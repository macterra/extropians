The TV show had some good stuff but it had a lot of crap too, the best
Python was their movies not the TV show. The best of the best was
"Life of Brian", possibly the most blasphemous movie ever made.
First rate!

Does anyone ever read how personally vicious and hateful Voltaire was?  Is 
this an ideological need to turn a blind eye to such bigots? Is religion the 
enemy of rationalism and science; or merely the enemy of atheism?

Monty python is hilariously funny - it's reciting MP that definitely is not.
I'm still hoping that eventually people at games cons will discover that

My historical view of the matter is that ecclesiastics,
being rather indolent as a whole, are not much
interested in exerting themselves to attack belief
systems per se ("science" and "rationalism" are
belief systems among other things) or even
atheists who keep a low profile.

Their real enemy, because it threatens their job
security, is DISBELIEF.  After all, the Church had
no problem at all with Copernicus continuing his
work -- many clerics thought he was probably
right -- but if he published anything he was told
to express his views in terms of exploring astro-
nomical matters in the scholastic manner, arrived
at as an exercise in pure reason. They were quite
candid about their motivation -- a heliocentric
theory that was presented as "True" would no
doubt "threaten the faith of the innocent".

The current flap over the "origin of man" would
not have emerged at all, even among fundamen-
talist Christians, were it not perceived as a
deliberate attack on their belief system.  Who
among them have the slightest interest in reading
Darwin or Genesis?  Their leaders are functioning
as agitators -- it's a time-tested way of increas-
ing their hold on their flocks. They have identi-
fied the more militant evolutionists as the typical
external enemy who induces group cohesion and 
the importance of submission to leadership.

What I'm emphasizing here is that the Great
Debate is not about the "Origin and Descent
of the Species" -- it's about power and control.
And the struggle is far from unilateral.

This article claims that research conducted at 
the University of Washington provides "proof" 
that mobile phones cause long-term memory loss:

http://www.sundaymirror.co.uk/stories/F3110932.html 

If true, since long-term memory is believed 
to involve actual physical changes in neuronal 
structure (unlike short-term memory), this may
suggest that mobile-phone radiation may cause
actual brain damage, as in neuronal death.
But that is not absolutely indicated.

I did a search at the National Library of 
Medicine using several key-word parameters 
and "phones memory" found one study:

Accid Anal Prev 1999 Nov;31(6):617-23 
Cognitive load and detection thresholds in car 
following situations: safety implications for 
using mobile (cellular) telephones while driving.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/htbin-post/Entrez/query?uid=10487336&form=6&db=m
&Dopt=b

which is only about how car phones increase the 
rate of accidents due to taking up too much of
one's attention span, not as a result of any 
brain impairments. I sent an email to the doctor
cited in the Mirror article asking for more info.
The Mirror article cites other studies, but I did 
not find them at the NLM using some key key words.

Interesting. I think your source was in error, REM becomes more
prevalent in the late night, not in the early part. So you likely
reduced the amount of REM you got rather than increased it.

As for myself, I think the most dangerous drug (or mindstate
alteration) ever would be something that mimicks the 
relaxed-sleepy-weakness-pleasure of just going to sleep or briefly
awakening and knowing you can sleep for the whole morning. It would be
more addictive than heroin (although I suspect the opiate and
cannabinoid receptors are already involved).

I show this movie every semester to my Philosophy of Religion class.
Somehow I don't think most of them appreciate it as much as I do. This
semester, since The Life of Brian wasn't available, I showed them The Name
of the Rose instead -- utterly different, but a good presentation of the
conflict between Aristotelian/rationalist and Augustian/irrationalist
strands in Christianity.

"LISTEN TO ME! I AM *NOT* THE MESSIAH! *HONESTLY*!"

<pause>

"Only the true Messiah would deny that he is the Messiah! All praise the
Messiah!"

Max

P.S:: "*How* shall we fuck off, O Lord?"

P.P.S.: Brian: "Don't let me tell you what to believe; don't let *anyone*
tell you what to believe. You are all different."

Crowd intones: "We are all different."

Lone voice: "I'm not."

(If you haven't seen this movie, your life is incomplete!)

Actually, I don't think so. First, the brain uses a lot of the body's
energy all the time, and while memory encoding seems to increase the
metabolism (support: PET imaging of people in memory tasks and that
higher levels of oxygen, glucose or ALC increases memory encoding
success) it doesn't seem *that* expensive (maybe I'm wrong, maybe we
sleep because otherwise memory consolidation all at once would cook
our brains :-). Second, we seem to do some memory encoding even when
we are awake (I can remember the bus trip to my office this morning,
and I haven't slept in between).

Mayhaps. It is rather hard to run a neural network while it is also
doing unsupervised learning, it can easily get caught in an attractor
and learn it to the exclusion of everything. So I think it makes sense
to turn off a lot of functions (especially motor activity) during
sleep.

Which studies do you refer to? Some of the old REM deprivation studies
have been questioned due to problems with set and setting, as well as
the deprivation methods. Of course, going without REM is almost
certainly bad for you anyway. There are some elegant rat studies (with
control rats awakened exactly as often as the REM deprived ones) that
show that selective REM deprivation is indeed quite nasty over the
long term.

Yes. Many models of memory consolidation doesn't hinge on it being
done in the sleep - it could be done when daydreaming, idling or just
doing something which we don't think of. The people fond of
correlating the theta rhythm in hippocampus with memory (I'm not :-)
point out that it is present during some situations rather than
others, which might suggest that we have two "modes".

I'd have to agree with John that the MP movies were better than the
TV show.  While I liked "Life of Brian", I'd have to cast my vote
for "The Search for the Holy Grail".  The scene where King Arthur
cuts off the Black Knight's arm and the Black Knight refuses to let him
pass -- Oh that, thats nothin but a scratch, I still got me oder arm --
sends me over the edge.  The killer rabbit comes in a close second.

I'd side with Max that "The Name of the Rose" is a great movie.  They
should show it to all Catholics the year they receive confirmation.
[I'd actually go for communion, but its a bit gory for 7-8 year olds.]

Does anyone have dreams remembered where they are not themselves?  In all
dreams that I recall, I am myself.  If we have dreams where we are someone
else, are they separated?

Recent dream tokens are aborigine, red truck.  Favorites include mountain
and flight.  Levitation is interesting.

Come sleep, oh sleep
wistful knot of peace
embalmer of woe
poor man's wealth
prisoner's release
indifferent judge between high and low
(paraphrase)

Makes me think of pseudo-science.  Dream interpretation and all that.

Anders -- I'm not sure if you have caught up with my posts on the
sleep thread yet, esp. vis-a-vis possible architectures & processing
procedures.  But given your comments on not being able to train and
run neural networks at the same time, I thought I'd offer a comment
and pose some questions.

There would seem to be several requirements here:
 (a) Processing of sensory input and presumably storing the
     relevant stuff it in a short term pattern buffer (because
     there simply isn't enough time to activate gene expression,
     biochemical pathways, transport of receptor molecules and
     neurotransmitters, etc. -- I.e. processes that take minutes
     to hours).
     [In computer architectures, this is a "short-term" cached input-buffer.]
 (b) Some application of that short term "eletrical" pattern into
     a chemico-physico structure (i.e. long term memory)
     [In CA, this is writing the data to disk or tape].
 (c) Some logical resolution of conflicts in the data.  If someone
     tells you garbage and you know it is garbage you immediately
     reject it.  But there may be data or complex experiences that
     can't be immediately accepted or rejected (but you don't have
     the processing capacity to do that immediately).  Examples that
     come to mind (of the immediate accept/reject type) would be
     noting spelling when reading or mis-spoken words when listening.
     Examples (of the delayed accept/reject) could include complex
     scientific or philosophical arguments.  Now, some of the logical
     accept/reject may be conscious, but some of it may be unconscious
     as well.
     [In CA, an example of this that comes to mind is the 4 computers on
      the Space Shuttle that use majority & confirmation "logic" --
      2 of 3 identical computers must agree and 1 different computer
      confirms the result.]
 (d) Perhaps rehersal of conclusions to strenghen the results & connections.

Do you see any problem with sleeping & dreaming being the primary
processes that allow (c) and (d) to function in the process of
transfering data from (a) to (b)?

Unfortunately as we are "initialized", we accept data in (c) all too
unconsciously with few "reality checks".  This is probably required for
rapid learning in babies.  It also contributes to our difficulties in
"unwiring" the early stuff like religious beliefs.  

It is interesting to consider that the sleep requirements decline
significantly in older healthy adults.  Now there could be many
reasons for this but one would expect that they have well honed
survival skills and have sufficiently developed their accept/reject
pathways that most of the data gets processed very quickly.
One possible way of testing this would be to see if sleep requirements
increase in individuals who have traveled to a "strange" place.
It might be difficult to account however for decreases in sleep
that might be caused by a higher arousal/alertness state due to
potential dangers perceived from the environmental differences.

As I child I always used to try to fly in my dreams.  All it took was
running across my yard and flapping my arms.  I'm not sure if I
ever got off the ground and had a "bird's eye view", I think I
generally woke up.  There is that tricky problem your brain
must have in a dream where you are rolling along fine and the
next thing it has to do is provide an image of you looking down
at the top of your house -- oppps, the recall mental image
processor comes up empty -- time for a scene shift.

Of course as you get older and you have reality checks in place,
you probably gain a censorship process so you never even imagine
what it is like to fly.

Too bad as adults, we lose the dreams of childhood.

Hi!

Here is my top 5 in no particular order:

Monthy Python
The Black Adder
The Fast Show
Not the 9 O'Clock News
Allo Allo!

Some of you might not know these shows because they're all British comedies
(British make the best comedies, no doubt about it) and some never aired on
the US.

Bye.

I have had plenty of dreams where I was not myself. I have been
everything from disembodied observers over interstellar economies to a
Axiomatically Invincible Hero to the god Odin.

(The Axiomatically Invincible Hero might need an explanation. In one
dream I encountered a box containing something awful breaking out,
just like the start of Jurassic Park. But this beast was an Axiomatic
Beast, which meant that it would - by definition - devour any victim
it pursued. I only had moments to prepare - so I redefined myself as
axiomatically impossible to defeat. Since the Beast couldn't eat me
without causing a paradox, it escaped into other parts of my dream...)

While a lot of dream interpretation is junk, dreams are after all
information about our minds. I would say that our dream "landscapes"
say a bit about what kind of people we are, what is going on and what
worldviews we inhabit.

Yes... my internal world seems to be quite unusual :-)

As far as I know they are assymetric like other mammals. I don't have
any info on brain lateralisation, but it might be known in the
comparative neurophysiological literature. I seem to recall that
monkeys have lateralisation, and it is not unreasonable to expect in
"high level" areas that are not strictly connected to a symmetric
outside world (lateralisation is to some extent a kind of symmetry
breaking in the brain which saves space).

It was pretty cool, several times that I remember, in a localized time period
over a couple weeks.  That is, flight dreams.  It was themed with skiing.  The
context was above the tree line.  A friend's presence was near, we didn't
communicate.  It wasn't anywhere I had been physically.  So the dream context
started with flight, it was a neat sensation.  I flew past a couple skiers.
Anyways, the series of flight dreams were initalized by sliding, slippery slope
type phenomenon, then initial flight.  When first starting, there are some
other presences, they are there to reassure you to some extent, if only by
their presence, they are presences in the same context that you are, in a
way.   There is a sense of freedom which is very itself.  After some initial
confusion, it's pretty cool.  So that is my story about some dreams.

Some people keep dream journals, I think that's a pleasant idea, although do
not or ever.

I often have dreams with a sexual context, mostly about women I have been with,
one or two or three unknowns, mostly separately.  Almost all dreams with these
women have sexual content.

I find dreaming very pleasant.  I am trying to recall unpleasant or unsettling
dreams, the only ones that come to mind are danger to family.

Back to pseudo-science, dreams would be interrelated with any other companion
of man, like astrology, psychology.  Some might assign extra-sensory attributes
in this category.

In terms of hard science and dreams, I guess there is REM sleep described by
physical eye motor decalibration and brain wave cycles.  I read somewhere that
sleep is best partaken in 4 hour intervals, although to each his own.

Have a nice day,

Ross F.

Maybe.  The same mentality that sends thousands of men to
their deaths is responsible for this new style of warfare.
The capacity for bloody, brutal warfare still exists; foot
soldiers may be obsolete but the mentality that sent them to
the killing field still exists.

Fascinating. So instead of living in an universe filled with sleeping
super-cats we might be living in an universe filled with super-cave
fishes...

Makes the behavior of the Transmuters in Egan's _Diaspora_ seem quite
rational. Maybe he was onto something?

If Dyson is right about the universe being maximally
interesting/complex, then it seems likely that the SIs would be up and
running with long-term memories. If the complexity of the universe is
too small, then being memoryless or asleep makes sense (however, SIs
have autoevolved from natural entities or been created by them, so
they might have residual fears of removing aversions against Eternal
Return and similar stuff). If the universe is too complex to be dealt
with (like living in a type III cellular automaton with gaslike chaos)
intelligence beyond a certain point doesn't help you any further, and
there would be an upper bound of necessary intelligence - resources
would better be spent on safety, backups and "entertainment".

To me it doesn't matter, since I prefer to measure time in
thought. Not much time passes when I'm asleep, but a lot when I'm
meeting fellow transhumanists. So from my perspective the available
time above is constant, and the distribution of it in physical time is
a matter of aesthetics (and some practical problems). Most likely I
would like to do it slowly so I could see what happens.

Not the eternal, even, just the Indefinite, that is where all beauty

next! And in the meantime, isn't it something, all of it?"

Yes. There are likely several levels of buffering, from perceptual
memory (visual scratchpad, auditory loop; lasts a few seconds at
most), working memory (tens of seconds) to short term memory
(hours). And maybe "intermediate term memory" linked to the
hippocampus.

Yes. Most likely the "writing" for long term memory is synaptic
rewiring. This requires gene expression and a lot of steps, so it
takes time to achieve.

>  (c) Some logical resolution of conflicts in the data.  

Much of this is likely done when patterns fail to evoke or get into
conflicts with other attractor states. During lunch our research
groups speculated in the existence of "collators", the opposite of
modulators, systems which gather overall information about the state
of our cognition and sends it to relevant systems. One example we
discussed was just conflict/contradiction detection, another recognition. 

Relevance signals are also worth mentioning. Some memories should be
stored, others best ignored. Emotional valence, coherence and links to
other memories likely play in. This area is likely where most
nootropics play in, although some like ampakines influence (a) and
piracetam likely (b).

Not really, although I think there is more to the issue. The theory of
memory consolidation I'm working on is based on the ideas of James
L. McClelland and Nigel H. Goddard, who suggested that we need the
intermediate buffer system to prevent overwriting of our cortical
memories. Having fast learning means that you easily overwrite
important information, but you need it to survive in the real
world. So it is stored in the hippocampus and then used to slowly
train the cortex when there is the time. This is of course also ideal
for (c) and (d).

I would rather blame age-influenced decrease in melatonin
receptors. But I think your explanation is partially true, and might
also relate to "the conservativism of old age" (which I also think is
partially due to a dopamine deficiency... OK, I'm getting
neurochauvinistic here :-)

I think this is true, both from personal experience (I sleep very
soundly abroad or after doing something unusual during the day), and
from some studies I heard about REM in chess players before, during
and after a competition.

This can likely be factored out in a good test design.

              Mars Polar Lander Mission Status
                     October 30, 1999
  
     NASA's Mars Polar Lander spacecraft successfully fired its 
thrusters for 12 seconds this morning to fine-tune its flight 
path for arrival at the Martian south pole on December 3.  

     Flight controllers said the spacecraft performed as planned 
and that preliminary data show the desired trajectory change was 
achieved. The thruster firing began at 10:28 a.m. Pacific 
Daylight Time.  Previous thruster firings were accomplished on 
January 21, March 15, and September 1.  The next thruster firing 
is scheduled for November 30.
  
     The landing site is located at 76 degrees south latitude 
and 195 degrees west longitude, near the northern edge of the 
layered terrain in the vicinity of the Martian south pole.  The 
lander is now about 14.3 million kilometers (about 8.9 million 
miles) from Mars, traveling at a speed of 4.8 kilometers per 
second (about 10,700 miles per hour) relative to Mars.  The 
spacecraft is about 228 million kilometers (about 142 million 
miles) from Earth, and has traveled along an arcing flight path 
of about 690 million kilometers (about 429 million miles) 
through space since launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on 
January 3, 1999. 

     For more information on the mission, see 
http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/marsnews/ .
  
     Mars Polar Lander is managed for NASA's Office of Space 
Science by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  JPL is a division of

That just goes to show what too much Role-Playing will do to
your head... :-)  I'm apparently grouned enough that I don't
recall having been someone else in my dreams.

True, they say you really have mastered a foreign language when you
start dreaming in the language.

So Anders, do you dream in Swedish, British or ancient Norse?

Lucid dreaming, where one has visceral control over the dream, is interesting.
I think it's possible to train to control at least waking dreams, ie those that
occur when the alarm goes off, etcetera.  I find that all the dreams I remember
are in the context where I realize that I am dreaming.  That is, if there is any
memory of the dream, then it is associated with awareness of it being a dream.
I generally don't exert control over dreams, but feel comfortable in
dissassociating myself from the dream state and observing it when my clinical
side takes over.

You mention invincibility, most of my dreams I might as well as have had a
bottle of tequila.  I have had numerous dreams about combat or with martial
context.  This is in the same context as sports arena.

I think it is not so unusual.  You sound powerful in your dreams.  I have some
dreams that have wormholes with disembodied talking heads that chant like
Tibetan monks, although it's been some time.  They are out there.

Existentialism, Castaneda.

Dreams often have an extrapolatory ability not present to the conscious, ie, an
opening of the floodgates of the subconscious.  Some people note prescient
dreams, or in general, deja vu, I often see this is a rational extension of the
parallel nature of the brain, which might predict events before they occur,
unconsciously.  I haven't had any good deja vus in several weeks, but am not
concerned.

Have a nice day,

According to today's New York Times several important advances will be announced
in the scientific journals in the next few weeks. A long time ago, way back in July,
a molecular switch was made for the first time, however it had limited usefulness
because it could only switch once. In about 2 weeks a Yale chemist, Mark Reed,
will publish an article in Science describing a molecular switch that can be turned on
and off indefinitely . Of course you'd still have to wire all those switches together
to make a computer, but in a separate development Hewlett Packard found a
easy way to make a grid of conductive lines 10 atoms wide and 50 atoms apart.
Reed must be a busy man, he also said he will make an announcement on
December 6 at the International Electron Device conference in Washington about
using his molecular switches for RAM memory, he won't release details about
his memory device until then.

The NYT quotes a bunch of experts about the very recent developments,
they said some interesting stuff:

"We're on the scent, and we know the fox is out there."

"It feels like we're a year before the invention of the transistor."

"In two to five years you will begin to see functioning circuits which
 are of recognizable utility."

"If you can make computers as easily as photographic film a
 lot of companies are going to be wondering what they're doing
 with their 15 billion dollar fabrication plants".

One remark would certainly catch Eliezer's eye, Reed said:

"This should scare the pants off anyone working in silicon.
 It will be dirt cheap and it will create a discontinuity."

Well I could argue that what is left of the Iraqi infantry would

As Sadaam has shown.  Of course you might argue that failure
to exercise "rational judgement" on the part of the soldiers
creates the possibility of their leaders turning them into
tank and plane targets.  Perhaps it is just natural selection
at work.

ummmmm.....actually I DO beleive it.

I don't like it.  But the evidence is overwhelming.  Some examples are the
Clinton Impeachment, The Waco Coverup, The OJ Simpson Trial.  I'm sure those
more familiar with current events could go on and on.

You have to factor in lifestyle & economic situation.  "Most" people
hate their job and wouldn't want to work for 500 years.  But if you
point out that if they invest a few dollars a year, by the time they
are 100 or so they can retire and never work again then they see things
differently.

There is also the fact that most people are pretty bored (all you
have to do is look at sensationalist TV to know that).  I suspect
these shows are watched primarily by people with IQs in the lower
half of the distribution.  So now you have to bump these people
up to around 120 or 130 where they have the ability to go create
an interesting life for themselves.

So the only way to ask the question would be:
   Would you like to live 500 years as an independently wealthy,
   gifted, healthy individual?

Asked that way, the answer is yes more often.  Fortunately we
will have the technologies to do this.

Getting back to the start of this thread (Xiaoguang Li's proposal),
I'd offer a couple of comments.

Vinge's singlularity is not a singularity in the true black hole
sense.  There are clearly limits on the matter, energy and perhaps
volume of the universe.  More importantly there are limits on how
effectively you can utilize these resources.  So the curve
may be exponential but it doesn't go to infinity.  In "reality"
it eventually levels out.  I suspect it goes through 4 stages
- The energy-limited expansion (The historic past until you have
  all of the power possible from the sun -- theoretically within
  days of having full nanoassembly capacity).
- The matter-gravity-well limited expansion (after you get all a star's
  energy until you have finished restructuring all the material in
  your solar system -- limited by the size of the gravity wells
  in which material is located).
- The speed-of-light-foresight limited expansion (look in your
  local region for uncolonized spaces and colonize them; look
  in those local regions and colonize them, etc.  It makes no
  sense to colonize distant regions because they may be colonized
  by the time you get there.  It also assumes there is some reason
  for colonization).
- The intergalactic-distances limited expansion (these distances
  are so large and the foresight time required so great that you
  only do this very slowly, if at all.  It may simply be easier
  to wait for intelligence to evolve on its own).

Separately, there is a bandwidth-energy cost limitation for the
rate at which you can expand knowledge "collectively" depending on
the inter-entity distance and the energy cost for communicating
across that distance.

Then you are back to the energy limits when you have to switch
over from burning light materials to dropping iron into black
holes for energy.  Of course you can switch over to this sooner
if you are a "think fast, die soon" fan.

Whether we end up as AIs or IAs its the limits above that both
will be facing.  The singularity is a self-perceived rate of
change problem.  In reality, literally, it can't happen.  What
you get is punctuated evolution.

The sci.astro.seti newsgroup has been created, although I have some
fear that it will attract the same rec. and comp. material as 
alt.sci.seti.  alt.sci.seti still has more on topic SETI material
than this list, even though it is only 2 or 3%.

This is the charter from the first Call for Votes (the creation control
message didn't make it to the office because the office ISP has a 50% loss
rate on their news feed) - note that USENET voting rules meant it was
not possible report the CFV to this list before the end of the voting:

RATIONALE: sci.astro.seti

The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) is the scientific
discipline of searching for electromagnetic evidence of
extraterrestrial civilizations.  SETI has received a lot of attention
recently due to the SETI@home project.  The SETI@home project has
shown that at least several hundred thousand individuals are willing
to dedicate computer resources to the search for alien radio signals.
This has brought an increase in the amount of discussion of SETI and
the possibilities of extra-terrestrial intelligence (ETI).  Which has
increased the number of posts about SETI in related newsgroups
(sci.astro, etc.) by a large amount.

The SETI@home project is a distributed computing project which
harnesses the computing power of hundreds of thousands of Internet
connected computers to search for radio evidence of extraterrestrial
civilizations.  It is the newest and most public SETI project to date.
Currently it has attracted almost a million people willing to donate
computer time to this search.  However, SETI@home is not the only SETI
project, nor will it be the last new one.  Several SETI projects are
on the drawing board (1HT, etc.) and many of them will require as much
or more computing power as the SETI@home project uses currently.  It
would be surprising if none of these new SETI programs use the
distributed computing model that has allowed SETI@home to harness
computing power equivalent to multi-million dollar super-computers for
very low costs.

This newsgroup will serve as a forum for discussion of SETI in
general, and any SETI projects in specific.  This includes discussion
of SETI@home, both it's scientific aspects, as well as the use,
configuration, and troubleshooting of the SETI@home client software
and any similar software by future SETI projects.  Additionally, it
will serve as a place to discuss the technical specifics of all
current and future SETI projects, and as a place for teachers who are
developing curricula around SETI projects (such as SETI@home).

CHARTER: sci.astro.seti

This group will be unmoderated and distributed worldwide.  This
newsgroup is intended for the discussion of the Search for
Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence.

Appropriate topics for discussion include the following:

1) Discussion of SETI projects (such as SERINDIP, Phoenix,
   SETI@home, BETA, ARGUS, etc.)
2) Installation and configuration of the SETI@home client
   or other SETI projects using distributed computing.
3) Trouble shooting the use of the SETI client programs.
4) The possibilities of Alien life (Drake equation, planetary
   abundance and its relavance to SETI, etc.)
5) Discussion of statistical results for SETI projects.
6) The potential content of alien messages and how to decode
   them, as well as any messages we (humans) have / will /
   could send into space that are intended for ETI's (such as
   the Voyager record, the Arecibo message to M13, the Encounter
   2001 project, etc.)
7) Potential alien technology in the context of detection /
   communication by / with humans (using visible light lasers
   instead of radio, for example).
8) Discussion of school curricula built around a SETI
   program

Inappropriate posts include:

1) Commercial advertisements of any kind, including those for
   items related to SETI or any SETI project.
2) Binaries, with the exception of cryptographic signatures.
3) Discussions concerning UFOs, "alien abductions", etc,
   which should take place in other groups.

END CHARTER.

It is?  I disagree heartily though I think terrain has alot to do with it.  
Like they say in the Pentagon, "we do deserts, not jungles!"  American 
mechanized might cannot be matched where we are allowed by terrain to deploy 
it.  The ancient Egyptian pharoahs might agree considering their 
charioteers.

What I did like about the cold war and all the nuclear tipped ICBM's aimed 
at major cities was that the leaders of the nations involved knew they would 
be targets also!  Even if they escaped to a bunker their world would never 
be the same and so they thought twice about things.  It is much easier to to 
send off hundreds of thousands of young men to die and be maimed when you 
yourself as a leader will never be in harms way.


Sincerely,

John Grigg

Well said, however not everyone who believes in God, or at least, hopes to 
believe in God need be numbered amongst the Christian Fundamentalists. Why 
some of us are even hated by them, who bury their hatred under the veneer of 
"love".  I believe that evolutionary adaptation is the stongest body of 
evidence that there is (along with the notion that the earth isn't flat).  I 
also wonder about the hypothesis of emergence, and wonder how that works. I 
also believe in God, though I am not sure why, nor do I have an answer for 
evil, in this regard.

I am aware of the hunger for power that many religious leaders have (I am 
currently readling Hitler's Pope by John Cornwell) and am not naive in this 
regard.  However, neither am I unaware of the mentality of some of the 
atheists, who curiously, seem to wish to proselytize their belief, and do 
based on the notions that all religions are identical to fundamentalist 
Christianity-it isn't so.

I have a friend who dreams about his everyday life... I pity him :-)

But yes, my roleplaying has influenced my dreams a lot. Not to mention
the Internet, I often email in my dreams, build websites or gather
information. Too bad it is all fictional.

Mostly Swedish and British, I'm not sure which is the most common
right now (I wouldn't be surprised if it was British). My ancient
Norse is a bit rusty, but I seem to recall a few German dreams. As
well as a lot of dreams in C, Smalltalk, Java, Scheme and other
programming languages...

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

With regard to the recent proposals that E.T. may be on the net, I offer
http://www.sightings.com/ufo5/seti.htm, an article from a UFO site asking
why SETI supporters are so dogmatically resisting the evidence that UFOs
are real and are extraterrestrial craft.  Rather than surfing the net,
we should keep watching the skies, by this view:

   A full house turned out Tuesday night in Cocoa to catch the SETI
   show at Brevard Community College's Fine Arts Auditorium. Leading
   the sermon was Dr. Seth Shostak, a brilliant wit at the privately
   funded SETI Institute of Mountain View, Calif.... Audience members
   were told how they, too, could assist the radio hunt by downloading
   and crunching signals with the so-called SETI@Home program.

   The doors slammed when several listeners advanced the UFO heresies,
   wondering if maybe those alien life forms hadn't already arrived. One
   woman rattled off a list of related Web sites, prompting Shostak to
   charge, "None of those sources you've mentioned are credible."
   [...]
   Pressed further by another listener who asked why UFO researchers
   and SETI guys couldn't reason through this thing, Shostak replied,
   "Scientists don't object to a dialogue; it just doesn't go anywhere."

   Speaking for all scientists, naturally. But not a nine-member
   Stanford University panel led by physicist Peter Sturrock who, after
   examining the available evidence in 1998, advocated a rigorous public
   investigation. Good luck.

This is the problem with fringe science.  You can always find someone who
has some modest credibility who will support the topic, at least with
the idea of investigating it further (which would involve funding the
researcher, of course).  Once you open up the possibility that ETs may
be here on earth, monitoring us, of course you have to deal with UFOs.
Furthermore, because it is overwhelmingly likely that they would have
been here for millions of years, you have to look at all the ancient
artifacts, the "chariots of the gods", the possibility of meddling in
the human genome, the stories of the Bible, all as possible confirmation
of ET activity on earth.

Maybe religion is true: maybe we are the creation of god-like beings.
If ETs have been here throughout our evolutionary development, isn't
it a significant probablity?  Maybe Jesus was an extraterrestrial.
He could have been, couldn't he?  Water into wine and raising the
(recently) dead shouldn't be too difficult for nanotech equipped aliens.

I don't see how you avoid this slippery slope once you assent to the
view that ETs are among us.  Is there anyone here who denies the truth
of biblical miracles yet maintains that there is a real probability that
extraterrestrial intelligences are monitoring us right here and now?
How can you reconcile these views?

Hal

I don't know if any of you have ever read the Vertigo comic
Transmetropolitan (and if you haven't, do so. It combines transhuman
ideas/technology with human level stories about corruption and politics.
Its protagonist is a futuristic Hunter S. Thompson), but the breatharian
idea appears there. I thought it was a riff on religion, since its first
appearance was in a rant-on-religion story, but to find out that not only
is it real, but that people try to follow it tells me how far humanity has
to go. It sounds stupid in a comic book, I can't imagine what kind of mind
would accept it in real life. If any of us are going to make it to
trans/post humanity, some of us are going to have to be left behind. Cruel
sounding, but that's life.

It has done wonders both good and bad.  Now we of the eurocentric view are 
going to get a taste of our own medicine as China and the rest of the world 
eventually gain ascendancy.  In time white eurocentric males will be museum 
pieces or kept in zoos.

Considering the sheer oddness of the Fermi Paradox, I'd say that any
theory with a self-consistent, cognitively plausible, and
evidence-consistent account of how the aliens *are* here deserves
serious consideration.  And I should think that most believers in the
Judeo-Christian tradition would regard the suggestion that *any* miracle
was produced by mortal-level aliens as being blasphemy.

This is like attacking quantum physics on the grounds that one or two
New Agers have tried to use it to rationalize Buddhism.

If I can rewrite the entire planet on the molecular level, I can deal
with human stupidity as well.  Nobody *has* to be left behind.  The only
real question is whether ethics requires that everyone be given the
*option* of staying behind.

[snip -- long quote from the above URL]

In short because the views simply are not consistent with the known
laws of physics.  Once you invoke "magic physics" you are in the
realm of "faith" and not "science".

Knowing the "potential" technological capacities that nanotechnology
allows (dismantling planets in days), one has to make arguments as to
why "they" haven't done that.  I would guess that there are few people
who are associated with the UFO "movement" who are versed in this knowledge.
What UFO people have to do to make things acceptable is to present
coherent explanations for:
 (a) Why would they bother to come here when they can do most of their
     observations from their home at a much lower energy cost?
 (b) Why are "aliens" are wandering around abducting people?
 (c) Why do the abduction reports have"aliens" with a humanoid body
     when it is a horrible body structure?
 (d) If they do come here, Why don't they communicate with us when they
     obviously could do so?

Believing in gravity is easy because it operates on everyone.
Believing in UFOs is a much harder sell because it happens to a select
few.  The SETI people have a credible position because they do
not require magic physics and do not require the expenditure
of resources required to hurl spacecraft across interstellar
distances.  They have a nice equation that incorporates the
probabilities of finding someone.  The UFO believers, to my knowledge,
have not developed a credible framework in which reasonable arguments
can be made that would allow the position to be believable.
They need a "Probability of ET Visitations" equation.
Instead, it is much easier to simply say "believe me".

No you don't.  If you assume that civilizations capable of interstellar
travel are 50+ years beyond our level, then you *must* assume (a) they
are fully nanotechnology capable or (b) nanotechnology is impossible.
[And (b) flies in the face of the available evidence.]

If you assume (a) then the *only* discussion that can occur is:
What are the characteristics of civilizations operating a the limits
of known physics and what can be constructed on relatively short
stellar time scales (say millions of years)?  The answers to that
question must match those ideas with current observations of the
universe and provide a coherent picture.  To my knowledge none
of the UFO/Aliens supporters have attempted this.

Yep, the analysis isn't difficult.
  (a) Is the artifact constructed using molecular nanotechnology?
      If no, then its not alien.
  (b) Does the genome show evidence of tampering?
      Not enough is known to answer the question, but there is so
      much junk DNA in it, that if they did play with it the did
      a really poor job of it or wanted to remain "unrecognized".
  (c) Stories of the Bible could be true, the flood apparently has
      a historical basis as do many of the historical accounts in
      the Old Testament.  But because it is an largely unconfirmed
      "history" with an "agenda" it can't be used as "scientific"
      evidence.  You can't subject it to repeated "experiments".

I've mentioned in previous posts (from a humorous perspective)
the possibility of agents of alien superintelligences deflecting
a comet to eliminate the dinosaurs so that H. sapiens (as something
more interesting) could arise.  Entirely possible, however very
very difficult to prove.

Absolutely possible.  We could be an experiment.  But I want to
see evidence for those god-like beings before I spend time seriously
considering it.

Yep, I've considered it.  Once you allow nanotechnology and the possibility
of billions of SuperIntelligences in the galaxy you have to re-examine a
lot of "miracles" in history.

What you need is:
  (a) A Scientific case that the miracles don't violate the laws of physics.
  (b) Reasonable scientific evidence the miracle *actually* occured.
  (c) A plausible explanation for the motivation of the miracle.

Getting (b) is very difficult, but the evidence for the "flood"
shows that it isn't completely impossible.  (c) Gets really
difficult, fundamentally you have to answer the question of
why a superintelligence would bother with us.  Experimentation
on the scale of planets/civilizations is one I've offered.
But if you designed and setup the experiement in which we
are the "molecules", then you don't have to send in UFOs
to abduct people unless thats part of the experimental design.

Perhaps its an experiment in the willingness of creatures of our
limited capacities to believe things on the basis of hearsay
evidence. :-)

> How can you reconcile these views?

You don't have to reconcile them.  If you are scientific about it
and they don't violate known laws of physics, you keep an open
mind about them and explore the possibilities.  However, if you
want to do good science, you presumably fund efforts on the
basis the probability that something is true (or will be discovered)
based on our current (limited) knowledge base.  You fund infrared surveys
on the bases of the scientific return we know they will provide,
not the hypothesis that intgelligence might actually be easy
and the population of the galaxy is dominated by superintelligences.

I will keep an open mind to UFOs and Alien abductions but I'm not
going to "believe" in them until *I* see one or *I'm* abducted.
And then I hope some of the other good people on the list will
try to convince me that I've been dreaming or hallucinating.

Who cares what the religious think?

I want to know what you and other Extropians think.  Is it plausible
that Jesus was an alien?  How likely would you view that to be?

Do you look at other religious miracles in the same way - judging whether
they would be doable with technology that we can foresee, and if so,
that they might well have represented ET activity?

How about today?  If you were an ET here, and compassionate, but
determined to allow the civilization to develop roughly on its natural
course, mightn't you still want to help those around you in a small way?
Nothing that would be noticed or attract attention, but maybe a little
healing now and then, a touch of magic when needed?  Do you think it
likely that such beings exist and are active in our world?

Actually these all have some level of reality/danger depending on
when they would occur or the average threat to individuals.  If
I were to order them, I would say:

Asbestos > Ozone depletion > Global Warming > Nuclear Winter >
  Population Explosion > Homeless.

Comments:
  Asbestos: Very bad (over time) if exposed
  Ozone: Direct effects observed in animals and perhaps humans
  Global Warming: Ask someone living in North Carolina...
  Nuclear Winter: There are still lots of weapons out there.
  Population Explosion: Recently cut back from previous predictions by the UN
  Homeless: Not a significant impact on the average person.

What TV doesn't do unfortunately is provide much of a global
perspective.

Actually New Agers can come in so many forms and I see many individuals and 
groups being thrown in with them arbitrarily.  I could see some people 
saying the Extropian Institute is a "new age" group! lol

I would like to know what the problem is about social scientists??  What is 
wrong with psychologists and sociologists?  I have a sociology professor who 
went off on me when I called sociology a "soft" science!

I read with interest Greg Burch's post about coming across a new age 
newsletter packed with advertising.  We have a popular one up here in 
Alaska.  I do not know how much the two relate but ours does some some 
redeeming value with usually one or two articles at least about human 
relationships or nutrition that are beneficial.  A person must be careful 
because there is plenty of snake oil being advertised also.

Another good example is the "Tools for Exploration" catalog which is full of 
"peak performance" products such as brain machines, biofeedback devices, 
nutritional supplements and anything else you could imagine.  Some of it is 
classic snake oil but there is much there in my view that could be good and 
in fact is the sort of thing Anders might recommend in his vast Transhuman 
site.

As for physicists and evangelicals uniting it just might happen for perhaps 
brief periods.  I don't see evangelicals and extropians uniting on anything 
soon.  In fact I expect Hal Lindsey or Bob Larson to be writing a book 
denouncing transhumanism anytime!!  You will know you have arrived when that 
happens.  Moody press would lose half their revenue if they stopped 
publishing books against Mormons.
Extropianism could be their next cash cow.  Max More and the rest of you 
will make for great antagonists in their story.  I see Bob Larson 
interviewing Max and Natasha and acting horrified each time they make a 
statement.  Then he will sell it to his listeners for hundred dollar 
donations.  I will say to the man's credit he does help out alot of really 
messed up teens who have nowhere else to turn.


Sincerely,

John Grigg

There was a through treatment of this avenue of thinking written a few years ago by an attorney.  It is a book called: THE GODS OF EDEN.  His disturbing premise is that "they" have been here for at least millennia and we are merely "cattle" or should I say chattel to them and that they control us through wars and pestilence and religious superstition.
  He never explained exactly what use we are to "them" though.
In reference to your comment about religions, he contends that all major religions were created (even scripted somewhat) by the visitors.
I don't subscribe to this way of thinking, but I must admit I am reminded of this book every time one of our Mars probes blinks off or behaves incorrectly. (and there have been how many now?) :-)
I'm keeping an open mind on the question of whether "they" are here.  I try to follow the hoaxes, evidence, coverups, etc.  Obviously the ramifications of somekind of truth in any of this would be massive, and perhaps I follow it to ameliorate the possible shock of some future revelation.  
I think it is unfortunate that those most qualified to study these subjects risk committing academic suicide by investigating these fringe areas.  There seems to be an artifical schism between "approved" research and "beyond-the-pale" research, and I wonder if anyone's interests are served by this.

Its been years since I've been on the receiving end of a Usenet

The problem is that Deja is slow (and who wants the ads).
I'd prefer a standard news feed but my ISP (being a big
bureacratic telcom company) doesn't seem to have the newsgroup,
might not grant me access to their news server and will be
wonderfully slow (and probably ill-informed) in responding
to my queries on this topic.

The question is what to do?

Does anyone know of public/free NNTP servers that are relatively fast?
Is there a "source" NNTP server for the SETI newsgroup(s)?

I've got rn, bnews & cnews & nntp but they are 5+ years old.
I can use got Netscape Messenger as a client anything better?
What is "state-of-the-art" now-a-days?

Also, if it is of use to people, I could arrange to setup
a free relay news server on "extropian" topics.  It would
be nice to accumulate a list of Usenet topics of interest
to extropians & transhumanists and archive them in a single
place.  My ISP for example carried sci.nanotech but didn't
seem to have sci.longevity and had no messages in
bionet.molbio.ageing, so we may have to hunt around
for places that will serve up the various topics and
concentrate them in a single location.

Please copy either extropians@extropy.com or me directly with
any response.

I would imagine that your ISP (US West?) will carry this news group
since it is in the sci hierarchy, but it might take a few days for it
to appear, if it was just created today.  However if their coverage is
generally slow and spotty then you should complain.  I am sure they have
many subscribers who use newsgroups and your voice will join theirs.

Unfortunately, I do not, and I imagine that these characteristics are
somewhat contradictory.

I've just finished up a new song of mine. It's called "The Next 25 Years"
and that's what it is about -- I'm kind of having writer's block here with
coming up with a good title. If anyone has any better suggestions for a
title, let me know ;-)

It's not for everyone -- some may find it a little boring. It's a long
instrumental piece with a tribal feel too it. Lots of subtle building, and
heavy on repetition. I've written it to evoke the deep feeling I get when I
try and imagine the course our lives will take over the next 25 years. The
utter gut feeling that something amazing is happening to our species -- a
true transformation, with an actual impact on the course of the universe.

Hope y'all enjoy it!

--Aaron


P.S. While where on the topic of Music & the Next 25 years, lets throw out
some speculation on the trends we will see in music over the next 25 years.

This is the first I'd heard of a theory like this.  Has anybody else here
heard anything more?

-----------

A Scientific Heretic Delves Beneath the Surface

By Ken Ringle
Washington Post Staff Writer
Sunday , October 31, 1999 ; C1

Computers used to cost millions. Now they're being given away. The country
was rapidly going broke. Now we've got a $115 billion budget surplus. Butter
was bad for us. Now we're not so sure. We're being forced to reexamine all
our old assumptions on millennial eve, right?

So maybe we should finally pay attention to Thomas Gold. He says the world
has an endless supply of oil and gas.

Gold, a Vienna-born physicist, cosmologist and general scientific heavy
lifter, founded and for many years directed the Cornell Center for
Radiophysics and Space Research. In his 79 years he's authored more than 280
scholarly papers on subjects ranging from astronomy to zoology.

He's also a full-time heretic, periodically parachuting into some new
scientific field and infuriating academic plodders there with some
outlandishly bold new theory. More annoying, his theories usually turn out
to be right. Worst of all, he thinks the orthodox have so gummed up the
gates of knowledge that they were more open to breakthroughs 50 years ago.
Harvard biologist Stephen Jay Gould has labeled Gold "one of America's most
iconoclastic scientists." Says Gold himself: "In choosing a hypothesis there
is no virtue in being timid ... [but] I clearly would have been burned at
the stake in another age."

In 1947, fresh from pioneering wartime work on the development of radar, he
used his research into high-frequency receptors to publish an entire new
theory of mammalian hearing. Physiologists shrugged it off for 30 years.
Until auditory technology evolved enough to prove him correct.

In 1959, when everybody thought the surface of the moon was frozen lava,
Gold decided it was covered with dust from meteor impacts. Footprints of the
Apollo astronauts will testify eternally that he was was right about that,
too.

In 1967 astronomers trashed his suggestion that energy pulsating in the
distant universe was the signature of collapsing stars. The subsequent
observation of pulsars won two other scientists a Nobel Prize. And proved
Gold correct.

In 1992 he predicted that Martian meteorites might contain fossilized
microbes. Four years later NASA announced the same thing.

Now in a new book, "The Deep Hot Biosphere," Gold says the origin and bulk
of biological life is not on the surface of the Earth where the birds and
bunnies are, but deep within it. Moreover, that microscopic life force is
fueled by an inexhaustible supply of petroleum constantly migrating outward
from our planet's volcanic core.

Eight years ago, when Gold was still developing his theory, some geologists
were so incensed by it they petitioned to have the government remove all
mention of it from the nation's libraries.

"It was an effort at book-burning, pure and simple," Gold says, shuffling
around a computer-buzzing, paper-littered attic study as energetically
unkempt as he is. Most petroleum geologists, he says, "simply have no
concept of the laws of physics at work" beneath the Earth's crust.

People need to understand, he says, that the long-held assumption that oil
comes from the millennial composting of dinosaurs and ancient swamps has
always been dubious, whatever school science books may say. His theory of a
deep, hot biosphere doesn't just solve its contradictions, it sorts out in
the process such minor matters as the origin of all earthly life and its
relationship with the rest of the universe.

Is there any wonder it makes people nervous?

Way Outside the Box

What's unique about Thomas Gold, says astronomer Steve Maran of the American
Astronomical Society, is that unlike most scientists who are content to
"pursue the advancement of knowledge in small, incremental steps," Gold
"comes up with new ideas by starting from the original principles" in some
field where others have labored for years.

When that happens, he's often "treated like a curiosity that can't be taken
seriously," Maran says. "But he always shakes things up in a useful way,
often opens up entire new areas of thought. Some denounce him even as they
profit from the push he's given their thinking."

"Gold's style is in turn charming, intriguing and exasperating: short on
details (where the Devil lies) and long on fiats and suppositions," sighed
eminent geochemist Harmon Craig of Scripps Institution of Oceanography,
reviewing Gold's book in Eos, the journal of the American Geophysical Union.

But if Gold is right about subterranean microbes being the seeds of all
life, and if they survive the Earth's next asteroid collision to restart
evolution, he adds, "Let us hope that when new humans finally emerge and
invent science they will have another Tom Gold to delight and exasperate
them with his theories."

On this particular day the heretic himself is stopping by the local
techno-emporium to pick up a new computer. It's a Macintosh, and with its
blue-and-white neon tones and "Star Trek" design it looks like something
morphed from one of his theories. It's unclear just why his former computer
succumbed. It was only a year old, but he may have made it think too much.

"Supposedly all my files have been transferred into this one," he says
skeptically, accepting only a modicum of help lugging it through the garage
and up to his study. "But of course, you never really know."

Gold says his curiosity has been getting him in trouble ever since his
father gave him a watch when he was little and he took it apart. He's worked
at reassembling things ever since.

One of his boldest constructs was the steady-state theory of the universe,
which is now regarded, says Craig, as "beautiful but untrue." Still, as
cosmologist Freeman Dyson of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton
says, if Gold hadn't put forward the steady-state theory, astronomers might
not have been inspired enough to dream up the Big Bang theory, which
replaced it.

We probably shouldn't be too hard on Gold for not quite figuring out the
universe on his first try. After all, he rushed through Cambridge in only
two years (there was a war on) and his degree was in engineering.

But his mind had impressed his friend Hermann Bundi, one of Cambridge's
famous wartime coterie of mathematical geniuses, who suggested Gold would be
useful on a highly classified war project. There was only one problem: Gold
was interned at the time as an enemy alien. He and his parents were Austrian
citizens, and despite being refugees from Hitler (his father was Jewish),
they had been technically classified as Germans by the British after war
broke out in 1939.

"I was probably the first person to go right from internment as an enemy to
work on an ultra-secret project like radar," he muses.

After the war he went back to Cambridge where, impressed with his
brilliance, administrators presented him with a prized four-year fellowship
to do anything he wanted.

"I told them I would like to teach advanced physics," Gold remembers. "They
said that was fine. But since I had never studied any physics, I had to
learn it myself night by night, before each lecture."

In the process, he read widely on all sides of the subject and became
convinced all physics was related. From that he published his steady-state
theory, which held that whatever had happened once in the universe must be
occurring someplace in the universe today.

That made a big splash in scientific circles and, says Gold, "I'm still not
entirely sure it's wrong." From there he moved on in 1953 to become
assistant to Britain's astronomer royal, who heads the Greenwich Observatory
and holds one of the country's most prestigious intellectual posts.

There he says he accidentally discovered the ultrasound phenomenon now used
to check out unborn babies. But his boss decided it had nothing to do with
astronomy and tore down his laboratory, so Gold left for the United States.

He landed in Harvard in 1955, "either the youngest or the second youngest
full professor on the faculty. I forget which." But he refused to live in
Boston and detested commuting from the suburbs, so within four years he had
migrated to a "much more livable" environment at Cornell.

He's been here causing trouble ever since.

Fueling Passion

Gold, who holds prestigious appointments to the National Academy of Sciences
and the Royal Society of London, turned his attention to petroleum during
the energy crisis of the late 1970s. He has not been universally welcomed by
industry geologists. Gold's hypothesis on the origin of petroleum amid deep
hot life "is not very well defended," sniffed geoscientist Alton Brown of
Atlantic Richfield in a review of "The Deep Hot Biosphere" in American
Scientist last July. "We ... know too much about the subsurface and about
petroleum geochemistry to seriously consider these ideas."

But Gold is used to being dissed. While scientists like Brown have
traditionally sought to explain petroleum by looking in the ground, Gold
says, he developed his theory by looking in the other direction.

Far from being an earthly substance, he says, petroleum and its component
hydrocarbons are present throughout the universe. You find them in
meteorites. You find them in captured interplanetary dust. You can detect
them quite abundantly on one of the moons of Saturn. About all this there is
no scientific argument.

As an astronomer and geophysicist, he says, "it always seemed absurd to me
to see petroleum hydrocarbons on other planets, where there was obviously
never any vegetation, even as we insist that on Earth they must be
biological in origin."

Yet wherever earthly petroleum is found, even miles below ground, oil always
contains biological material, such as the wreckage of old, dead cells. If
"fossil fuel" wasn't formed from ancient plants and animals, how did that
material get there?

Another puzzle bothered Gold, though he says it seems to concern few others:
the gas helium. Helium is one of the essential elements of the universe,
present in trace amounts everywhere in nature. As a so-called "noble" gas,
it stays chemically aloof from other elements, never combining like, say,
hydrogen and oxygen do to form a third substance like water. Yet the only
place on Earth helium is ever found in abundance is with pools of petroleum
underground.

What, Gold wondered, could explain that?

Then in 1977 a tiny research submarine probing deep beneath the Pacific
Ocean near the Galapagos Islands discovered something that revolutionized
our understanding of life.

More than 1 1/2 miles down on an ocean floor made otherwise barren by
darkness and crushing pressure, the sub's floodlights revealed entirely new
ecosystems living amid the scalding 600-degree heat and mineral-rich
eruptions of subsea volcanic vents. On subsequent expeditions, scientists
were astounded to find an entire food chain at the vents--blood red giant
tube worms, albino crabs and other creatures--thriving on previously unknown
forms of heat-loving microbes where no possibility of life was thought to
exist.

That got Gold thinking.

Last year, in his book "Consilience," Harvard entomologist E.O. Wilson, a
polymathic heretic like Gold, stirred the scientific pot by arguing that all
forms of human knowledge are really branches of biology, and serve an
evolutionary goal. But Gold goes further than that.

"Perhaps biology is just a branch of thermodynamics," he has written, and
the history of life is just "a gradual systematic development toward more
efficient ways of degrading energy. ... The chemical energy available inside
a planetary body is then more likely to have been the first energy source,
and surface creatures--like elephants and ... people--which feed indirectly
on solar energy--are just a [much later] adaptation of that life to ...
circumstances on the surface of our planet."

Endless Oil?

Working from that hypothesis, Gold's theory goes like this: Oil and gas were
born out of the Big Bang and trapped in the Earth 4.5 billion years ago in
randomly dispersed molecular form. But the intense heat of the Earth's
volcanic core "sweats them out" of the rocks that contain them, sending them
migrating outward through the porous deep Earth because they are more fluid
and weigh less. In a region between 10 and 300 kilometers deep, the
hydrocarbons nourish vast colonies of microbes where all of earthly life
began, and where today there's a vastly greater mass of living things than
exist on the surface of the planet. The migrating oil and gas "sweep up" the
biological wreckage of this life as they percolate upward, together with
molecules of helium, all of which eventually get trapped and concentrated
for periods in near-surface reservoirs where oil is usually found.

As far out as all this may sound, in the years since Gold first noised the
outlines of his theory, researchers throughout the world have documented
extensively the presence of active microbes in the deep Earth under
conditions of heat and pressure once thought impossible to sustain life.

Furthermore, some oil reservoirs long thought exhausted now appear to be
mysteriously refilling. Gold considers the best proof of his program the
extraction of 12 tons of crude oil in 1990 from a 6-kilometer-deep well
drilled in the long-presumed oil-free granite of central Sweden.

Chris Flavin of World Watch Institute says he's found many elements of
Gold's theory "pretty persuasive" in the light of such discoveries, and says
there's much to cheer environmentalists. If Gold is right, he says, the
greatest abundance of accessible hydrocarbons will be found in the form of
natural gas. Gas is not only the cleanest-burning energy source right now,
it promises "to be the bridge to the hydrogen economy in the future" which
will be cleaner still, he says.

But skeptics remain.

"We know there's carbon deep within the Earth because that's where we find
diamonds," says Nick Woodward, a geoscience program manager with the Energy
Department. "And we know there's water, at least in small amounts, which,
since it's hydrogen and oxygen, gives us the building blocks for petroleum
hydrocarbons. ... "But whether that therefore means the source of all
hydrocarbons is in the deep Earth, I think that's highly questionable."

Gold shrugs off such unbelievers. The scientific world, allegedly searching
for truth, is really little more hospitable to it than when Galileo fell
afoul of the Inquisition, he says.

"You know, I am very lucky that I received recognition and honors early in
my career, so that by the time I started making real waves I already had
stature," he says. "Even with my record I've had a terrible time getting
some of these papers published. Without it nobody would touch me. ...

"The problem is this system of peer review" wherein established scholars in
a field pass judgment on new papers before publication, he says. "That
rewards small steps but discourages bold ideas and the very sort of
cross-discipline thinking that can provide the greatest breakthroughs. I
don't think there's any question that we produced more great ideas in the
first half of the 20th century than we have in the second"--when peer review
has ruled.

Nevertheless, Gold soldiers on. He's presently writing his memoirs of a
lifetime of heresy. Chosen title: "Getting the Back Off the Watch."

I recall reading an article by Gold in Scientific American in the
1970s regarding what he then called his "Deep Earth Gas Hypothesis",
or something similar.  It was the same idea, that petroleum and natural
gas came from methane bubbling up from deep in the interior of the earth,
rather than from organic matter.

Gold convinced a group to drill for oil in what was a highly unpromising
area by conventional standards, in the late 70s or early 80s, and as I
recall the project was a complete failure.  No mention of that in the
article quoted here, though, which seemed more interested in colorizing
the man than in whether his ideas are correct.

Actually, how can I reconcile *your* views is the main question going
through my head right now.  First you write that we shouldn't believe in
ETI because religions could abuse the concept, and then you ask me who
cares what the religious think?  If we're going to think on that level,
then the probability of ETI is totally independent of who abuses the concept.

I have no interest in hypothesizing that miracles are the results of
extraterrestrials playing games.  This sounds to me either like a theist
rationalizing a slide into atheism, or like an atheist who still hasn't
emotionally let go of a religious upbringing.  A real atheist would tell
you that the miracles are simply fictions, and a real theist would tell
you that the miracles are the direct intervention of the Creator, who is
the unique creator of all reality, and who obeys Damien Broderick's Law
("Gods are distinct from creatures").  And I would tell you that any
explanation that tries to compromise between those two extremes will be
as flat wrong as a compromise between chemistry and alchemy.  Humans
compromise.  Groups compromise.  The truth doesn't care what you think.

Exactly, if you can't come up with a plausible explanation for the
"interventions" then you are on swampy ground.  The two I've been
able to provide are:
  (a) an experiment (though this is iffy because you should be able
      to simulate it with a large enough computer)
  (b) an attempt to increase the diversity of evolved superintelligent species
      (in which case you want to watch but interfere as little as possible).

Don't look at the Mars missions, look at the loss of the WIRE infrared
survey.  No matter how clever they are, if they have anything big in
our vicinity it is going to have an infrared signature.  The biggest
threat to discovery is infrared surveys.  If we lose SIRTF to some
accident then I would say we have a real smoking gun.

You can attribute it to a pendulum effect -- we once "believed"
"anything" (when we were a younger species or as children).
Once you develop (as a race or individual) critical, rational
approaches to discovery of "reality" one is reluctant to
relax them.  It is easier to reject complexity rather than
develop accept it.  But if you look at the evolution of physics
we have gone from 4 elements to 92 elements, from 1 "indivisible"
atom to dozens of subatomic particles.  So complexity evolves
until it can explain the unexplained phenomena.  So long as
we have unexplained phenomena, I'm pretty confident that
we haven't got it quite right yet and it might well be more
complex than we imagine.

That wasn't my point at all.  I care nothing about the approach of
traditional religions to this question.  My point is to suggest that
the views of many Extropians may not be consistent.

The possibility which some list members have advanced, that ETs may
well be in our vicinity, observing and possibly interacting with us,
is inconsistent with another belief many of us share: that traditional
religions are absurdly false, as are claims of leprechauns, UFO
abductions, prayer healing, and other forms of pseudoscientific claptrap.

> and then you ask me who

You replied that believers in the Judeo-Christian tradition would view
such an interpretation of religious miracles as blasphemy.  No doubt
this is true, but irrelevant.  I assume none of us falls into this
category.  It is our own beliefs which I want to investigate and test,
not those of religious fanatics.  In particular, I want to know whether
we can consistently adopt the view that ETs are here and still strongly
disbelieve in religion.  This is the proposition I challenge.

It doesn't sound like either one to me.  Rather, it seems to be the
position forced on a rationalist who looks at the Fermi paradox and
concludes that ETs are here and have been here throughout human history.
Since they have the power to perform most of the miracles which have been
claimed over the years, we can no longer rule them out on the grounds
of impossibility.  This is the position which I am arguing that an
Extropian must take who chooses this way out of the Fermi paradox.

The proposition that religious miracles are due to scientific
interventions by advanced ETs is hardly a compromise between the atheistic
and religious views as you have defined them here, but this whole semantic
issue is irrelevant.

My ultimate point is the same one I have made in other contexts.  We have
had tremendous success througout history by removing supernatural elements
from our explanations of the universe.  Adopting the view that ETs are
here and manipulating our world is a giant step backward.  Posting to the
web to implore ET to respond is simply a form of prayer.  I don't believe
this has any place in a modern, rationalistic approach to the universe.

I reject utterly this entire concept of rationality.  What you're saying
is that the historical development of human opinion, in which "progress
in successfully modeling and manipulating the Universe" was covariant
with "the change from models that attribute patterns to the desires of
powerful entities, to models that attribute patterns to the interaction
of lower-level elements", is allowed to impose a constraint on external
reality that prevents powerful entities from influencing our world.

Maybe people who are already silly to begin with can't accept the idea
that this whole Universe might be a computer simulation run by
interventionist sysops without losing all track of reality, but as far
as I'm concerned, in the event that the Matrix Hypothesis was proven,
I'd simply go on thinking the same way as always.  If I don't believe in
miracle X, it's because miracle X is easier to explain by reference to
human legend then by reference to intervention, not because intervention
is absolutely impossible.  Think relative probabilities, not proof. 
Only weak minds demand certainty.

If there's a Power hovering behind the moon, I don't have to abandon the
reductionist paradigm.  I just say the low-level elements making up this
Universe are organized in the shape of a Power hovering behind the moon,
for understandable historical reasons having to do with the previous
development of intelligent life.  And if the Power starts playing games
with the planet, presumably due to persistent initial programming, then
the behavior of the Power is explicable in terms of the evolved
psychology and last-minute social interaction of the race that created it.

Known memetic forces impose one set of probabilities on an explanation
for an account of a miracle; known facts about the world (i.e. WWII was
not prevented, nor is child abuse) and probabilities about the racial
psychology of the initiating race impose another set of probabilities on
interventionist explanations for an account of a miracle.  I don't see
where the equations break down.

Noveau neurons are better than no neurons at all 

An artificial neuron built by researchers at U.C. San Diego may be the
first step toward restoring brain function in patients suffering from
stroke, Alzheimer's and other neurological dysfunction. The
interdisciplinary team, led by Alan Selverston and Henry Abarbanel,
successfully integrated their electronic neuron within a group of 14
biological neurons from the California spiny lobster. 

The neural network controls the rhythmic way food passes from the
stomach to the lobster's digestive system. By removing crucial
biological neurons from the natural circuit, the UCSD researchers
essentially created "lobster epilepsy" and then cured it. The Navy would
like to emulate biological systems for information processing and
control. One approach is to understand biological neural networks. "This
demonstration shows that we know enough about the biology of a simple
network so that we now can build models and hardware to take advantage
of their nonlinear properties," said ONR Program Manager Joel Davis. 

The electronic neuron was built from $7.50 worth of circuit parts from
Radio Shack. The team said the key finding was in the mathematical
modeling that preceded the actual experiment. They discovered they only
needed to control three variables that affect a neuron's overall
function, rather than the hundreds of variables involved in the detailed
biological functioning of each cell. Their finding radically simplified
the mathematical algorithm used to construct the circuit. The team plans
to gradually replace each of the biological neurons in the network with
electronic ones. If the entire electronic network can function properly,
then technology will be a step closer to replacing diseased or damaged
neurons in human tissue.

No, it does not put a constraint on external reality.  But it does provide
strong evidence of what we should believe about external reality.

Broadly speaking, we live in one of three universes:

	(A) No Powers are locally present
	(B) Powers are present, but they hide perfectly
	(C) Powers are present, and they sometimes do interact with us

For all intents and purposes, (A) and (B) are the same, so the real
issue is whether (A) or (C) obtains.  My criticism is directed at those
who would support (C).  The fact is that all of our scientific successes
and slow, painful progress over the centuries have been the direct result
of denying (C) and moving to (A).  There is no reason whatsoever to go
back to believing (C) at this point.

How likely is it, then, that the miracle of the loaves and fishes (in
which a multitude were fed using a small initial allocation of food) is
the result of nanotechnological food synthesis by an alien Jesus?  How
can you evaluate this?

Suppose you had absolute knowledge that a sometimes-interventionist
Power was in residence on the earth.  Doesn't this force you to accept
a significant probability that this event was real?  Certainly it would
have been within the capabilities of the Power.

Now suppose you (somehow) knew that there was no such interventionist
Power.  Can't you say, now, that this miracle is virtually certain not
to have happened?

It seems to me that accepting the premise of an interventionist alien
civilization in residence on or near this planet, as several people
have suggested, forces you to accept as a reasonable, plausible and
significant probability that any number of miraculous, non-scientific
events may in fact have been real, and may still be real.

The issue is not whether a reductionist paradigm works, because as
you say you can trivially expand it to include any phenomena you like.
The real issue is whether conscious intelligence plays a role in what
we would ordinarily consider natural phenomena, suggesting that our
observed laws may be much less lawful than we would otherwise imagine.

Biblical miracles and other magical events represent suspension of
natural law.  By ordinary scientific reasoning we can rule these out.
In the presence of a Power, we can not, for two reasons.  First, most
of them could be accomplished by sufficiently advanced technology, and
second, even for those which appear to violate natural laws, it could be
that the Power has systematically and intentionally misled us about the
true laws of the universe.  Philosophically we have no basis for making
conclusions in the face of such superior power.

When we face scientific quandaries today, such as the solar neutrino
problem or the missing galactic mass, we can either look for naturalistic
explanations in keeping with the philosophical tradition of scientific
inquiry, or we can try to solve these puzzles by invoking the existence
of a supernatural Power.  But the latter explanation is so broad and so
unlimited that virtually anything can be explained by this means.  It
is essentially a religious explanation, not a scientific one.

This is close to reasoning I would accept: the fact that Powers apparently
do not intervene openly and obviously seems inconsistent with the
proposition that they would have instigated a religious movement that
would sweep half the globe.  Creating Jesus is hardly the way to keep
a low profile.

Nevertheless, religious philosophers have devoted uncounted thousands of
hours to rationalizing their own higher Power's seeming inattention to
the world with his forceful intervention in the creation of Jesus.  It is
not difficult to invoke the unfathomable mind of the Power to explain
why we cannot plumb the mysteries of its divine will.  Virtually any
pattern of behavior is possible, and the technology of the Power puts
essentially no limits on what it may choose to accomplish.  In practice
you cannot deduce anything significant about the reality of religious
miracles from the fact that WWII and child abuse are allowed to happen.

It seems to me, that global warming would reduce hurricanes, not make them
worse.  My logic is this.  Hurricanes are caused by temperature differences,
and global warming would reduce temperature differences.

The colder the poles are, the more moisture they sucked out of the air.  And
if the polar regions became warmer, then the rainfall and cloud cover would
increase. Causing the warm regions to become cooler.

And with the cold regions becoming warmer, and the warm regions becoming
cooler, the temperature differential that causes storms would be reduced.
Therefore I would expect more mild temperate weather.

The possibility of a National Nanotechnology Initiative being launched
by the Federal government next year was mentioned in the business
section of the Monday (Nov. 1) New York Times in an article on
molecular computing (that is a follow-up to an article that appeared
several months ago describing the Hewlett-Packard/UCLA research).

Yes, except one doesn't get the impression that this 14-cell gut
ganglion which has had one of its neurons replaced by an artificial
one is still actually attached to a lobster.  [This news report,
or a very similar one, was actually at msnbc.com about three weeks

It seems to me that you're having trouble accepting the proposition that
anything is possible.  In my philosophy, this is an engineering fact
verging on an axiom; the fact that I cannot assign a 100% probability to
any assertion trivially implies that I cannot assign a 0% probability to
any assertion.  I don't navigate qualitatively, ruling out branches of
the future.  I navigate quantitatively, using Occam's Razor.

Yes, anything is possible, but some explanations are more complex than
others.  Which is more likely; that the known forces of human memetics
generated a legend, or that a Power intervened in this case, but not in
others?  The information contained in the memetics specification arises
naturally from human psychology, evolution, and ultimately the laws of
physics; on a fundamental level, it requires almost nothing that we
haven't assumed already.  Unless you can find an interventionist
specification for some set of miracles that compactly explains why the
Power intervened in these cases but not in other, similar cases, then
your specification pretty much assumes what it's supposed to explain,
requiring a much greater quantity of information to specify.  Under the
information-theoretic formulation of Occam's Razor, which is what I
usually use, this would mean the first explanation is correct.

And while I agree that "Don't use Powers to explain things" has,
historically, great value as a heuristic, cognition doesn't dictate
external reality.  If my model of the Universe predicts local and
interventionist Powers, and a model that lacks said Powers is more
complex and in fact contains characteristics that are obviously assumed
solely to prevent said Powers from being there, then Occam's Razor - the
rule underlying the no-Powers heuristic - takes over and makes the first
explanation correct.  Because the *real* heuristic is that you can't
assume what you're trying to prove; that's why Power-based explanations
don't *work*, they attribute the blueness of the sky to someone's
intention that the sky be blue, and then refuse to explain the
intention.  That explanation contains as much information as what it
explains.  The simplest explanation is *not* "The lady down the block is
a witch; she did it," because you haven't explained her motives. 
Reductive explanations are far more compact, informationally; you can
explain complex surface behaviors by reference to simple elements and
rules of interaction.  And since we're in a reductive reality, and our
world *is* made up of interacting elements, Occam's Razor works.

That was the Siljan Gas Project, where they drilled in the region
around lake Siljan in Sweden. The place is rather interesting, an old
impact crater (a few tens of kilometers across) where Gold's theories
said methane would have been trapped beneath the rock. There was quite
a bit of interest in the drilling, not unlike participating in a
lottery (OK, the likeliehood of winning is slight... but IF you
win!). As you said, the project failed to find any oil or gas.

What they did find, and didn't realize the importance of, was strange
organic gunk from deep in the ground. I remember seeing it on
television and thinking "Hmm, could that be bacterial films from deep
in the rock?" - they might have discovered the subterranean ecosystem
several years ahead if they had not been too hungry for oil.

Was there a laugh track in the Mony Python show? I can't recall it,
except occasional clips to old ladies applauding. Maybe somebody sent

I think the main cause of hurricanes is that warm moist sea air rises,
causing an inflow of surrounding air. The heat differential that
supplies the energy is vertical, the difference between ground level
and stratospheric air. The effects of global warming on this
differential is definitely non-trivial.

Also, higher temperatures -> more evaporation -> more cloud formation
-> more sunlight reflected into space. But this effect will not be
homogeneous across the planet...

I have seen this idea proposed before, and it just goes to show how
tricky climate modelling is. You get a lot of highly nonlinear
interactions; an increase in arctic temperatures would reduce the
saline cold deep sea currents, possibly weakening the Gulf stream -
which might either balance the situation, or cause oscillations
leading to a new, likely unpleasant (to us Swedes) climate.

Yes, it was removed from the lobster. 

Hmm, maybe I can convince the Sten Grillner's group at the Karolinska
Institute to do something similar with their lamprey spinal cord
preparations... I think I'll try to convince my professor about it, it
would actually make sense for our research group to get involved.

Or, in either case, suggested even the bare bones of a mechanism or path
whereby this intention or motive was actualized. Worse, if the mechanism is

blueness is), the intention is otiose and gets the Ockam chop; if it is
entirely inconsistent with the corpus of knowledge (the witch's purported
powers), it's not even a starter (with a proviso to follow).

But I feel that Hal's and Robert's injunction against `magic' forces, etc,
might foreclose some true explanations. Lovelock's Gaia heuristic looks
good to me - we expect life to put its environment into
far-from-equilibrium but equilibrated states, so planets in such states
probably harbor life and those that aren't probably don't (except maybe of
the Tommy Gold lurking variety). To gaze at a world from a distance and
refuse to accept as explanatory life, and even the intentions of some of
the life, would prevent us from knowing true things (at least in respect of
the Earth). That would be a kind of Copernican stance, but a misguided one. 

Robert's decision to view the structure and dynamics of the large-scale
cosmos in the light of likely earlier SI civilisations seems to me a
defensible Gaia-type approach (and one that I adverted to in THE SPIKE).
The trick to making it work is to clamp down hard on allowable parameters,
to make restrictions as tight as possible. On the other hand, this might
force us (as it forces Robert) to say `No magical physics', which I suspect
is a cardinal error. Not because our guesses at any particular magical
physics are likely to be right (too few limiting constraints), but because
the chances of us today just happening to live in the period when *all the
major physics is finally known* is... rather remote, isn't it? Yes, we know
a lot, yes, some think we're closing in on a TOE, but by golly we'll all
look as dopey in 50 years time as any Lord Kelvin a century back whose
world view denied (if only by implication) black holes, M-branes, or simple
radioactivity.

My own take on this, as I might have embarrassed a few here who perhaps
regard me as more or less rational, is that some of the evidence from
parapsychologists points to very weird shit indeed. Example: of late, some
intriguing work is being done as a follow-up to studies by Dr Dean Radin,
which I reported here a year or so back, indicating that subjects make a
detectable GSR `presponse' to visual targets not shown to them until a
couple of seconds later. This is a statistical effect, as usual, found in
concatenated results - like most psychophysiological paradigms. Reported
work, and other stuff still in press that I'm not at liberty to discuss in
detail, suggests that these presentiments are weak or non-existent for
emotionally colorless or `calm' stimuli, stronger for sexually arousing
images, and strongest of all for violent or horrible pictures. If this
effect is repeatable, as it now begins to seem to be, we have the door
opened a tiny crack to magical time-bending physics. Dang.

Don't shoot the messenger, I just work here.

Hi!

I love it too (particullarly the first few series) but I don't think it's as
good as the ones I mentioned (and you could also mention "Smith & Jones",
"You Called M'Lord?", and "Crazy Train" as possible options).

Are there any good US comedies nowadays? I used to watch "Seinfeld" and "The
Simpsons" but right now I don't think I watch a single US comedy. I believe
"Frasier" is the most popular comedy in the US but I think it sucks. Is
there some alternative?

That's weird. Have you ever watched "Not the 9 O'clock News" or the
third/fourth series of "The Black Adder"? They are superb.

Perhaps. But what about "use-related damage" or mechanical senescence that
might not be derived from aging itself. For example: presbyopia, molar
erosion, hardening of joints, and menopause. Species that appear not to age
have different physiologies that allow them to cope with these situations.
Even that we do not age, these problems might still affect us. Of course
this depends on how you define aging but I think that senescence and certain
age-related changes might be independent of one another (as predicted from
evolutionary theory).

You need to have lots of warm sea water (>27 degress C) to get a hurricane.
Therefore hurricanes only appear in places north or south of the equator
which do have direct sea access to the equator.  A hurricane tend to blow
away :-) when it hits higher ground.

So... global warning would mean more warm sea water, and thus extended
hurricane belts.

The point Hal is trying to make ( and you are missing, or being deliberately
obtuse) is this:

Believing that Powers exist and are interacting with us is just as
irrational as believing in Gods and miracles.

Powers _may_ exist and _may_ be interacting with us but, given the available
evidence, this is extremely unlikely and therefore we use Occams razor to
dismiss this possibility.
Gods and miracles _may_ exist, but rational people generally discount this
possibility for exactly the same reason as above.

What Hal is saying (IMHO) is that accepting the premise of interventionist
Powers leads on to a strong possibility that these same (or other) Powers
have intervened in the past in ways just like have been 'reported' in the
Bible and elsewhere.

He is, therefore pointing out the contradiction in people who strongly
support one and strongly disagree with the other.

It seems to me that you're having trouble accepting the proposition that
anything is possible.  In my philosophy, this is an engineering fact
verging on an axiom; the fact that I cannot assign a 100% probability to
any assertion trivially implies that I cannot assign a 0% probability to
any assertion.  I don't navigate qualitatively, ruling out branches of
the future.  I navigate quantitatively, using Occam's Razor.

Yes, anything is possible, but some explanations are more complex than
others.  Which is more likely; that the known forces of human memetics
generated a legend, or that a Power intervened in this case, but not in
others?  The information contained in the memetics specification arises
naturally from human psychology, evolution, and ultimately the laws of
physics; on a fundamental level, it requires almost nothing that we
haven't assumed already.  Unless you can find an interventionist
specification for some set of miracles that compactly explains why the
Power intervened in these cases but not in other, similar cases, then
your specification pretty much assumes what it's supposed to explain,
requiring a much greater quantity of information to specify.  Under the
information-theoretic formulation of Occam's Razor, which is what I
usually use, this would mean the first explanation is correct.

And while I agree that "Don't use Powers to explain things" has,
historically, great value as a heuristic, cognition doesn't dictate
external reality.  If my model of the Universe predicts local and
interventionist Powers, and a model that lacks said Powers is more
complex and in fact contains characteristics that are obviously assumed
solely to prevent said Powers from being there, then Occam's Razor - the
rule underlying the no-Powers heuristic - takes over and makes the first
explanation correct.  Because the *real* heuristic is that you can't
assume what you're trying to prove; that's why Power-based explanations
don't *work*, they attribute the blueness of the sky to someone's
intention that the sky be blue, and then refuse to explain the
intention.  That explanation contains as much information as what it
explains.  The simplest explanation is *not* "The lady down the block is
a witch; she did it," because you haven't explained her motives. 
Reductive explanations are far more compact, informationally; you can
explain complex surface behaviors by reference to simple elements and
rules of interaction.  And since we're in a reductive reality, and our
world *is* made up of interacting elements, Occam's Razor works.

The trouble I have with the idea is that it is incoherent.  On the one hand
they implicitly assume that all aliens follow a very extreme Prime
Directive-type rule against doing anything that would even be detectible by
primitive civilizations, let alone intervening.  On the other hand, they
seem to think that these same aliens will happily suspend there rule as soon
as someone says hello to them.  That doesn't make sense.  If they don't
respond to a concentration camp inmate praying for deliverance, I don't see
any reason to think they will respond to a casual electronic greeting
either.

     And remember that even the most conservative SETI scientists agree 
that ETI is likely at least 100,000 years beyond our technology.  The 
deep implications of that are worth thinking about for a few minutes.

Hmm... now that I think about it, you're probably right.  Darn.  Cancel

In my mid-twenties, I'm happy to say I still have dreams of flying on a
semi-regular basis.  These usually involve flying far above a city; well,
let's say anywhere from 30 feet to cloud level.  Generally I'm kind of
bobbing up and down, and it requires a sort of concentration to stay aloft,
or perhaps just making super-leaps from the ground.  However once in a while
I really seem to get the hang of it and just soar...  I love those parts,
and I love these dreams in general.

Interesting, I always wondered about that, the laugh track seemed so out of

FUTUROLOGY

Lost in space

http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/304/focus/Lost_in_space+.shtml


Where are the robots, the moon colonies, the domed cities, and automated
highways predicted 40 years ago?

By Scot Lehigh, Globe Staff, 10/31/99


tanding here on the cusp of the new millennium, peering back at the
predictions of the last half century, one can't escape an obvious
conclusion: Some dastardly time bandit made off with our future.


Oh, the dazzling modern amenities that were supposed to have arrived by now.


Underwater settlements. Domed cities. Space colonies.


Automated highways. Hover trains. Endless energy.


Smart homes and smarter offices. Robot maids. Even universal health care.


Such were the predictions proffered in the last half century for life by the
year 2000. And they weren't the pipe dreams of harebrains and crackpots, but
the best guesses from supposed specialists: engineers and scientists,
futurologists, technologists, and professional trend-watchers.


But just as in Michael Crichton's ''Westworld,'' somewhere, something went
wrong ... wrong ... wrong.


When it comes to forecasting the future, two maladies commonly distort the
gaze: too little imagination or too much.


A prime example of the former is Charles Duell, who in 1899, as commissioner
of the US Office of Patents, opined that ''everything that can be invented
has been invented.''


A more common failing, however, is an excess of imaginative power.
Futurologists, tingling with a love of technology and a sense of endless
possibilities, are particularly susceptible.


At the New York World's Fair of 1964-65, the undersea city was one of the
promised marvels in General Motors' popular Futurama II. At about the same
time, Alister Hardy, an Oxford marine biologist, declared that in 20 years,
men would be using aquatic tractors to cultivate crops on the sea floor,
while divers would stay for days in permanent undersea habitations.


Others looked toward the heavens, found the sky illimitable, and promptly
got lost in space.


Now predicting is not rocket science - but rocket scientists have long been
predictors. We would have a manned station on the moon by 1984, Wernher von
Braun foretold in 1964; 50,000 people would live and work in space by 2000,
thought Robert Truax, another rocket pioneer.


Futurologist Roy Mason figured 1989 was a more accurate date for that, while
Timothy Leary, then a professor at Harvard, felt man would begin a massive
migration to High Orbital Mini Earths, or HOMES, in 1995, by which time Drew
University professor Roger Williams Wescott expected we'd have satellite
factories producing goods and bouncing solar power to earth via microwave.


Arthur C. Clarke, the science and science-fiction writer, foresaw a manned
lunar base by 1995; science writer Trudy Bell predicted the Soviets
(remember them?) would colonize the moon by then.


A mere moon colony? Why, Gerald Feinberg, a Columbia University physicist,
said we'd build an artificial planet by 2000 - and see the birth of the
first extraterrestrial tots.


How to transport goods to space? Nothing as fanciful as ''Beam me up,
Scotty,'' certainly. How about the space elevator, a device that would
operate on a cable running, like a giant beanstalk, up through the clouds to
a geosynchronous satellite?


That was a nostrum Clarke tried to popularize in the 1970s and '80s.
''Clearly, if a satellite can remain poised forever above the same spot on
the equator, then, in principle, it should be possible to lower a cable from
orbit to Earth, performing an Indian rope trick 36,000 kilometers high,'' he
wrote. Cagily vague on the time line, he said it would happen ''50 years
after everyone stops laughing.''


One who was not chuckling was inventor and designer Buckminster Fuller, who
noted that as early as 1951 he had proposed a man-made space ring encircling
the earth above the equator. To travel, one would simply ascend to the
ring-bridge, wait for the earth to turn below, and then drop back to the
desired location.


Fuller's fecund imagination also saw the virtual reinvention of the
land-based city under climate-controlling domes. New York City was a likely
candidate, he said, as was East St. Louis.


That idea caught the fancy of other wool-gatherers, and Robert Kenedi, a
Scottish professor of bioengineering, predicted those environmentally
controlled towns by 1984.


Clarke's time line for future progress, outlined in 1964, gives some idea of
the perils of prognostication. A half decade out, he was doing pretty well,
missing by only one year with his estimate when he predicted a manned lunar
landing by 1970.


But what of his fusion delusion: power by combining atom nuclei by 1990? Any
number of more cautious soothsayers thought 1995 to 2000 was a likelier
date, and Clarke later revised his estimate to that date for commercial
application.


What to do while we wait for the promise of unlimited power?


Enter, stage north, the huge chunks of glacial ice that, futurologists
Marvin Cetron and Thomas O'Toole predicted in their 1982 book, ''Encounters
with the Future,'' would be towed south to remedy the severe water shortages
they foretold for the 1990s.


Those icebergs, declared the diving duo, would also ''be used as floating
islands where the country can locate breeder power reactors, using the
melting glacial ice to cool down the reactors while they produce enough
electricity to light up entire coast regions.''


Alas, once the breeder went bust and the cold-water-fusion craze of 1989
turned out to be the scientific equivalent of a misplaced Alka Seltzer
bubbling away in a beaker, hope for power too cheap to meter receded to more
distant days.


Nor have we eliminated hurricanes and typhoons, as Roger Revelle, director
of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, thought we would. And if we're
to have complete weather control by 2010, as Clarke thought, science had
best get busy in the lab.


Futurologists took to the road with their predictions. Automated highways
were much in imaginary vogue, and we're not talking a simple ''smart pass''
here, but systems in which drivers would surrender their cars to remote
roadway control, and let the central computer set the speed.


Worried about malfunctions? No need to be. By 1995 at the latest, Sperry
Corp. futurist Earl Joseph said, a new car would have computerized
collision-avoidance hardware to keep it ''virtually accidentless throughout
its life.''


As for steel wheels on steel rails? Gone the way of the horse and buggy. The
hovercraft subway was the wave of the future, with cars that cruised on an
air cushion, said Christopher Cockerell. (As inventor of the hovercraft,
Cockerell can perhaps be forgiven his self-interested optimism.)


And for cross-country travel, there was Rand physicist Robert Salter's
''planetron,'' an underground mag-lev train that would zoom from New York to
Los Angeles in about an hour.


And there was going to be plenty of time for travel. Life was supposed to
become more leisurely, not more hectic. ''There will be shorter workweeks,
32 hours a week by 1990 and 25 hours a week by 2000,'' wrote Cetron and
O'Toole. A common idea, the truncated workweek, and the reasons were
obvious: computers and robots.


As office help, these machines were supposed to be microelectronic Radar
O'Reillys. Mention a meeting and a topic, the authors confidently predicted,
and your computer would log the appointment, find the address, calculate
your travel time, assemble a dossier of relevant information - and remind
you when promptness required your departure.


Keyboards would become a thing of the past, replaced by ''direct speech
communication'' with your machine, predicted computer expert Malcolm Peltu.


And technology wasn't just for the workplace. Writing in the 1960s, British
engineering specialist Meredith Thring envisioned, within 20 years, a
''robot slave'' that could ''carry out half a dozen or more standard
operations (for example, scrubbing, sweeping, and dusting, washing-up,
laying tables, making beds). ''


In more modern predictions, add shoveling the snow, cutting the grass,
cooking meals, and acting as a sympathetic companion to the elderly.
(''Please Pro-vide Me With More In-for-ma-tion About Your Lin-e-ar
De-scen-dants One Gen-e -ra-tion Re-moved.'')


Others thought robots would become so smart they'd teach our children, whip
us at Scrabble, and be nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. And, horror of
microelectronic horrors, perhaps eventually they would grow so haughty about
their obvious superiority that they would subject us to cyber-tude and
cyber-snubs. (That's a role Gen X has graciously agreed to assume while we
wait upon technology.)


Society's past difficulty with prognostication has not discouraged a new
crop of futurists. ''Predictions for the Next Millennium,'' a 1998 book
surveying some of today's best-known citizens, is full of the same sort of
notions: spaceships, robots, orbiting cities, colonies on Mars.


But until then, we will have to make do. So if you're living in a
not-so-smart home, muddling along without a mechanical maid, and driving a
car or taking a subway not so very unlike those of a decade ago to an office
where you're endlessly tap-tap-tapping on the same old keys of yore, well,
feel free to lament your lost future. And remember the words of Yogi Berra:
''It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future.''


Editor's note: Information for this essay was drawn from a dozen books about
the future or futurology, including, prominently, ''The Book of
Predictions,''``1984 and Beyond,'' ''Encounters with the Future,'' and
''Futurehype.''

Sorry, Spike, but it isn't going to be that easy.  Foot soldiers won't be
obsolete until we can build equally capable robots for less than it costs to
train men, and that won't be for another 10-20 years.

The ability to bomb enemy leaders is not the same as the ability to kill
them.  Even if it were, it is unusual to have a serious war in which killing
one man will change anything.  The really ugly wars are the ones that have
broad popular support, and in that kind of situation killing a leader just
gives the other side a martyr.

Desert Storm showed that air power has become the dominant offensive weapon
in relatively open terrain, but that leaves lots and lots of roles that must
still be filled by the infantry.  Planes cannot capture terrain, they can
only weaken an enemies ability to resist.  Open terrain can be taken by
armored forces, but in close terrain (and especially in urban areas) there
is no substitute for infantry - and since major cities are critical targets
in any real war, that means infantry remain essential even in a modern army.

Several Internet years ago, it only took being
flamed a little bit for me to realize that the
vocal and rabid atheists on this list would
always dominate the list's atmosphere with
regards to religious thought, and I accepted it
as inevitable, even though I found their
hostility strange, as if they personally had
been stretched on the rack next to Galileo
instead of growing up in societies where
freethinkers have long been celebrated and in
charge. (Anyone who does not admit this fact
must be living in a cave without TV. The very
existence and nature of the Internet is proof
that the societies we live in are largely free.)

So I have remained on the sidelines watching
yet another argument about religion wash
over the list, until now.

Obviously, I am not the only one who is
frusted by those who seem to equate all
religious thought with fundamental
Christianity. Aarrgh! What century do
you think this is?

Look, you guys, I think it's safe to say we all
know that evolutionary theory is correct, that
our planet is millions of years old and was
not created in seven days, and that
Christianity was largely made up by a Roman
government committee hundreds of years
after the life of Jesus, if he ever really existed.
We all know that there is no "God" in the
sense of some huge all-powerful man with a
beard who created us and gets upset when
we have sex for any other reason than
procreation. Among intelligent people, which
probably includes anyone on this list, these
arguments have been won a long time ago. As
Nietzche said; that God is dead.

The "God" that is harder to vanquish is the
ineffable one that the mystics talk about, the
one that is defined as undefinable. This "God"
will never be disproven, for the same reason
that a child can always say "Why?" to
whatever explanation you give him. Like
"infinity", this "God" is a symbol and a useful
meme. To get upset when this symbol is used
is like getting upset when someone says
"infinity". If you're so lacking in a poetic sense
that you cannot appreciate this "God", that's
no reason to verbally abuse those that do.
Would you insult Douglas Hofstadter when
he uses the word "God" in this sense?

I don't find it hard to imagine an advanced SI
with a brain the size of a planet thinking,
analyzing, constructing and testing mental
models, expending the energies of whole stars,
for countless terateraflops, trying to understand
the universe, why it's here, and ultimately giving
up, realizing it'll never know, and at that moment
feeling a great awe.

No, when I look at this problem I'm not looking for "enforced" solutions
(for the reasons you point out).  I'm looking for logical solutions dictated
by the environment.  I think there is a process of convergent evolution
that takes place.  Insects fly and birds fly and bats fly but they didn't
get there by the same route.  Fish swim and whales and porposes swim and
even some snakes swim.  They didn't get there by the same route either.
The characteristics of these species has been determined by their environment.

The problem with the SETI/UFO folks is they suffer from a lack of imagination.
They tend to diverge little from our characteristics and apply our motivations
to any extraterrestrials.  But what we ought to start with is: 
(a) the "space" environment; (b) the laws of physics (as we know them);
and (c) rational thought and/or "conscious" evolution.  Then see if
you end up with different entitites based on directed evolution in space
towards known limits.

Anders has a revised version of his Jupiter Brain paper coming out in
which he has 4 types of entitites.  It will be interesting to see whether
they fit into different ecological niches in the galaxy.  When you design
"thought" architectures you have a number available but what I can do
with a quantum qubit computer is different from what I can do with a
cellular automata is different from what I can do with a planetary mass
of magtape and a 4004 microprocessor attached to a read-write head.
The really hard question is
  "What to advanced individuals/civilizations/SIs really want?"

If you can answer that, you could begin to discover what their
motivations are, what kinds of computers they would build and where
they might be.

I don't assume there is an "enforced" Prime-Directive.  I do assume
  (a) there really is nobody out there; or
  (b) the prime directive "followers" are our care-takers/observers; or
  (c) the non-prime directive "followers" haven't reached us (yet); or
  (d) there is virtually no point for a prime directive because we
      aren't of any interest or importantace to the ETs (i.e. convergent
      evolution creates a disinterest in non-space environment occupying
      creatures by space occupying creatures).

> On the other hand, they seem to think that these same aliens will

If (b) is true, my personal opinion is that they will suspend the
rules when we are "interesting" to talk to.  If one of those rules
is that they be "invited to the party" (IR), then we should do that.
If one of the rules is "they never go to parties to which they are
invited" (!IR) then we are not doing the right thing.  But it seems
more logical that rational beings would follow IR than !IR.

Part of allowing evolution to occur "naturally" is to allow the
brutality of [human] "nature" to takes its course.  If they
were around 65 million years ago and didn't off the dinosaurs
they certainly didn't stop it either.  It isn't easy to come
up with a set of rules for when you can violate the prime
directive.  Numerous Star Trek episodes about that one.

You are probably right.  But there is a small chance that
they want an invitation.  Since we have effectively given
them that, either you are right or there are other conditions
that haven't been met.  Maybe one of those is getting rid
of all the people who disbelieve they would respond to
an invitation.... :-)

I don't find it hard to imagine the SI one day realizing "Aha! So that
is how it all works..." and then feeling a bit of dissapointment (it
was rather trivial when you think about it) which quickly turns into
the determination of creating something better, something more
interesting.

Wouldn't it be cool if leprechauns really did exist?

They say the "statues" that guard the path to enlightenment carry the
names "Confusion" and "Paradox".  An enlightened extropian (me?)
can simultaneously hold onto the Paradox that ETs may be among
us and be throwing down a miracle from time to time *and*
disbelieve traditional religions.

It depends on the purpose of an individual's belief and/or the purpose of
the religion.  If you want to believe in "God" or a creator, I'd say you
would be better off betting on ETs (particularly until the biologists
or bioastronomers come up with better evidence for how life self-started
here on Earth).  If you want to believe in "salvation" from "death",
I'd say you would be better off betting on cryonics and nanotechnology.
If you want to believe in paradise on Earth, nanotech looks like a
sure thing.  If you want to believe the universe was "created" by "God",
I would offer instead even odds on (a) multiverses, (b) quantum fluctuations
leading to the big bang, and (c) an SI creating a workable universe
to tunnel some information into.

You can also view religions as being quite valid if the local ET/SIs
who set up our game as an experiment have a really sick sense of humor.

Yep, you cannot rule out the miracles as "impossible".  But I would
say you get into a highly improbable situation trying to justify
when violating the Prime Directive is allowed.  We could have an
interesting time writing up "Escape Clauses for the Prime Directive".
Better get Obie Wan Burch to put that one on his to do list.

Yes, because we have gained increasingly greater abilities to "see" things
at larger and smaller scales (telescopes & microscopes).  Now, as we are
about to *DO* things at increasingly larger and smaller scales (nanotech
and astroengineering) we may have to take a step back and reinterpret
some of our "simple" assumptions.  But rational thinking has done this
throughout history.

> Adopting the view that ETs are here and manipulating our world is a
> giant step backward.

They may be here but may not be "manipulating".  You have to hold
onto both possibilities.  Since most of the "miracles" are unlikely to
be verified, you can only say "They could be here and may or may
not be performing miracles" until evidence becomes available to
dictate which way the pendulum goes.

A rational thinker must hold *all* the possibilities until the
evidence is in  (that *is* extropian).

> Posting to the web to implore ET to respond is simply a form of prayer.
Only if you believe ETs are Gods... :-)

> I don't believe
> this has any place in a modern, rationalistic approach to the universe.

I would offer that the evidence for "No God", i.e. athiesm is weak.
The question revolves around "What is God?".  If I choose to define
"God" as the creator of Earth (an alien ET SI running an experiment
performing an occasional miracle) then there isn't much evidence
available to say that isn't true.  If I choose to define "God"
as the creater of the Universe (an SI in an alternaverse creating
our universe with a stacked deck of fundamental constants and laws
and tunneling into our universe in the the first moments of the big
bang to recast his accumulated knowledge as variations in the
matter density), there isn't much evidence against that either.
Finally, if I choose to define "God" as the computer on which this
entire simulation of an artificial universe is running unbeknownst
to us, we are once again up against a lack of evidence to the contrary.

I'll freely admit that these things don't seem probable to me
but proving them "out of the question" seems difficult to me
so I tend to call myself an agnostic rather than an athiest.

If rational extropians want to disassemble traditional religions
I think it needs to be done via a route other than asserting
"there is no God".

Apologies if I've ruined anyone's day.
Byegones.

No, Hal didn't say that.  Hal said that *admitting the possibility* was
a horrible thing because then he couldn't go around saying that miracles
were *absolutely impossible*.  I'm the one advocating the view that you
use Occam's Razor and probabilities.

If he's saying that, then he's wrong.  Unless you can come up with a
coherent (informationally compact) set of motives that would lead to a
given set of interventions and non-interventions, then the fact that
interventionist Powers exist certainly does not imply the possible
existence of a particular kind of (humanly visible) intervention, much
less the truth of any given set of accounts.

Once again:  This is entirely possible; all it takes is Occam's Razor.

Actually, this is closer to what I meant. I simply think some people will
NOT allow themselves to move on, and will try to prevent anyone else from
doing so. They will have to be left behind, since it is not ethical, to me,
to force people to do things, even if 'it's for their own good'. The
thought that someone would not take up the chance to better their lives
sounds sad, but it's quite common.

This falls into the exact pitfall of applying "our" motivations to
a state of technological development that we don't have.  When
we have that level of development, it is impossible to say what
our motivations will be.

I think the only situation that would ever arise where this might
happen in the universe is when you got two planets forming
in the same solar system within the "possible life belt".  Then the
discovery of and activity of an intelligent civilization could
influence the evolution of life on the other planet without the
requirement for interstellar travel technology.  We would need
some simulations of the formation of planetary systems to see how
probable that is.

Once you have interstellar travel you probably have nanotech and AI as well.
If so, it is questionable whether you have an interest in biosphere
engineering (other than perhaps dismantling them).  Why would you
want to do reality engineering with hardware when you can do it with
software?

I'm not completely 100% opposed to magical physics, though in IMO
current physics is magical enough.  However *if* physics continues
to become more and more complex and/or magical it is going to start
to push me into the "we have to be running on a simulation" camp.
And I really don't want to go there.

My primary reason for pounding the doorstop under the door on
magical physics is to try and force people to explain things
using "conventional physics" before they resort to inventing
things like MACHO particles and the like.  We have far to
many theoretical physicists and far to few astroengineers
when we would probably be better off with things the other
way around.

Consider gas.

Boyle's  Laws and like that.  When gas is heated in a closed container the 
pressure increases.  Now why....fundamentally.....at the molecular 
level....is that?  Well the way I understand it is that the velocity of the 
individual gas molecules increases....which thru a chain of events exerts  
more pressure on the containment walls.

To cut to the chase....somehow by applying heat to gas... velocity is 
imparted to individual molecules. 

I may be missing something here....but where is the "for every action there 
is an equal and opposite reaction".   

Even if i'm not missing something......<great leap>....suppose that all of 
the gas molecules could be coaxed to go in the same direction? (Campbell's 
"Mightiest machine(?)" <early sixties?>)

So if a gadget (with all kinds of neat magnetic fields and primary and 
seconday windings and multicolored flashing lights) could be developed that 
would convince all the gas in a container that they should go in ONE 
direction when heated......wouldn't that be a reactionless drive?

So what has that to do with the real world?

Methinks that as the purity of materials increases (via drextech) that 
certain insignificant physical effects might become more significant.  Silly 
things like......quantum tunneling, direct conversion of stress (piezo) heat 
or light to electricty...and others....

Isn't this fundamental to transistors?  The migration of a "hole" ....and 
thence IC's?

So the point I'm speculating about....perhaps there will be some other 
effects of drextech ......really soon now.

I'm currently reading a book.

Meme Machine by Susan Blackmore.

She defines, defends and expands on the original concept of meme's as 
presented by Dawkins.  In fact dawkins wrote the preface.

It's fascinating....and scary......and explains EVERYTHING.

Basicilly it boils down to this.  After all the interesting stellar evolution 
and stuff things settled down enough for chemistry to start cooking up 
organics.  Eventualy a replicator appeared.

Call this replicator a gene.  

Thence all of biology.

For some silly strange reason (as yet unknow although there are interesting 
speculations...my favorite being heat radiator for cursorial hunters) one of 
the species of biologicals developed a HUGE brain.

This humongous brain was analogous to the "primal ooze"  for meme's....in 
other words  a second replicator developed in conditions which favored it's 
doing so.....the human brain.

This replicator, the meme,...is entirely mental...an information virus so to 
speak.

And that's all there is too it.

No god's ...no aliens...no grand design.  Just replicators trying to 
replicate.  Like germs in a swamp.   (turn on a TV..or take a walk in a 
mall....see what I mean?....meme's everywhere...trying to get into your mind 
and breeeeeeeedd)

Humans have two kinds of replicators working on them unlike every other 
biological known.  Consequently this explains why humanity is so ascendent 
over everything else.  I beleive the word factorial is interesting in this 
regard.

A key concept to keep in mind is that meme's could care less (metaphorically 
speaking of course.....because meme's ...like genes....dont care at 
all)......about what's good for gene's.  All meme's are "trying" to do is 
replicate.  That's what replicators do.  That's All they do.

Hence relegion......looney tunes......and  soap operas.....mental viruses 
trying to infect and breed.

If you can catch the reruns on HBO of The Larry Sanders Show I think you might get a chuckle or two.  Another comedy that is a cut above the standard network sitcom is Sex and the City, also on HBO.  Unfortunately, the production is inconsistent and some nights are better than others.

You misunderstand. My hypothetical SI was not trying

No, "god" can't be compared to a relatively neutral
meme like "infinity"; it is firmly (and IMHO duly) 
linked to things like ignorance, irrationality and 
oppression. It's a meme that carries a lot of (often 
unpleasant) historical baggage. That's why atheists 
get upset when you use it.

The undefinable is the undefinable, the universe is 
the universe, infinity is infinity. Using the term 
"God" to describe any or all of these things is 
simply not very practical.

....or frustration. Personally, I don't think a SI would
*ever* give up completely, though it may give the search 
for absolute understanding of everything an increasingly 
lower priority.

Well, the fact of the matter is that when we're talking about gasses, the
temperature of the gas just IS the mean kinetic energy of the molecules
involved, in a very palpable sense.  So it's not that heat SOMEHOW imparts
velocity, it's that heat IS the act of imparting velocity to the
molecules.

Similarly, it's not like shaking hands somehow *causes* hands to be shook;
it's that shaking hands just IS the shaking of hands.

> I may be missing something here....but where is the "for every action
> there is an equal and opposite reaction".

I'm not sure I'm understanding your question...  Maybe you're asking how
the mean kinetic energy is increasing without obvious force being applied?

Suppose that the gas is in a canister.  Note that even though the kinetic
energy of the gas is increasing, the momentum of the *container* of gas is
still zero.  Those little particles are all zipping around, on average, in
every direction at exactly the same magnitude, so the center of gravity of
the whole can (that is, the average location of all of the particles in
the can) doesn't move, even if the individual particles are bouncing all
over everywhere.

On account of this, no force need be applied to the canister to get this
change, though heat must be applied (and, as you're surely aware, heat
doesn't come from nowhere).

> Even if i'm not missing something......<great leap>....suppose that all of

This reminds me of Maxwell's demon.  He was noticing that you can get work
by allowing heat to flow from a hot place to a cold place.  (You can think
of it as something like a water wheel or turbine, which extracts energy
from the flow of water).  When the two places are at the same temperature,
no more energy can be extracted in this way.  This is the fundamental
theory behind an engine.

Well, being "hot" just means that you're a fast particle; being "cold"
just means that you're slower that the fast hot particles.  So, Maxwell
imagined, what if we had a box with two insulated compartments, and a tiny
little door between them, which was opened and closed by a tiny little
Demon, or nanobot if you want a more modern version.  Then suppose that
you put the gas, of one constant temperature, on the right.  Now "constant
temperature" is something of a misnomer: what this really means is that
exactly half the particles are faster than the average, and half the
particles are slower than the average, and the average determines the
temperature.

The Demon/nanobot, imagined Maxwell, could simply watch the particles
heading towards the door.  If the particles were sufficiently fast, he'd
open the door and let them through.  Otherwise, he'd keep the door closed
and they'd remain in the original canister.  After a while, one
compartment would be filled with fast, hot particles and the compartment
on the right would be filled with slow, cold particles.  At that point,
you turn that system into an engine, allowing heat to flow from one side
to the other.  Free energy results from nothing, since opening/closing the
door takes very little energy at all in comparison to the amount which the
engine would generate.  Entropy, in this case, would decrease in the
closed system, for free.

Maxwell's Demon doesn't work, and the law of conservation of energy still
holds, however.  Why?  Since it was revealed that the act of OBSERVING the
particles, of figuring out how fast the individual particles are, this
observation act ITSELF required energy to run.  In fact, it requires much,
much, more energy than the engine would generate after the Demon/nanobot
had done its work.  (I think that entropy, on account of this, is better
thought of as "uncertainty" than as "chaos," though some disagree with
me.)

I tell this little anecdote since what you're describing seems like a
similar project to Maxwell's Demon: it seems like it would work, but the
devil is in the details [pun intended].  Coaxing all of the molecules to
travel in one direction would GREATLY reduce the entropy of the system of
gasses; the attempt to reduce the entropy in this way, even by a
nanobot/Demon, requires much more energy than you get out of it.

If it's any consolation, you should feel proud for inventing yourself one
of the most interesting physical puzzles of this century, IMO.

Don't forget that velocity, and therefore momentum, is a vector.  As
the heat input is converted to kinetic energy of the gas molecules, the
overall effect looks like "pressure" because the vectors all point in
random directions, so the overall velocity (and momentum) of the
container as a whole is still zero.  Momentum is preserved.

The only way to "convince" an atom to move in a certain direction is
by giving it momentum stolen from something else.  Magnetic fields
aren't enough: a magnet might attract an ion, causing it to move toward
the magnet, but it also move the magnet a tiny bit toward the ion in
proportion to its relative mass.  For one ion, you won't notice this,
but if you try to move a significant mass, you're trying to pull a
car with a magnet mounted on the car.

You can't get away from needing reaction mass if you really want to
go from point A to point B.  Something like Lorrey Drive will let you
wiggle around point A for a while, but that's of limited use.

> So the point I'm speculating about....perhaps there will be some other 
> effects of drextech ......really soon now.

I don't think tunneling violates conservation of momentum, but I may
be mistaken about that.  If it does, that very well might be used to
get around some of the reaction mass problem--but a more likely way it
will be done is with the big scoop to suck up stray hydrogen atoms
along the way to push out the tailpipe.

As the above list makes clear, you have a much bigger implicit assumption
that is very improbable, and therefore requires a great deal of
justification.  Specifically, you are assuming that no SI ever wants to do
anything that would be especially visible to us.  They don't disassemble
solar systems to build things, they don't reorganize galaxies to optimize
the mass distribution, and they certainly don't to any recognizable sort of
cosmological engineering.

We've been doing that ever since we learned how to pray.  If sincerity were
the key we'd already be talking.  If correctly understanding what they are
is important we still have a long way to go.  Either way, I don't see that
posting a message on the Internet is any more likely to work than striking
up a conversation with the nearest wall.

What could possibly convince every single individual of every sentient
species within a billion light years to abide by such a code?  The Prime
Directive is a human invention founded on the idea that all cultures are
equivalent and meaningful improvement in the human condition is not
possible.  Neither of these propositions is true.

If primitive sentient life has value then allowing primitives to die while
they struggle towards understanding is immoral.  If primitive sentient life
does not have value then why not convert the solar system into something
that does?  Either way, you don't get the world we live in.

There are multiple memes for which the word "God" are
sometimes applied. Some of these memes CAN very well
be compared to the infinity meme, and *these* memes
cannot fairly be linked to things like oppression,
etc.

I agree, but a learned native English speaker should
be aware that in the English language the word "God"
is used this way.

To continue the series: what would it be to have *three* kinds of

Genes, memes and... ?

I recently started reading a book called _Reason, Truth and History_ by
Hilary Putnam.  (I highly advocate this book to everyone, though it is
quite difficult.)  He argues in favor of an "internalist" or
"anti-realist" theory of truth, rather than a correspondence theory of
truth; I think his argument has relevance here.

Under a correspondence theory of truth, a given sentence is true, say
"snow is white," on the condition that there is real snow, out there in
the real world, and that the snow really exhibits the property of being
white.

Under an internalist theory of truth, however, we merely generate models
(such as scientific models) which we use to attempt to explain/predict our
experiences.  In this sense, we *posit* the existence of a real world,
snow, whiteness, etc. in an attempt to explain/predict.  So when is a
claim true?  Well, under internalism, all we have is the rational
acceptability of the claims presented to us; thus, truth is simply
rational acceptability under ideal epistemic conditions.  "Snow is white"
is true iff, under ideal epistemic conditions, we would find that the
claim that "snow is white" is rationally acceptable.

On account of this, there can be more than one true explanation of
phenomena, because both are equally rationally acceptable.  More relevant
to this conversation, however, is this: if a given claim would NOT be
rationally acceptable under ideal epistemic conditions, then the claim is
false.  The important result here is in Eliezer's claim above, that even
if the Matrix Hypothesis were somehow "proven," he'd still use human
legend rather than intervention to explain/predict.  (Me, too!)  In
Putnam's terminology, Eliezer would NOT rationally accept a Matrix
Hypothesis, even under ideal epistemic conditions.  Therefore, since truth
just IS rational acceptability under ideal epistemic conditions, the claim
is false, full stop.

Putnam's argument is quite convincing to my mind.  His argument stems from
the philosophy of language, showing that there is no way for a
correspondence theorist to give an account of how words in a sentence
*refer* to specific real objects out in the real world, because there are
too many possible correspondences between words and object.  To *specify*
one particular correspondence would require one to already have the
capacity to REFER to a particular correspondence.  Since we were trying to
give an account of how reference happens to begin with, we cannot invoke
reference in the process.  Without a working theory of reference, the
correspondence theory of truth becomes nonsense.

(Note that not even the intentions of the author/speaker can do the work
here, since the correspondence theorist cannot show how the thoughts of
the author can be ABOUT the things in the real world [that is, how the
author's thoughts *refer* to the real world!] without invoking reference
in order to do so.)

In contrast, internalism has none of these problems, since the objects in
question were POSITED to exist in the first place.  For internalism,
"snow" just refers to snow; since we invented "snow" as a theoretical
construct to begin with, that's all you can say on the matter, in the same
sense as the character "7" just refers to the number seven; since we
invented seven to begin with, 7 can't fail to refer to the correct thing.

If the correspondence theory of truth fails, as I believe it does, and all
we have left available to us is rational acceptability, then
Power-intervention may be false in the only notion of true/false that
makes sense.

PS for AI programmers

Eliezer, even if anti-realism isn't the sort of philosophy you'd like to
adopt generally, it nonetheless seems to me that this is exactly the sort
of way that an AI should think about problems: in terms of models which
explain/predict, rather than in terms of reference/correspondence to the
way things "really are."  Having checked out your website a very long time
ago, it seems to me that your approach is similar to this, but all too
often it invokes metaphysical realism to "settle" various questions.

(Take care that you don't interpret my position as being that of the idea
that our "experiences" are all that there "really is," that our models
must correspond to our experiences.  Even the similarity/dissimilarity of
our experiences are posited/constructed by us, though not just any old
conceptual scheme is rationally acceptable.)

If I'm right, then this appeal to metaphysical realism will get your AI in
big trouble if it ever starts wondering about the problem of
aboutness/reference and doesn't stumble upon anti-realism.  If it
concludes that its own thoughts have NO aboutness, it may shut down and go
quiet.  Starting with anti-realism (and then allowing for the rational
possibility of rejecting it later, as should be the case for all of your
initial instructions) may avert that possibility before it happens.

Well, my above paragraph works in that case too. After all, maybe the
universe doesn't have a *good* reason?

I'm reminded a bit of the civilization mentioned briefly in Vinge's _A
Fire Upon the Deep_ that was created as a joke by a transcendant
power. Maybe the universe is a bad joke? Maybe we want to escape into
real literature?

I think the third kind of replicator is any self propagating pattern in an
artificial context that does not require any human neurons.  The computer virus
fits in this class.  If humans are not required to support the context (Gray
Goo) then I would put it in class four.  If androids dream of electric sheep,
they may be in yet another.

I suggest that those involved with this project convince Dr. Tough to
make up a new web page seeking contact with leprechauns and fairies.
For too long we have had only limited and fragmented contact with the
Little People.  We have much to learn from them, particularly their
almost-magical technologies.  Contact with them would indeed be an
aesthetic and spiritual experience.

Or, even better, why not go straight to the top.  Set up a web page
seeking contact with God Almighty, the King of Kings, the Alpha and the
Omega.  Invite God to establish communication.  Maybe that's all he's
waiting for, just like ET.  It's just as likely to succeed, in my opinion.

Be sure to include helpful mailto: links and phone numbers as was done
for ET.  Wouldn't want the Lord to have to have to hunt through the phone
book.

Now this raises an interesting point regarding "language"
and meanings.  The problem arises when you "overload" a
word.  Are their languages that exist and differentiate
between things like:
 - "the creator of the universe",
 - "the source of all good (or evil)",
 - "the laws that make things go"
 - "the thing that provides the energy for life"
 - "the thing that creates life"
 - "the reason we should be good to one another"
 - "the easiest way to explain to children stuff you can't explain"

Perhaps one problem we have in discussing this stuff is
we have not defined accurately what we are discussing.

At least when I say 1 + 1 = 2, people know what I'm talking
about (unless you grew up in BinaryLand, then 1 + 1 = 10).

Anders, you devil you, what an interesting question.

Genes are hardware (at least in this computer simulation)
Memes are software (virtual-hardware, soft-hardware?)
What is virtual-software, soft-software?

I'd have to cast one vote for that age-old nemesis of the computer
software industry: vaporware!

It has to be something that you think you have to have and although
it never arrives, it has a demonstrable effect on the things around it.

Another possibility would be a self-modifying programs that replicate
which sounds a lot like ALife.

However I'm not really satisfied with either of these ideas.
This needs more development.

Hello everyone,

It has been about ten years at least since I last saw "Life of Brian" so I 
will have to do it again.  I remember seeing it with a group of my fellow 
Mormon missionaries on our day off to relax and do chores!  I don't recall 
it being blasphemous, just irreverant.

I have never seen "Name of the Rose" with Sean Connery.  I have always meant 
to but never get around to it.  I must make amends.

For those of you who love a good historical mystery I recommend the "Brother 
Cadfael" series.  This is topnotch television viewing with the title role 
played by the very gifted actor Derek Jocobi.  Brother Cadfael is a monk and 
former crusader who uses critical thinking to solve crimes and murders 
during the medeival age.  He is a man out of time in a sense.


Sincerely,

John Grigg

I'm not sure that memes are qualitatively different from genes in the
way we often think.  Both can be thought of as patterns in the physical
world.

Genes are patterns of nucleotides in DNA molecules.  The molecules
engage in chemical reactions such that they replicate and preserve
their patterns.

Memes are patterns of neural configurations in people's brains.
The physical substance of the brains engages in activity such that
patterns in one person's brain come to be copied analogously in another
person's brain, such as when an idea is verbally passed from one person
to the other.

The difference, then, is in where the pattern lies, as well as in
the physical mechanism by which the pattern comes to be replicated.
It ought to be possible to identify other instances in which patterns
of matter come to be copied in other matter, and these would then be
other candidates for the genes/memes continuum.

One of the old hypotheses for the formation of life was by Cairns-Smith,
who proposed that patterns in clay crystals would replicate.  Clays
sometimes exist in moving water which continually dissolves them away in
some places while adding new material in other places.  The new material
tends to copy the patterns of the existing clay substrate, in terms of
defects and layers with slightly different properties.  Such patterns would
then be candidates as replicators beyond genes.

In our own bodies, there are speculative theories of non-genetic
replicators, called prions.  These are supposed to be protein molecules
which exist naturally in the body but which have a specific harmful
configuration which is different from their benign configuration.
Somehow molecules which get into the harmful configuration are able to
trigger other molecules also to adopt that harmful shape, leading to the
progression of the disease.  "Mad cow" disease has been proposed to be
caused by this mechanism.  However I don't believe this theory has ever
been validated.

Some forms of inheritance might be neither genetic nor memetic.  For
example, if the father is a coal miner, his sons may become coal miners
simply because that is the most economically attractive option available.

Some drug addicts give birth to drug-addicted babies.  If such babies are
more likely to grow up to be drug addicts themselves, then this could
be a replicated pattern which would not be memetic, since it would be
based on physiological changes in the body, but not genetic either,
since the genome is not involved.

At sports events, it used to be popular to do "the wave", where spectators
would stand and sit in a rhythmic pattern, making a wave of standing
people move around the stadium.  This was not a memetic replicator in
the way that, say, a popular song would be, but rather it was simply a
form of behavior which produced this continually replicating pattern.

I think if you look around you can identify many other instances in which
patterns replicate without the direct intervention of genes or memes.

Lojban <http://www.lojban.org> avoids polysemy by having inclusive
root words whose meanings can be narrowed by nonce coinings according
to specific rules.  Thus, one can use the word "cevni" when you don't
need to be specific about what kind of god you're talking about, but
when you want to narrow things down you can refer to "mu'ezbacei"
(universe-creating god), "vu'emi'ecei" (virtue-commanding god), or
"nalselri'agaucei" (agentive cause of non-physically-caused things
god) as the need arises, and the word-coining rules of the language
make the interpretation of these coinages reasonably straightforward.
Conversation about these complex coinages can then be simplified by
assigning pronouns to them that persist over whole conversations.

I think the general consensus among doctors today is that the
prion model is correct, and that it causes BSE, CJD, Kuru, and
Scrapie (in sheep).  It was controversial as late as 1995, but
Nobel prizes and good test results can be pretty convincing.

This is how I'm interpreting the experiment (please correct
me if I'm wrong):  When they saw activity that they
considered a 'presponse' they put a little tick in the
'presponse' box, and if they saw no such ativity they put a
little tick in the 'no presponse' box, and then added them
all up in the end.  Actually, I don't see a way you could
make this into an experiment.  I must be missing something.

This is better.  But the only way I can see the data being
pure is to show only one image to each person, otherwise
each 'presponse' can be attributed to the previous response.

It doesn't seem to me that this reasoning leads to the right answer, though:

Someone comes to me and tells me a story of a woman floating in the air,
brilliant lights shining all around her.  I am very skeptical about this
and tend to believe it is not a true story.  Then I learn that the woman
was on a stage, and standing beside her was a magician waving his wand.
Now the story becomes much more plausible, because now I can see that
there are technological means which would accomplish what earlier sounded
like something which would defy the laws of physics.

In the Matrix, if someone tells me that they say a person leap 50 feet
through the air, I would be inclined not to believe him, if I thought
the world was "real".  But if the Matrix Hypothesis were proven, I would
change my view and I would say that this is a very real possibility.
Such things are possible in the Matrix, but not in the real world.

In each case, I gain knowledge which turns the event from an effective
impossibility into something which is technologically possible.  This
forces me to re-evaluate the probability of whether it occured.

A priori, if I hear that Jesus healed cripples with a touch or walked
on water, I find this to be virtually impossible to believe.  However,
if I come to believe that aliens were present on the earth at the time
who had the technology to accomplish this, it forces me to give a much
higher degree of credibility to the story.  It is no longer impossible,
it no longer defies the laws of nature.

I don't understand this notion of "ideal epistemic conditions", but it
seems to me that accepting the presence of super-advanced technology
forces us to give credibility to otherwise impossible tales.

That's and interesting thought.  The problem is what  would the substrate be?

The substrate for the biological replicator(gene) is protein.

The substrate for the information replicator(meme) is data <thoughts, tunes, 
etc, etc>...but this substrate requires the first substrate in order to 
exist.  Or one similar. 

 Interestingly memes can exist in TWO substrates.   Both human brains and 
'dead storage" (books, and various media and computers).

I wonder if a meme existing in a computer is the same as that 'same' meme 
existing in a brain?  Or are they two different critters.  Are there in fact 
three different replicators?  Or two replicators with one having two sub 
types?

Anyway.....what would the substrate be for the "descendent" of meme's?

Note that memes don't RUN on genes, they run on the machinery which genes
"know" how to build, our brains.  So extending the metaphor leads one to
the obvious conclusion that the next thing will not run on our brains, but
on the machinery which our brains figure out how to build: thus, SIdeas
will become the next level. (SInes?)

A good point raised in Kevin Kelley's _Out of Control_, however, is that
memes don't obey the same sort of rules that genes do; if anything, they
evolve in a much more Lamarckian way than genes, since individuals can
make intentional changes to their memes rather than random changes which
simply turn out to have beneficial changes.  (Or, on another similar
picture, memes are gene-like, varying randomly, but most variations
usually die in our individual heads before they are copied to other
people.)  On account of this, I find the predictive power of memes to be
pretty poor.

The next step in this slippery slope is to say that the aliens are here,
silently monitoring us, but as each person dies they take a snapshot of
his brain state and take him off to live a new life elsewhere, one free
of trouble and pain, until they can be rejoined with their loved ones.

This addresses the moral issue in a very familiar manner, one which has
been taught in Sunday schools for centuries.

A list of "or"-ed alternatives is an attempt to outline the possibilities
from which (given an Eliezer framework) one begins to assign probabilities.

No.  *Only* if they want an experiment where the dumb-ones (us) think
they are at the top of the tree of life would they consciously hide from
us.  Now, if they are in a situation where they want to increase diversity
in the universe (suppress convergent evolution due to meme sharing) then
they may do this.

What I do lean towards is -
 - interstellar colonization is of very small marginal benefit
   (so it only occurs rarely and proceeds slowly)
 - SIs evolve towards the most efficient structures possible.
 - If some SIs do evolve an aggressive consumption strategy then
   that explains galactic voids & walls

SIs don't go out of their way to be "invisible", they are "invisible"
because the most efficient structures are those that radiate their waste
heat at the lowest possible temperature.  This is evolution to the
limits of physics.

I'm not sure why you think I'm taking this position.  I would argue that
(a) they do disassemble solar systems;
(b) that galaxy consumption/optimization is variable depending on some
    initial conditions (as Eliezer has discussed);
(c) that our galaxy is by and large a Kardashev Type III civilization
    (with ~90% of the mass astroengineered).

Have we?  Most people praying are praying to an omnipotent being.
SIs know they aren't omnipotent, just very very powerful.
What is the point of responding to someone praying if you
are not whom they were praying to?

If we *knew* the wall had nanobot monitors in it then that might be a
good strategy.  Unfortunately we may be dealing with a question of --
Are the majority of people "ready" to accept us?   A responsible
individual never knocks an expression of art off its pedestal
unless it is prepared to catch it before it hits the ground.
SIs could prevent most humans from despair but it would require
a massive intervention that destroyed the experiment.

>

First you *assume* that in sentient species we remain "individuals".
I would argue in the long run that "individuality" may carry a price
we are not willing to bear.  Borg-ites may be a natural choice of
rational thinkers.  Even if you chose to remain individuals you
have to assume that galactic species are "unaware" of the mistakes
made in interference.  If the history of "contact" is littered
with the remains of species whose "will to survive" has been
prematurely ripped away from them, then *rational* species will chose
to avoid such contact.

I would hope that natural selection and species evolution favors
"rationality" over "irrationality".  If it doesn't I fear we are
doomed.

Huh?  That isn't my impression.  If you lose even 1 culture because
it discovers itself to be woefully inferior does that justify the
marginal advancement of 10 other cultures?  There may be something about
this point that I just don't see, if so please be more explanatory.

Ultimately contact involves the meeting of different social, developmental
levels and philosophical perspectives.  It would seem that the probability
for "mistakes" could exceed the probability for "success".  In that case
contact should be avoided and any "justified" miracles should be "cloaked".

> If primitive sentient life has value then allowing primitives to die while

I've discussed this before (within the last week or two) with regard to
male dolphins raping female dolphins.  Morality seems to be *highly* "level
of development" and "environment" specific.  You cannot extrapolate our moral
perspective to the realm of SIs.  What you view as immoral, SIs may
view as natural selection.  Would you argue natural selection is immoral?

> If primitive sentient life does not have value then why not convert the

What is "value"???  A new supercomputer in a galaxy filled with 200 billion
of them?  Give me a break.  Only if the marginal benefit of ~1/10^11
of what you have is better than some unknown proability of developing
something you don't have (or don't know you don't have) does this make
sense.

> Either way, you don't get the world we live in.

Perhaps.  But I'm not saying "this is the way it is".  I'm saying
"this is the way it might be" and people ought to seriously look
at it and raise questions about the way they have traditionally
perceived things.

The only way the Prime Directive works is if you assume the first
species to attain power imposed the Prime Directive by force on all
other species.

This may well be the case, but if so, then I think Eliezer was probably
wrong in saying that he should continue to ascribe "miracle" claims to
human legend rather than to intervention, in the case where the Matrix
Hypothesis turned out to be the case.

The problem with Putnam's theory is that you can't get humans, capable
of *forming* models, without a pre-existing reality to create them.  So
internalism doesn't strike me as being very self-consistent.  In my
philosophy, which is called "Externalism" for a very good reason,
external reality predated humans, who evolved to model that reality. 
You can't "prove" reference, of course, because if that were true our
thoughts would define reality.  (And of course, I don't believe in
instantiation, especially of Turing-computable behaviors, but that's not
the point.)

To me, this sounds like another version of that old dilemna of "How do
you prove that rational thought works without assuming the rational
processes you use for the proof?"  Or in other words, "How do you

The internalist theory of proof is false.  Given time and money, it
would actually be fairly easy to set up a situation where the most
rational explanation is the false one, a situation where Occam's Razor
doesn't work.  For example, I found my copy of "True Names and Other
Dangers", which I'd been looking for for three years, when I went back
to the bookstore to return nine dollars they undercharged me.  Now,
while Occam's Razor says this was a coincidence and not a causal effect
of my charity, I hope, it would be easy to target someone else looking
for a book, pay the store owner to undercharge ver, and then have the
book there when ve returned.  Occam's Razor says it's a coincidence, but
in reality, it's not.

Well, last time I checked L&F were supposed to be "magical" creatures
and that would probably violate some basic perspectives I would like

creatures, then your suggestion would certainly have some merit.  :-)

Oh, but there are fundamental problems with this.  If "God" tunneled
into this universe during the big bang, he may not have established
a coherent pattern capable of a reponse yet.  If "God" is running
us as an experiment, a response would presumably violate the protocols
and void the results.  If "God" is the supercomputer running our
reality, then he would simply be ROTFL.  If s/he has a really sadistic
side, then s/he will probably broadcast the man page documentation for our
reality "debugger" over the internet but add an addemdum that we *all*
have to *believe* before the terminal appears on which debugger commands
can be entered.

So, Hal you have to "believe", then I can do:

Sorry, I meant `consolidated' not `concatenated' - that is, they combined
the curves gathered over many trials and screened out the random variations
and noise. The composite curves then showed this apparent prodromal effect.

The details can be found in Radin's paper, which might be accessible at his
web site. 

The method, roughly, is to show a series of bland images, to accustom the S
to the task and establish a baseline, then to flash the test image
somewhere randomly between the fourth and tenth images, say. And of course,
there are many Ss, and their runs are consolidated. The aggregated GSR
scores for the test items show a small bur significant surge in advance of
presentation, compared with the background scores for non-target images (I
simplify). Yes, there can then be `Gambler's Fallacy' expectation effects
with confounding consequences, but the experimenters have allowed for this
in their statistical analysis. Obviously, though, this will be the point at
which skepticism will bear down hardest (unless it is assumed from the
outset that the entire endeavour must be bogus - which is why it is
interesting to examine existing data from earlier, non-parapsychological
experiments open to retrospective analysis of such effects..  as is being
done even as we speak).

I have had dreams where I am flying through the air but they are quite a bit 
different then what most people have.  In these dreams I can see myself 
flying in a rather uncomfortable position.  My back is arched with my head 
back and my arms are straight and tensed behind me.  It takes all my 
concentration to maintain altitude and when I lose confidence or focus I 
begin to rapidly drop.  I travel through the air not too far over housetops 
in a jerky manner.  It is not a pleasant and easy way to dream about flying!

Hal, what a great idea!!  So the SIs can run the experiment untroubled
by the moral implications that allowing information to decay into
dust violates the commonly accepted standards of "Mind Ethics".

All they require is sufficient storage for the offline copies.
That of course raises an interesting question -- with a saved
mind copy, you may be obligated to "preserve" it, but are you
obligated to "run" it?

Hello everyone,

Things are getting very exciting around here with news of  breakthroughs 
done by Dr. Ken Diller to preserve organs for transplant (see below courtesy 
of Alex Berg) 
http://www.engr.utexas.edu/comm/newsletter/alumni_fall98/diller.htm
and also major advances happening in the area of molecular switches(thanks 
John Clark)!

Given time we are gonna have A.I.'s up and running along with people getting 
suspended with a damn good chance of being brought back with no damage!  I 
feel like the world is catching up with us!  I'M EXCITED!!  :)

Now all I want is my own affordable Moller skycar to zip around in.

... and this example in no way makes your case.  Indeed, I almost wonder
if there hasn't been a communications error if you think this justifies
your position.  Putnam's internalism in NO way requires me to believe that
your paying the store owner was a coincidence.

I mean, for crying out loud: you think that it is RATIONAL to believe that
your returning the nine dollars was an act of charity, yes?  Thus, the
rationally acceptable belief here is that your act was an act of charity,
not that it was a coincidence!

(Indeed, it makes me wonder what notion of rationality you adhere to if
you believe that it's rational to believe that coincidence is the
explanation here, and not charity.)

Putnam's internalism merely GOES ON to say that the very fact that it is
rationally acceptable to believe that P is what makes P true.

What's the problem?

And?  Putnam would agree with that, he'd simply point out that we have
POSITED the existence of a real world with real people in it in order to
explain/predict our experiences.

With that having been said, I (as well as Putnam) believe that it is the
case that we have posited correctly, that is, there certainly IS a real
world, with real people in it, etc.  By that I mean that the above claims
are certainly all rationally acceptable under ideal epistemic conditions.

Putnam is NOT saying that there is no real world; that would be rationally
unacceptable, after all!  He is, however, saying that truth does not
consist in corresponding to the "real world," but in idealized rational
acceptability.

Speaking as a self-affirmed internalist, your "externalism" seems like an
extremely reasonable model of the world; so reasonable, in fact, that I
ALSO believe that it is the case!

Your position in no way disagrees with Putnam's internalism.  Internalism
simply specifies the conditions under which externalism would turn out to
be true.

I'm not sure what you mean by this...  I don't recall any mention of this
particular snippet online.  What DO you mean by it?

Not really, though that's certainly an interesting question.  I'll
probably go take a look at your TMOL page in a few minutes.

Only to a limited degree.  I grant the probabilities on my suggestions
seem to be very small indeed.  But to someone living in the 14th
century the probability of the planets revolving around the sun
or planes carrying people in the sky would seem very small as well.

The problem with probability assessments is that many of them
depend on the knowledge implicit in your reality.  It may turn
out that the gravitational microlensing obervations *are* explained
by mini-black holes in association with large molecular gas clouds
(one proposed solution), if so we are going to have to adjust our
universe view because we do not have a mechanism for creating such
a highly arbitrary solution.  As you have said, "Truth" doesn't care.

We don't know the limts to evolution.  I can only draw one reasonable
line in the sand and say, "What would things look like if these were
the real limits?".

What if the Universe runs on a set of laws that are as "editable"
as the genetic program you run on?  The "reality" 15 years ago
was that you couldn't even *read* a genetic program, much less
edit it.  If you had asked a average collection of scientists in
1985 whether we would be able to create synthetic bacteria
they would have laughed at the question.  Yet we are on the
brink of that today.   If you go back 40+ years and asked
if we could "read" genomes, they would have laughed as well.

The entire point being that what you *believe* in is highly
context dependent.  If you cannot point out clearly and concretely
where something violates the laws of physics (and that the laws
of physics are immutable) then you had better allow for the
"improbable" being "possible".  As a side note, if the
expansion of the universe does turn out to be slowing down
it would be an "interesting" crack in the wall of the time
invariance of the "laws" of physics.

I question whether these motives could be enforced over
interstellar distances.

The concept of God has appeared over and over again, with many different
interpretations.  What makes the atheists different, is that instead of
redefining the concept of God, they get disagreeable.

If your god is rationality, popular opinion, money, drugs, or sports.  Just
say so.  But don't fool yourself into thinking that we are without our petty
gods.

Population control is part of what happened.  There is plenty of room for
people to live without the domed cities and moon colonies.

Emblematically (since They might be impelled by aesthetic whimsies as
readily as by economic imperatives), here's a fragment from STUCK IN FAST
FORWARD by me and Rory Barnes (HarperCollins Australia 1999):

=======

Now the sun was definitely brighter.  In the year 2,173,698,172 its furnace
was burning harder, and according to Daddy it was more than ten percent
hotter than in our own time.  We stood just outside the lava face of the
vacuole, shading our eyes.  Early morning clouds were wispy and very white.
 We had run down our supplies of water, so we went looking for a stream,
carrying a plastic bucket and a couple of bottles with screw-tops.  Dad set
up his solar panels to refresh our battery supplies, and listened across
the radio spectrum.  Nothing at all.  The earth was empty again.

That night's gorgeous pastel sunset took at least an hour to fade, so Dad
said we'd obviously floated a long way on the local continental plate, well
down below the tropics again.  But the wait for nightfall was worth it.

`Oh my god,' Dad said, as the first stars began to prick out in the heavens.

`Funny way to set up your satellites,' I muttered.  I'd just finished off
the last chocolate bar from our stores, and so I was feeling rather grumpy.
 I licked my lips regretfully, looking up at the pattern emerging overhead.
 `They must have built more of those orbital rings and stuck them
everywhere.  You'd think they'd bang into each other.'

`Not satellites, darling.  Those are stars,' Daddy said, and came and sat
down beside me on a shelf of cooling rock, putting his arm around me
tightly.  `That's what they've done to the stars.'

I didn't understand, and then I did, and my heart jumped and my
chocolate-lined stomach did a little terrified spasm.

The sky was a vast curving criss-cross grid of points of hard light, like
atoms seen from inside a crystal.

All my life, the stars had been scattered across the heavens pretty much at
random, except for the blurry band of the Milky Way.  Oh, you could pick
out the odd bright constellation - the Southern Cross, with its Pointers,
Orion and its Belt - but I'd always known that they were just a kind of
game or trick the mind played on itself.  Actually, the stars that seemed
to make up a cross or a belt were usually many hundreds of light years
apart, in the depths of space.  It was only from earth that they formed the
patterns we chose to call constellations.

Not this lot.  Oh, no.

Someone had actually revised the sky.  Somebody had come in and moved the
stars around.  Some Mind had reached out and flicked the billions of
burnings suns of the Milky Way as if they were some kid's marbles.

`A moir pattern,' Dad mused.

`A what?'  I looked at the changed universe with deep horror, but also with
a wild wonderment.  What kinds of beings could do something like this?  Fi
and I were raised with no religion, but this kind of caper made you think
of the myths and legends of Greece and Rome, gods who built the sky and
could change it with the jab of a finger.  But those old-fashioned gods
were stuck on a flat earth under a sky where the sun was thought to spin
about the world, not the other way around.  Those old story-tellers had no
idea how far away the stars were, or how big suns are.

`It's a spherical grid,' Dad was saying in a frail voice, `all the stars
have been moved to locations at regular intervals on a series of concentric
spheres,' but I hardly heard a word.  I just looked and looked, and you
could see places where the spots of brilliance ran together, which was just
where the lanes of light overlapped in the endless dark deeps of galactic
space.  The Milky Way itself was gone, its billions of stars relocated into
the grand crazy rational design.  But you could pick out the core of the
galaxy, because that was the brighter place that the endless onion skins of
stars wrapped themselves around.

`Wow,' I said.  `Oh, wow.'

===========

Horse puckies.  I'm surprised that you would make such a statement.
Convergent conclusion (evolution) is an equally valid way to
get to the prime directive.  If the galaxy is rife with
broadcasts (directed at emerging species) of "The History
of Failed Contacts" then "rational" species would never attempt
contact.  (Or the might attempt one or two to confirm that
the broadcasts are accurate).

You don't go out into the environment and see hyenas attempting to
take down lions.  Why?  Because it simply doesn't work in
the average case.  If knowledge of the average case not
working is available, and civilizations trust it, then
they will not attempt the average case.

For the Prime Directive *not* to be "in practice" you have
to make a very strong case that the overlords can "salvage"
a contacted species without "poisoning" it.  If you destroy its
will to survive/evolve (because of an awareness of how
pointless it is) then you do not want contact.  If you
do have contact and they are aware of it, how do you
salvage the goals of "uninfluenced" evolution?

The "Prime Directive" is not so easily circumvented as you might
like and may be a very natural conclusion by rational thinkers.

The thought has occurred to me.

And that's exactly why this *is* a significant probability, albeit not
one that much affects the choices I make.  If the Prime Directive is
psychologically plausible, so is mind-state preservation.  In fact, I
would argue that they're more plausible together than they are apart. 
Given the number of people on this list who insist that Powers (AI,
upload, whatever... Powers are Powers) can be preprogrammed, or retain
their human motives, don't you think that the tremendous mortal-level
emotional attractiveness of mind-state preservation makes it one of the
most likely motives for a persistent-motive Power to have?

Of course, I personally don't care much about such things; in fact, I
think I may actively dislike the whole concept, since what I *do* care
about is a no-holds-barred Singularity, while *this* scenario implies
that the first race to get there imposed limits on everyone else.  I
know that if my desires were given free reign, there wouldn't be any
damn Prime Directive anywhere that people were suffering.

And before you ask:  No, I don't care how the concept has been abused in
the past.  I do my own navigation, and what other people think doesn't
enter into it, either way.

I was gaacking at the whole concept of what you believe being influenced
by what you want to believe.  This may happen to our teeny mortalminds
but we don't have to like it, or accept it, or permit it to persist
after we've noticed it.

"Enforced?"  There is no enforcement.  There is only lack of resistance.
 If there are no forces that interfere with the initial programming,
then the motives are eternal.

No, no!  Not that returning the money was a coincidence; finding the
book I was looking for, after around 30 unsuccessful visits, during a
charitable act, was coincidence.

Are you arguing that since the "God" concept has been with us for so long, we are stuck with it and that all of our actitivities must forevermore be filed under "merely serving yet another petty god". This seems demonstrably false.
For example if I am "devoted" to making tons of money in the stock markets and I spent inordinate amounts of time poring over "sacred texts" such as the Wall Street Journal and Business Week, does that make me just like an east Tennesee rattlesnake handler who does this to prove his faith in the Lord? Does it make me just like a Muslim bowing and praying towards Mecca a few times a day?
Are you saying I have replaced belief in one toothfairy by the belief in another toothfairy?
Surely you can't equate rational thinking and scientific progress as just another "petty god"?
If one has made certain rational choices about how to live life, why denigrate it by saying we are fooling ourselves with "petty gods"?

Create some new categories how-about-it?

Behold, I shall now rain on thy parade.

"There was once a race that spent most of its resources in devising a
means by which a star may be moved.  This they learned how to do, and
did.  They rearranged some of the constellations seen from their home
planet.  How this was done is unknown.  The motive was not religious or
superstitious in nature, but derived chiefly from esthetic concerns..."

I wasn't claiming priority in this instance. How could I, when Arthur
Clarke did the star-shunting for visual effect so beautifully in THE CITY
AND THE STARS back in the '50s? (And probably Olaf Stapledon did it much
earlier, I can never get through his majestic but tedious tomes.)

OK, gotcha.  Now that I better understand what you're saying, I realize
that not only is this not a refutation of internalism, Putnam covers a
case *exactly* like this in his book.  I'll quote, since I don't feel
inspired this evening.

--------

"To reject the idea that there is a coherent 'external' perspective, a
theory which is simply true 'in itself', apart from all possible
observers, is not to *identify* truth with rational acceptability.  Truth
cannot simply *be* rational acceptability for one fundamental reason;
truth is supposed to be a property of a statement that cannot be lost,
whereas justification can be lost.  Thee statement 'The earth is flat'
was, very likely, rationally acceptable 3,000 years ago; but it is not
rationally acceptable today.  Yet it would be wrong to say that 'the earth
is flat' was *true* 3,000 years ago; for that would mean that the earth
has changed its shape. ... "

"What this shows, in my opinion is not that the externalist [here, he
means metaphysical realist] view is right after all, but that truth is an
*idealization* of rational acceptability.  We speak as if there were such
things as epistemically ideal conditions, and we call a statement 'true'
if it would be justified under such conditions.  'Epistemically ideal
conditions' of course, are like 'frictionless planes': we cannot really
attain epistemically ideal conditions, or even be absolutely certain that
we have come sufficiently close to them.  But frictionless planes cannot
really be attained either, and yet talk of frictionless planes has 'cash
value' because we can approximate them to a very high degree fo
approximation."

---------

In your example, in which you have a windfall at the same time as you
perform an act of charity, it is rationally acceptable to believe that the
windfall was a coincidence.  However, you're right, it could well be the
case that the windfall was NOT a concidence.  If we accept internalism,
then all this means is that, under ideal epistemic conditions, (for
example, you being aware of this fellow who tries to reward people for
acts of charity,) it would NOT be rationally acceptable to believe that it
was a coincidence.

According to my current favorite model of my experiences, "ideal epistemic
conditions" is the situation in which you know everything you can know
about the "real world."  In this case, the words "real world" refer to a
theoretical construct in my mind, which in turn is part of a theory which,
I find, correctly explains/predicts my experiences.

Just as it WAS rationally acceptable to believe that the earth was flat
back when nobody knew better, so in the imagined scenario would it be
reasonable to believe that your finding the book was sheer coincidence.
This does not mean that the above claims are true, even under an
internalist "idealized justification" view.

Hal pointed out that I may have misapplied the doctrine in the case of the
Matrix Hypothesis.  My whole point was to show that if you would act as if
the Matrix Hypothesis were false, even if some proof of it were presented
to you, then the Matrix Hypothesis would be the sort of Hypothesis (and
there are very few of these, I think!) which are not rationally acceptable
under any circumstances.  Some examples of hypotheses like these are:  "I
do not exist," "the real world does not exist," "my actions have no impact
on the real world or on myself," etc.  If the Matrix Hypothesis is not
acceptable under any circumstances, then it is not acceptable under ideal
epistemic conditions, and thus it is false.

(I feel quite certain that the claim: "I am living in a Matrix world, but
the creators of the Matrix have never intervened and never will" is false
in the manner I've described.)

BTW, I'm almost inclined to say that you can't HELP but install a
world-view like this into an AI, since the anti-realist/internalist theory
of reference is EASILY explained to an AI.  It's so easy, in fact, that
you may accidentally wind up coding your AI in an internalist way when you
had MEANT to code it to be a metaphysical realist!

Under anti-realism, the internal symbol "ball" simply refers to the
internal theoretical construct of a ball.  Any theory which incorporates
this term must correctly explain/predict the AI's experiences, which are
*also* internal.  Adopting a realist approach would require you to CODE IN
an idea of the real world, and explain to it how the internal symbols
refer to the real world out there.  Unfortunately, this approach, as I've
argued, must necessarily fail, unless you're going to code in a "because I
say so!" theory of reference.  And, of course, if you accidentally code up
the words "real world" to refer to the AI's internal theoretical construct
of the "real world," then you've accidentally coded an anti-realist AI.  
As Putnam put it:  "Since the objects [of reference] *and* the signs are
both internal to the scheme of description, it is possible to say what
matches what.  Indeed, it is trivial to say what any word refers to
*within* the language the word belongs to, by using the word itself.  
What does 'rabbit' refer to?  Why, to rabbits, of course!  What does
'extraterrestrial' refer to?  To extraterrestrials (if there are any)."

I presented an example similar to this when I said that the character 7
simply referred to that theoretical invention of ours, the number seven.
So with the real world, balls, horses, etc.  Each of these words refers to
internal theoretical constructs; we judge the theories based on their
explanatory/predictive value.

Standard apres-Sausurre poststructural (Derridean/Lacanian) analysis might
cast this in terms of signifiers, signifieds and (inaccessible) referents,
with many signifieds being, in turn, signifiers pointed to by other
signifiers.  Rudely: signifier = word, signified = concept, referent =
thing in the word that the concept stands in for, to some degree of
adequacy. A symbol is a seamless blend of signifier and signified.

In practice, referents often seem to drop out of this account. Putnam's
version, as Dan describes it, seems to work the same way.

I assume a cog sci/neurosci account would want some more hidden layers. Dan
says:

>Under anti-realism, the internal symbol "ball" simply refers to the
>internal theoretical construct of a ball.  

Here, a poststruck account would presumably say that the signifier `ball'
(whether inwardly thought or uttered aloud/written) stands in for the
signified <ramified concept of a ball>. The cog sci equivalent, I assume,
would be the neural attractor or web synaptically activated by most
situations that involve either the idea of a ball or the perception of an
actual or represented ball in the outside world.

I conclude that Putnam and poststructuralism offer a story that's not as
ridiculous as it first sounds (and is similar to Humberto Maturana's,
perhaps), 

[ e.g., http://www.oikos.org/maten.htm   ]

but both risk losing their grip on/need for access to a genuine referent
out there (whatever that means in a QT/relativistic universe).

Posted to ICANN 11.02.99

Phil Osborn, netizen
philosborn@hotmail.com

I attended the Sunday Workshop sponsored by the Berkman Center. At Sunday's 
end, I pointed out the inadequacies of the proposed voting model.  First, it 
excludes the majority constituency by default.  Most people are not on line, 
yet are impacted by ICANNs policies re future access.  On the other hand, 
the stake in the internet
varies, so why should everyone get an equal vote?

I prefaced this with - "who owns the internet?"  The tragedy of the commons 
looms, with all the possible related disasters discussed earlier on Sunday: 
intractable conflicts of interest, covert subversion/capture of ICANN by 
special interests, simple Board incompetence, etc.

I pointed out that perhaps a better solution is to create natural incentives 
as exist when those with a stake also have control.  Why not make ICANN a 
shareholding trust, with domain name holders getting one voting share each?  
Why not make it a profit-making trust, owned by the world?  Where then the 
conflict of interest?  With Martians?

There are many possibilities for structuring such an organization to avoid 
problems: capture by special-interest coalitions, monopoly-pricing concerns. 
  There is, however, a false premise implicit here.

ICANN does not have a true monopoly.  There is nothing preventing 
competitors from setting up their own systems of naming, and they have, are, 
and will be doing so, from AOL to company intranets.  A country wishing to 
keep its citizens isolated and controlled could set up an incompatible 
naming system, even incorporating
high-level state-enforced encryption to keep all communications segregated 
to that jurisdiction.

Should ICANNs pricing or regulation of domain name assignment become too 
onerous, anyone could start another internet, offering their own unique 
naming system, with all kinds of built-in features - e.g., backlinks as in 
Xanadu, or credibility-based filtering matrices, as I have suggested for 
decades, or a real social contract, as I have pushed since the 70s - and 
surely with transparent links to
ICANNs version.

The bugaboos of ICANN taking over the world for the Borg or becoming so 
dispute-mired that it can no longer function are perhaps less important 
considerations than the potential benefits of doing things right.  If the 
current proposed structures are implemented, then perhaps they will work 
well enough.  There are many very good
people involved who are dedicated to that goal, and often good people of 
common will can surmount structural problems and stand fast against evil.

I would hope, however, that participants might think of themselves as 
sorcerers, as in Another Roadside Attraction, i.e., as those who deal with 
sources.  We all can recall numerous cases - any major computer hardware/OS 
design - verifying that an organization's founding forever determines its 
potential, its strengths, its weaknesses.
Let us not merely accept what might work.  Muddling through may make it for 
now, but it sets a poor standard.  As sorcerers we should aim higher - add 
some real magic.

Good deal!  If they are ready in 10-20, that fits my definition of
"threshold of a dream."  We will never see anything like the horrifying
first world war again.   Huge armies are more of a liability than an asset.
Infantry would be a special team of highly trained people with lotsa
high tech gear and an intense focus.

> The ability to bomb enemy leaders is not the same as the ability to kill

Ja.  What I have in mind is surgical damage to the enemy infrastructure,
that disables communication, command and control, in such a way that
repair is easy after the short war is over.  When all is said and done, a
war could conceivably be fought with few or perhaps no casualties.

Consider the threads that were going around here six months ago
regarding planes dropping a webby substance, and some were
arguing about what it could be.  Turns out it was carbon filaments,
dropped in exploding cannisters that would drift down and short
out power lines.  Now *thats* my kinda war!

> Planes cannot capture terrain, they can

This *assumes* terrain must be taken and held.  Of course this is the
way it has *always* been done, but I urge you to ask yourself why
exactly this is necessary.  I can imagine many scenarios in which a
technologically advanced society could get its way, while allowing
the adversary to keep all their terrain, even allow it to imagine itself as
having won the war, yet stop whatever behaviour that we found
objectionable to start with.

Since the *real* currency of our times is information, the whole notion
of capturing dirt seems absurd.  Please someone more advanced
than me, chip in here and extrapolate forward.  spike

Aubrey de Grey is a learned, innovative and superbly graceful writer on the
topic of aging, and an acknowledged expert researcher at Cambridge
University. His long-awaited book is now out.

He writes:
============================================
"The Mitochondrial Free Radical Theory of Aging",
has just become available.  Its details are:


Title:     The Mitochondrial Free Radical Theory of Aging
Author:    Aubrey D.N.J. de Grey
Price:     $89.00 (212pp, hardback)

ISBN:      1-57059-564-X


It is described at amazon.com as to be published in February, but this is
incorrect -- it is available now.  It covers most aspects of mitochondria
and free radicals as they relate to aging, including extensive background
information (enough, I hope, that the scientifically-minded non-biologist
will be able to cope with it).  There is also detailed discussion of some
perhaps-imminently-feasible life-extension interventions.

================

I haven't read it yet, but hope to do so soon.

Putnam's approach is not relativism, though many people who consider
themselves anti-realists are relativists.  For Putnam, "coherence" is the
criterion for evaluating sentences, as is the case for many relativists,
but many of them go on to assume that there is no meaningful notion of
"objective truth," there is only true-for-me, true-for-you,
true-for-Putnam, etc. ie relativized truth.

Putnam, however, argues that there must be some OBJECTIVE notion of
rationality, and on this account, not any old conceptual scheme is
rationally acceptable.  He argues that to reject the idea of objective
rationality would require one to embrace total relativism, a position
which he argues (correctly, I think) is totally incoherent.  "If there is
no conception of rationality one objectively *ought* to have, then the
notion of a 'fact' is empty.  Without the cognitive values of coherence,
simplicity [Ockham's Razor] and instrumental efficacy, we have no world
and no 'facts,' not even facts about what is so *relative* to what, for
those are in the same boat with all other facts."  Under internalism,
truth is the ultimate goodness of fit.

In rejecting total relativism, he provides a rather puzzling argument,
however.  Maybe one of you can sort it out for me.  He bases it on
Wittgenstein's "Private Language" argument, as follows:

"The argument is that the relativist cannot, in the end, make any sense of
the distinction between *being right* and *thinking he is right*; and
that means that there is, in the end, no difference between *asserting* or
*thinking*, on the one hand, and *making noises* (or *producing mental
images*) on the other.  But this means that (on this conception) I am not
a *thinker* at all but a *mere* animal.  To hold such a view is to commit
a sort of mental suicide."

I have no idea how he thinks he can make the leap from ("I think that P"  
<-> P) to meaninglessness, and he appears to leave it undefended.  He
explicitly rejects the argument that the equivalence of "I think that P"
and P requires one to perform it an infinite number of times: "I think
that I think that I think that ... P", but rather only shows that it CAN
be repeated any number of times.

I've guessed that maybe Putnam's argument has something to do with the
fact that in this situation one is speaking in a language in which one
can't ever be wrong, (and thus all sentences have the same cognitive
value,) or perhaps his argument hinges on the fact that sentences no
longer HAVE to be about anything in order to be right.  If anyone can shed
some light on this argument, I'd appreciate it.

Thankfully, he also provides the more conventional arguments against
relativism, which, I think, are pretty palatable to all of us:  "If anyone
really believed that [every conceptual system is just as good as every
other], and if they were foolish enough to pick a conceptual system that
told them they could fly and to act upon it by jumping out of a window,
they would, if they were lucky enough to survive, see the weakness of the
latter view at once." :)

God is an issue of where we apply our faith.

A thousand years ago, and today, a mother with an ill child might pray, an
expression and practice of faith.  She would pray to God, if monotheist, or a
God, if pantheist, or perhaps to the spirits.

Today, besides that, she might make a call to 911 and the miracle of modern
medicine.  So, we see the imbuement of faith to non-spiritual means.  Maybe it
could be called Technos.

People have faith in their habits, normally regularity, and maybe their horse at
the track.  Many espouse spirituality as faith, and religion as a large, well
established part of community and avenue of spiritual expression and
commonality.

Many, probably most, still have some faith in a higher power.

It is impossible to disprove a higher power.  Strict monotheists can still
assign everything to an omniscient, omnipotent God.  It doesn't matter what ever
things are ever scientifically explained that were previously assigned to
miracle.

I don't know if he was particularly extropian, or if Westerns are particularly
extropian, but Louis L'Amour wrote a book _The Lonesome Gods_ which has some
themes of faith transitions, otherwise generally a decent story.

Infinity is a mathematical expression, as well as a slightly different
expression with spiritual aspects.  The limit of 1/d, as d goes to infinity, is
zero.

To each his or her own.

MOON CASTS SHADOW OVER MARS 

     New images from NASA's Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft show 
shadows cast on Mars' surface by the Martian moon Phobos. 

     Global Surveyor's wide-angle cameras, designed to monitor 
changes in Martian weather and surface conditions, are also 
proving to be a good way to spot the frequent solar eclipses that 
occur on Mars when Phobos passes between the red planet and the 
Sun. Phobos is a tiny, potato-shaped moon that is only about 13-
by-11-by-9 kilometers (8-by-7-by-6 miles) in size.
     
     The images are available at  http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov
or http://www.msss.com.

     Mars Global Surveyor is the first mission in a long-term 
program of Mars exploration known as the Mars Surveyor Program 
that is managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for NASA's 
Office of Space Science, Washington, DC. JPL is a division of the 
California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA.

I don't think we can answer this question well until we better understand
the evolutionary *function* of leisure.  Leisure was something we evolved to
like, and I don't buy the "conserve energy while waiting for something to
happen" theory of leisure.  Actual leisure is much more active than this.
So it must have had a more active function in our ancestor's lives.

My current theory is that leisure is mainly about "bonding."  By spending
time with our social allies, we show that it is they who are our allies.
Of course this isn't our conscious motivation; it doesn't have to be.
I also hypothesize that social allies were relatively more valuable in
times of plenty, giving us an evolved tendency to spend more time in
leisure as we get richer.  (This would also explain why we spend more on
useless medicine, if it is a way to show we care.  See
http://hanson.gmu.edu/showcare.pdf or .ps)

So will the people who dominate the future be those who follow their
evolutionary tendency to spend lots of time in leisure, or those who
resist it to spend less time?  Well, according to my theory that depends
on the actual value of social bonding today relative to what we evolved
to expect it to be.  And damned if I know the answer to this.

Well, since memes is stretching an analogy *almost* too far
let's go way over the top and say inanimate objects cause
brains to be inspired by sending their invisible quemes.
The study of quemetics would involve looking at inanimate
objects for long periods of time.

A silly naked assertion.  I'm as militant an atheist as
anyone, but I cannot honestly deny that the "God" concept
is a very useful part of the language, and that it is
likely that our brains have evolved in such a way as to
make it useful, for reasons I can only imagine.  It is a
very convenient way of expressing superlatives, ideals,
unexplained things: God's algorithm, God's intent, acts
of God, God only knows, thank God; these are all useful
expressions that convey their meaning far more clearly
and powerfully than many alternatives.

I think the analogy with "infinity" is perfect: we all
know that infinity doesn't exist either, but it is quite
a useful concept for expressing ideas about the limits of
things.  Similarly, "God" is a useful way of expressing
the ways of the universe by personifying it, much the way
we often personify cars and computers to describe their
behavior.

It is good that we fight dogmatism and irrationality; but
let's not get so hung up on a word that we sacrifice the
elegance and power of the language available to us.

You don't get it, do you?

Okay, let's say the kid asked why the sky was blue,
and you explained it in correct scientific terms,
but he kept saying "why?" to every explanation.
Eventually, you find yourself having to explain
why electrons and photons act the way the do,
why there is an electromagnetic force, etc. And
eventually, you just have to say something like
"that's just the way it is" or "I don't know why."

At the heart of existence is a mystery.

If "God" wasn't useful, people wouldn't use it.

I've been buzy the last two weeks writing a new paper
(http://hanson.gmu.edu/torustwn.pdf or .ps), and just
caught up with this long and interesting discussion
about miracles, and ETIs all around us.

I share Hal's visceral horror of reverting to religion,
but also share Eliezer's insistence that we entertain
any hypothesis, no matter how horrifying.

The main problem with the "ETIs are all around" theories
is that as a whole they fail to predict much of anything.
The alternative class of theories, that the universe is
mostly dead and uncaring, have in contrast led to many
strong predictions, many of which have been dead on.

Postulating a mostly dead universe has led us to expect that
relatively simple mechanisms underly phenomena, and that
these mechanisms are similar across time and space.  While
predictions based on these expectations haven't always been
dead on, on the whole they have been remarkably good.

In the space of all logically imaginable observations, the
dead universe theories have, as a whole, assigned a relatively
high likelihood to data we observed, relative to the data
we did not see.  In Bayesian terms, relative to theories which
don't assign as high a likelihood to to observed data,
our posterior that the right answer is in this theory class
should rise.

In contrast, the class of living universe theories has not,
as a whole, assigned a very high likelihood to the data we
actually observe.  For every more specific theory that predicted
that, say, the allies would win World War II because God is
on their side, another nearly equally plausible theory in
this class predicted the opposite.

This lack of specific predictions seems to result from
saying "they are all powerful and can get whatever they want",
while also being willing to entertain a very wide range of
ideas about what they could want.

I applaud Robert Bradbury's attempt to work some more robust
and specific predictions out of the live universe class of
theories.  I'm not yet convinced he has done so, as it seems
he is so far mostly taking the fact that the universe looks
dead to constrain he theories of a live universe.  But I look
forward to his collecting his ideas into a coherent paper
for us to evaluate.

On the topic of web invitations, I see that some think that
making a web page inviting ETIs to visit might make such
visits more likely.  But I can equally entertain the idea that
it might make them *less* likely to visit.  So I can't support
the effort.

Gold, in http://www.people.cornell.edu/pages/tg21/usgs.html claims otherwise:

"It was quickly ascertained that just the area of the Siljan structure was
quite anomalously rich in soil
methane and other light hydrocarbons, that many ordinary water wells produced
copious amounts of
gas and that a number of stone quarries in the area had oil seeping out of the
rocks and making oil
pools in the ground. It is true that the stone quarries were in the
sedimentary rock which fills a ring
shaped depression, but those sediments are nowhere deeper than 300 meters. Oil
seepage generated
after 360 million years from such a small quantity of sediments seemed
improbable. Aside from the
ring shaped depression, the basement rock is very close to the surface in the
whole area; there is
barely enough soil for the trees to grow both inside and outside the Siljan
Ring feature.

As a result of the clear demonstration that the area was quite anomalous for
its hydrocarbon content,
it was decided to engage in a major drilling operation. Since 1986 two wells
have been drilled: one to
a depth of 6.7 kilometers, the other to a depth of 6.5 kilometers. Both holes
showed the presence of
methane and of other hydrocarbon gases, as well as of crude oil. While in the
first hole (Gravberg I)
diesel oil was used for a time as a component of the drilling mud, only
water-based mud was used in
the second hole (Stenberg 1), which is situated in the center of the ring, and
is 12 km distant from the
ring sediments, and also from Gravberg 1. Although the detailed chemical
makeup of the oil found at
deep levels in Gravberg was not the same as diesel oil, many considered
nevertheless that the diesel
drilling oil could be held responsible. Some 15 tons of oil were pumped up,
oil that had hydrocarbon
components and organo-metallic compounds that are frequently in natural crude
oils, but were absent
or present only in very much lower abundance in any of the drilling fluids...

The scientific investigations carried out on products of the two holes have
thus demonstrated that
hydrocarbons are present deep in granitic rock in the complete absence or
proximity of any
sedimentary materials and in a distribution that leaves no reasonable doubt
that they have come from
deeper levels. The mix of the different hydrocarbon molecules, both of the
gases and the oils, is quite
a typical mix, as it is found in other oil and gas producing regions. The
quantities of oil and gas that
appear to be present in this 44 km diameter formation, tested in two distant
locations, appear to be
very large, as judged by the porosity measurements and the vertical intervals
showing high
concentrations."

He also mentions the sludge you cite, for example:

" Production flow rates could not be achieved in either hole, apparently
because in a
confluent flow towards the wellbore, the sludge quickly concentrates and
blocks the pores."

Perhaps for that reason the project was deemed a failure.

More importantly, there's none to say that it is true, and the
responsibility for proof lies with the proposer. Otherwise, I could propose
that everything was made by a big mac and fries on the clouds that gives me
everything I want (in a non-measurable sense, of course), then back it up
with "You can't disprove it!!".
Then of course, I'd start "educating" YOUR children with the big mac
religion, and you'd be given a bad-sounding "-ist" to wear on your head,
should you complain.
There is no "disprove it!", this is not rational.......after all - do you
think you can disprove my big-mac that demands blind irrational faith and so
hides? How can you do it when there are no premises or base observations to
scrutinise?
What there is though, is a MASSIVE and totally transparent motive to make
any old crap up, and delude myself - hey, I can magic away all my greatest
fears, and give existence "meaning" in one fell swoop......yahoo!

I guess we can say the same for war, child abuse, rape, torture, drugs,
genocide, and devil worship.  If they weren't useful people wouldn't use
them.  That doesn't make them a good thing just because idiots use them.

Get a clue, the God concept is the most distructive concept ever
unleased on man by man.

Subject: Lunex - USAF 1961 Moon Base
X-Comment:  Friends and Partners in Space


In May 1961 the US Air Force released a secret report, summarising the
result of years of planning to place a military base on the moon by 1967.
The complete Project Lunex - Lunar Expedition report, including some
observations, is now on-line on the Encyclopedia Astronautica at:

http://solar.rtd.utk.edu/~mwade/articles/lunex.htm

This is a little off-topic, but there are some interesting parallels to 1960
Russian lunar base plans (noted in the report). Members of this list may
also find Section X - Intelligence Estimate - interesting as a summary of US
knowledge of Russian space capabilities and plans at the same time the moon
landing decision was being made.

Here here! (Or is it "Hear hear!"? "Hear here!"??)

I might add, if Extropianism becomes associated in the
public mind with people who get abusive and angry
whenever the "God" meme comes up, REGARDLESS OF THE
INTENT OR CONTEXT, it will hamper the spread of
Extropian memes.

In some of the recent posts concerning religion, some
people have been painting with mighty broad strokes.

I'm at a loss to imagine how communication can exist between powers.

If evil powers exist, how can you protect yourself from viruses/trojan
horses possibly encoded into a message? Here and now, I doubt most
people check their mail for letterbombs, but in this case the price of
failure is only one human life and maybe collateral damage. Once we're
powers, we might have a whole legacy to look after, and the price of
failure might not be just mere death but an infinity of hellish torture
(spanning multiple universes) for multiple copies of ourselves and loved
ones spawned for some evil darkside-extropian mind experiment (see
archives).

So say you're a power cruising thru space and you come across a derelict
spaceship sending distress signals (or maybe a planet full of miserable
peasants praying for salvation). How do you know that it isn't a trap?
Wouldn't it be prudent to just ignore it, and possibly move away from it
at near-light speed, dropping antimatter space-mines behind you all the
way?

Even if you reduced the message/derelict/planet to its constituent
atoms, how can you ensure it isn't a clever trap constructed by some
much more advanced but evil power?

Maybe the Earth's core isn't full of deadly nanoweapons to ensnare
powers that come to visit, but it could be, and isn't that enough?

Believe it or not, there were a few hundred scientists making jokes
(knowing that it is not a laughing matter, but sometimes all one can
do is find humor in it) about the conversion of units thing at the
AAS annual Division of Planetary Sciences conference last month
(and since the meeting was in Italy this year, the European contingent
was present in large numbers and found great humor in it too).

Far from making big armies obsolete, high technologies encourage them.  The
difference is that instead of having 1,000,000 riflemen you end up with
thousands of different kinds of specialists working together in very complex
ways.  There is a strong selection pressure in favor of large, well-funded
armies that manage to be a little less hidebound than their competitors.

So, you won't see a return to trench warfare, but that doesn't rule out new
and innovative ways of committing mass murder.

As the air force has discovered time and time again, the enemy starts
repairing damaged systems the instant your air raid is over.  To disable an
entire nation you have to destroy things faster than the enemy can rebuild
them, and keep doing it for long enough to win the war.  Unless the enemy
suffers a failure of will (i.e. surrenders without a fight), that means
there is going to be a very large amount of damage.

It isn't the terrain per se that you want to control of, its the enemy
population, manufacturing centers, and other resources that can be used to
resist your attack.

Then you are probably imagining a relatively genteel enemy.  Suppose your
adversary decides they are tired of dealing with tricky cyberterrorism, and
simply exterminates your entire population?  If you don't keep an actual,
physical army on hand you won't be able to do anything about it.

> Please someone more advanced than me, chip in here and extrapolate

Sure.  Over the next 20 years or so (CRNS, of course) most humans in combat
roles are replaced by machines.  Armies have much lower headcounts, operate
at a higher tempo, and are far more deadly to both enemies and civilians.
In 20 - 40 years CRNS mass mind control becomes a popular tool in
authoritarian circles, and genocide is made easy by genetically targeted
bioweapons.  Emerging AI technology enables the creation of Orwellian
superstates where all human action is constantly monitored by machines, and
the need for actual human subjects begins to decline as the AIs improve.
Within another century your typical authoritarian state has become a
borganism in which all action is constrained my layer upon layer of loyalty
programming.

I think that those of use who favor freedom can find ways to counter these
trends, but it isn't going to be an easy task.

First of all, I wasn't talking about God, I was
talking about "God", the meme (or set of memes). You
seem to be talking about the actual things. Your above
analogies are not valid for this reason. To use the
first on your list, obviously the meme "war" is as
useful as the meme "earthquake", even though both
refer to destructive things.

While I do acknowledge that this list is a valid place
for freethinkers to vent their frustrations about
religios irrationality, this is just what I mean by
people getting angry and abusive. It's very strange
that the "God" meme gets you so upset. What, in your
opinion, is the SECOND most destructive concept
unleashed on man by man?

Title
  Evaluation of butylated hydroxyanisole, myo-inositol, curcumin, esculetin,
  resveratrol and lycopene as inhibitors of benzo[a]pyrene
  plus 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone-induced lung
  tumorigenesis in A/J mice.

Abstract
  The potential activities of butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), myo-inositol,
  curcumin, esculetin, resveratrol and lycopene-enriched
  tomato oleoresin (LTO) as chemopreventive agents against lung tumor induction
  in A/J mice by the tobacco smoke carcinogens benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and
  4-(methyl-nitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) were evaluated. Groups
  of 20 A/J mice were treated weekly by gavage with a mixture of BaP and NNK (3
  micromol each) for 8 weeks, then sacrificed 26 weeks after the first
  carcinogen treatment. Mice treated with BHA (20 or 40 micromol) by gavage 2 h
  before each dose of BaP and NNK had significantly reduced lung tumor
  multiplicity. Treatment with BHA (20 or 40 micromol) by gavage weekly or with
  dietary BHA (2000 ppm), curcumin (2000 ppm) or resveratrol
  (500 ppm) from 1 week after carcinogen treatment until termination had no
  effect on lung tumor multiplicity. Treatment with dietary myo-inositol
  (30,000 ppm) or esculetin (2000 ppm) from 1 week after carcinogen treatment
  until termination significantly reduced lung tumor multiplicity, with the
  effect of myo-inositol being significantly greater than that of esculetin.
  Treatment with dietary LTO (167, 1667 or 8333 ppm) from 1 week before
  carcinogen treatment until termination had no effect on lung tumor
  multiplicity. The results of this study demonstrate that BHA is an effective
  inhibitor of BaP plus NNK-induced lung tumorigenesis in A/J mice when
  administered during the period of carcinogen treatment and that, among the
  compounds tested, myo-inositol is most effective after carcinogen treatment.

Except that this only works if we are literally a simulation.  If we are
living in the real world then even advanced nanotechnology won't enable them
to do this undetected - you need too much hardware in everyone's brains, and
in the surrounding environment, to be able to escape detection even by a
primitive race like us.

Of course, I suppose they could be controlling our minds to prevent us from
noticing the intervention, but that approach leads to untestable (and
therefore pointless) theories.

This one is easy.  Right now, attack is easier than defense; you can't
stop a massed nuclear attack.  Given nanotechnology, the inequality will
get even worse.  But in software, it seems to me that it's getting
easier to defend then attack, and I certainly don't see Powers worrying
about Trojan-horse attacks and the like.  And it could be that under the
ultimate laws of physics, defense is just easier than attack; once you
have total control over local space, no external force can take it away
from you.

Leaving aside answers like "social contracts" and "convergent motivations".

    One thing I always find baffleing are the miracles of Fatima and 
Garibondal (Not sure of spelling on that one) or some of the well documented 
miracles, some of them I have been able to explain to my personal 
satisfactory but Fatima I can see being a UFO hoax.  It was a cloudy day 
raining and then when the clouds disappear the "sun" danced and pulsated.  We 
know that that would be impossible because if the sun did anything like that 
there is no way we would be here today.  An SI craft could easily pull this 
off but to jump to that conclusion would not be kosher.  In Garibondal Spain 
the girls who saw the Arch angel Micheal had a sketch made and he looked a 
lot like a "Gray" with a silly wig on.  I find it amusing to entertain these 
ideas and I love to run them through my head but to take them too seriously

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic data on the possible benefit of eating fish to
  reduce the risk of coronary heart disease have been
  inconsistent. We used data from the Chicago Western Electric Study to examine
  the relation between base-line fish consumption and the 30-year risk of death
  from coronary heart disease. METHODS: The study participants
  were 1822 men who were 40 to 55 years old and free of
  cardiovascular disease at base line. Fish
  consumption, as determined from a detailed dietary history, was stratified
  (0, 1 to 17, 18 to 34, and > or = 35 g per day). Mortality from coronary
  heart disease, ascertained from death certificates, was
  classified as death from myocardial infarction (sudden or nonsudden) or death
  from other coronary causes. RESULTS: During 47,153 person-years of follow-up,
  there were 430 deaths from coronary heart disease; 293 were
  due to myocardial infarctions (196 were sudden, 94 were nonsudden, and 3 were
  not classifiable). Cox proportional-hazards regression showed that for men
  who consumed 35 g or more of fish daily as compared with those who consumed
  none, the relative risks of death from coronary heart
  disease and from sudden or nonsudden myocardial infarction
  were 0.62 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.40 to 0.94) and 0.56 (95 percent
  confidence interval, 0.33 to 0.93), respectively, with a graded relation
  between the relative risks and the strata of fish consumption (P for trend =
  0.04 and 0.02, respectively). These findings were accounted for by the
  relation of fish consumption to nonsudden death from myocardial infarction
  (relative risk, 0.33; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.12 to 0.91; P for
  trend= 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: These data show an inverse association between
  fish consumption and death from coronary heart disease,
  especially nonsudden death from myocardial infarction.

I don't know. But some people's conceptions of "God"
(I'm tired of saying meme so much) seem to refer to
this "mystery at the back of everything", rather than
the vengeful Jehovah. I don't find this version of the
"God" meme particularly harmful, that is,
IN-AND-OF-ITSELF. (Obviously, this version of the meme
COULD be attached to a lot of other harmful ideas in a
particular belief system.)

Before I jumped in, a few people were trying to point
out that not all religions are like "fundamental
Christianity" while others were painting ALL religions
as being totally (equally?) bad and harmful. I'm with
the former set of people, trying to help the latter
see that there are differences.

It sounds to me like Putnam, or the person explaining Putnam, or
someone, is failing to clearly distinguish between the question "What is
truth?" and "What is rational?"  The truth precedes us, generated us,
and acts according to laws of physics which we cannot specify.  There is
an objective answer to the question "What is truth?".  Rationality is
the process whereby we attempt to arrive at the truth.  There is no
objective answer to the question "What is rational?", not *here*, not
without direct access to objective reality.  Rather, "How should
rationality work?" is an engineering question about how to create
systems that can model and manipulate reality - or rather, how to create
parts of reality whose internal patterns mirror the whole, to the point
that the internal process can predict the external processes in advance.

As for AI, it seems to me that the concept of an internalist mental
model is a confusion between "is" and "should".  A reference to "green"
*is* the cognitive concept of "green", but what it *should* be, what the
system tries to make it converge to, is the external reality of green. 
If you have a wholly internalist system, then the concepts don't
converge to anything.  If the only definition of correctness is the
thought itself, there's no way to correct malfunctions.  The system is
meta-unstable.  The AI thinks "I can't possibly be wrong; anything I
think is by definition correct," and then it gets silly, just like
subjectivist humans.  Shades of Greg Egan's _Quarantine_.

OK, Robert, let's try this again, from the top.

A project like web-mediated SETI makes sense only if aliens can actually
receive the message.  In order to receive the message they either need
"magical" powers, or sensors located right here in the solar system.  Since
I know you frown on theories that rely on technomagic, I assume you take the
latter stance.

Now, we would expect that the odds of another species achieving a high level
of technology at the same time we do would be very low.  If such a species
exists we would expect their technological civilization to be tens or
hundreds of millions of years old.  That in turn implies that they have been
here for quite a long time.

This raises the obvious question of why we are here at all, and failing that
why the presence of the aliens is not obvious.  You offer two possible
explanations: either the aliens follow a very strict non-intervention rule
with regard to primitive life, or we are an experiment of some kind.
Unfortunately, neither explanation is anywhere near sufficient to support
the weight of the assumptions it must bear.

You speculate that a non-intervention rule (or a set of observed behaviors
that give the same effect as such a rule) might arise from some kind of
universal evolutionary pressure, but give no clue as to where such pressure
might come from.  I can, however, see a number of factors that would work in
the other direction.  First there is the obvious fact that expansionist
races will spread while non-expansionist races will not, so we would expect
the universe to become dominated by expansionist races.  Furthermore, a
civilization that converts all available matter into useful artifacts gains
a strong competitive advantage over one that does not, whether their
competition is economic or military or both.  Finally, we have never
observed anything like the degree of uniformity your hypothesis requires,
and we can see that as a general rule increasing technology results in more
diversity rather than less.  Why, then, should we expect that very advanced
technology will cause society to suddenly collapse into a
"one-best-way-to-do-everything" situation?

With regard to the experiment hypothesis, the big problem is that
web-mediated SETI makes sense only if we are in some bizarre,
custom-tailored sort of experiment where SETI itself is central to the
experimenters' purpose.  One can construct an infinite number of equally
plausible scenarios where the experimenters will never speak to us, or where
attempting to speak to them will prompt them to end the experiment, or where
any other result that you happen to like will happen.  In the end it is no
different than speculating that we are all thralls of the Illuminati
overlords, or servants of God, or participants in any other
internally-consistent fantasy world you care to construct.  If you want to
move the theory beyond this level you need a clear theory that explains why
this particular experiment would actually be the one that is run.

On one of my mailing lists we have adopted the convention
of using angle brackets to denote "meme for" something.
So the God meme would be written as <God>. It has proven
to be a very useful shorthand.

If Extropianism or TransHumanism's basic tenant is merely atheism and an 
obsession with concepts of the deep future, I guess that it will have a 
self-limiting impact.  Perhaps I am under-valuing its cultural significance; 
I know that Mr. Bard appeared on a prominent daytime chat show in Sweden 
(Bard identifies himself as a Zoroastrian).  Playing Devil's Advocate I could 
say that the emphasis on material solutions to spiritual problems will never 
be solved by this World-View, that reduces humanity to nothing more then a 
mobile central nerbous system..and so forth.  

If you were in a playful mood you can then reply that 'material problems will 
never be solved by spiritual solutions.." My concern is that  Extropianism 
will never play in Peoria, as we say in the States, and thats where the money 
is. You do like money, don't you?

Yes or in other words how many members who are currently atheist,  were 
subjected to Sundays filled with fire and brim-stone preachings (not good for 
the stomach!) or are afraid that such types will rise to power and that 
atheism is the best antidote--it ain't.  But then you are reading that from 
someone who hopes that one day Jerry Fallwell will have sex with teletubbie.

Whatever Einstein was, he was never a schmuck.  "Religion without science is 
blind, and science without religion is lame".  I would say that the utility 
of God is to promote scientific evolution to the resolution of suffering and 
yes, the search for extra-terrestrial intelligences--as looney as that may 
be.  

The funny thing is, if one extrapolates technology out far enough(time-wise) 
in a speculative sense, in a David Deutsch/Max Tegmark kind of way; the 
religious loons may be sort of correct.  Wasn't it Jon Donne who said "A 
man's reach exceeds his grasp, or whats a heaven for?"

That's cool, but if <god> ever becomes an HTML tag,
the results could be unpredictable.

(I bet somebody already thought of that joke.)

The March/April, 1999 issue of Mercury Magazine is devoted to
SETI and extraterrestrial life.  Read the Table of Contents here:

http://www.aspsky.org/mercury/mercury/9902/contents.html

One article is online - "The View from a Distant Star: Challenges of 
Interstellar MESSAGE-MAKING", by Douglas A. Vakoch 

In the absence of knowledge of physical and cultural clues, 
communication between two species can be almost impossible. Almost. 

http://www.aspsky.org/mercury/mercury/9902/vakoch.html

The Editorial also deals with the subject and is online at this URL:

The January/February, 1999 issue of Mercury has this online article:

"More Than Just a Planet, It's a Meal"

Can a star swallow a planet? The extrasolar planets discovered over 
the past two years display an odd range of characteristics - from their 
masses to the size and shape of their orbits. And they just may offer 
us clues to stellar diets.  By Eric Sandquist of Northwestern University

I believe it.  Some yahoo at the rocket ranch put out a gag memo
saying that if anyone posted baby announcements with the traditional

If a "rocket scientist" loses a mission due to *units* screwup [fer

I would expect the "variance" in rates of development for civilizations
is probably quite large depending on the environment.  SI-Civs could
easily identify life-compatible planets remotely.  However if you want
to monitor or communicate in real time, you are going to have to be
"on-site".

Selection pressure as always comes from the environment.  Water
forces you to become streamlined, air forces you to become light.
In the case of SIs in space I think it is the environment of the
"laws of physics" and "physical limits of computation" that drive
convergent evolution.  For SIs the primary constraints are the
laws of thermodynamics, the Plank heat radiation function, the speed
of light and materials properties (melting temperature, etc.).

For example, the laws of thermodynamics say you are going to get
the most work done if you can harvest energy at the highest temperature
(limited by materials properties presumably) and radiate at the
lowest temperature (dictated by the background radiation).  That
is going to provide selection pressure for you to get as far away
as possible from radiation sources that shower you in heat/light
(raising the temperature of surrounding space).   However the
further away you get from other SIs the greater your communications
delays (leading to slower thought) are and higher your communications
costs (due to increased power requirements).  This provides pressure
to stay close.  Without estimates as to the value SIs place on
"personal thought" vis-a-vis "interpersonal communication" it
is almost impossible to determine the configurations SIs find most
desirable.

But you are making an implicit assumption that "expansion" has value!
I will call this the "fallacy of universal expansion".  Expansion
does have [some] value in *our* environment.  In the environment of
space there may be concrete limits to the value of expansion (due to
the communication delays outlined above).

My argument is that races with the technology to be "expansionist"
may "universally" see the futility of doing so.  You don't want to
get "bigger", you want to get "smaller".  To make the argument that
there will still be a few "expansionist" races, you have to make
the argument that they will fail to see something as obvious to the
majority of SIs as gravity is to us.  It is like arguing that some
fish species would architect themselves with square corners or some
birds should use lead to encode the information in their DNA.
It just isn't done!

You have to make the case that "competition" can exist on interstellar
or even worse intergalactic levels.  I will call this the "fallacy of
small spaces and limited resources".  In the year 1300 there was no
"competition" between native Americans and Europeans.  The technology
and access didn't exist to bring them into competition with one another.
If the costs of interstellar competition exceed the benefits then
such competition will not occur.  If you look at the problems we
have now of justifying colonies on the Moon or Mars you can see
this is true for even us.

The gravitational microlensing observations are pretty damn uniform.
Estimates of 200 billion objects with masses ~0.4 M_sun.

Also you have to look at the trends from hardware into software.
Software diversity may increase to levels I cannot imagine (because
it isn't limited by physical laws, in fact it can make up new
physical laws).  Hardware on the other hand *does* have to deal
with the physics of the universe.  In that reality you may only
have a few optimal architectures.  Once you have discovered/constructed
those you move all of your diversity-creation into the virtual reality
(fantasy realm).

> Why, then, should we expect that very advanced

Because they have had millions or billions of years to discover
those "best ways".  Think of the refinement of the designs of
an automobile.  It hasn't *really* changed much in ~100 years.
If you have been working on SI architecture refinements for
millions of years you probably have them pretty close to
perfect.  But unless you can *prove* they are the best that
is possible, there may be a motiviation for letting another
civilization take a crack at the problem.  They just might
come up with air-cars or dragons as a transportation vehicle.
This gives rise to the "set-up-an-experiment" and/or
"non-interference" principles.

Probably true.  We would have to be in an experiment studying
the evolution of intelligence(s) to the point of recognizing
that things are "rigged".  If we are in an experiment studying
the variation of explanations for the cause of existence, then
an invitation is probably worthless.

I wouldn't say an "infinite" number, but certainly quite a few.
But then if you knew what the result of an experiment (initiating
contact via Web-Mediated SETI) would be, there would be no point to
doing it would there?

Not really.  If one says, "Ok, try it", and it doesn't work out
(as seems to be the case) then one is forced to construct a
more elaborate hypothesis.   Its different from saying "I believe in God"
but then explaining why God never talks to us in a manner that can
be verified.  My perspective would be to lay down hypothesis
and attempt to verify or reject them as rapidly as possible.
As Eliezer says, the truth doesn't care what you think, so you
might as well narrow things down as quickly as possible.

I thought I had explained this in previous messages but perhaps not.
One fundamental reason for "non-interference" is to increase
diversity in the hope that a non-contacted "in-the-dark" civilization
may uncover something here-to-fore overlooked by the overlords.
One reason to setup experiments and interfere on a "restricted"
basis is that you have previously run all of the "unrestricted"
alternatives and you want to drive the development of the civilization
into a phase space that rarely, if ever, develops naturally.

If there are civilizations in the galaxy 7-8 billion years old
(perhaps unlikely but *very* difficult to say "impossible"),
then they have had time to run *millions* of experiments
in the phase space of evolution of technological civilizations.
They may be down to the "bottom-of-the-barrel" in terms of ideas
of how to vary the conditions to promote increased diversity.

If you believe the first part of your sentence, you are laboring under very uncreative and uni-dimensional assumptions about the potential of extropian ideas.

Please!, "reduces humanity to nothing more..."?

Apparently you are oblivious to what religion has been telling people for millenia: you are a sinner, you are nothing compared to the glory of the Lord and etc.

And What is so bad about being a moblie central nevous system....with potential?  What is the alternative you are proposing?
In every post of yours, I detect a constant hinting at some kind of "spiritual world" that you seem to think extropians are missing.  For example, last week you insinuated that extropians are anti-religious because they are ignorant of other traditions and belief systems.  A few posts, including mine, demonstrated that this is incorrect.

Now you seem to be saying that material solutions will never solve spritual problems.  How are you defining spiritual? Give me an example of a spiritual problem.  I am thinking that "spirtual problems" are at their root material problems.  (Often involving common things such as deficts or excesses of neurotransmitters or a dearth of zeros in one's bank accounts.)

Are you truly interested in getting extropianism to play in Peoria or do you just like to play "devil's advocate" as you mentioned above? And are you insinuating that we should create a "spritual mythology" some we can win friends and make money?

Steve

p.s. Is your phrase "merely atheism" in the first paragraph a reference to Lewis's "Mere Christianity" or is that what you really think about the greastest liberating philosophy in history?

It is the concept of religion that is so harmful.  The concept of God is
merely the concept of a Prime Mover.

Let me tell you about religion.  Anytime anything generally recognised as
good is widely accepted.  A number of people seeking to exploit this fact,
latch on to it, and make themselves its preisthood.

This has happened to the concept of God, of Government, of the Law, and of
the Ecology.  I know many statists and eco freaks that are at least as scary
as Jerry Fawell.

Let's face it, in this country most people who believe in God, embrace the
concept of a personal God, and they aren't anything like the way you fear
that they are.

This isn't an error.  Putnam explicitly argues for their equivalence.
True statements are those statements which, objectively speaking, we
OUGHT to believe.

Morality is objective in exactly the same sense and in
exactly the same way that rationality is objective.

[If it helps, here where I say "morality" insert "meaning of life."  Also 
assume that I'll use rationality and morality interchangeably.  If you
don't believe that rationality is morality, then change every instance of 
the word "rationality" in my argument to "morality" and re-read.]

I have many midterms due this week, so I'm not going to post on this again
for a while, but...

This seems an odd thing to say, since these two claims are directly
incompatible.  An "answer" is a special kind of statement.  There is no
such thing as a statement which cannot be stated.  (If you think that
there can be, then you're using a Very Different definition of statement
than I am.)  If it can't be specified, then it's not an answer.

Anyway, I hold that there is an objective answer to the question "what is
truth," one which CAN be stated.  I wholeheartedly agree that it preceded
us, was the cause of our creation, etc.  I also believe that the question
"what is truth" is equivalent to the question "what should I believe?"  I
also believe that questions of morality, questions of "what should I do?"
have objective answers.  Thus, "what is truth" has an objective answer
because "what should I believe" has an objective answer.  Finally, "what
should I believe" is exactly what I mean when I say "what is rational," so
it ALSO has an objective answer.

> Rationality is the process whereby we attempt to arrive at the truth.

If you mean that we simply don't have ACCESS to the objective answer to
the question "what is rational," but that access is possible through
thought/approximation, then we're probably in agreement.  This is very
different from saying that the answer does not exist.

Here, again, we're in agreement.  But what makes you think we have access
to the answer to "how should rationality work?"  That use of should drops
this question in the realm of morality.  This question should be as dimly
lit (or as brightly lit) as the question "what is rational."  (Indeed,
under my account, you should have EXACTLY as much certainty about both of
these questions.)

But the words "external reality" CANNOT REFER to external reality in the
sense that you use it.  It can refer to your own internal construct which
you call "external reality," but you can't actually cook up a theory of
reference that can make the connection from your words to the right thing
under your conception.

Having said that, I again assert that positing the existence of an
external reality is a very good idea, we objectively ought to do it, and,
according to my theory of truth, I assert that it is TRUE that external
reality exists, and that our words model it.  We both agree that our
beliefs SHOULD line up with external reality.  However, I know what my
words mean when I say that, HOW they refer to external reality; you do not
appear to.

Again, this is absolutely wrong.  Our beliefs converge onto true beliefs.
(Or, at least, they OUGHT to converge onto true beliefs!)  No AI could
rationally accept the claim that "I can't possibly be wrong."  The claim
is OBVIOUSLY irrational.  The subjectivists buy it, but Putnam doesn't,
and I sure don't.

Again:

"Internalism is not a facile relativism that says, 'Anything goes'.
Denying that it makes sense to ask whether our concepts 'match' something
totally uncontaminated by conceptualization is one thing; but to hold that
every conceptual system is therefore just as good as every other would be
something else.  ... Internalism does not deny that there are experiential
*inputs* to knowledge; knowledge is not a story with no constraints except
*internal* coherence; but it does deny that there are any inputs *which
are not themselves to some extent shaped by our concepts*, by the
vocabulary we use to report and describe them, or any inputs *which admit
of only one description, independent of all conceptual choices*."

I think the third kind of replicator is any self propagating pattern in an

No, but we can make some interesting observations.  First off, allow me to
point out that the light speed barrier does not impose a limit on the scale
of computing devices.  If you have a closely spaced cloud of computing
systems, and you add more nodes to the outside of the cloud, the power of
the overall system will increase no matter how big the cloud has become.
The light speed barrier only limits your ability to apply all of that power
to a single sequential calculation.

Of course, that approach will consume energy rather quickly, and may not be
optimal in a universe where space-time engineering is not possible.
However, that does not mean that it makes sense to just leave most of the
universe alone.  Stars are terribly wasteful, after all - they convert so
much mass into a form that is terribly inconvenient to collect.  A frugal
civilization would convert them all into some form optimized for long-term
storage - perhaps a large number of brown dwarfs, or black holes of
carefully-chosen mass.  They would sweep up all matter that might fall into
black holes, collect the energy radiated by neutron stars, and generally
suppress all energetic events in favor of conservation.

There are other possible scenarios one could contrive, depending on one's
ideas about the nature of reality and what strategies will ultimately be
optimal for surviving it.  My point, however, is that the universe we see is
not particularly optimal for anything at all.  That is inconsistent with the
idea that SIs exist, because if the do then the entire universe should be
sculpted to fit their goals.

Caveat: If there is no possible way of getting around the light speed
barrier, then they will have altered only a portion of the observable
universe.  In that case the demarcation should be obvious, and our entire
galaxy is on the "undeveloped" side.

It isn't an assumption.  No matter what problems you need to solve,
controlling more mass/energy lets you do a better job of it.  If there are
big computational problems to solve, converting the whole galaxy to J-brains
will give you a better chance of solving them.  If the universe is doomed to
eventually run down, a large-scale conservation project will keep you alive
longer.  If it is possible to profit from aggression, mobilizing all
available resources will be essential to both defense and predation.  The
list goes on and on.

The only scenario I can see in which there would be no expansion is one in
which all SIs undergo some mental transformation that leads them to end
their won existence.  I don't see that as a plausible scenario (especially
since they haven't ended *our* existence as well).  Do you have another one?

And I've already referred to this line of thinking as the "Big Universe
Fallacy".  Interstellar trips would be long and boring for an SI, but there
is nothing even remotely difficult about them.  Sending out automated
devices to do things is essentially free - the energy costs of even an
ambitious program are tiny compared to the energy output of a star, and you
really don't have to send more than a few grams of matter.

Give me just about any set of hypothetical goals, and I'll give you a plan
for accomplishing them better by remodeling a substantial amount of matter
into specialized tools.

> The gravitational microlensing observations are pretty damn uniform.
> Estimates of 200 billion objects with masses ~0.4 M_sun.

I was referring to *cultural* uniformity.  This is another area I feel your
analysis unduly neglects.  Different people choose different goals, and use
different means to pursue them.  The historical trend has been for this
diversity to grow as we increase our knowledge (and more importantly, our
capabilities).  Why do you expect this trend to reverse?

But if you really want to explore possible paths of evolution this is an
absolutely terrible way to go about it.  It would be far more effective to
apply some of that SI intelligence to inventing abstract, high-level models
of biological and memetic evolution.  Then you can convert the solar system
to a computing device and get your results in a fraction of the time.  Not
only that, you gain the ability to take snapshots, add and remove unlikely
events, and generally experiment with possibilities in a manner that could
never be duplicated in physical reality.

Christianity & pals are not about true personal growth or "transhuman"

Well, I'd point out it *is* replicators in a context *without*
variation and selection that allow you to rapidly disassemble
planets and do other feats of astroengineering.  Adding the
variation and selection is what gives you the distinct
possibility of them creating a home for themselves rather
than for you.

Don't dis the replicators, they can do a lot for you. :-)

This depends on the "goals" of the species.  We are talking conscious
entities here, so in theory they are free to pick their own goals.

If the goal is "longevity within the limits of the known universe"
then there is a self-generated selective pressure to avoid hazards
(black holes, blazars, etc.)

If the goal is "escaping from a doomed universe", then the selective
pressure is to "think" or "architect" your way into a better universe.

Given our current knowledge of physics, I can't say which of those
SIs would want, but I propose that that they do know.  Since I
would hope that the laws of physics are universal, I would think
that all SIs adopt only one of those two perspectives.

No, the theory of gravity imposes a limit on the scale of computing
devices.  To much computronium in too small a volume and you become
a black hole.  The speed of light imposes a limit on computational
"throughput".  If you have a "cellular automata" architecture where
all you have to do is communicate with your nearest neighbor, this
isn't too bad (the limits in this case are thermodynamic because
as you compute at lower & lower temperatures you have to make your
radiators bigger, thereby decreasing the rate at which you can pass
your "state" information to your neighbor).   If on the other
hand you have a shared memory architecture then you have
synchronization issues where the time it takes to verify that
no processor node has a memory lock is a severe limit on the computing
throughput.  Those limits will be determined by interprocessor
distances where synchronization times are speed of light limited.

You can't do this.  You hit the thermodynamics limits.   In a
Matrioska Brain architecture you harvest stellar power at the highest
temperature materials allow (e.g. Tunsten carbide rod-logic
computers) and radiate the waste heat outward through successively
lower temperature computing layers until the final layer that radiates
at ~ the cosmic background.  You have a computer with physical dimensions
several times larger than the solar system (if you have sufficient
material to build it).  The computers on the outside can't
absorb energy (from inner computers) at 2.7K and radiate at
2.7K because you can't do any work.  If they generate their
own energy (say using fusion reactors), they still have the
problem that they *must* absorb the heat being radiated from
the inner computers and radiate that plus the heat that they
generate.  You get into a runaway radiator sizing problem.

The compute nodes on the outer shells are 100's of km apart
(assuming each node is funneling 100 KW of power through a
1 cm^3 nanocomputer type device).  The propagation delays
between nodes are *not* insiginficant in these cases.


> The light speed barrier only limits your ability to apply all of
> that power to a single sequential calculation.

No, the light barrier has fundamental implications on how fast you
can synchronize your computations.  If I moved all the neurons in
your brain 1 km apart but left the interneuron transmission speed
the same *you* would think slower (if at all).  If you think slower
it takes you longer to solve a problem.  *Only* if it is the type
of problem that can be subdivided (e.g. molecular modeling) and
fits well on a cellular automata architecture (which molecular
modeling does) do you have problem solution times scaling nicely.
If you are dealing with "cross-pollination" of memes that are
stored on opposite sides of a solar system then the delays *hurt*!

But they *may* just be the best way to produce heavy elements.
We are not *energy* constrained!  We are construction material
constrained due to the scaling laws for your radiators.  Your
radiator size scales inversely with T^4 -- low temperature radiators
require a *lot* of material.

If energy conservation were your concern this would be true.  However
at the current stage of development of the Universe, we want computronium
materials, not energy.  The situation will be reversed at some point
in the future (depending on the rate at which they/we convert material
into heavier elements).

Precisely.  That is why I devote the time I do to looking at the
astronomical evidence (esp. "unexplained" large-scale phenomena that
require the invention of improbable answers) to see if they might indicate
that there really are SIs.

You should say "our entire *VISIBLE* galaxy".  Given that 90% of the
mass is missing and we have evidence for 200 billion "thingys" we
can't see, the "undeveloped" claim is entirely in the eye of the viewer.

No, that is simply wrong.  You can control a huge amount of mass
but you can't get it close enough to have higher computational
throughput because you fall out of the universe.  You can control
a huge amount of energy but you can't use it any more effectively
because your *melt* yourself.

Go read Nanosystems, Sections 11.5 and 12.8 -- quoting from the later
  "In nanomechanical systems of sufficiently large scale, the ~10^12
   W/m^3 power dissipation density of ~1 GHz nanomechanical logic
   systems described here ***exceeds any possible means of cooling***."

The cooling requirements limit the single-node computational capacity
and the material from which the node is constructed determines the
operating temperature and therefore the radiator size and thus the
inter-node propagation delays.

*Only* that subset of all possible problems that can be divided into
data subsets that can be solved on "local" computational resources.
If the problem is bigger than the local node (or collection of nodes)
then you have to pay the price of the communication delays.

I can have a virtual reality encompasing an entire M-Brain full of
uploads in one solar system.  Synchronization and communication
between that entity and another similar entity is going to be both
*slow* and *expensive* (and that isn't even a problem that requires
tight synchronization).

> If the universe is doomed to eventually run down, a large-scale

I thought about this.  Do you want to build M-Brains around big
stars or small stars?  It turns out that the lifetime computation
available is roughly the same (this is determined by stellar
physics).  So there seems to be little difference in whether you
run your virtual reality "fast" or "slow".  If you run it "slow"
and are interested in the external universe, you get to watch
more of it.

This goes back to my comment on "enforcing" directives across galactic
distances.  *Only* if the remote SI/MBrain etc. is designed by you
to be non-self-modifying do you have a chance of this occuring.
If it is a conscious self-modifying entity then it may well decide
its interests & goals are much different from the mission you gave it.

Defense may be a small requirement because of the difficulty
of destroying solar system sized sturctures (down to the atomic
level) across interstellar distances.  Predation may be pointless
due to the aforementioned physical limits.

This comes back to marginal benefits.  You have to make a case that
the marginal benefits for expansion *exceed* the marginal benefits
of letting some fraction of the galaxy/universe evolve naturally.
To me this is as simple as the question of -- Do you eat the last
tiny crumb of food on your plate?  Generally not, if you have
eaten all of what you need for sustenance.

A plausible scenario is that they evolve to local limits and then
go to sleep waiting for more computronium to evolve or something
worth watching (that they haven't watched 10,000,000 times before)
occurs.  Or they put up their automated defense systems and spend
all of their attention evolving an ever more complex internal virtual
reality.

I agree that it is not difficult, but it *is* expensive!  Can one of
our rocket engineers compute the DeltaV requirements on a solar
system mass object to bring it within planetary distances of
a star within a few dozen light years?

This remains a *very* open question.  It isn't clear nanoprobes
can survive the radiation of interstellar space.  But leaving that
aside it becomes a question of what is the point?

So you send out nanoprobes to convert a nearby star into an
unpatterned SI.  How do you transport your uploads to that SI?
You are going to have one huge telephone bill.  If you do
relocation half of your uploads what does this get you?
Your synchronization times between the two systems are
going to make coordinated thought very slow.

If all you want to do is harvest matter, you are back to the
DeltaV requirements.  If you want to harvest energy and beam
it back, you are back to the heat radiation problems again.

I can't see the usefullness of colonization.

Yes, but that is due to the fact that we are individuals with very low
communications bandwidth.  They say that married people become more similar
over time.  That must be because the resolve their "differences" in
favor of one position or agree to expand to encompass both positions
(as a pseudo-single unit).  The communication bandwidth is so much
higher and the "universal" knowledge so much greater in SIs that
it is hard to imagine sub-SIs maintaining those differences as anything
other than fashion statements.

I think sub-SIs evolve into highly similar entities.  I think SIs
reach a small set of optimal architectures due to the physical limits
and convergent evolution.

It depends on how much of the knowledge you have access to.
If your knowledge is my knowledge and my knowledge is your knowledge
then we might be on a trend to minimize differences.  Now you may
choose diversity, but it will be for aesthetic reasons rather than
rational/logical ones.  Rational/logical approaches would argue
that for any specific problem there should be a *limited* set of
"best" solutions that is much smaller than the set of "all" solutions.

No argument.  If you can get the level of granularity you want in the
simulation then this is a much better way to do it.  By this argument
the SIs are too busy running these simulations to be bothered to
clean up the crumbs of the galaxy that are currently left.  If
so then they are not likely to be here which is just fine by me since
it means we get to surf the wave without having to worry about
being turned off.

I'd be inclined to use the second point against the first.

It's hard to guess what Final Technology/ies will be able to do, or what
outcomes economic imperatives would lead to. Impossible, in fact, *unless*
there is, logically and overwhelmingly, "one-best-way-to-do-everything"
that every culture must converge toward.

Right now, *we* have the option of slash-and-burning our habitat, of
monocropping and strip-mining and polluting in an uncontrolled and
short-term-profit fashion. We don't, by and large, and we better resist the
temptation the more technically advanced we are. I don't think that's just
because wealthy cultures are sooky and mollycoddled and wimpish, allowing
themselves sentimental indulgence of traits encoded genetically for other
purposes and now culturally hypertrophied. (But that could be true, so
SIs'd recycle the Mona Lisa for the useable computronium. Ugh.)

    When NASA was preparing for the Apollo project, they did some astronaut
  training on a Navajo Indian reservation.
  
  One day, a Navajo elder and his son were herding sheep and came across the
  space crew. The old man, who spoke only Navajo, asked a question which his
  son translated. "What are these guys in the big suits doing?"
  A member of the crew said they were practicing for their trip to the moon.

  Recognizing a promotional opportunity for the spin-doctors, the NASA folks
  found a tape recorder. After the old man recorded his message, they asked

Billy you raise some good points.  I ask myself, if I had the technology to

Yah the  "all sinners" concept is a bad concept. It seems to be almost 
exclusively a Church concept, as in Council of Nicea 315, and 325CE.  The 
Aztecs didn't care whether one was a 'sinner' as it was a 'glory' to be 
sacrificed to the Great Black Jaguar in the Sky-no sin involved. They also 
murdered captured prisoners from smaller tribes, and cut out their hearts 
regardless of moral status.

That religion is Christianity that best describes that, not the one I was 
raised in.

posts, including >mine, demonstrated that this is incorrect.

I beg to differ on this claimmed achievement, since I have seen in many 
posting here a generalized conception that Christianity is and has been the 
only path. For evidence of that please see my first quote of yours:

"Apparently you are oblivious to what religion has been telling people for 
millenia: you are a sinner," --that has been a central principle of 
Christianity, and is the sole inventor of 'original sin;-which is what you 
are refering to, whether you realize it or not.

Give me an example of a spiritual problem.  I am thinking that "spirtual 
problems" are at their root material problems.  (Often involving common 
things such as deficts or excesses of neurotransmitters or a dearth of zeros 
in one's bank accounts.)  

Fair enough, since you've opened up the barn door on this one, let me release 
the livestock.  Sprititual problem: I miss  Dear Grandpa Waldo; he passed 
away many years ago. Unfortunately, Alcor wasn't in business at the time to 
preseve his biology. So Uncle Waldo is dead and gone-forever.  Now if you 
have a solution for death(a physiological & spiritual problem); you may now 
present your answer.

If you disagree with my premise, that there is a 'problem' i.e. Uncle Waldo 
being gone from my life; that may be logical, but it certainly doesn't 
address the issue-for me and for many people who have loved ones perish. 
Perhaps a virtual Uncle Waldo may suffice, but then more questions are raised.

Well there are churches selling that flavor.  But half of the new testament
is an inditement against organized religion, and full of exhortations to
have faith instead of blindly believing what people tell you.

This doesn't make any sense. Prideful people who expect themselves to be

Hello everyone,

I was wondering as seen in the form of degree requirements, what classes 
would a person have to take to get a "bachelors in extropian studies?"  
Would engineering be the foundation of this degree?  How much philosophy, 
history, poly sci and sociology would be needed? And what about the 
biological sciences?  A fine arts requirement possibly?
I look forward to getting some detailed posts on this question.


Sincerely,

John Grigg

I'm presently an undergraduate at Yale...  I started out as a biomedical
engineering major, but these days I'm considering biomedical engineering +
philosophy.

Even if I COULD major in "extropian studies," I probably wouldn't.  IMO,
extropy is just too interdisciplinary to realistically major in it.  Any
attempt to do so would probably lead to knowing not enough about too many
different subjects.  If I could, I'd be BiomedE, philosophy, computer
science, physics, math, music, psychology, literature...  not necessarily
in that order.

I think you are copping out Damien.  I think we can use the limits
of Non-Magic-Physics as a logical plateau.  After all we don't
have the matter and energy that we can see structured into an
quasi-infinate set of possibilities.  We only have 3-5 states of matter,
perhaps 6-10 types of stars, 2-3 major classes of galaxies, etc.
and some interesting transitions or evolutions between them.
The various states and evolutionary paths are due to the laws of physics.

What we need are theories for the evolution of technology, intelligence
and consciousness.

I agree, it is because we learn to do more and survive more elegantly
with less.  If we still see stars it may be because the SIs have figured
out how to get what they want from the universe without having to
consume everything.

>(But that could be true, so

Depends -- does the marginal benefit of turning it into computronium
exceed the marginal benefit of having an "original" work of art?
Comes down to some interesting questions of "values".
As we have risen up of of the "survival" swamp, we seem to be
evolving towards a species that controls our population, develops
extended longevity, values our safety from galactic hazards, really
learns to practice live and let live, etc.

Perhaps the extrapolation of these trends leads many SIs to be caretakers
or gardeners.

When you don't have to worry about your survival (for at least 100 billion
years) what do you do?

Well, I'd point out it *is* replicators in a context *without*
variation and selection that allow you to rapidly disassemble
planets and do other feats of astroengineering.  Adding the
variation and selection is what gives you the distinct
possibility of them creating a home for themselves rather

Don't dis the replicators, they can do a lot for you. :-)

Ah, grasshopper, you have indeed been a bright student. You have
discovered the true meditative path, also known as Quieting the Monkey
Mind. Now meditate on this terminal for a day. :-)

Seriously, I think the queme idea isn't completely ridiculous. Maybe
the quemes are correlations/consistencies in the world around us? They
replicate in a way, since a world with many correlations is likely to
produce new events and pbjects embodying the correlations or new
meta-correlations. Of course, now we come full circle since genes and
memes are special instances of quemes.

Title
  Parkinson's disease-like effects of S-adenosyl-L-methionine: effects of
  L-dopa.
Source
  Pharmacology, Biochemistry & Behavior.  43(2):423-31, 1992 Oct.
Abstract
  The major symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) are due to degeneration of the
  nigrostriatal pathway and depletion of dopamine (DA). Tyrosine hydroxylase
  (TH), norepinephrine (NE), serotonin (5-HT), and melanin pigments are also
  decreased and acetylcholinergic activity increased. Biochemically, increased
  methylation can cause the depletion of DA, NE, 5-HT, and melanin pigments and
  also an increase of acetylcholine; thus, increased methylation can present a
  biochemical picture that resembles the biochemical changes that occur in PD.
  During the therapy of PD with L-dopa, it is well known that L-dopa reacts
  avidly with S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), the biologic methyl donor, to
  produce 3-O-methyl-dopa. Correspondingly, L-dopa has been shown to deplete
  the concentration of SAM, and SAM has been found to induce PD-like motor
  impairments in rodents; therefore, an excess of SAM-dependent methylation may
  be associated with Parkinsonism. To further study the effects of methylation,
  SAM was injected into the lateral ventricle of rats. SAM caused tremors,
  rigidity, abnormal posture, and dose-related hypokinesia. Doses of 9.38, 50,
  and 400 nM/rat caused 61.9, 73.4, and 94.8% reduction, respectively, of motor
  activity. A 200-mg/kg IP dose of L-dopa, given before 50 nM SAM, blocked the
  SAM-induced hypokinesia. SAM also caused a decrease in TH immunoreactivity,
  apparent degeneration of TH-containing fibers, loss of neurons, and the
  accumulation of phagocytic cells in the substantia nigra. These results
  showed that excess SAM in the brain, probably due to its ability to increase
  methylation, can induce symptoms that resemble some of the changes that occur
  in PD.

The first sentence reveals an ignorance about religion
which you later deny. Not all religions teach that
"you are a sinner."

I guess the angry atheist faction on this list will
never change. Bad news for Extropy.

Cynthia,

Having faith is blindly believing what people tell you. They say, just
have faith, so you just have faith.

My vent is not against just religious irrationality, it is about all
irrationality. Relegion and the god concept just happens to be the one
we are talking about and is such an excellent example.  

While I did mean to sound angry in my post, I did not wish to be abusive
to you, but rather to the concept being discussed.

Second most destructive cocept; communism.

If ALL people have this property, being a sinner, then there is no contrast.
If there is no contrast then the statement has exactly the same meaning
as "all people are saints", and that is no meaning at all.

To be honest there is another even more important reason I would never
use the  phrase "we are all sinners", it makes me sound like a hillbilly.

In at least one translation of the Tao Te Ching, Lau Tzu proudly proclaims,
"I am like an idiot, my mind is so empty!"  Cynthia's remarks made me see an
analogy between this and saying that we're all sinners.  If I proclaim, "I
know it all!" ( = "I am without sin"), we inhibit learning (= improving
ourselves morally).

The way I am applying this Bayesian argument is with regard to reports of
events which would seem to imply a "living" universe, i.e. one in which
intelligence intervenes to apparently circumvent natural law, in the
form of events which have been described in terms of miracles and magic.

Given the success of dead-universe predictions, we come to believe
that these reports are very likely to be incorrect.  The reason we
disbelieve these reports is exactly because of the evidence that the
universe is dead, and therefore natural law holds in a relatively simple
and straightforward manner.  (Of course, natural law holds in a living
universe as well, but the point is that Powers would be able to use
their technology to give the illusion of violating virtually any laws.)

Now if we develop new reasons to believe that the universe may be
living, such as the Fermi paradox or Robert's attempts to explain our
cosmological observations in terms of widespread alien activity, then we
have to re-evaluate our earlier decisions regarding miraculous events.
To the extent that we come to believe that the universe is living, it
very likely would have been so throughout recorded history.  And therefore
we can no longer interpret history as occuring in a dead universe.

In the context of a living universe, our reasons for disbelieving in
miracles no longer apply.  Miracles are no longer impossible, as they
would be in a dead universe.

Strictly speaking, Bayesian reasoning merely forces us to raise the
probability that miracles may be real, given new reason to believe in
a living universe.  By itself this is a weak statement, as it may be
argued that the necessary increase in probability is trivial, from one
in a quadrillion to two in a quadrillion, or some such.

I am arguing though that the fundamental reason for disbelief in
miracles is that the universe is lawful, and therefore if the universe is
living this fundamental reason no longer applies.  Therefore the whole
issue of miracles must be reevaluated from the beginning, without the
preconceptions and mindset which we carried over from when we thought
the universe was inherently lawful.

Now, you can still disbelieve in miracles, as we have seen here: people
can create explanations in terms of the apparent motives of the Powers
which (we stipulate) are present.  But any such argument is far weaker
than one based on natural law.  Judging the psychology of unknown
super-intelligences can be at best a highly uncertain enterprise.
There is no way that I can see to justify a strong disbelief in
miraculous intervention given a worldview that includes godlike aliens
in our vicinity; at least such disbelief can be nowhere near as strong
as that which would hold in a dead-universe model.

My basic point, therefore, is simply that to the extent that you come
to believe that a local alien presence is a real possibility, you should
accept that divine and magical and mystical events reported in the past
(and present) may be true.  The same thing would hold, BTW, if you came
to believe that time travel from the future were possible, or that we
were part of a Tiplerian simulation where there could be intervention
from the outside.

The lessons to draw from this are more ambiguous.  I do not mean to
say that we should refuse to accept local Powers because it forces us
to believe in religion.  We should follow our beliefs whereever they
take us, courageously, and let the chips fall where they may.  However,
we have to let the chips fall!  No one here should be bashing religion,
or even be especially skeptical of religious reports, pseudo-science,
Big Foot, UFOs, or any of the other phenomena which seem to defy the
laws of nature, if they are seriously entertaining the possibility of
a localized alien presence.  It is inconsistent to adopt a position
of extreme skepticism with regard to one set of reports while openly
exploring the other possibility.

Furthermore, I think it is important to recognize a possible emotional
component which may be driving beliefs in alien Powers.  There are many
commonalities between such beliefs and those of traditional religions.
Throughout SETI literature you can find similarities between the appeals
to the wisdom, benevolence, etc. of the aliens, and traditional appeals
to God.  I'm not saying that all believers in the value of SETI are
looking for God, but I do think that in some cases there are similar
motivations involved, perhaps subconsciously.  We should all try to be
aware of our emotional motivations so that we can make better decisions.

To the extent that SETI efforts represent a sublimated search for
God, hidden beneath rationalism, then my arguments will be especially
unwelcome.  Some SETI believers think they have cast off the chains
of religion, and are likely to be an extreme skeptics with regard to
classical religious stories.  They will abhore any suggestion that they
have inadertantly adopted a doctrine which requires them to be open to
the possibility of the truth of biblical miracles.

The emotional aspect goes in the other direction as well.  I personally
experience tremendous emotional resistance in accepting the possibility
that Biblical miracles may be true.  I do think this is a component of my
skepticism towards the suggestions by Robert and others that aliens may
have a widespread presence in the galaxy.  I tend to be impatient and
disdainful of the SETI enterprise; it seems only slightly removed from
praying at the temple.  The recent "Welcome to ETI" web page serves for me
as practically a reductio ad absurdum with regard to the quasi-religious
nature of SETI efforts.

In either case, then, there can be a significant emotional component in
our attitudes towards SETI, whether supportive or skeptical.  Hopefully
we can all try to make ourselves more aware of them and thereby gain
clarity in our judgements.

I am talking about the new testament definition of faith, and perhaps I have
a different interpretation of these things.  But I think the concept of
'faith' would better be translated today as 'self-confidence'.  From what I
remember from my reading is:

   Don't doubt that the sun will come up tomorrow, have faith.
   Don't fear that you can't make it through the travails of life, have
faith.
   Don't fear death, have faith.
   God gave you the ability to perceive and reason, have faith in them, not
in what religious figures tell you.

JC goes on and on, warning people about those who claim to speak on behalf
of God.

You know how I found this out?  My mother died when I was 15, and the priest
from our church refused to give the funeral oration because my mother did
not attend regularly.  A matter that was settled when my Grandfather donated
10K to the church (and 10K was a lot of money in the early 70's).  Anyway, I
passionately hated the church people.  And I found in the bible plenty of
justification for my hatred.

I think I've spotted a trend here.

When I do this kind of theorizing I start with a lifeless universe, and try
to work forward to a theory that explains the present without as few
unsupported assumptions as possible.  I see that there is no particularly
convincing evidence that there is anyone out there, so I think "well, there
must not be anyone out there".  When some SETI enthusiast brings up the
Drake equation I merely note that a list of unknowns does not constitute
evidence - we know essentially nothing about how easy it is for intelligent
life to evolve, and we therefore can not expect to predict anything from
such an analysis.

Robert, OTOH, seems to start by presuming that the universe must be filled
with sentient life.  He then works backwards from this point to construct
ways of reconciling this assumption with the fact that we see no evidence of
intelligent life.  He searches the universe of possible SI behaviors for
some set, however implausible, that might give that result, and then treats
that set of assumptions as if it were the simplest possible explanation for
observed facts.

This leads to some remarkably pointless debates.  I note that some
particular point requires you to make a whole raft of assumptions about the
nature of SI civilizations, and ask for evidence that these assumptions are
correct.  Robert, taking the existence of said civilization for granted,
replies that it is the simplest explanation for the observed universe and
therefore *I* should have to provide evidence that they are wrong.  We can
go around like this forever and never get anywhere.

So, why don't we start at the beginning.  I look around our corner of the
universe, and see that I can explain all of my observations quite well
without invoking extraterrestrial intelligence.  Why, then, should I add in
the complicating assumption that there must be SIs out there somewhere?

Robert Bradbury has continued to throw out many hypotheses to

A creative suggestion, but I don't think it works if the radius of these
dark regions is presumed to increase at a reasonable constant local speed.
Maps of these regions and walls are looking back in time.  So we should see
the wall widths increasing linearly with radius from here, out to a point
when the regions disappear.  If the dark regions started growing recently,
we should see these effects in the maps.  If the dark regions started
growing long ago, then the only way to not have everything dark by now is to
posit a very slow local speed of growth. And I don't see why probes can't
move between galaxies at a substantial fraction of the speed of light, if
that space is as empty as it seems.

I addressed this argument of yours in detail in Sept., giving specific
math models which imply contrary conclusions and challenging you to
offer models which imply the conclusions you favor.  My last post was
Sat, 18 Sept 1999, to which you have not yet responded.

To summarize for others, it is hard to rationalize spending precious
mass to carefully drop the radiation for most stars down to very low
temps, while not even touching 99% of the light from the remaining
stars, and also leaving substantial amounts of useful mass there.

This seems contrary to your earlier explanation for why life is dark.
If they are not energy constrained, why try so hard to re-radiate at
a low temp?

You are making the strong assumption that these powers care
much at all about observing the undisturbed evolution of lowly
creatures like ourselves.  You could be right, but it is quite
a strong assumption.  If we know little that would be valuable to
them, they would mostly want "contact" to take over the resources
we occupy.  Maybe there is demand for a dozen such "zoos" in a
galaxy, I don't see why there would demand for much more.

This seems like complete speculation. I.e., you have no other reason
to believe this than it would make your theory work better.  And it
would be very surprising if the most efficient factor were exactly
the natural factory.

This seems like complete speculation in the same sense.

You have just assumed that virtually the only thing all SIs want is
to compute answers to the sort of questions that require high
synchronization, and maybe also to watch the universe a little.
You have *not* derived this conclusion from other assumptions.

I don't think you understand evolution.  Selection works regardless
of the conscious or unconscious goals of the entities involved.  If we
work at it carefully enough, we should be able to figure out what
kinds of goals selection should favor.  Their freedom to pick their
own goals is irrelevant.

You simply assume it is very hard to create descendants which are highly
likely to have very compatible goals.  I see no reason to think this.

<and assorted related comments>

Yes, the density of a computational structure is significantly limited by
the need to avoid forming an event horizon.  Yes, long communication delays
limit the scale on which you can mobilize resources to attack a single
closely-coupled problem.  Neither of these facts places much of a limit on
the useful size of a computing system.

Why not?  Well, for starters, most really hard problems do not require close
synchronization between computing nodes.  Most of the ideas I've heard for
how SIs might pass the time would be quite amenable to being spread across a
large network of computing nodes.  The only real constraint is that the time
to pass messages from one side of the node to the other must be a reasonably
small fraction of the time needed to solve the problem.

Also, an SI civilization can reasonably be expected to think about more than
one thing at a time.  Since we have already discovered several fields that
seem to have the potential for developing to an arbitrarily large degree of
complexity (namely mathematics, social interaction, arts & literature, and
military and economic competition), there is reason to believe that SIs
might actually have lots and lots of different things to think about.  The
space occupied by the entire civilization will therefore be limited by the
details of the socioeconomic tradeoff between deeper computing resources and
social coherence.

As for your arguments from energy conservation, well, I really don't see
that they are relevant except in the closed, doomed universe scenario (in
which case SI conservation efforts should be much more all-encompassing, as
I noted earlier).  If you have figured out how to salvage, leave, or
otherwise outlive the universe, or if you are desperately looking for said
solution, what you care about is maximizing throughput.

That means you don't use stars for energy.  What you want is a small, dense
energy source - say, a small black hole that you can drop matter into.
Surround that with a thick shell of high-temperature computronium, along
with all the hardware needed to feed matter into the black hole, collect the
radiated energy, and cool the whole system (obviously, the scale of the
whole structure will be determined by the maximum energy density your energy
collection system can handle).  Ideally the black hole should be a small
fraction of the structure's mass, so you get to devote lots of matter to
doing computations.  Lastly, cover the surface of the device with the most
high-density communication system you can build.

Now you have a single computing node.  Build a few million more of them, and
with a bit of careful calculation you can arrange them in a constellation a
few tens of light-years across without any danger of gravitational collapse.
Add in a few hundred thousand solar masses of very large spacecraft (to
collect fuel, build new black holes of the optimum mass, and carry off old
ones that are too big to be useful), and you've got a credible first
approximation of an SI civilization.

Depending on what assumptions you make about the limits of technology I
could see an optimal computing node being anywhere from a few Earth masses
to several solar masses.  The spacing between nodes would be chosen to
maximize the overall density of the constellation without risking
gravitational collapse - and we don't really care how much energy it takes
to maintain the ideal separation, as long as it doesn't cause enough of a
cooling problem to impair the throughput of the nodes.

I'm not sure we're even ready to have a class on the subject, much less a 
major.
To have a good class on the topic, we'd need say twice as many good papers 
on the
topic as there are weeks in a semester.  That is, about thirty.  I don't think
we have that many yet.

REMARKS TO THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE BUSINESS ASSEMBLY by

U.S. 

Department of State, on behalf of the Secretary of State 


<paraindent><param>left</param>REMARKS TO THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE
BUSINESS ASSEMBLY



by

Kenneth C. Brill

Acting Assistant Secretary

Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs

U.S. Department of State

Reagan International Trade Center

Washington, D.C.

November 2, 1999


Good evening. Secretary Albright had very much wanted to be with you, but
she is with the President in Oslo, where the long quest for peace in the
Middle East is being pursued with renewed hope and urgency. She has asked
me to represent the Department of State in her absence, and to extend to
you all a warm welcome to Washington for this important and exciting
conference. It is my great pleasure to do so. 


- - - - -

<underline>

Introduction

</underline>

The well known writer Arthur Clarke once said that although it is true
that Earth is the cradle of humanity, we cannot remain in our cradle
forever. This first-ever global conference for the business of space
demonstrates that we have moved beyond exploratory steps outside the
cradle and are striding ahead with strength and confidence to exploit the
enormous economic and scientific potential of space.


Space activities touch the lives of ordinary citizens as never before,
not just in the United States, but around the world. Satellite dishes
pull down hundreds of channels of television programming in Central
America. GPS receivers guide millions of motorists in Japan. Programs
beamed by satellite to remote villages in India help farmers improve
their productivity. And ever more sophisticated satellite networks are
being developed to track weather patterns on a global basis. 




 

<underline>

State Department's Role

</underline>

We at the State Department are not isolated from these exciting
developments. We are not a so-called "technical agency," and so far no
one has designed 


pin-striped space suits. But we have an intense interest in the latest
developments in space exploration, space technology, and space 
commerce.


-2-


Let me review briefly the role of the Department of State in the space
arena as a consumer, facilitator, and promoter. 


 


The Department is a big consumer of space products and services. We use
satellites for instantaneous communication with our more than 200
embassies and consulates overseas. We use remote sensing imagery and the
Global Positioning System to mediate border disputes, monitor refugee
flows and human rights abuses, and respond to natural disasters. 




Many of the global issues facing us today can only be dealt with if we
understand their scientific underpinnings. Indeed, the National Research
Council, in its recent report on "Science at State," concluded that
science and technology have moved to the forefront of the international
diplomatic agenda. As a result, good diplomacy is becoming more dependent
on good science. 


Information from space-based instruments is central to the good science
we try to bring to bear on global issues. Ozone depletion, deforestation,
fish conservation, coral reef degradation, climate change and its
consequences--these are but a few of the areas where we rely heavily on
scientific analysis of data from space to inform our decision making and
build international consensus.


In addition to consuming space-based services and space-derived
information, the State Department has a significant role to play in
facilitating space cooperation. Space activities and issues are
inherently international, and the State Department has the statutory
responsibility of providing leadership within the US government on
foreign policy matters. Today, our role as facilitator is vastly more
complicated 


than it was two decades ago. With the end of the Cold War, cooperative
ventures that would have been unthinkable twenty years ago have become
commonplace. From Sputnik to the International Space Station, competition
in space has become collaboration in space. Moreover, space activities
are no longer monopolized by a handful of governments. Commercial
spending on space 


-3-


now exceeds government spending, and at least fifty countries have space
programs of some sort. In July, 100 countries sent delegates to the
United Nations' Third Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space in
Vienna, a clear indication of the expanding interest in using space to
improve lives on Earth. 




The State Department also works hard to promote the interests of the
American aerospace industry. Maintaining leadership in space has long
been a foreign policy objective of the United States. In today's arena,
"space leadership" and "aerospace industry leadership" are becoming
almost synonymous. We recognize and appreciate the major contribution
that the aerospace sector makes to US export earnings. We want to do what
we can to ensure that American companies remain at the cutting edge of
space technology and that they compete on a level playing field. 


With that general overview of how and why the State Department is
interested in space, let me turn to some projects and issues that are of
particular interest to us.


 

<underline>

International Space Station

</underline>

The first project I would like to mention is the International Space
Station. We worked closely with NASA during the 1980s to create a
partnership with Japan, Canada, and nine members of the European Space
Agency to build an International Space Station. We were just as active in
the 1990s in expanding the program to include Russia and, more recently,
Brazil. Space cooperation is hard work; national space objectives have to
be melded with foreign policy objectives, and US programmatic
requirements have to be tailored to meet those of potential partners. But
the International Space Station illustrates that it is possible to carry
out even the largest, most complex space programs on a cooperative basis.
We are convinced that uniting the world's major space powers in this
monumental, peaceful use of outer space will pay long-term dividends. 


 


-4-


 

<underline>

Global Positioning System

</underline>

Another area of special interest is satellite-based navigation. The
President's 1996 policy directive on the Global Positioning System gave
the State Department the task of consulting with other countries and
international organizations to promote GPS as a worldwide standard for
global navigation. We achieved a breakthrough last year with Japan, the
world's largest user of GPS consumer products, when President Clinton and
Prime Minister Obuchi issued a Joint Statement on GPS Cooperation. Our
attention currently is focused on Europe. The Europeans have announced
plans to build a global navigation satellite system of their own, known
as Galileo. We will begin later this month an important dialogue with the
European Union aimed at ensuring that Galileo, if built, will be fully
compatible and interoperable with GPS. 


 

<underline>

Remote Sensing

</underline>

We also spend a lot of time thinking about and dealing with remote
sensing issues. International cooperation on earth observation satellites
is already remarkably extensive. Some of you may already be familiar with
CEOS, the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites. CEOS is an informal
but very active mechanism through which space agencies from around the
world coordinate separate missions to study and monitor global phenomena.
These missions provide crucial data for a myriad of purposes, including
monitoring international environmental agreements. We work very closely
with NASA and NOAA to facilitate earth observation projects involving
satellites or instruments from two or more countries.


 


In this field, as in others, we also try to stay alert for ways to
promote innovative approaches to solving problems that transcend national
boundaries. One exciting example is a project we are trying to get
started called Peace Wing. Many of you are aware that NASA has an
Environmental Research Aircraft and Sensor Technology program (ERAST). As
a part of this program,


-5-


NASA is testing a remarkable new kind of aircraft--remote-controlled,
solar-powered, high altitude platforms that can stay aloft for months at
a time.. These airborne platforms have unique potential for extending
telecommunications and remote sensing to the most isolated parts of the
world. Through Peace Wing, we hope to promote a variety of international
applications for the ERAST aircraft, such as natural disaster prediction,
monitoring, and relief. 


It is clear that the technology available for earth observation continues
to advance at a rapid pace. Equally significant, it is no longer limited
to government agencies. We are very excited about the recent successful
launch of the IKONOS satellite, the first commercial system to acquire
and market imagery down to one-meter resolution. At the same time, we are
mindful that the emergence of a high-resolution commercial remote sensing
industry raises serious questions regarding national security and
privacy. 


For remote sensing activities, as for most space activities, our policies
must carefully balance foreign policy and national security concerns with
commercial


interests. We need to continue to ensure that space cooperation does not
inadvertently result in missile proliferation or unwarranted technology
transfer. The fact remains that the same technologies used for commercial
space launches can also be used to develop ballistic missiles. We have a
common interest in ensuring that such technologies do not fall into the
wrong hands.


 

<underline>

<bold>International Legal Regime for Space

</bold></underline><bold>

The last issue I would like to mention concerns the international legal
regime for space activities. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the UN
Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space developed the Outer Space
Treaty and three related United Nations conventions, which serve as the
bedrock of international space law. This was an example of multilateral
diplomacy at its best; the international rules that were created afford a
measure of transparency and accountability for space 


-6-


activities, without constraining national programs. But this body of law
was developed during an era when nearly all space activities were carried
out by governments. We need to begin thinking about whether it is
adequate for the coming era of space commercialization--an era in which
entrepreneurs may seek to earn a profit from activities such as space
tourism, mining of asteroids, or waste disposal in space. It is not too
early for government and industry to begin a dialogue on whether some
modest additions to the current body of international space law would be
appropriate. 

</bold><underline>

 


Leadership Requires Resources

</underline>

The challenging space agenda of the new millenium demands effective
leadership. In the international arena, the Department of State stands
ready to provide that leadership. It is painfully clear, however, that we
lack the resources we need to address the wide array of global,
science-related issues that face us today. We are well aware, for
example, that the average time it takes to process licenses for space
technology exports has increased, and that this sometimes hurts US
businesses. This stems not from any lack of will or


motivation on the State Department's part, but very simply from a lack of
resources. 


The plain fact of the matter is that the resources for most of the State
Department's day-to-day activities have been cut to the bone in recent
years.. If America is to retain its leadership in new areas like space,
as well as in traditional areas like brokering peace agreements between
age-old antagonists in the Middle East or Ireland, we need resources to
do the job. Talk is cheap; results take resources. 


 


 


In closing, let me say that the State Department applauds and
congratulates the organizers of this first global conference for the
business of space. We join you in being proud of America's past
accomplishments in space and excited about the unlimited possibilities
of


-7-


the future. I know I speak for Secretary Albright when I say the
Department of State stands ready to work closely with America's space
community to maintain America's leading position in space. 


Thank you.

Good point. I stipulate that there is only <God>.

Here is another reason your analogy with memes like
<war> is still not very good; there are actual wars.

However, I still think that the fact that people use
<God> proves that <God> is useful, like <absolute
zero>. Does it bother you when people say "absolute
zero"? How about "the average man"?

 > Second most destructive cocept; communism.

<Communism> is second on the list, eh? Pretty
impressive for a meme that has had less than two
centuries to do its dirty work. If the Soviet Union
hadn't collapsed, it could have had a shot at #1! I'm
glad you've thought about it and it wasn't just an
off-the-cuff remark; it must be pretty hard to rank
these memes.

Don't feel bad; most of the people who use the word don't understand
it fully either, using it as a hip substitute for "idea".  Pick up a
copy of Richard Dawkins' _Selfish Gene_ without further delay for the
origin and full explanation of the word.

In short, a "meme" is a pattern that replicates by the mechanism of
learning or imitation.  Things like the use of clothes; the practice
of marriage; handshaking; religious beliefs; cooking techniques.
Under certain conditions, such patterns can produce phenotypes that
compete and lead to evolution of complex meme pools ("culture") the
same way genetic evolution leads to complex species.  One big
difference, though, is that memetic evolution is Lamarckian: you can
pass on memes acquired within your lifetime.

The term meme was coined around 1975 by Richard Dawkins, the great Oxford University zoologist.  He noted that genes are the fundamental units of biological reproduction and that sometimes ideas, catchy tunes and chain letters sometimes replicate themselves from mind to mind in a way analogous to genes.
He called these self-replicating entities memes.  
The most accessible example is that tune you hear somebody whistling and you find yourself humming it even though you don't want to and may not even like the tune!
It has replicated itself in you, if only for a moment.
And now, the meme of the meme has just reproduced itself!

If people didn't get something out of the concept of god, how long do you
think the idea would last?

I know lots of people who claim that God saved their lives, or at least
changed them for the better.

Communism is a religion.  Communism is what happens when you take the simple
idea that helping, sharing, and planning are a good idea, and make a
religion out of it.

Any good idea, becomes hideous when people make a religion out of it.

It would be nice to be able to study self-organizing systems without needing
to be engaged in a post-graduate math or physics program.  Or AI without
needing a bullet-proof computer science and math background.  Or cognitive
neuroscience without a degree in biology, or psychology.

The technical nature of these subjects require substantial preparation.  But
by not addressing these topics at the undergraduate level, I think too much
of the "good stuff" is saved 'til later and not many students get exposed to
them.

I think there is plenty of material that could be reduced and simplified to
an undergraduate survey level and integrated in a one semester - or even one
year - class.  This would doubly serve the purposes of exposing many more
people to these fascinating topics, as well as presenting an integrative
perspective that will benefit them in their later studies.

Any thoughts?

I answer your question at the bottom, but first a little housekeeping:

I think I have been feeding a pointless fire.  You are certainly welcome to come in and stir the pot, but it is of little use if you ignore most of my comments and questions.(my previous two replies to your post's)

Perhaps if you could clearly define the points you want to make or the questions you want answered we could have a useful exchange.

You continually seem to be arguing  for some kind of spirituality or transcendent belief.  It would helpful if you would just come out and state it rather than beating around the (burning?) bush.  Last week, you signed your posts with: "the holy hand grenade of Antioch".  That smacks of religious overtones.  If you have a religious ax to grind, send it in and I will grind it, but if all you have is provocative comments that you intend to rile atheists with, that is a sad waste of time.

As for Uncle Waldo:

He is dead and probably decaying.  He is irretrievable until somekind of Tiplerian Omega Point. (which you can read about in Frank Tipler's book if you care to know more about it). 

Let me put it a simpler way: People die,  then the living then grieve, other people stop by to say: "Oh it's so dreadful that old so and so is dead but they have gone to a better ___________________ .  Some people find comfort in these words and others realize that it is a comforting fantasy.

Immortality is a hard technical problem.  It will be solved, probably sooner than we think.  Spiritual Mumbo Jumbo is just that--worthless.  If Waldo was born a few decades later and wanted to partake of extropian technologies this conversation would be a moot point.  (it may be anyway)

If you want to define your personal grief as a spiritual problem, fine, then do it.  I see death as a technological problem that is likely to be solved within the next half-century.  

Again, I challenge you to be straightforward in your questions and replies so that we might achieve some understanding.  It is not enough just to try and piss atheists off.

Steve

You misunderstand the concept of meme's.  Then again.....maybe you don't. The 
point is that in a certain number of brains......<god> finds a fertile 
nesting area and replicates.  

This replication has nothing to do with how 'real" <god> is or whether or not 
it benifits the brains that it infects.

The multiple evolutionary processes, all leading to the same result --
visual simulation of the environment by means of a manifold structure
we call an "eye" -- has always been of great interest.  Now, however,
we have established a new discipline, "exobiology", to investigate a
much greater array of evolutionary outcomes in the exotic ecologies
expected on exoplanets.

Larry Klaes <lklaes@bbn.com> brought this article to my attention
and I noticed how it could serve to emphasize the inestimable scope
of evolutionary possibilities; this should encourage optimism as we 
investigate the universe to determine the cosmic distribution of life.
Perhaps the most important inference is that a very large number of 
processes seen potentially available to actualize diverse modes of 
behavior which, at least analogically, we would not hesitate to to 
interpret as exhibiting a high order of intelligence.

                                     -o-o-o-o-o-o-

ITHACA, N.Y. -- An unusual type of eye -- resembling a tiny raspberry
and possibly following a design principle that vanished with the extinction
of trilobites hundreds of millions of years ago -- lives today in a parasitic
insect, Cornell University biologists report in the Nov. 5 issue of the journal
Science.

The compound eyes of most insects have many hundreds of lens facets,
each sampling only one small point in the insect's visual field, but the
composite lens eyes of strepsipteran insects have no more than 50 facets.

Fewer facets does not mean poorer vision, the Cornell biologists believe.
The strepsipteran lenses are larger, and each has about 100 receptors,
forming an individual retina behind each lens. According to the investigators,
this kind of eye is well equipped to sample not points but "chunks" of the
visual field, greatly improving the visual capabilities of these strange insects.

"No other insect that we know of has eyes quite like this," said Ron Hoy,
professor of neurobiology and behavior at Cornell and co-author, with
Cornell postdoctoral associates Elke Buschbeck and Birgit Ehmer, of
the Science report. "The only place one may see a comparable eye
structure is in the fossils of some kinds of trilobites," he says, referring
to the extinct arthropods that lived in shallow seas during the Paleozoic era.

    quemes = emes? not long after i read _the selfish gene_, i starting 
thinking that memes and genes were subsets of 'emes' in general, where an eme 
was any pattern of cause and effect that spread across and ran on multiple 
substrates. so, pool balls being hit could be viewed as emetic substrates of 
a sort, with momentum being the eme... i guess my beef with this viewpoint is 
that its waaaaay to general, so it probably doesnt help much if your looking 
for explanative/predictive functionality. however, with refinement it might 
become something useful...

This is tiresome.  Baiting me, quoting me out of context.  I don't think you have read all of my posts.
Calling me names.  This is so unproductive.  If you have a point please make it.  Otherwise, I am through responding to these "Nah, Nah" types of posts.

We're assuming that they're hiding, and if they want to hide, I'd tend
to assume that they're hiding pretty darn well.  This theory isn't one
that gets tested by looking, because it doesn't predict that we'd find
anything.  This theory is one that's generated by other theories about
racial psychologies, the Universal distribution of intelligence, and the
persistence of initial programming in Powers.  It's the subtheories that
are testable.

Besides which, if they've got hardware subtle enough to read our minds,
they've got hardware subtle enough to intercept the output of any
microscopes advanced enough to spot the nanoagents.  Or they might have
descriptor-theory scanners (or some other kind of ontotechnology) that
can just directly read out the state of local reality in ways no
pre-Singularity culture could spot.

I still think the theories are pointless, because, believe it or not,
I'm a pragmatic guy.  In most of these exotic theories, either not much
is at stake, or the only significant action is still a Singularity.  So
why speculate?  We know what comes next; let's *do* it and get it over with.

Oh, give me a break.  Are you saying the statements "All people are made
of atoms" or "All atoms obey the laws of physics" are not meaningful?  I
think you're objecting to the fact that "sin" lacks a clear definition,
which has nothing to do with the generality or lack thereof.  After all,
all tangerines are not sinners, so "sin" is less general than "atomic substrate".

And why?  Because "sin" has not been clearly defined except as
"something you should feel guilty about", making it a statement with
emotional value but almost no logical value.

As a Randian Atheist growing up in small-town North Georgia, I well recall 
how easily religion could be used to justify just about anything.  A good 
high-school friend of mine, early adopter, techno-nerd radio tinkerer, CB 
enthusiast, etc., replied to my tentative, "so what do you think about these 
atheists?" with, "I think we ought to just hang em from the nearest tree."  
And he was serious.

Religion has set up a boundary between ethics and rationality.  God, the 
divine enforcer, tells us what to do, or else.  I mean what kind of maline 
jerk would torture people for infinity for not believing he existed?  Yet 
this IS the moral standard espoused by most popular religions.  So, try to 
argue rational ethics with most religious folk and see how far you get.

"Thomas Paine, God damn his name."  That's the start of a little ditty sung 
by the faithful in this nation of the brave and free.  Paine, the real 
father of our revolution, had gone to France to help out with their 
ill-fated revolution.  Because of a treatise he wrote defending religious 
liberty (!) in response to the practice of beheading people just for being 
priests, he was almost beheaded himself - rescued literally at the last 
moment.  When he came back home, he found himself attacked for the same 
treatise, on the basis that he was defending atheism!  He was literally 
hounded to his grave by the faithful, who then dug up his bones and 
scattered them, as a lesson to other atheists.

The need for Snow's Two Cultures to synchronize, and for ethics - and the 
related disciplines such as politics and law - to catch up with physics can 
hardly be overemphasized as we approach the point that Conrad Schneider 
predicted in the late '70's, when our power to destroy ourselves completely 
becomes too much for any conceivable defense.  The literal "God said it, I 
believe it, that settles it" mentality is one of the primary blocks to that 
happening.

Anders are you a fan of the 70s series Kung Fu?  Wasnt that a cool

was almost superfluous.  It was so cerebral, so idea-ey, meditative,
way out of character for its time.   spike

Quotes from the October 23,1999 edition of New Scientist:

  'Master  of survival, can withstand pressures six times greater than those at
the bottom of the ocean and endure temperatures ranging from more than 100 C
down to absolute zero. Can shrug off lethal radiation, survive in a vacuum and
go without water for more than a century.
  It sounds like the resume of a superhero. But these traits belong to
little-known animals less than a milliter long that probably live on your
rooftop. Like superheroes, the animals conceal their cylindrical bodies, stumpy
legs and tiny claws have earned them the nicknames of "water bears" and "moss
piglets".
.......
  Substituting trehalose for the water in membranes allows tardigrades to
survive for long periods without any water at all. The record is 120 years, held
by tardigrades taken from dried-out moss kept in a museum in Italy. Once their
membranes are safely coseted by trehalose, the animals can shut down their
metabolism and survive without oxygen or food.
  Surviving extreme cold requires yet another clever trick. When they freeze,
the animals have to protect themselves against damage caused as ice crystals
grow. Westh has identified large proteins in an Arctic tardigrade that raise the
freezing point of the animal to ensure that it freezes quickly. This 
creates lots of tiny crystals that are less likely than large ones to
damage cells, enabling some species to survive freezing in liquid helium.
.........
  What can we learn from these survival experts? Harnessing the tardigrades
powers of self-preservation, Seki and his team have used trehalose to store rat
hearts for 10 days before reviving them (New Scientist, 7 November 1998 p 7).
The goal is to develop long-term organ banks for transplant operations. "We
believe that this method can be effectively applied to prolong the storage
periods of other organs as well," he says.
  If brains can follow the hearts, then the preservation and resuscitation of
whole bodies might not be far behind. At present, only single mammalian cells
such as blood and sperm can be reliably stored for long periods, but tardigrades
have around 40,000 cells, including nerves. Such suspended animation has long
been the staple fare of science fiction, allowing humans to endure the tedium of
crossing vast interstellar distances. So while tardigrades might not have come
from the planet Tardigron, they might one day lead us there."

Fellow Extropians,

	We've been working on building a new infrastructure for the
extropy web sight.  We're in the process of moving to a new server
(Provided graciously by David McFadzean) and have installed a bunch of
tools like jrun, java server pages, a MySQL database and so on.  We
now have our own machine dedicated to www.extropy.com.

	The first addition using this infrastructure is the new Extropy
Bookstore.  You can see a mostly working prototype here <URL:
http://www.extropy.com/bookstore/agent.jsp>. You can type in a title
and it will go off and search all affiliates for the best price.  And
if you make a purchase from the resulting pages, the Extropy Institute
will receive the amount indicated.  Feel free to use this extropy
agent to help you find the best price for all your shopping during the
upcoming holiday seasons.

	But of course, there is lots more we'd like to do with all
this.  We'd like to make the agent more reliable, add more book stores
to search, make the results page have a more useful format, create a
database of extropian ranked and recommended books which can be
purchased through this agent...

	So, if anyone wants to help out with some java programming,
MySQL, Java Server Pages, dynamic html graphic layout...  or has any
other ideas of how we can make things better, Please give us a call!
We can use any and all help!

	As it says on the book store page: Help us create the heaven
some others only pray and die for.

	Onward!

		Brent Allsop <allsop@extropy.org>

To be honest, I feel that the atheists who get pissed-off, under these 
generally, friendly circumstances of email exchanges, must feel challenged by 
anyone who is not an atheist.   I cannot imagine why, if this is true?  If I 
am foolish enough to believe in God and you don't;  how does that adversely 
effect you? 

Regarding this phrase "the holy hand grenade of Antioch" obviously you are 
not a Python fan, and the less said on that the better!

<As for Uncle Waldo:

<He is dead and probably decaying.  He is irretrievable until somekind of 
Tiplerian <Omega Point. (which you can read about in Frank Tipler's book if 
you care to know <more about it). 

I have read Tipler's "Physics" and his earlier work with John Barrow on the 
Final Anthropic Principle, I really did enjoy his work.  However, Professor 
Tipler has been extremely, quiet, regarding his Immortality book, and I am 
not sure if any other physical scientist has signed on to his Omega Point 
theory. Quite the contrary, he seems to have been uniformly and harshly 
criticized.  I have wondered if any of Professor Tipler's students have ever 
carried the baton forward regarding the Omega Point? Probably not.

So whether one is a theist, atheist, or agnostic; we are biologically all in 
the same boat of the good ship, mortality. How's that for closure?

Well, I wouldn't call myself a fan, but since I often work at my
computer with the television on during the late night hours, I have
assimilated maybe too many reruns of the series. While I found the
basic story weak and often corny, it raised interesting issues about
personal value systems, codes of honor and ways of acting. As a
television series, it was unusually aware of some real eastern
thinking, even if it often took the easy way out anyway.

I think we can learn useful stuff even from late night re-runs. Just
modelling some of the characters can be an useful exercise or tool.

I think you have a point with 'emes'. (however, the term emetic is not
very good - it is medicalese for a drug that produces vomiting :-) It
reminds me a bit of soliton waves, where a soliton wave doesn't
disperse and generally behaves as a kind of particle. Maybe an
interesting class of emes would be the discrete emes that don't
disperse quickly (like an electromagnetic wave would, when it reflects
from the environment). The momentum of the pool ball might or might
not belong to this class depending on the timescale you use (in the
long run the momentum has dispersed into heat). Such emes may interact
with each other and the environment, replicate and sometimes die
out. Their discreteness makes them easier to handle than just general
effects that spread over multiple substrates. I'm still not sure what
explanative/predictive functionality they might have, but it seems to
me that we need a vocabulary to speak about substrate independent (or
weakly substrate coupled) phenomena.

Greetings, allthis is the first article/whatever that
I've ever posted on here, so don't expect it to be
terrifically spectacular. It's just a story idea of
mine that needs a bit of refinement before I can
incorporate it into a plot.
Anyway.
Basically, if you've read Larry Niven's the "Integral
Trees", you probably have a good idea on the theory of
life in a gas torus. Well, I have no intentions of
writing a story like that, but I was thinking that if
some kind of fungus.(long pause here while I get
reorganised).well.
In theory, if life is possible in a gas torus, there
could be some form of fungus there. It would probably
be adjusted to feed off of gases and organic debris,
and it would of course shoot of spores at the
appropriate stage in its life span. The spores would
probably destroy most of the fungus in the process of
being ejected, and would either get caught by the
gravity of the gas torus and remain in its orbit or be
shot into the rest of space, where it would be capable
of floating for many millenia until it came into a
place where the circumstances where right for it to
revive and continue the cycle. Some of these would end
up getting hopelessly loss, others would probably be
crashed into by stray objects, and some would probably
crash into planets, on some of which at least they
would remain dormant and hollow. Creatures would erect
settlements in any around them, andwell, that slips
into my story plot.
But what I'm trying to figure out is the basic
dynamics of the fungi-creation, how large the adult
stage and the spores would be, the composition of its
diet, gestation (such as it is) et cetera. I am of the
opinion that they would have to be fairly large, the
fungus reaching maybe three miles across, or sobut
that gives any of the spores that crash into a planet
or planetoid a good chance of creating a small ice
age. Of course, the fungus wasn't exactly designed to
be a friendly visitor to distant planets, and that
would provide some amusing history for the people in
the story.... I'd really appreciate some input on
this. 


My thanks,

Neal M. Swain

I know.  But there are many ways of getting a payoff that aren't necessarily
beneficial.  For instance, drug users get something out of using their drug,
even if it is otherwise ruining their lives.  Women who stay with men who
beat them are getting some kind of payoff, even though we many think they
are nuts.

Isn't the above paragraph missing a sentence, maybe along
the lines of "oh, and death would be a thing of the past".

ifeminists.com: 21st Century Feminism
CHICAGO - With the opening of ifeminists.com today
 (http://www.ifeminists.com/) , the women's
 movement takes a giant step forward into 21st Century Feminism.
 In recent years, American feminism has come to be associated with anger
 toward men who, as a class, are viewed as the political enemy. Many
 feminists have attacked the sexual choices of adult women who enjoy
 consuming and posing for pornography. Others have called for the government
 to impose affirmative action policies and speech codes. Some feminists even
 want to ban new reproductive technologies that offer hope to infertile
 women.

 "ifeminists.com smashes the feminist stereotypes," says Wendy McElroy, the
 site's editor and an internationally recognized leader in the individualist
 feminist (ifeminist) movement. "A new generation of women are facing the
 millennium. They deserve a new feminist paradigm that celebrates the
 diversity of their choices and the wonders that technology can offer to
 them. ifeminists.com is an on-ramp to this new way of thinking about
 feminist issues."

 "Freedom and choice do not threaten women. Government and orthodoxy do,"
 says McElroy. "Pornography and prostitution? Let women do what they want to
 with their own bodies. Verbal sexual harassment? If women want an equal
 right to explore their own sexuality, they risk encountering the offensive
 sexual attitudes of others."

 ifeminists.com invites women and men to come online to socialize, to learn,
 and to explore a wealth of information. The site offers an Introduction
 section that includes a "Frequently Asked Questions" page and an "Are you
an
 ifeminist?" quiz. For the activist, the Interaction section offers a
 directory of the site's members, an interactive message board, and a live
 chat room. For scholars and students, the Information section features a
 comprehensive and constantly expanding database of hundreds of
individualist
 feminist resources.

 Visitors are invited to become members of ifeminists.com for free. Of the
 first 1,000 people to register during November, 200 will be randomly
 selected to receive a complimentary audiotape recorded by Wendy McElroy.
Her
 controversial speech critiques policies such as affirmative action and laws
 against sexual harassment.

 ifeminists.com is a project of The Henry Hazlitt Foundation, a
Chicago-based
 non-profit organization that produces Free-Market.Net: The Freedom Network.
 McElroy is the author of books including "XXX: A Woman's Right to
 Pornography" (St. Martin's, 1995), and, most recently, "Queen Silver: The
 Godless Girl" (Prometheus, Dec. 1999). She has been published in magazines
 as diverse as National Review, Penthouse, and Marie Claire.

What happens when you take a bad idea and make a religion

Here's the actual release from the Department of Justice on the antitrust case
against Microsoft.  About 400K in .PDF form.  Somewhat interesting reading.  The
judge ruled that Microsoft has monopoly power over it's market.  A ruling will
follow, but no date for that is mentioned.

Why a large fungus? I don't see any reason to have a big and massive
fungus. In the environment you describe, mass seems to be at a
premium, so a more likely form would be a broad net of sticky strands
to collect as much matter as possible - it might be very large, but
flimsy. Of course, for your story you might need a massive fungus, but
evolution doesn't seem to favor it. Sending away spores with an
explosion might be useful on the ground, but in the zero gravity
environment of the ring it would be much easier to glide far away from
the mother colony (I would expect some self-propelling spores, a bit
like oceanic plankton).

The space-travelling plant idea has been done several times, maybe you
can invent something stranger? What about some kind of reef-building
creatures with a symbiotic ecology, that break loose chunks of the
spherical reefs to replicate it? That might produce a similar effect.

This is likely something that differs from university to
university. Here we have undergraduate courses in neural networks,
cognitive psychology, AI and even some biomedicine including
neuroscience. It might not be that deep, but it is at least possible
to get a "sip" of the stuff. But it is still clear that many students
feel that all the good stuff is beyond their level, and they get very
excited when you drop it into their courses (I have had great fun
throwing in the occasional neuropsychology perspective in a course on
text and image processing I helped with).

     Paul is quite correct.  The whole point of my "Array of Search

radio/optical seti to searching for physical traces of a probe.   My own

Space Vehicles Arrive -- But Whose?

By Jim Oberg
Special to www.space.com

Nov 05 1999 09:44:43 ET  
Everybody knows what space vehicles look like on the way up. The explosive 
steam-enshrouded liftoff becomes a fiery upward trail, brighter than the sun. 
The rocket rises, dims and arches over, aiming to throw itself beyond the 
horizon and into space.

But even after decades of space operations, many people remain in the dark 
about what space vehicles look like when they come back. 

Satellite orbits slowly decay into near-circular paths, skimming the upper 
atmosphere. Moving at 8,000 meters per second [17,000 miles per hour], they 
begin to flame at an altitude of 110 kilometers [68 miles], falling to 80-100 
kilometers after five to ten minutes. 

At that point, maximum heating and deceleration cause them to break up into 
fragments, which continue their gradual descent for another five or ten 
minutes. Surviving fragments slow to 3,000 meters per second [6,700 miles per 
hour] at a height of about 50 kilometers [31 miles], where the flames die 
out. 

At the cost of their own existence, these hunks of cast-off space junk 
provide earthlings with thrilling fireworks. However, when the dazzling 
fireballs unexpectedly pierce the darkness, surprise, confusion and innocent 
misidentification often result.

Who built the flying triangle?
Early last September, U.S. observers were treated to two glaring examples of 
this phenomenon. A pair of larger-than-usual pieces of space debris fell back 
into the atmosphere, one crossing the California-Oregon border late on 
September 1, and the other streaking from New Orleans to central Florida 
early September 7. Both sparked widespread amazement and awe, as well as 
disbelief in "official explanations" and a new crop of UFO reports. 

Just before 9:30 PM PDT [12:30 AM ET] on September 1, viewers along the 
Pacific Coast and as far inland as Nevada and Utah were treated to the fiery 
spectacle of a tight formation of multi-colored flaming fireballs crossing 
the sky, leaving smoke in their wake.

Some observers noticed an even more spectacular apparition. Near Travis AFB, 
a 13-year-old boy identified only as "Ben" told his local paper he had seen a 
large dark craft with running lights.

"It's got to be either something the [Air Force] base made or a spacecraft 
from a different world," he told the reporter. "There were huge blue flames 
coming out of a triangular object." 

According to an account distributed by California ufologist Frank Moreno, Ben 
described the object as "a huge black mass which might have gone unnoticed if 
it were not for this trailing flame which shone behind it." The boy estimated 
the eastward-moving object -- festooned with small white running lights -- 
was no more than 300 feet [92 meters] off the ground.

Observers barely had time to collect and examine these California reports 
when a second apparition blazed over the Gulf of Mexico. As on the West Coast 
a week earlier, many people saw a formation of fireballs, but a few saw only 
a single object with blazing lights or "windows."

One truck driver rolled down his window and was shocked to see a huge 
"object" that he estimated was only 75 yards [68 meters] away. As he 
remembered the encounter, the UFO had a "blimp-like shape" and was about 450 
feet [138 meters] long, with large windows that emanated a bluish light. 

Robert Russell, a maintenance employee at the First United Methodist Church 
in Sarasota, Florida, told UFO investigators he pulled off the highway to 
watch a similar object: "It was like light and I could see the outline of the 
passenger windows, but I couldn't see any wings. I thought it might be a 
blimp...." 

Rejecting the official story
Public affairs experts at US Space Command in Colorado Springs quickly 
explained that the fireballs were falling space junk. The first object was a 
spent fourth stage of a Russian communications satellite launched the 
previous February; the second was the discarded third stage from a similar 
launch just the day before. 

But many witnesses and ufologists jeered in derision. On his UFOSEEK web 
page, ufologist Ignatius Graffeo insisted that "a spent rocket booster . . 
.would be fiery, burning up, falling fast, and would not be displaying 
blinking red, green and amber colored lights in a controlled slow moving 
flight." 

Frank Moreno, who had distributed "Ben's" sighting, was equally certain. The 
reports "seem contrary to falling space debris" he said, because they 
"indicate multiple lights, flying in controlled formations, parallel to the 
ground on their own trajectories," certainly not "what would be expected of 
falling space debris."

A classic misunderstanding
Sadly for alien seekers, these reports are actually "classic" cases of 
sightings of falling satellites, according to the "bible" of UFO 
investigators, The UFO Handbook (Doubleday, 1979).

Written 20 years ago by Allan Hendry, then the ace investigator for the 
Center for UFO Studies in Illinois, the book documented the kinds of 
eyewitness reports that different mundane stimuli can provoke. 

According to the book, meteors and returning satellites have led to reports 
of " 'downed planes', missiles, fireballs, comets, 'swept-wing jets', cigars, 
saucers, sparklers, and sometimes formations of individual lights." 

In particular, Hendry noted that "re-entries of orbiting material move in a 
flat trajectory" parallel to the Earth, and can be visible for up to three 
minutes as they slowly cross the sky.

Astronomer (and talented space artist) William Hartman went one step farther 
in his 1968 perceptual analysis for the USAF's "Scientific Study of 
Unidentified Flying Objects". Based on actual case files, he described what a 
witness may mistakenly perceive when seeing a formation of bright fireballs: 
"He may even imagine a dark elongated form connecting them so that they 
become lights on a cigar-shaped object, or even windows on a cigar-shaped 
object."

A web that's out of this world NASA and network gurus are working together
to extend the Internet to other worlds in the next five years.

http://www.msnbc.com/modules/exports/ct_infobeat.asp?/news/325201.asp

By Alan Boyle MSNBC

Nov. 5 - NASA and network gurus are working together to extend the
Internet to other worlds in the next few years. But there are some limits
that not even the World Wide Web can route around, such as the speed of
light. So the builders of the Interplanetary Internet are going back to
the basics, retooling protocols for future communications with Mars and
beyond. 

FOR THE PAST year or so, the vision of the Interplanetary Internet has
been championed by such visionaries as Vinton Cerf, one of the Internet's
founding fathers. 

"By 2040, we hope a stable interplanetary backbone can be established
between the planets," Cerf said last month at a White House presentation.
Meanwhile, behind the scenes, engineers are adapting Internet architecture
to space communications, with funding from NASA as well as the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency's Next Generation Internet project. 

Why do it? It's not just so Mars colonists can hear a cheery "you've got
mail" from their computers in 2040 - although space experts say a sense of
connectedness could be important in combating the isolation of
long-duration missions. At least in the short term, the biggest users of
the Interplanetary Net will not be humans, but robots. 

In fact, Adrian Hooke of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory argues that the
infant Interplanetary Internet is already in action, just as ARPANET
prefigured what we now know as the Internet. More than 100 space missions
have signed up to use protocols standardized by the international
Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems. 

Internet pioneer Vinton Cerf discusses the global network's past and its
interplanetary future on CNBC. 

The current studies are defining "how we need to grow and expand these
underpinnings over the next 20-odd years, i.e., what new protocols and
communications capabilities we will need," he said in an e-mail exchange. 

THE ROAD AHEAD

Standardization is just one of the driving forces behind the
Interplanetary Net. NASA is moving toward "faster, cheaper, better" space
probes - and more of them. If off-the-shelf technologies can be adapted to
those robotic missions, so much the better. 

"We steal what we can, bend when we need to, and as a last resort start
over and design something from scratch. But that's so expensive that it's
something we don't want to do," said Hooke, who is manager of NASA's space
mission operations standardization program.  Lessons gained from the
growth of the Internet - and particularly wireless networking - can keep
NASA from having to reinvent the wheel as space missions proliferate,
Hooke explained. 

PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS But there's a big difference between using the
Internet on Earth and connecting with Mars - a minimum of 34.6 million
miles of difference, to be specific. Even at the speed of light, it takes
radio signals three minutes to travel that far. And since the distance
between Mars and Earth is constantly changing, the travel time could be as
long as 20 minutes. Those kinds of time delays would wreak havoc on a
classical Internet, said Bob Durst, an engineer at Mitre Corp. who is
working on the architecture for the Interplanetary Net, also known as the
IPN. 

"The Internet suite is pretty heavily based on the notion of
interactivity," he explained. Communicating computers trade signals back
and forth on a scale of milliseconds, checking to make sure packets are
received intact and re-sending them if necessary. 

"That's real handy for us when you're in a terrestrial environment, but
when you get into round-trip times of 10 minutes, that just doesn't work," 
Durst said. "You can't take delays much past five minutes or so." To cope
with this cosmic speed limit, network architects envision a "network of
Internets," linked together with new protocols. They draw comparisons to
the Pony Express and United Parcel Service. "We need to distill out all
the interactivity and bundle up all the information into a single
transaction that has everything needed to process the information, either
interactively or noninteractively, on the other side," Durst said. 

Each planet would have a gateway to manage data traffic over the
interplanetary backbone. For example, NASA's Deep Space Network, which
NASA uses now to communicate with distant probes like Galileo, could be
the gateway for Earth.  "It's like dropping a package at UPS," Durst said. 
"The notion is that you submit your data in the form of a bundle to a
gateway that says, 'I'm going to accept your data ... here's a claim
ticket, and I'll let you know when it's there ... if you want to be
notified.'" 

To use another comparison, the Interplanetary Internet would be like
e-mail: Mission controllers would entrust their transmissions to the Net
gateway, with a "soft expectation" that the bundle of data will eventually
get to the right destination. 

Some other twists will be required: Bandwidth and memory are extremely
limited when you go beyond Earth, so engineers want to avoid having to
keep an updated Internet address book on every spacecraft.  Instead, data
traffic would be routed to the proper gateway (say, "earth.sol" or
"mars.sol"). The gateway would then figure out how to get it to the exact
address specified by the sender. 

Also, since celestial objects are constantly moving in relation to each
other, the communication paths between gateways will have to stretch and
turn like a cat's cradle between a child's moving fingers. That's where
the experience of wireless telecom providers like Iridium and Teledesic
will come in handy, Hooke said.  Security is another big concern: What's
to stop someone from hacking into Mars' interplanetary gateway? 

"We're making assumptions that because the bandwidth is still going to be
precious ... access to the Interplanetary Internet is something that
needsto be mediated," replied Howard Weiss, an engineer at Sparta Corp. 
That means not everyone will be allowed to send messages to
rover@pathfinder.mars.sol, at least in the short term. 

NASA's Deep Space Network will still be limited, although one company is
working on a secure Web-based system for controlling spacecraft from
laptop computers.  Weiss said the lack of interactivity over so-called
"bundle space" means that the latest crypto protocols, based on public-key
exchange, can't be used. "We're going to have to go back to the good old
golden days ... and use things like pre-shared keys," he said. Other
time-honored protocols such as BitNet and UUCP - which provided the
foundation for newsgroups - also may be adapted, said Eric Travis, an
engineer at Global Science and Technology. 

WHAT THE NET WILL DO

When it comes to putting these networking theories in practice, all eyes
turn to Mars. "Think of it as the first stop on the Interplanetary
Internet," said Chad Edwards, manager of the Mars Network Project Office
at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 

NASA's Hooke said the Mars lander and orbiter, both due to be launched in
2001, would communicate with each other using their own style of "Internet
service," but Edwards' project would build a real telecom constellation
around the Red Planet. The telecom satellites could hitch rides on Mars
missions every two years, beginning in 2003. 

"As his Mars Network constellation builds up, we will progressively add
more IPN-derived standard protocols to his communications suite," Hooke
said. "We will also try to start infusing regular terrestrial Internet
capabilities into the Mars rover and lander missions as we get the chance,
probably starting about 2005." 

The Mars Network could greatly increase the data flow back to Earth,
Edwards said. Back in 1997, Mars Pathfinder could only send 30 megabits of
data per day back to Earth, which averages out to 300 bits per second, he
said. In contrast, typical modems on personal computers transmit data at
rates up to 56,000 bits per second. 

The Mars Network could relay data at more than 30 times Pathfinder's rate,
or an average of 11,000 bits per second. That is enough to send back a
full-resolution, 360-degree panorama of the Red Planet every day.  By
2007, Edwards said, there could be a "permanent robotic presence" on Mars,
pumping data back and forth using Internet protocols, and communicating
with Earth via a central gateway.  He even envisions a relay satellite
flying 10,625 miles (17,000kilometers) above Mars, in an orbit stationary
with respect to the Red Planet. Such a satellite could transmit 1 megabit
of data per second, enoughfor a continuous video feed via the Mars
Channel.  That kind of bandwidth also could be used to send back a
detailedvirtual-reality representation of the Martian surface - in a
sense, allowing scientists and sightseers to study Mars without leaving
Earth. 

"The public may just want to go for a walk on Mars. ... And with a gigabit
of data, I can bring a rock from Mars to here, plop it in front of a field
geologist and let him look at it," Edwards said.  Although this may sound
like blue-sky thinking, it's not too early to lay the technical foundation
for the reality yet to be, Hooke said. And he's hoping that the next
generation will help out with what he views as one of this world's most
intriguing research projects. 

"There are some great Ph.D.s to be mined here," he said. "This is cool
technology." Hooke already has written the International Organization for
Standardization in Geneva to ask what would be required to set up
"earth.sol" and "moon.sol" superdomains.  "It provoked an interesting
exchange with those guys," he said. "They said I essentially had to get
the sovereign representatives of the moon and the earth to write them a
letter."

I'm going to respond to Billy's note and then suggest a temporary
"hold" on this discussion because it seems needed.

Robin and others have raised good points and to put them all in
perspective I need to present a coherent rationale on the other
side. I don't know if I will be able to prepare that soon since this
month I'm in Moscow and am in business plan writing mode, but it is on
my todo list.

But this could easily be an assumption similar to those we had before
the invention of the microscope.  Before that, we couldn't "see"
bacteria we had no theories about their existence!

I want to stress that I don't start with the assumptions in the Drake
equation.  I start with the problems I have with physicists making
up new particles (MACHOS) to explain the observed galaxy masses.

I put my making up "intelligence populating the universe" as being
on equal footing with the physicists making up MACHOS, except mine
at least has an existing concrete example of 1, while theirs requires
has no concrete examples [both require a lot of theoretical hand waving].

Actually, I try to limit "behavioral" choices to those that are *highly*
rational (driven by the physical laws and optimal solutions to problems).
If we can define those, then we probably have the "simplest" explanation.

I don't find them useless, they help me refine the points I need to make
to have people consider alternate explanations.

It is true, the only way this thing can hold together is if I can
limit the assumptions to those that rationally make sense.  The
environmental niches and evolutionary histories of SI-ETC may
be so complex however that simple explanations may become very
complex.  If so the natural history of SI-ETC is going to be as
difficult to comprehend as modern physics.

But you can't explain "all of the observations".  I've got 5+ astronomical
"observational problems" that do not have good explanations.  Right now of
the only problem I see in astronomy that may get a believable solution
in the near future is the cosmic ray bursts (blazars, etc.).  The
arguments there seem to be holding up without inventing new physics,
cosmological constants, etc.

> Why, then, should I add in
> the complicating assumption that there must be SIs out there somewhere?

Because you have two problems you have got to solve:
  (a) the lack of aforementioned explanations for astronomical observations.
  (b) the really thorny problem of "We are alone".
      [We *are* on the SI evolutionary path.  You have a lot of explaning to
       to do if we are *unique* in 200+ billion stars in 200+ billion galaxies.]

IMO, the weight of (*b*) is *so* strong that even if you had completely
consistent non-magical explanations for what you observe that you had
better not trust them too much unless they can *explain* completely
the process by which (b) occurs.  [As things are now, people use the
observations to assume (b), but that doesn't explain *why* its true.]

If I'm interpreting the other posts correctly, Hal seems to have
settled, perhaps uncomfortably, on at least the possibility of having
to not completely disregard possible "miracles", while Eliezer seems
to allow them but figures its by and large irrelevant.

Slowly, gentle-Is, step by step, we will move as Max says, Onward.
As Eliezer pointed out, the truth doesn't really care.

Thank <Goodness>. Years ago I read a book on <Dianetics> by

I think there will be three significant trends in music over the next 25 
years, all of which one can already see in one stage of development or 
another.  The first will be a continuation of the syncretistic style of 
mixing musical styles and "mining" traditional and "world music" sources for 
pop music applications we've seen during the last few decades.  This will be 
driven by both 1) the never-ending desire of First World music promoters for 
novelty and 2) the increasingly global nature of a more and more wired pop 
culture scene.

The second trend will be an increasingly diverse and "flat" musical scene: 
With the development of the Web and technologies like MP3 and sophisticated 
and inexpensive tools for digital music creation and production, the very 
hierarchical, unified music industry will become increasingly fragmented, as 
more and more creators of music reach wider and more diverse audiences.  At 
the same time, there will be a trend toward "balkanization" of musical tastes 
(as with other cultural tastes) as highly targeted music sources like net 
radio and cable music channels (like the ones I listen to in my study here) 
deliver very narrowly-focused programs tailored to specific musical tastes.  
How these two somewhat contradictory trends will interact will be an 
interesting phenomenon to watch (or listen to).

Finally, the truly "new" development during this time will be the impact of 
human-machine composing and performing collaborations and, then, purely 
AI-driven musical creation.  Even with today's $500 synthesizers one can have 
fun with some primitive man-machine collaborations as the machine works with 
you in playing back rhythm and chord tracks.  More sophisticated "music 
generators"  have already been demonstrated in "the lab" are not far behind 
for consumer level use.  Beyond this will be true AI music composition that 
interacts with human mood and gesture, as is already seen in the interactive 
musical tracks for some simulation games.

Ultimately, I see a true multi-media human-machine collaboration in virtual 
environments where auditory (including musical) and visual phenomena (and 
eventually direct emotional phenomena) are part of a seamless human-machine 
artistic environment - in which composition, performance and "consumption" of 
art are indistinguishable.  This promises a truly new artistic world that 
will have an impact on culture equivalent in its importance to the 
humanization of all of the arts during the Renaissance period.

I know there's some (perhaps quite smart) sentiment to kill this thread but, 
since most of my non-professional writing time is concentrated on weekend 
mornings, I thought I'd toss in a parting note or two here . . .

In a message dated 99-11-02 13:02:09 EST, mesmith@rocketmail.com (M. E.

As with so many things, one's personal environment often dictates the 
"feeling" one has about such matters as religion and culture generally.  
Perhaps you live and work in a community where scientific humanism is the 
predominant cultural milieu.  I do not.  I am constantly surrounded by 
symbols of religion and see churches as one of the major architectural 
features of the urban landscape I inhabit.  

Now, it's true I live in that strange borderland between the American South 
and West, where laissez faire and religion combine to make traditional 
christian symbology the predominant semiotic background and memetic 
mainstream.  I also do not work in the scientific world or academia, but 
instead in the world of business and law, where overt expressions of fairly 
simplistic religious faith are commonplace, and where an open expression of 
atheism or even agnosticism marks one as a strange fellow, indeed.  
Freethinkers are definitely not "in charge" in the worlds of business and 
government (outside of Silicon Valley, perhaps).  Frankly, I don't think this 
last proposition is even subject to much doubt, at least so far as the vast 
majority of the positions of the power strictures in American society are 
concerned.

Have I been personally stretched out on the rack with Galileo?  No.  But I've 
endured the necessity of keeping my opinions to myself.  To express 
skepticism about basic religious concepts in the workplace I inhabit would be 
the absolute kiss of death to my career.  This while religious people openly 
use that same workplace to spread their ideas.  This same feeling was 
expressed by another poster here a week or so ago and I fully understand it: 
No emotionally healthy person likes to feel like a stranger in his own land; 
but that is the fate of the skeptic in our society.

Of course scientific humanism has had a great impact on society (as that 
poster whose name I can't recall pointed out), but it has largely been in the 
delivery of "goods" produced by the scientific method and in the 
frighteningly thin world of academic philosophy and the humanities.

Yes, the internet shows clearly that our society is "largely free", as you 
say.  But the net allows us to be very selective about what sorts of cultural 
material we are exposed to.  Instead of the net, spend some time surfing the 
television.  I just had digital cable installed in my house (and cable modems

Again, I think you limit yourself to a tiny minority of humanity when you say 
that "we all" know these things.  It is absolutely not true for the vast 
majority of humanity.  I urge you to get a copy of the movie version of 
Sagan's "Contact" if you haven't seen it.  The alienation felt by a 
scientific humanist is portrayed there quite well.

I'm in fairly deep agreement with the sentiments you express in these last 
paragraphs.  I think that increasing grasp of reality DOES engender a greater 
feeling of awe than spiritualistic fantasies ever could.  I think there is a 
kind of mystery to existence that fuels an ultimate reverence for 
consciousness that underlies the best of which humanity has been and will be 
capable, no matter how augmented we or our descendants will become.  However, 
I do believe we can do better than to call this mystery "god".  To redefine 
that word as you and others suggest does violence to its real, 
historically-grounded and culturally valid meaning.

Hello Greg,

Some spontaneous thoughts on your lovely post, and especially on this passage.

Huxlean "feelies"? Soylant-Green-Style autoeuthanasia?  Can one distinguish
the objet d'art and the artist?  Why do I associate your expression with
"onanism" when what initially caught my attention was the lucidity of your
vision? Do you have in mind the projection of private fantasy into a synesthetic
n-dimensional medium?  "Where", "psychospatially", is the medium? What is it --
a sensorium of psychic aether, a hologram that exists only when it is perceived?
How does this differ from the "virtual worlds" that emerge spontaneously during
sensory deprivation, without the intervention of "computer-assisted perception"?
Does this integration exclude a social audience? While one is absorbed in the
evidently all-encompassing and engulfing aesthetique, is one technically under-
going a transient dissociative state? Is the "artistic environment" an "alternate
universe" -- c.f. lucid dreaming?

One of my avocations is improvisational music -- jazz, more or less. Piano and
horn.  But piano is the best analogy -- like many, I play with eyes closed --
there is absolutely no spatial disorientation with respect to the keyboard. Your
body knows where a particular key is, hands know the span of an augmented
fifth, your fingers know when crossovers are needed during a run, you have an
aural sensation similar to hearing with respect to the future -- you hear the
future, you know what everyone is going to play and yet are surprised when
you hear it in the conventional sense, in the present. Surprised you knew.
That's why everyone is always saying "yes" to themselves. And sometimes, even,
you are REALLY surprised -- someone's, maybe your, two bars [it doesn't matter]
are from elsewhere... Anamnesis.

Remember, this is improvisation -- no head arrangements, no canned riffs,
nothing except maybe a fake book.  And yet without precognition of the
somethings out of nothing, it can't happen.  And all the instruments are
playing you and conversely.  Is this the exotic, "paresthetic" world you
are predicting for everyone?  But this is a GROUP scene!

Why the computer? Is it here a prosthetic device for the musically challenged
or a nucleus for a qualitatively new form of aesthetic ___________?

Cordially,

Bob

Thank you for posting this Daniel.

It seems that no matter what prefix added, "feminist" continues to carry
with it truckloads of "stuff" -- remainders of what didn't work with
feminism and reminders of what did.  Whether or not the word and its load
have been tarnished, it was once young and with it came a lot of impulses
of youth as well as mistakes before its maturation.  There have been
individualists feminists (not to be confused with "ifeminists") whose lives
and work is significantly referenced without any gender association -- and
this I favor very much.  There are also works by adamant feminists who have
added insight, although I do not want to repeat a lunch date I had with
Betty Friedan some years ago when her obtuse and crusty manner alienated me
as well as many other women to her particular plight.

Wendy McElroy is an outrageously wonderful and provoking author and I think
she has added intelligently to the works of women in this arena.  From her
early writings on pornography to her recent writings on attitudes, she
brings to the turf quality and an out-of-the-box thinking. I look forward
to reading her "controversial speech." 

This past week, I have read and reread lines from Jane Austin's writings.
Jane Austin's keenness of senses represent issues of individuality and
intrigue.  Even over a hundred or so years (I believe her writing dates
1796 - 1817)  cannot change the *quality* of presence most men and women
aspire toward.  And even in her writings one has to giggle just a little
because of the pomposity of manners when taken to an extreme.  I think here
is a lot to learn from Ms. Austin's early writings (which caught me
off-guard when I thought I gleaned a bit of Rand in some of the Austin
character's lines (but Jane Austin did come *before* Rand.))  And, her work
did conflict with Romanticism -:)

I'd like a 21st Century Aristoi/Austin sensual sensibility. 

Cheers!

Natasha

                          Welcome To SETIWEB NEWS
        A newsletter dedicated to those with an interested in the
                Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence
         and where humanity fits into the scheme of things.
         -----------------------------------------------------------
         SETIWEB NEWS is an extension of SETIWEB.ORG

         -----------------------------------------------------------

Issue 1 - November 4, 1999
--------------------------------

My personal greeting:
      Greetings all, I come in peace.  Hi, my name is Tony.  I have
agreed to do this newsletter in the hopes of expanding the outreach of
SETIWEB.ORG, and reaching others that may not have the time to surf
message boards or web sites in search of relevant information.  I
hope to issue this newsletter on a regular basis, every two weeks,
sooner if there is breaking news, or later if  my non-cyber life
dictates.  Subscription info is available below. This is my first
attempt at anything of this nature, so please bear with me.
Suggestions are welcome.
      I intend to keep the scope of SETIWEB NEWS fairly broad.
Matters directly related to "the search", changes at SETIWEB.ORG,
space science and other matters I feel fit, will be mentioned.  UFOology
is NOT suited for this forum.  I will post links to interesting news
articles and mention current discussions of interest at various forums.
If you have anything you would like to submit, please let me know,
and feel free to forward this to your friends. Thank you very much
for subscribing, and happy hunting!

Seti@home News:
---------------------
October 22, 1999 SETI@home has now accumulated more than 100,000
years of computer time, more than any other computing project in history!
We have recorded over 85 million "candidate signals" (spikes and Gaussians)
in our database, and we're preparing to start the second phase of analysis,
which will search these candidates looking for "repeat events".

Mars Polar Lander Status:
October 30, 1999
        NASA's Mars Polar Lander spacecraft successfully fired its
thrusters for 12 seconds this morning to fine-tune its flight path for
arrival at the Martian south pole on December 3.
        Flight controllers said the spacecraft performed as planned and
that preliminary data show the desired trajectory change was achieved.
The thruster firing began at 10:28 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time. Previous
thruster firings were accomplished on January 21, March 15, and
Sept. 1.  The next thruster firing is scheduled for November 30.
        The landing site is located at 76 degrees south latitude and 195
degrees west longitude, near the northern edge of the layered terrain
in the vicinity of the Martian south pole. The lander is now about 14.3
million kilometers (about 8.9 million miles) from Mars, traveling at a
speed of 4.8 kilometers per second (about 10,700 miles per hour)
relative to Mars.  The spacecraft is about 228 million kilometers
(about 142 million miles) from Earth, and has traveled along an arcing

To the best of my knowledge, the quote should be attributed to Tsiolkovsky
and not to Clarke.  I wouldn't be surpriced if Clarke had quoted Tsiolkovsky
on it at some point and the attribution got lost.

But if these folks are going to rewrite space law, then perhaps we should
be worried.  :-)

In a conversation with friends the other night I was blowing hurricane-force 
hot air to the effect (i.e. putting forward the proposition) that the 
military doctrine of the 20th century can be aptly contained between the two 
polar ideal types of the "surgical air war" and the guerrilla "people's war" 
(with the added proviso that the Wehrmacht's blitzkrieg in WWII was actually 
the embodiment of an ideal of 19th century military doctrine).  The former, 
which I called "Billy Mitchell's Dream", was finally achieved - sort of - in 
the Gulf War.  The goal of Billy Mitchell's Dream was to use air power to 
break an enemy's will to fight, first with carpet bombing of civilian targets 
and then, as technology developed, with precision guided munitions aimed at 
key elements of an opponent's C3I and other warfighting capacity itself.  
Inherent in this doctrine was the notion that the actor wielding such air 
power would not have to actually control territory, so much as deter 
international aggression by projecting force beyond its own "home turf."  The 
application of the purest form of this doctrine has actually turned out to be 
rather limited in military and political terms: The Gulf War was about as 
close to the scenario originally envisioned by the early proponents of air 
power as one can get.

The doctrine of "people's war" - Mao's type of war -- was premised on the 
notion of an ideologically motivated people waging a "war of resistance" 
against an occupying force.  The steady draining of blood throughout the 
century in the Third World has been due to a large extent to some form or 
other of "people's war" - although traditional Western political theory would 
characterize most of these conflicts as civil war.  

To a great extent these two paradigms of warfare are skew to each other.  
Nowhere was this more apparent than in the US involvement in Vietnam, where 
each side was pursuing a different ideal type of warfare, and at the same 
time each was being forced into a third, older type of warfare (positional 
warfare of maneuver) from time to time.

If technology develops to the point where reliable, effective robotic 
ground-based units are possible (before such things are made irrelevant by 
even more advanced forms of weaponry and warfare), one can see a projection 
of Billy Mitchell's Dream backward in time in a sense, into the doctrine of 
positional warfare of maneuver.  In such a situation, the kinds of political 
and military goals achievable by overwhelming technological superiority might 
well cause a real shift in the global balance of power - and possibly not a 
good one.  As it has turned out, the old paradigm of air power is primarily a 
defensive and reactive one.  "Robot armies" would be a much more effective 
tool of aggression... not a pleasant thought.

I do not get this at all -- it seems that bonds of social trust would have 
been more valuable in times of scarcity.  I'd appreciate a brief explanation 
of this idea.

Hmm -- you know, I interpreted this question to be more about "fun" than 
"idleness".  Maybe we read "leisure" differently . . .

Arthur C. Clarke, TALES OF TEN WORLDS, 1963:

`Our beliefs were neatly expressed by that famous remark of Tsiolkovsky's,
which I'd hung up for everyone to see as they entered my office:

	EARTH IS THE CRADLE OF THE MIND--BUT
	YOU CANNOT LIVE IN THE CRADLE FOREVER

`(What was that? No--of *course* I never knew Tsiolkovsky! I was only four
years old when he died in 1936!)'

That, obviously, is not Clarke himself speaking... but a character in his
1959 story `Out of the Cradle, Endlessly Orbiting', reprinted in the
collection. ACC was born in 1917.

Poignantly, that story starts by noting: `The twenty-first century does
*not* begin tomorrow; it begins a year later, on January 1, 2001.' Bad
luck, Arthur. Less than two months away now, and you were right - the
cretins never did learn to count...

Dan Gillmor's article "Nanotechnology: from science fiction to fact"

extension.  Robert's ideas are simply amazing.    


"Some of the most intriguing, and certain to be controversial, uses of
nanotechnology will be in the medical arena. The ability of tiny machines

Robert advised me on my talk at Extro 4 -- nanomedicine and how it relates
to the potential nano enhancements of our current and future senses.  He is
simply amazing.

No different from a lot of other words, such as "atheist," "Objectivist,"
"liberal," and "conservative."  I'm sure other can add lots more.  Lee
Bonnifield once dubbed such things "trance inducing words."  People see them
and react according to their preconceived notions.  This is why I don't tell

I must admit, I've not read any Austin, though I liked the movie version of
"Sense and Sensibility."

As for Rand, I guess those of us who have been exposed to her will be making
such comparisons for a long time.  No doubt, Rand read Austin and many
others.  Dickens, e.g.  After all, a lot of her evil characters are like
something Dickens would create, no?

Title
  Dietary L-arginine reduces
  the progression of
  atherosclerosis in cholesterol-fed rabbits: comparison with
  lovastatin.
Source
  Circulation.  96(4):1282-90, 1997 Aug 19.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: We investigated whether
  L-arginine induces regression of preexisting
  atheromatous lesions and reversal of
  endothelial dysfunction in hypercholesterolemic rabbits,
  whether similar effects can be obtained by
  cholesterol-lowering therapy with lovastatin, and which
  mechanism leads to these effects. METHODS AND RESULTS:
  Rabbits were fed 1% cholesterol for 4 weeks and 0.5% cholesterol for an
  additional 12 weeks. Two groups of cholesterol-fed rabbits were treated with
  L-arginine (2.0% in drinking water) or lovastatin (10 mg/d)
  during weeks 5 through 16. Systemic nitric oxide (NO) formation was assessed
  as the urinary excretion rates of nitrate and cGMP in weekly
  intervals. Cholesterol feeding progressively reduced urinary nitrate
  excretion to approximately 40% of baseline (P<.05) and increased plasma
  concentrations of asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous NO
  synthesis inhibitor. Dietary
  L-arginine reversed the reduction in plasma
  L-arginine/ADMA ratio and partly restored urinary excretion
  of nitrate and cGMP (each P<.05 vs cholesterol) but did not change plasma
  cholesterol levels. L-Arginine completely blocked
  the progression of carotid intimal plaques,
  reduced aortic intimal thickening, and preserved
  endothelium-dependent vasodilator function. Lovastatin
  treatment reduced plasma cholesterol by 32% but did not improve urinary
  nitrate or cGMP excretion or endothelium-dependent
  vasodilation. Lovastatin had a weaker inhibitory effect on carotid plaque
  formation and aortic intimal thickening than L-arginine.
  L-Arginine inhibited but lovastatin potentiated superoxide
  radical generation in the atherosclerotic
  vascular wall. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary
  L-arginine improves NO-dependent vasodilator function in
  cholesterol-fed rabbits and completely blocks the
  progression of plaques via restoration of NO synthase
  substrate availability and reduction of vascular oxidative stress. Lovastatin
  treatment has a weaker inhibitory effect on the
  progression of atherosclerosis and no
  effect on vascular NO elaboration, which may be due to its stimulatory effect
  on vascular superoxide radical generation.

There is a difference, all atoms are not in people and not all the laws of physics
involve atoms; I was assuming (it's not implicit in the original post I admit) that
not only are all people sinners but all sinners are people. But now that I come to
think about it, that's equivalent to "all non sinners are non people" so your example
of a virtuous tangerine is a little bit of evidence helping to prove the proposition
that all people are indeed sinners. Perhaps the original poster was right after all.

    >I think you're objecting to the fact that "sin" lacks a clear definition,

No, that's not the problem, nearly all the really important things in life
have no clear definition. My objection is that the idea is pointless.

I cited Arthur C. Clarke's 1959 story `Out of the Cradle, Endlessly
Orbiting', reprinted in the collection, TALES OF TEN WORLDS, 1963:

`...famous remark of Tsiolkovsky's, which I'd hung up for everyone to see
as they entered my office:

	EARTH IS THE CRADLE OF THE MIND--BUT
	YOU CANNOT LIVE IN THE CRADLE FOREVER

Perhaps I should have spelled out a rather obvious play in Clarke's title
(obvious, at any rate, to Americans, although maybe not to the rest of us):
it's a reference to Walt Whitman's poem `Out of the Cradle Endlessly
Rocking' (in LEAVES OF GRASS, 1881 edition), which opens with that line.
Its second line, eerily predictive in its own way, perhaps, is `Out of the
mocking-bird's throat, the musical shuttle'.

George, I whole heartedly endorse your disconcertion, with the pervasive 
attitude regarding the sometimes, oppressive, mean-spirited, behavior of the 
Christian Fundamentalist Churches that have historically pervaded in the 
Southern Continental US since pre-Civil War days.  I am a target of their 
dislike also, but curiously enough, believe in God; just not their god. 

On this mailing list I am concerned, conversely, that a lot of the atheism is 
passionate, but not serious.  That it somehow is simply WASP culture with 
their Jesus excised out. But that WASP culture survives (opinions, attitudes 
and beliefs) even though their view of God has been deposed.   The analogy 
would be like going to a Thai restaurant and dousing everything with 
mayonnaise.  

Yours in Mother Shabooboo, Spud

Visions of the future from some of the world's greatest thinkers paint a 
dismal picture for the inhabitants of Earth in the next millennium, with 
humans vying for supremacy with a new species of intelligent being. 
Predictions, a new book including contributions from such esteemed 
visionaries as sci-fi writer Arthur C Clarke and economist JK Galbraith, 
suggests that within two decades a new life form will have evolved from 
artificially intelligent machines. 


 
Telepathy promises to replace phones and faxes 
This development will occur "far more rapidly than biology will ever permit," 
reckons Clarke, author of 2001. 

With independent-minded machines threatening to leave us behind, the book 
predicts that humans will turn to genetics and computer implants in a bid to 
compete. 

Geneticist Dr French Anderson fears that, not content with curing all disease 
using gene-based treatments, people in the next millennium will attempt to 
"improve" themselves and their children. 

"Eugenics [might] be practised on a scale far larger than any 'selective 
breeding' policy could accomplish." 

The end of sex

Couples will no longer have sex to reproduce, with individuals relying on 
sperm and egg banks instead. 

Cybernetics expert Kevin Warwick, who already has a chip in his arm to 
remotely operate doors and switch on his computer, predicts that similar 
implants will become commonplace. 


 
 
The time may come when such devices will make speech obsolete, with humans 
communicating to each other telepathically. 

Such developments could pose a real threat to our established notions of who 
we are. 

"A human brain is a stand-alone entity, guaranteeing a unique human 
identity," Warwick said. "But link a human brain via the internet to other 
brains, both human and machine, and what of the individual then?" 

The anthology of forecasts by 30 noted thinkers - including Umberto Eco and 
Richard Dawkins - does envisage exciting leaps forward in space travel. 

Prince in space

Arthur C Clarke even predicts that Prince Harry, youngest son of the Prince 
of Wales, will be the first royal to holiday among the stars. 

He also says that by 2057, a century after Sputnik was launched, man will 
stand on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. 

However, many of the great minds quizzed were less than positive about the 
prospects for the future. 


 
Space travel: taking chaos to the stars 
British scientist Susan Greenfield thinks the attention span of humans will 
be eroded to the point where we will become a "society of restless, 
unimaginative individuals". 

American feminist and historian Elaine Showalter suggests that future 
generations will be dogged by "new paranoias, new hysterias, new conspiracy 
theories and new imaginary diseases". 

Sian Griffith, the Times Higher Education Supplement journalist who edited 
Predictions, said lessons should be learned from the prophesies. 

"I get the sense from these predictions that there is a limited time span for 
human beings unless we change." 

"There's a sense that we'll be struggling all the time, trying to do new 
things, but with a sense of disaster looming." 

Humans: A lethal mutation

Linguist Noam Chomsky describes the human race as a "lethal mutation", 
acquiring in an evolutionary heartbeat the capacity to destroy ourselves and 
the other life forms which share our planet. 

"Perhaps it will find ways to contain its destructive impulses. A rational 
Martian spectator might not be sanguine about the prospects." 

Writing in the journal Nature, Arthur C Clarke says that alien civilisations 
should welcome the "annihilation" of the human race. 

He thinks that extra-terrestrial onlookers will be glad that our mishandling 
of technology may destroy us before we can cause havoc on a galactic scale.

Gentlemen: Here are assembled the descriptions of "Sin" presented by
                those religious sects who use this term in their scriptures:

-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-

UNIFICATION CHURCH

Adam and Eve...were tempted by the archangel Lucifer into illicit
and forbidden love. Through this, Adam and Eve willfully turned
away from God's will and purpose for them, thus bringing
themselves and the human race into spiritual death (DUTA).

UNITY

Sin, sickness, poverty, old age, and death are not real, and they
have no power over me. There is nothing in all the universe for
me to fear (LT, p. 35).

THE WAY INTERNATIONAL

Man fell because of disobedience to God's Word (JC, p. 66).

ORTHODOX HINDUISM

By the Law of Karma--"sowing and reaping"--wrong actions
inevitably produce punishment, good actions their reward.
Salvation consists of doing good in excess of evil in order
to evolve to the highest state through successive incarnations.
This highest state is Enlightenment--the realization of oneness
with the World-Soul, Reality.

MORMONISM

Adam cried, "Because of my transgression my eyes are opened,
and in this life I shall have joy" (Pearl of Great Price, Moses
5:10-11).

JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES

Sin is a falling short of God's mark of perfection, transgression of
His righteous law (MS, p. 456).

SPIRITUALISM

Man never had a fall.

Whatever is, is right. Evil does not exist. Evil is good. No matter
what man's path may be, good or bad, it is the path of divine
ordination and destiny. (Childs, Whatever Is, Is Ri

CHRISTIAN SCIENCE

Sin, sickness, and death are to be classified as effects of error.
Christ came to destroy the belief of sin (SH, 473 :4-6).

BIBLICAL CHRISTIANITY

Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law, for sin is
the transgression of the law (I John 3:4).

-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-

I think a univocal meaning of "Sin" could be extracted by
induction from these statements, but the result would not
be a proper logical definition but rather a metaphor. This
is needed to judge whether there is at least a symbolic
referent for the term or whether it is literally "pointless".

Unfortunately, this entire page is now beginning to exude
Nietzsche's "odor of sanctity"; it is caustic and putrid at
once -- a chthonic smell of the subterranean deliquescence
of something still partly alive.  Unbearable -- why must
people talk about things like this? I must dispatch the
letter at once!

Yes there are many screwy notions that have made religion suck the big one. 
Notice though what you despise, 8 of the 9 religious paths listed are, at 
least, quasi-Christian. The Way, Moonies, Church of Mormons... You did list 
Orthodox Hindu's..I wonder what non-Orthodox Hindu's believe in? As far as 
Neitszche, who wants to be locked into an Eternal Return-I even hate

the same people.  Poor Neitch died of tertiarry syphallus and ended up 
speaking to horses along the way. For some reason the nazis liked him too. Go 
figure.

These are all good questions.  In fact, they probably presage the outlines of 
21st century art criticism well.  Just as there have been spectra of quality 
in the creation and appreciation of traditional media - what may come to be 
called the "separate arts" (as a reference to the medium-imposed bright lines 
between "painting" and "music" and "drama" we recognize now), so there will 
be in the new art form(s) I envision.

You identify one of these spectra in your first question, with its reference 
to "onanism".  Just as the media of literature, painting, photography and 
movies/video have given rise to a spectrum spanning pure pornography on the 
one side, through "erotic art" to works with little or no sexual content, so 
immersive, interactive computer-mediated art will likewise span a similar 
spectrum.  Similarly, the "separate arts" have given rise to a spectrum 
spanning purely subjective works (with abstract expressionism perhaps the 
purest example) on the one end, to "objective" works such as, for instance, 
the overtly didactic painting of Enlightenment painters like David or the 
modern "flat" journalistic style of photography and painting.  One can see 
another spectrum in the "publicness" or "privateness" of art in the 
traditional "separate arts".  On the one hand, one had the great "public" 
works of grand symphonic music, civic architecture, traditional works of 
drama, and painting on the heroic scale of, again for instance, the great 
works of the Enlightenment painters.  On the other, one can see much more 
"private" art in the form of small-scale painting and print-making, 
craft-oriented forms such as "art pottery", traditional chamber music, and 
the like.

Immersive virtual interactive art will span the same spectra, I imagine (and 
will almost surely give rise to new ones we can't yet envision).  These 
spectra define a multi-dimensional "critical space" into which one can fit 
the potentialities of interactive, immersive multi-media art.  Thus one might 
have purely subjective, totally onanistic and private works or experiences at 
one "corner" of this space, and non-sexual, objective, public works at 
another "corner" of this "critical space".  

Another dimension in this critical space, "interactivity" is barely presaged 
in some current media and art forms - I'm thinking of kinetic sculpture, 
simulation games and, in the example you cite, perhaps the most fruitful 
progenitor, improvisational music such as modern jazz and traditional Indian 
music.  Thus, I foresee at one end of the spectrum, purely "pre-programmed" 
immersive works in which there is a clear-cut  distinction between audience 
and "creator" (whether the latter is purely human or not, and whether the 
"creator" is a lone individual or a collaborative enterprise between multiple 
people and/or machines) and, at the other end of the spectrum, more 
interactive "works", where there is no clear-cut separation between the 
pre-determined art "object" and the resulting experience of the 
participants/artists/audience.  In this artistic world, our current 
vocabulary distinguishing between creator and audience, instrument and 
product, object and context will all be construed very differently.

[snip a nice description of the improvisational experience in jazz]

Again, I think we are limited by our current vocabulary.  I think "it" is 
both of the things you suggest, and more.  Just as our current distinction 
between "computer" and "peripheral" is increasingly coming into question, 
likewise, I think the distinctions between "medium", "instrument" and 
"object" will be transcended and we will have to develop a wholly new 
critical vocabulary.  Notions such as "theme", "motif" and "dynamics" will 
become paramount and, perhaps, critical concerns with media and 
instrumentalities may come to be seen as quaint or very historically bound, 
such as the conventions of mediaeval iconography now seem to us.

Okay, once again we have the idea that *I* hate, and which I am going to
keep on objecting to, to wit, what you "want" to happen doesn't have the
vaguest influence on that kind of large-scale pre-human reality.  If the
Reality is large enough, then you're going to get every possible
configuration of 10^80 atoms in 10^11 lightyears at least once.  And
y'know, I think the Reality is that large.

You raise some interesting questions Spud, ones with which I have been
rassling for years.  For many of us who grew up in CFC-dominated (christian
fundamentalist churches) society, or WASP culture, our core system
of ethics and morals are based directly on those teachings.  After years
of being atheist, I am still unable to give a simple, crisp bumper sticker
answer to those who claim that CFCs provide a solid framework upon
which to base ones morals and teach ones children ethical behavior.

Of course, atheists are moral and ethical people too, but the reasons why
we are tend to be more complicated and subjective than the CFC version,
which is: god says do this, so I do.  Humanism contains all the same
core values of honesty, forthrightness, etc, but it requires *brains* instead
of blind obedience.

And to be honest, I am not sure myself that had I been an atheist from
the start, would I still have the same moral and ethical values.  I am
an extremely introspective person.  I am deeply entangled in the values
memes with which I was infected as a child.  I cannot turn them off,
even tho my mind has overpowered the <god>.

Consider for instance the <faithfulness in marriage>.  Most would
recognize that this meme is solidly CFC based, and yet I cannot shake
this one off even if I tried, and it is unclear to me that I should try.  Yet
from an atheist's point of view, it is difficult to explain to others why
the meme holds under atheism.  All I can say is:  I do not believe in
god, but I do beleive in the ethical and moral system which the <god>
people espouse.

As you can see, I am groping here, so anyone can jump in and help
at any time.

I don't have much more.  We do know that in situations of extreme poverty,such as
during famine, people show the *least* social bonding.  And as we have
gotten richer, we have spent more time on activities whose primary purpose
I think is social bonding: leisure, education, and health care.  So I hypothesize

that social bonding is more important as you get richer.

I meant "fun" as well.

I just got one of these new speech recognition products.  This message is being
generated on it area.  I don't know how useful it is, that it is the coolest toy
I
have received in a long time.  I will send this message leaving the mistakes in
their that it made.  Notice for instance at the end of the second sentence the
work area.  And in the previous sentence to this one the word work should
be word.

I'm having a great time of this thing.  Spike

Team.  As variant.  The previous was supposed to be p.  S.

This is l and h speech recognition software myriad.

It is the cheapest version.  $30.00 including headset and microphone
Darien.  The biggest problem is in recognizing the word..  I do nut
know what you would need to do to have it type out the work
which means the dot at the end of a sentence myriad area.

This message was generated without touching a keyboard
Darien Darien.  Dot damnit!

It is not very dead at recognizing the word which means a dot at the end of a
sentence.

It keeps thinking I'm saying Darien or area or myriad.  Spike

Dear ___________,

I wish I knew your name -- your alias just doesn't fit a person of
your high intelligence, although it it consistent with your spelling.

Clarification: I was neither [1] promoting the conceptual content
of Nietzsche, nor [2] disparaging any spiritual practice.

Actually, however, I view Nietzsche's writings as "cultural criticism",
not as "metaphysics", and as such possessing considerable merit.
Further, I myself practice a non-ideological "spiritual" discipline.

My problem with the quotations is their vocabulary, and the meta-
phorical expression was meant to describe this vocabulary as
decadent if not altogether moribund.  Greg Burch and I were just
discussing the need for a new semantics of artistic creativity and
criticism for the coming Millennium.

For example, I could regard the term "sin" as "quaint" were it not
for the repulsive connotations it has acquired over the years.  The
association of "sin" with "Sheol" (which today would refer to a
sanitary landfill or a settling tank for human excrement), the intrinsic
sadomasochism of the evolved usage of the concept of "hell" (c.f.
"celare", "kalyptein") -- such terms are, in my view, anachronistic to
say the least. I put the word "spiritual" within quotation marks
because I also find its acquired burden of connotations distasteful.
I'm sure I would be misunderstood if I used "pneumatic" instead.

I certainly apologize if you experienced my post as a demeaning and
disrespectful reference to your belief-system,

Bob

I thought immediately of "Childhood's End" about which C.S. Lewis made this
transhumanist, if not exactly extropian, remark:

             "...here we meet a modern author who understands
             that there may be things that have a higher claim
             on humanity than its own 'survival'."

Actually, this is probably an instinct we've inherited.  Pinker makes a
solid game theoretic argument in favor of appearing to have an instinct
like this in "How the Mind Works;" and, arguably, the best way to appear
to have a given instinct is to actually have it.

i dont know steve, but i generated the previous post after only
one training session.  ive done two more since then, so it
mighta gotten better.  each training session takes about
6 minutes.  this is the cheapest version of the software,
so im greatly encouraged.

i dont know about mac compatibility, but seems like
anything a pc can do, a mac can do better...

This is another test of the voice recognition software.  This message is generated

without a keyboard.  I think I worked down the.  Problem.  Rather I think I
worked of the problem with the word that means the dot at the end of a sentence
theory had.  Or perhaps not.

This exercise has been most insightful.  With my own modest typing skills,
I have always assumed that my brain was waiting for my fingers.  However
even with my modest skills of about 80 words per minute it appears that
might fingers were still waiting for my brain theory and.

If you see theory had horror.  And that means the top at the end of the
sentence.  Please forgive.

I have come to realize that the typed word uses a richer vocabulary that
the spoken word here yet.  Also the sentences are less likely to end with
absurd Miss Such as here yet.

By a was considering switching to the big war act of war act of

The odd arrangement of keys on the tube w e r t white keyboard

Carbon 

How to "mine" carbon out of the air for use in nanotech?

Speculating on this I beleive that perhaps the easiest way would be to first 
suck in some air and then cool it past the dew point of Carbon Dioxide. This 
would percipitate Co2. (at what pressure is it possible to have liquid 
co2?......does it matter?)

This C02 "snow" would then be "picked apart" by tiny atom grabbers pulling 
the carbon atoms loose from the oxygen.  

Question...should monoatomic oxy be released back into the atmosphere?

The caron atoms can then be used to immediatiately build (grow) something 
diamonoid.

Possibly a "seive" device that would capture carbon dioxide from the air  
directly by passing the cooling step.  I assume that all molecule have 
specific shapes.  If so...then Carbon Dioxide is uniquely shaped and would 
fit into a "cutout" which would tend to exclude all other molecules.

Driving down the road and bored with radio I do a lot of speculating like 
this...I've come up with a nanotech tunneling machine but it'd be hard to 
explain..

beforehand, rather than just rehearsing them aloud.

Having said that, the question is whether reading + correction is faster
than typing + correction.

This stuff is great! When my mom got voice recognition software on her
office computer, I spent all day reciting the sentence "Fred Flintstone is
fond of saying Yabba Dabba Doo" into it.. the results were hilarious, it
came out different every time. I've never had more fun in my life.

Untrue.  Historically and cognitively untrue.  Marriage existed in
hunter-gatherer times, as did the issue of faithfulness in marriage and
adultery.  It exists in *birds*.

The mac not only has speech recognition products, but you can also use your
voice as your password.  It will only recognize your own voice as being
valid.

I am retracting my previous retraction of my statement that 40K
is a greater problem than 14C (circa 21 Oct 1999).  I've updated my
calculations to reflect a 14C abundance of 1 in 10^-12 C atoms from a
recent paper by Robert Freitas on the subject.  For details see:

  http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/Papers/RitHB.html

This isn't the final word on the problem.  Robert Fs' draft paper
on the subject suggests that we are good for 500-1000 years on ice
but still needs some work, as does, I suspect, my brief commentary.

The bottom line for now is that 40K and 14C are both of concern
but are probably not of "significant" concern (given the progress
in biotech/nanotech that we can reasonably expect).

Some of you might like to actually observe the transition of
a system from a predictable (ordered) to a chaotic state.
This simple apparatus ingeniously retards the state-transi-
tion so it is readily observable.  The experiment is so easy
to perform that your children (with your supervision) can
learn some avant-garde physics, and the colored water
droplets descending through mineral oil provide a lovely
slow-motion study of the phenomenon.

Spike, my friend (I hope):-)

Consider this:
CFCs have utterly failed to provide any kind of practical ethical framework.

  1) After over 2000 years of time to prove itself        effective we are still extremely violent, lying
     dastardly, etc...
  2) 80% of prison inmates espouse some form of             religion.  And they were beleivers before their        arrests.
  3) And then there is the escape clause: (Perhaps the      main reason for the success and "stickiness" of        the CFC sects.)  You can do absolutely any kind of      heinious rape, murder, torture and then be             forgiven in the last instant of one's horrific         life and get the same perks (eternal life and          etc.) as a virgin church schoolmarm.
   4)Then there is all of that "eye for an eye"           material that helped rationalize all those holy        wars.  Richard Dawkins has gone into detail in         this area, and I could get more if you are              interested, but this is my quick version.

I think I would much rather trust someone who has "rassled" some of these ethical issues and grounded themselves in solid  reasoned conclusions, rather than someone who bases their ethics on an old compendium of myths and superstitious tales full of contradictions and inaccuracies.

So, I don't think I came up with a bumper sticker here, as you mentioned in your previous post, but I couldn't put it on my car anyway.  (Darwin fishes in my area are an stimulus to vandalize).

           ASSOCIATION FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF CONSCIOUSNESS

                  -----------------------------------
                  4TH ANNUAL MEETING: CALL FOR PAPERS
                  -----------------------------------

                      THE UNITY OF CONSCIOUSNESS:
                 BINDING, INTEGRATION, AND DISSOCIATION

                     Universite Libre de Bruxelles
             JUNE 29th - JULY 2nd, 2000: BRUSSELS, BELGIUM


The fourth meeting of the Association for the Scientific Study of
Consciousness will be held from June 29th to July 2nd, 2000, at the
Universite Libre de Bruxelles (Brussels, Belgium) on the theme of "The
Unity of Consciousness".

Consciousness has many elements, from sensory experiences such as
vision, audition, and bodily sensation, to nonsensory aspects such as
volition, emotion, memory, and thought. The apparent unity of these
elements is striking: all are presented to us as experiences of a single
subject, and all seem to be contained within a unified field of
experience. But this apparent unity raises many questions. How do
diverse systems in the brain co-operate to produce a unified experience?
Are there conditions under which this unity breaks down? And is
conscious experience really unified at all?

In recent years, these questions have been addressed by researchers in
many fields. Neurophysiologists and computational modelers have
investigated the mechanisms by which binding and integration of
disparate information may take place in the brain, producing a unified
experience. Neuropsychological research has documented a large variety
of dissociation disorders in which damage to specific brain regions
leads to dissociated experiences, suggesting the apparent disintegration
of a unified subject. Cognitive psychologists have investigated the role
of attention and learning in the integration of information, and have
examined conditions under which perception and action, or subjective
experience and behavior, can become dissociated. Some cognitive modelers
have suggested that unity is a mere illusion, while others have
emphasized the role of a central unifying system in integrating sensory
and motor experience. And philosophers have analyzed just what the unity
of consciousness comes to, and whether we have reason to believe that it
exists.

The fourth ASSC conference will bring together researchers from numerous
disciplines to discuss these issues. Topics that will be addressed
include:

- the role of synchronous oscillations in binding and integration
- other neurophysiological mechanisms for integration of information
- computational models of binding, integration, and unity
- neuropsychological disorders with dissociation of experience
- the role of attention and learning in unification of experience
- dissociations between perceptual systems
- implicit vs. explicit aspects of knowledge and learning
- dissociations between perception, thought, and action
- the relationship between information integration and unified experience
- analysis of the concept of unity
- unification of consciousness and self across time
- the existence or nonexistence of unified consciousness

Confirmed plenary speakers include: Rodney Cotterill, Zoltan Dienes,
Andreas Engel, Glyn Humphreys, Susan Hurley, Pierre Perruchet, Randy
O'Reilly, Sidney Shoemaker, Catherine Tallon-Baudry, Giulio Tononi,
Anne Treisman, Andrew Young, and Semir Zeki.


-------------------------
CALL FOR PAPERS & POSTERS
-------------------------

While the central theme of ASSC4 is "The unity of consciousness", and
plenary sessions will deal largely with this theme, speakers in
concurrent sessions are invited to talk on any topic relevant to the
scientific study of consciousness. Submissions that include
physiological, psychological, philosophical, and computational
perspectives are all welcome.

Submissions for both posters and talks will be accepted. Any person may
present only one submission, but may be co-author on several. Oral
presentations will be limited to 20 minutes, to be followed by a
10-minute discussion period.

Plenary lectures, symposia, concurrent sessions, and poster sessions
will all be held on the Solbosch campus of the Universite Libre de
Bruxelles.


---------------------------
CALL FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSALS
---------------------------

This notice is also intended as a call for workshop presenters. One of
the aims of this meeting is to allow researchers to gain a background in
areas that they may know little about. Towards that end a number of
workshops are planned. Is there a topic you or perhaps someone in your
laboratory might want to present? Some participants in the conference
would be very interested in learning about technical matters such as
fMRI or other important brain imaging techniques. Others might enjoy a
seminar on a philosophical topic. If you have recently published a book
or major article on some topic you might want to lead a discussion on
it.  As with papers the focus of all workshops should naturally fit
within the overall theme of the conference. A non-exclusive list of
possible topics might include:

    -- The latest methods and implications of various brain scanning
       techniques (e.g. fMRI, EEG, SQUID, ERP)
    -- Blindsight, neglect, or other neuropsychological syndromes
    -- Neural network or other theoretical models of processing in areas
       related to conscious activity
    -- Differences and similarities between conscious and unconscious
       processing
    -- Current models of the visual system
    -- Consciousness and metacognition
    -- Criteria for the ascription of consciousness
    -- Philosophical issues concerning unity
    -- Phenomenological methods for investigating
       consciousness
    -- Please suggest other sample topics, or modify the above!!

Workshops will be held in parallel sessions on the morning and
afternoon of June 29th. Each workshop is intended to last
approximately three hours. The sizes of workshops will vary between a
minimum of 10 to a maximum of around 25 people. Workshops that do not
achieve the minimum enrollment of 10 people will not be offered.
Workshop presenters will receive a minimum honorarium of 20000 BEF. The
cost of attending workshops will be 2000 BEF.

To submit workshop proposals or to suggest further topics, please write
to Patrick Wilken at <patrickw@cs.monash.edu.au>.

Yeah, this is like the research done by such Smolin, Linde, and Witten, also 
Max Tegmark. Now as far as such atoms forming a future plasma eventuating in 
a Uber Mind; that would be Tipler and Dave Deutsch's specialty. None of these

Neitzsch's eternal return doesn't cut it for me.  Or to quote Andrew 
Kurzweil, "whatever the physical law happens to be, it crumbles in the face 
of intelligence".  However, the realm of philosophy is like a smorgasboard; 
take your pick.

Oh Hell no, I am merely arguing against the mentality the Mr. Burch finds so 
disheartening.  I also persist in being a pain in the gluteus because it 
seems that  people who object to religion do so exclusively, from a  
Christian perspective.  Yes sheol was a burning trash heap of ancient times, 
but it may have been the location of early Caannite and Hebrew sacrifices-bad 
vibrations.  The Hell of the Christian is purportedly eternal, which tells 
one about their view of <God>, and the necessity to conform to their edicts 
(historically speaking) so where am I on this?  The purpose of nuking people 
eternally in some permanent convention oven is a bout as sensible as  biting 
on a ball of aluminum foil.  I hope that Extropianism or TransHumanism 
doesn't devolve to being mono-cultural

I'm not EXACTLY sure what you mean by that, but Tipler makes a point of
discussing eternal return in his book... but I think you already knew
that.

Yes, true, CFC people are just as dastardly as us heatherns.

But they don't have to beat Microsoft to make a difference; carving
out a reasonable market niche is enough.  If Wintel doesn't have a
monopoly and they have active competition they have to conduct their
business differently.  Doesn't that change the analysis of the situation?


On a related note, here is my reading of Friday's decision: The Judge decided
that it's a matter of fact that Microsoft is a heinous monopolist.  It's not
illegal to be a monopolist, but it is illegal to be a heinous monopolist.
Apparently the legal precedents says that Microsoft has to prove gross
negligence or something equally extreme to overturn the findings of fact.
It's not clear what the Judge will decide to do to them, but he seems to have
decided that they're guilty.  Even on appeal, that part is going to be hard
to overturn given the "facts" as they stand now.

It's sort of like refereeing in volleyball.  (And presumably most other
sports, though I understand the formalities in volleyball.)  When a play is
done, the ref decides what happened.  He can consult the 2nd referee and the
line judge, but when he's done, he gets to say who touched the ball and the
net, where they left the ground and in what order everything took place.  He
then decides what rules apply, and makes his call.  If anyone disagrees, they
can argue about what the rules say, and they can even appeal on
interpretations of the rules.  But if they disagree about what happened, they
can only ask the referee to change his mind about what happened.  His
reconstruction of the events is the only one that counts.

As a ref, you learn to describe what you saw in the terms of the rule you
expect to apply.  Very seldom, you agree with someone that things happened in
a different order than you first said, or that a player was playing a
different position than you thought.  

In the Microsoft case, the judge has given his interpretation of what
happened, and he's couched it in terms of the laws he expects to apply.  It
seems pretty clear what laws apply in the situation he's described.  He has
tremendous leeway in determining remedies.  (The papers keep saying that's "a
euphemism for penalties", but I think they're wrong.  He can't just order
fines or jail, he has to prescribe something that will apparently change the
practices he says have occurred.)

For illustrative purposes, I'm writing this e-mail using my voice as well.
I'm using Dragon NaturallySpeaking version 4.0.  I've gone through the
general training session and one additional trading session and have used it
for additional day or so.  Overall, I'm extremely impressed with its
performance.  One thing I've noticed, however, is that it does a great deal
better job at recognizing what you say if you speak all of the punctuation.
Another important details at the software use a great deal of memory --
about 90 megs for this process alone.  One of the nicest features, is
achieving use the program to navigate your entire computer.  I can surf the
Web with it, write e-mails, switch from program to program, even use a
special mouse navigating agent called MouseGrid in order to click the mouse
anywhere on the screen.

I have however noticed exactly the same thing as you; i.e., that my
vocabulary decreases the great deal using the dictation software.

Mormons Quasi-Christian!?  I spent two years in the Bible belt being called 
things like that.  And now on the extropian list!  I guess where there are 
two religious believers and the beliefs are somewhat different there is 
bound to be trouble. :)  And it is the the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints or the Mormons, not the "Church of Mormons." lol

One thing I appreciate about the Mormon view on the fall of Adam is that the 
fall was a good thing that was planned to be to make Adam and Eve mortal and 
able to reproduce.  Mainstream Christianity states that the fall was a 
tragic mistake and without it Adam and Eve would have brought forth a 
perfected race of humanity without sin.

I appreciate belonging to a church that teaches about the premortal 
existance of humanity, an apostasy and restoration and the doctrine of 
eternal marriage and family life.

I have already posted on my experiences and thoughts on religion and my 
faith in great detail.  I believe and yet I do have my doubts at times.  I 
have learned another view of things from this list and have found myself 
treated well here.  May we all in the end learn the ultimate truths and find 
peace and joy in our lives as the decades and centuries pass by.  This is my 
most sincere hope.


best regards,

John Grigg

Hello John,

I only included one quotation from my collection; here are the others
which exemplify your comments on "The Fall":

Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have
joy (11 Nephi 2:25).

Adam deliberately and wisely chose (to touch the forbidden
tree) and partook of the fruit (Talmage, DC, p. 65).

We ought to consider the fall of our first parents as one of the
great steps to external exaltation and happiness (Mormon
Catechism).

We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not
for Adam's transgression (AF, 2).

This is all summed-up in the expression of Bishop Tertullian:

                            "Oh felix culpa!"

THE SALT LAKE TRIBUNE  (November 6, 1999)

Archaeologist Draws Fire for Doubting Biblical Accounts 

    JERUSALEM -- An Israeli archaeologist is 
drawing fire for claiming that the biblical 
history of the Jewish people is probably fiction. 

    In an article last week in Ha'aretz newspaper, 
Ze'ev Herzog, a professor at Tel Aviv University 
argued that the Exodus of the Hebrews from Egypt 
probably never happened, the Ten Commandments were 
not given on Mount Sinai, and Joshua never conquered 
the land of Israel. Herzog said that if there was a 
King David, he probably was no more than a tribal 
chieftain. The same holds for King Solomon, Herzog said.

I'm sure the precise source of the hostility for each individual is similar,
but not identical to my feelings on the matter. See, growing up as a wee
fresh new human, we gaze up at these "grown-ups" with awe - completely
confident that they know everything about everything, and you will inherit
this knowledge when you "mature/grow up". Later, when you find out that in
fact, given the time that humans have been around, they've done pretty much
jack, except devise various ways of making a few persons comfortable at the
expense of the many, and that they also know precisely squat about the
universe, existence and everything. And instead of trying to find these
answers, the vast, vast majority just "believe" in some moronic fairy tale
to dull their nagging curiosity/fear. Not only that, but you find out that
as a child, you were in many ways superior to the exhalted grown-ups, who
are really no different save some limited experience, and much less freedom
in terms of motivation - (must have sex, must acquire resources, must
further my social status blah blah...).
Basically, it turns out that humans are lizard GTI, and that virtually
nobody has any interest whatsoever in matters beside those directly
applicable to the animal. I have become what they claimed to be - and now I
find myself alone. From this perspective, try and imagine how grating the
zealous rant of the religious really is, when they have the potential for so
much more.

Well, I think step is making public all information relevant to this operating
system, which is the linchpin and basis of market control.  Any other software
vendor that would write software and sell it to the large market of users of
Windows operating systems has to bludgeon through this monolithic layer,
architected and orchestrated by Microsoft.

First this means tools.  It's impossible, more or less, as discussed under
programming tools, to develop software for Microsoft machines without buying yet
more Microsoft software.  So, there should be free compilers.  This is a handful
of programs that are not currently available either a: generally for free or b:
free to any licensor of a Windows OS, ie, anyone running Windows, which was more
than likely pre-installed on the machine wholly purchased by the user.

Secondly it means access to the operating system.  If it is so that software
products are impinged by not having access to system level source code, then they
should (have access to the complete source code).

Thirdly,  it means total documentation, disclosure, as it were, of all features
of the operating system.

I think people often think of antitrust regulation in regards to Ma Bell, which
brought us AT&T and Baby Bells.  Along those lines would be MS-Windows,
MS-Office, MS-Explorer, besides the facts of MS-NBC and MS-Grocery.  (Multiple
Sclerosis never had it so good.)  In my insignificant opinion, this would not be
effective and would yield an unenforceable corporate reorganization with little
or no change in practices.

There is a term "convergence" which is often applied to the oncoming catalyzation
of the eponymous convergence of broadcast, Internet, and media technologies.
This is off the track from MS issues (except for MS-coax), but when it comes to
Internet access, there will soon be a boon of localized monopolistic point to
point providers, it should be required that they offer access to their networks,
just like long distance and local telcos for phones.

People often note these days some advent of the concept of Internet time, or I
guess in a non-validating use of the contemporary meme notation <Internet time>,
wherein developments and advancements take place at a much faster rate than in
times previous.  This point is geared towards some issues like public access to
privately founded communications networks, and fair use of same.  The tradeoff is
de facto monopolistic state versus constitutional, legal grant of competitive
access, and what timeframe is required to not discourage these private
innovators.  Correspondingly to this theme of Internet time, it's less time than
it was.

Well, back to the subject of this thread and the quoted material, now that a
judge, after lengthy deliberation in a trial with some note of forged video
evidence, has declared company M which will remain nameless guilty of
monopolistic practices, or what have you, what happens next?  There are appeals,
which barring some technicality are likely to uphold the court's decision.  Will
it be like Bill Clinton's impeachment, where nothing changed?  What was he
impeached for anyways, was it getting fellated in his office or accepting
campaign contributions from the Chinese military?  Is it in M's better interests
to reorganize now and carry on rather than reorganize later?  I.E., would this
avoid some kind of double-monopoly-jeapordy at a later point?

For many, it's an issue that is close to consider, for we use Microsoft products,
for which we have paid, although for the most part this payment starts as only
the intangible license, as opposed to purchase, when the OS comes bundled with a
PC purchase.  This is only considering the use of the PC OS, and is not
encompassing of the much more lucrative (predatory) field, that of business
software and the higher priced operating systems, ala NT.  I'm sure there is
something buried in the fine license print about it, but if the operating system
interferes with the best way to use the hardware, that is dang near wrong.

The issue of how to encourage competition is a prickly one.  Enabling others to
rebrand and sell MS products like Linux is out of the question.  Generally it's
done without rebranding, anyways, those that remarket MS products have little
reason to not do so, besides the fact that it is in Microsoft's rights to pursue
their legal rights with regards to these intangible software goods which can be
reproduced at zero margin, thus for which any claim of individual value is
arguable.  Reorganization of the software modules is moot, it is unenforceable,
as opposed to splitting a telco's wires geographically, which was probably in the
telco's better interests anyways.  They might get along better, in light of some
stories about internal competition.

There have already been competitors in the various software niches that Microsoft
occupies, many have failed where Microsoft metastasized onwards.  For each and
any of these, the design and control over the specification, documentation, and
implementation of the underlying operating system has been a key component of the
competition framework.

What is the operating system?  It is the software that loads into memory, when
queued by the BIOS, a process that runs for the duration of power being applied
to the CPU.  This process or Turing state works through the BIOS to access
hardware devices attached to the CPU such as storage, input, network, display,
sound, etc.  The process enables other processes to run, and provides the system
services to these processes.  The OS is not necessarily an MP3 player, nor a web
browser.  It's not necessarily a windowing system either, but's it's not feasible
to start at least one OS without it.

So what could we encourage Penfield Jackson to advise?  I would suggest starting
with that which is most damaging to any would-be competitor, control of the
operating system.  What are other's suggestions?

Last but not least, no small respect is due a company which has made itself a
monopolist in "Internet time."

There are two highly visible centers of significant activity relating to 
nanotech in Texas so far - at least based on my research and communication 
I've had with folks here and at Foresight on the Left Coast.  The first I 
would list is, of course, Zyvex, in Richardson, Texas (just northeast of 
Dallas):

  http://www.zyvex.com/

The big news at Zyvex is Ralph Merkle's new association with the company.  
I'll be seeing Ralph up at Zyvex next weekend.

The other visibly active center is at Rice University's Center for Nanoscale 
Science and Technology in Houston, where Nobel laureate Richard Smalley works:

   http://cnst.rice.edu/

(Isn't there always some basic rivalry between Dallas and Houston?)

Finally, there seems to be SOME kind of activity down at JSC (just south of 
Houston).  There's a company that's hung out a cyber-shingle there called 
"Nanotechnology Development Company":

   http://nanozine.com/Invest-NanoTech.htm

and a discussion group in the Clear Lake area (whose web site I can't seem to 
find this morning).  However, after some publicity about "NDC" last year, 
I've seen no activity out of them and didn't get a response to an e-mail I 
sent to the Clear Lake group in the Spring.  It seems the real center of 
NASA's interest and activity in nanotech is at Ames in Palo Alto.

Hope this helps.

It's a matter of degree, and of tradeoffs.  When consumers value is mainly
for a combination of products, e.g., a CPU, screen, OS, and word processor,
then when one company dominates the markets for more than one of these
components, there are benefits as well as costs.  The benefits are that
prices come down, and that the components are better integrated (i.e.,
customers avoid having each component maker say its the other one that is
at fault for interface problems).   A cost is that this firm can hinder
competition by purposely making its component incompatible with competing
components.  This cost is reduced if competitors can coordinate to offer
integrated systems.

If Microsoft is broken up, with an OS company and one or more applications
companies, we should expect to see higher prices for these things,
poorer integration between them, and less intentional incompatibility
between say the OS and competing applications.  Is this a good thing on net?
Very hard to say.

Herzog's an interesting guy,  as he's kinda 'out there' as an archeologist, 
non-conventional. He should be read, and then compared to other current 
Biblical archeologists for a full taste.  Archeology is full of surprises and 
it frequently takes years for the dust of centuries to settle, so we can see 
who's line of evidence is strongest. Sounds like fun.

Well stated. Your point regarding about (I'm paraphrasing) rekigious/social 
leaders using religion as a means of societal control are historically 
accurate. My contention is that not every inter-action between religion and 
science is not a re-do of the Scopes trial or even poor Galileo.  At every 
AAAS conference there is a lecture given to science and religion, focusing on 
dialogue.  Although religion (Christianity) of the 19th and the 
Fundamentalists of the 20th century have played the zero-sum game; there's no 
causal reason why this must ever be so.  

Don't be surprised with every scientific discovery achieved, that it gets 
utilized by the religious, I mean, why not?  Religion as practiced by the 
non-fundamentalist is a form of social inter-action, and also an "opiate" to 
quote Marx.  When life is painful, painkillers are frequently the treatment 
of choice, while the underlying cause of the pain is tackled.

Interestingly enough, if one reads magazines such as Skeptic and Skeptical 
Inquirer; they only thing the readers of that magazine have in common with 
most of this list's members is Atheism or Agnosticism. They generally have 
dumped on such demonstrated concepts as nanotechnology; join Scientific

Not everyone who dares to hope, even for a God, is a book-burner; a disuader 
of searching for answers, or a hypocrite.  Such people may be mis-guided in 
that hope, but its their right. Just as it is your right to say 'its all 
bullshit,  <God> gets in my way, I don't wanna hear any lies'.  Fair enough.

Hello Patrick Wilken and Extropians,

I am a transhumanist and a memetics enthousiast who just joined this
mailing list (I've learned about Extropy from the Dutch >H group 
`Transcedo' of which I'm a member) -- and I just want to respond to 
this mail from Patrick Wilken:

>                       THE UNITY OF CONSCIOUSNESS:

>     -- Please suggest other sample topics, or modify the above!!

There's absolutely no mention of *memetics* in your list of topics, nor in
your entire email.  Aren't you missing something important ?

`Memes' are a big component of the set of things that make people work,
therefore logically the science of memetics should give at least some
insights into consciousness.  Personally, I'm convinced that memetics can
explain *a lot* about consciousness.  See e.g. Daniel C. Dennett's book
`Consciousness Explained'.  (Yes, I'm a Dennett fan :-).)

Yours,     Menno Rubingh (rubingh@delftnet.nl)

I am posting this express my thoughts regarding a potential
misunderstanding on my intentions within transhumanism:

At the core of my ethical schema lies one core principle--I do
not place myself above anyone else and I do not place myself
below anyone else.  My perspective has always been that we are
co-collaborators in developing a relatively new area of thought.
To the extent that Max, Natasha, and others have developed it,
yes, they deserve respect for that.  They have mine, and always
will, regardless of personal issues.  

I cannot understand how any of my contributions, past or
current, diminishes that.  Any contribution made by any one transhumanist moves all of us forward as a whole.  To the extent 
that anyone has interpreted my involvement as trying to assert 
or usurp a place in a heirarchy--that is an interpretation made
through a filter that I do not happen to subscribe to.  And 
I have been negligent in getting up the website to list off my credentials, because I hadn't understood that people attached
some importance to that. 

Yes, I am passionate, tough-minded, questioning--please 
match your own strengths to those qualities and use them!  We hold
the beginnings of a distributed intelligence network, one that 
is currently expanding and developing new nodes.  Perhaps in time, historians will come to look upon that as our most important
contribution.

Sincerely,
Kathryn Aegis

Sorry Starman; I personally hold that Mormons are Christian, but the Joseph 
Smith's revelation puts it in a grey area(for some).  Lets call it 
"Christ-Centered" and be done with it. Both the Mormons and Southern Baptists 
love to missionize and it is gernerally why there is antagonism between them, 
asside from the doctrines of Joseph Smith.  

For many on this list, they seem to have been scalded by their encounters 
with Fundamentalism and abdure (5.00 word) anything remotely religious, as a 
result.

Indeed Dan. Tipler also made it clear that he was opposed, as a physicist and 
psychologically opposed to Neitszche's eternal return. I wish Tipler would

I also had reached the point where I saw no point in

Regarding GB's post, I can little fault with it. I
just thought I'd point that out.

In particular, I like his observation that a skeptic's
emotional reaction to "religion" is related to the
tolerance of his environment. Perhaps I've just been
very lucky in this regard, although I have been under
the impression that the culture variation between
different parts of the U.S. are exaggerated.

You might get that impression from watching TV.  However...from the driver's

Thanx Greg,
I am aware of the location of these groups, but do they hold conferences for
the public? Perhaps Rice does for it's students that is also open to the
mainstream? But I am not so sure about the others.

I'm not sure I understand you here, are you saying that you think any
power can be assured of 100% control over it's own space? Perhaps that
is a working definition of a power.

I just thought I might have a possible explanation for Fermi's paradox:
the price of failure for contact, even at a very low risk, is much
higher than any potential rewards. A power might have a few hours
amusement studying earth people, but if this planet contains (unbeknowst
to us) a hidden evil power that entraps such a visitor, this leads to
the aforementioned hideous torture for eons.

Thanks,

A question for Robin Hanson:

IMHO, one of the big problems with any kind of mega-merger is that the
organizational effectiveness of a company tends to be inversely proportional
to its size.  As a result, when a company tries to do many different things
it tends to do a poor job of all of them.  This is a particularly
significant issue in the Microsoft/Intel case, because software engineering
and CPU design are both exceptionally difficult disciplines where relatively
modest mistakes can quickly have a large effect on product quality.

So, I am wondering whether modern economic theory offers any concrete means
of analyzing this kind of concern.  Can you offer any basis for predicting
that this sort of problem would or would not become significant?

At the moment the quality of your backhand has nothing to do with the speed
your brain runs at, so there is not likely to be any change.  However, if
you were an AI (or an upload, or any other sort of entity capable of doing
internal re-wiring) things would be a little different.

A tennis-playing AI would presumably contain software for predicting the
flight of a tennis ball, controlling the motion of its arm, observing the
actual state of the game via its sensors, making abstract strategy decisions
on the fly based on the situation and the rules of the game, and relating
all of these different modules together so that it can actually act in its
decisions.  If the AI plays on the same level as a human it is likely that
this whole assemblage has trouble keeping up with actual events in a real
game - that is, after all, one of the criteria with which we separate
"interesting" games from "boring" ones.

If you double the available computing power, you can go back and look for
bottlenecks in all of these modules.  You can speed up the flight-prediction
module so that it gives an updated result the instant your opponent's swing
is complete (or even before then, based on the trajectory of his racket).
You can run the strategy module faster, so you actually have a chance to
think about what to do.  You can improve the precision of the whole motor
control subsystem, so that your swing is less likely to miss and more likely
to actually cause the trajectory change you want.  You can try out all these
ideas, along with dozens of others, and then pick the ones that turn out to
have the biggest effect on your game and keep them.

If you think of intelligence enhancement in terms of improving some
abstract, nebulous unit of "intelligence", it can seem rather improbable.
If, OTOH, you think in terms of improving your ability to perform some
concrete task, the way to proceed tends to be obvious for any field that we
have even a modest understanding of.  The contention of the "strong-SI" camp
is that this trend is likely to hold for those aspects of intelligence that
we do not yet have any understanding of, at that we should therefore expect
an exponential increase in processing power to make possible a rapid

It seems that the voice recognition software has come a _long_
way in the last 5 years. And so cheap too!

You might consider your new software/hardware as an alternative
computer input device to help prevent repetitive strain injuries.

Five years ago I became injured with a repetitive strain injury
and quit my NASA job and went home to heal and try my hand
at the astronomy consultant business. It took me about one to two
years before I could work fulltime at the computer again
(and I have some permanent loss of strength, so I have to
forever be careful using the computer), but one of the things
that I convinced my worker's comp insurance company to buy me
was a voice recognition system.

So I have a 4 year old system: "DragonDictate" running on
a 486 DOS machine and another piece of hardware that translates
the voice commands into Mac ADB characters for my Macintosh.
In 1995, the system cost about $1000, not including the price of
the computer that I bought to dedicate to it.

I really don't use the voice system now (My RSI flareups don't
happen often enough for me now to need it, so I keep the system
as a "backup" in case worse things happen), but those years ago when
I trained DragonDicate on my voice for an afternoon, I could get
40 words per minute input. The insurance people were impressed, and I
think I helped them be aware of technology that could get injured
people back working at their jobs. I remember that the science words
("Fourier" etc.) usually tripped up DragonDicate, though,
but that's understandable.

One thing to be careful of is that one can just as easily
injure one's vocal cords using these devices, so if you think
that you will use it alot, you may want to find a voice trainer,
like the kind that actors use, in order to help you use your voice
more safely.

Have fun with your new toy,

Amara

I saw this a few months ago, and was compelled to give the company a call.
I got some sample software which I haven't played with yet.

I'd love to get an internal contact to some of the people in their R&D
department, but maybe CA wants to keep them under wraps.  It would be
smarter for them to foster open systems and global collaboration, IMHO.

Sure, dozens of concrete means.  How relevant they are is another matter :-).
But there are tons of books and articles on "orgazinzation design".  Milgrom
and Roberts have a nice text (ISBN 0-13-224650-3).

Theoretically the puzzling thing is that a merged company should in theory
still have the option of letting its two parts be managed independently.
By that argument, a merged firm couldn't do any worse; merging just creates
new options.

So if merged companies do worse, it must be due to reduced oversight from the
now merged board of directors, reduced information to analysts and speculators
about the merged firm, meddling by a CEO who has to prove his or her
worth by getting involved in what should be independent operations, a
difficulty in creating financial instruments which are the equivalent
of "stock options" on the returns from each subsidiary, or some
similar explanation.

I can't speak for you, of course, but in my experience the actual memes are
more like <convince your spouse that you are faithful> and perhaps <keep
your word>.  The first is grounded in biological evolution, and the second
seems to be a sound principle in most viable ethical systems.  Add in a
traditional Western marriage vow, and you tend to get either actual fidelity
or hypocrisy.

> and it is unclear to me that I should try.

Interesting.  IMO traditional marriage is somewhat harmful even in a
traditional society, and becomes much more so when immortality and a
significant degree of self-modification become possible.  (Of course, the
likely emergence of posthumans and SI shortly thereafter renders the
question moot, but it is still an interesting topic).

IMHO, the pros and cons of marital fidelity stack up as follows:

PRO
1) Actual fidelity reduces the prevalence of Sexually transmitted diseases.

2) Purely monogamous relationships place fewer demands on an individual's
self-confidence and tolerance, and are therefore easier for some people to
maintain.

CON
1) A fidelity code does not acknowledge the natural variation in human
desires.  A few people actually want a purely monogamous relationship, but
they are at one extreme of a long continuum.  At the other end you have
complete free-love types, while in the middle are those who just want to
have an occasional fling.  A fidelity code forces almost everyone to
suppress their natural urges, which results in a lot of sexual frustration.

2) Fidelity greatly reduces the spread of sexual skills, while
simultaneously preventing individuals from comparing their personal
abilities with anything except the unrealistic visions of erotic fiction.
The result is frequently a poisonous mixture of ineptitude and insecurity
capable of doing a great deal of damage to otherwise healthy relationships.

3) Monogamy also tends to encourage a whole raft of other relationship
pathologies.  By ensuring that sexual frustration is commonplace and
experiential calibration is rare, it makes it easy for relatively minor
problems to grow into serious ones.  At the root of the problem is the fact
that the idea that a single individual will always be able to satisfy all of
your needs is simply unrealistic, but under monogamy there is no
alternative.  Dissatisfactions that would otherwise be manageable will
therefore tend to build up indefinitely, ultimately leading to all sorts of
unpleasant results.

4) A fidelity code create a perverse ethical landscape.  It rewards those
who cheat successfully while punishing both those who abide by the rules and
those who get caught breaking them.  The result is a memetic selection
pressure in favor of ideas that support skillful deception (including
self-deception) and hypocrisy.

Overall, I think the scales are clearly tipped against fidelity.  It may
work well for some small fraction of the population, but I expect that a
large majority of us would be better off with some alternative system.

If technological progress is open-ended, any hostile Power that isn't part
of your own society will either be far more advanced than you are (in which
case you can neither fight it nor run from it) or far less advanced (in
which case you are invulnerable to it).  This follows clearly from the fact
that biological evolution is many orders of magnitude slower than
technological progress.

If progress eventually comes to a halt, then you get a situation where all
SIs are of comparable sophistication and the results of combat depend
primarily on who has most resources.  In this case combative Powers would
rapidly be forced to mobilize all the mass in their environment for
defensive purposes - either as physical weapons, as computing devices
devoted to information warfare, or (more likely) as some combination of the
two, plus whatever infrastructure is required to support them.

Neither case predicts the sort of scenario you suggest.

There's a long list of pros to marital fidelity not mentioned here,
but I agree that moral actions--not values themselves, merely the
actions one takes to support them--have to change with technology,
and the problems that will arise from our failure to structure our
society with that in mind will greatly increase.  The destructive
points of marriage are mostly not the institution itself--freely
entered contracts creating mutual obligations for mutual benefit
are the very foundation of civilized behavior--but rather the
cultural and legal baggage that surrounds it. 

The primary technological changes that affect the usefulness of
marital fidelity are birth control, medicine, and general economic
growth.  Throughout most of human history, children wouldn't eat
unless they had two healthy adults caring and providing for them;
so a mother had a great interest in securing the promise of food
and protection for her children, and fathers had an interest in
ensuring that their investments were actually going into their
own children.  Today there is reliable birth control, so purely
recreational sex is possible--which it never was during the time
of our evolution.  Secondly, economic growth makes it common for
a child to have more than adequate care from one parent.  Today
we know about the evolutionary source of kin-preference and can
overcome it (I would probably care for stepchildren, for example,
rather than killing them as my ancestors would).

I've always though something like Heinlein's "line" marriages
would be better suited to a modern society.  Plenty of people
around to pool resources, care for children, and have some
degree of sexual variety while keeping intimacy and maintaining
a history and consistent values.

Menno:

I like Dennett too, but I am not sure I am sold on the ideas of memes.
Certainly from the perspective of the conference. How do you think memes
would resolve any of the binding problems?

I am sort of curious: people talk about memes as this really groovy
explanation, but I can't see them as being an improvement over the ideas
associated with cognition. How is 'memetics' a more powerful tool for
understanding thoughts, emotions, or consciousness, than those developed in
cognitive neuroscience (which lack any mention of memes).

So should we bring out calipers and reinstate phrenology?  Likely not.  The
nature vis-a-vis nurture debate is a longstanding one.

Good DNA is doubtless a beneficial factor when it comes to the ability to
learn, but at the same time, problem solving skills are a largely learned
skill.

Brain chemistry is a vast field, and one best left to brain chemists.  By the
same token, the large-scale (over)prescription of mood-altering drugs can be a
bad thing.

Memetics, if being the study and analysis of memes and memetic transition, is
tightly bound with sociology and psychology.

Um, OK.  Now how is any of that related to anything I've said?
I'm not being facetious here--I honestly don't know what you're
trying to say here or why you think it's a reply to my post.

You're right of course: memetics doesn't tell you anything about how
the brain works, any more than genetics tells you how DNA works.  It's
quite the opposite perspective.  Evolution of DNA explains many of the
physical traits we see in various animal species; similarly, memetics
can explain some of the aspects of human culture that the human mind
has produced, but it has nothing at all to say about how the mind
itself works--that's still being shaped by good old DNA.  Once a kid
starts learning, his actions may be shaped by memetic inheritance,
but the brain itself and how it processes thoughts and emotions are
already formed at birth.  If it weren't, there wouldn't be any medium
for memes to replicate in.

The only slight influence memetic evolution might have on the working
of the brain itself is through pseudo-Lamarckian Baldwin effects (i.e.,
cultural choices as an environmental factor selecting for genetic
traits).

I mean not to be facetious either, although it was flippant.  This quote
sparked reply:

>"Once a kid

The brain has always fascinated me.  As medicine developed over the years,
common knowledge went from the heart as center of being to the brain of center
of consciousness, although probably many a wise elder or shaman would have
known correctly.

The brain is a physical structure (here I venture into unfamiliar territory)
where sophisticated chemical and electromagnetic reactions take place to fire
the mechanisms of consciousness, memory, and locomotion.  The question of
self-awareness or spirit is not one I can answer, although many venture to do
so, with their reasons.

Here are some links about brain, they are mostly clinical.

http://www.neuroguide.com/ - Study links
http://www.med.harvard.edu/AANLIB/home.html - Whole Brain Atlas
http://dir.yahoo.com/Science/Biology/Neuroscience/ - Neuroscience directory

I'm sure there are many more.  I can not name many brain structures besides the
cerebrum, cerebellum, medulla oblongata, and brain stem.

Ah, the brain, perhaps the most complicated result of a fertilized zygote.
Here's to brain.

Anyways, I commented on a statement that we are limited or bound by our genetic
makeup, which I feel is not accurate, although I do not dispute genetic
predisposition.

A friend cites the New Testament:

And Jesus asked them, "Who is it that men say that I am?"

And the disciples answered, "You are the kerygma of our metaphysical

And Jesus said unto them, "Say *what*?"

That seems like a good possibility, although I think Heinein tended to make
marriage groups much larger than is actually practical.  I suspect it would
be very difficult to maintain a group much bigger than 4-5 people, because
the number of interpersonal relationships involved becomes too large.
Besides, it was hard enough to find one person I wanted to marry - finding a
group that big would seem to require either impossibly good luck or rather
low personal standards.

I tend to favor smaller group marriages involving 3-5 partners, with gender
balance varying depending on the orientations of the individuals involved.
However, I can see plenty of other workable arrangements, from an open
version of the traditional marriage to various fluid forms of polyamory.  I
think the important rules are simply:

1) Be open and honest with each other about everything.
2) Talk about and agree on the rules for your relationship up front.
3) Don't try to put restrictions on your partner(s) for no good reason.
4) Do insist on rules about the things that really matter to you.
5) Be realistic in your expectations.

Of course, this approach runs directly counter to the expectations of
Western culture.  After all, <love conquers all>, <only love matters>, <your
head can't (and shouldn't) understand your heart>, and "I do" comes just
before you segue to the happy ending scene, right?

     Hello, all.

     I am currently reading and selecting books for a reading list. I would 
like to include a book on critical thinking, seeing through logical 
fallacies, separating emotion, sentiment and cliches out of arguments...that 
sort of thing. I searched Amazon.com and found 2 or 3 that look good, but I 
would like to hear your recommendations and opinions.

     Thanks in advance for any feedback.

Glad someone brought this up, for I fear doctors are giving bad
advice under some circumstances.  When doctors see the youngest
fingers going numb, especially in office workers, especially in
the silly clone valley, the *immediately* say no keyboard for
a month.  How the hell is one to do one's job?

I have had this problem over the years, and experimented with
it enough to report the following theory:

Whereas I agree this *may* be related to keyboard use in many
people, in my case, the phenomenon is much more dependent upon...
motorcycles!

I was getting better, fewer instances of finger numbness, etc.  I
went on vacation in New England, drove 4 megameters in 11
days, no keyboards, suddenly, major dead fingers!  Both hands.
The weekend we had extro4, rode the bike up to Berzerkely, dead
fingers.

The first year I was doing extropians, no capital letters
to reduce keystrokes, no difference.  Wrote a 400 page fiction
work in about a month, no increase in dead fingers. Gave up
Jar Jar Binks, no difference.

Conclusion:  in my case, the wrist problems are more related
to driving than keyboards.  Now I will wait and see if the
medical community concludes similarly within a few years.
Its driving and motorcycles.

EvMick, whaddya think?  spike

  (Humans fed small beta-carotene supplements do not experience reduced
mortality rates. This is line with animal studies which have also found 
no benefit for such small supplements. 
   The case is different with very large supplements
in experimental animals  A human consuming about 2000 calories/day of the
hamster chow used below would be ingesting about 5 grams of beta-carotene/day.
The 98% survival at 69 weeks is a record for male Syrian golden hamsters.)

High Survival of Hamsters Given Intracheal Instillations of Benzo[a]pyrene and
Ferric Oxide and Kept on a High Beta-carotene Diet

Carcinogenesis 15(1): 133-136 1994

Abstract:
  The study described in this paper was primarily conducted to identify the cell
types involved in the formation, progression and regression of metaplastic
changes in the repiratory tract epithelium of hamsters after intratracheal
intubations with benzo[a]pyrene. Furthermore, the role of vitamin A and
beta-carotene in these processes was studied. In the course of the study
a remarkable effect of dietary beta-carotene on survival of hamsters became
a subject of investigation. Hamsters were fed diets with various levels of
vitamin
A or beta-carotene and were treated intratracheally with a suspension of
benzo[a]pyrene with ferric oxide in saline. The tumour response of the
respiratory tract was very low (2.8%) and hyper- and metaplasia of respiratory
epithelium were virtually absent. However, an interesting observation was an
exceptionally low mortality of only 2% after 69 weeks in the group of hamsters
fed a high beta-carotene diet (1% w/w), whereas in the other groups mortality
after 69 weeks amounted to 25%. Although the exact cause of death of most
of the hamsters could not be established, a 40% reduction of lipid peroxidation
in the livers was found in the high beta-carotene group. Moreover, in this group
the degree and incidence of nephrosis and of focal mineralization of kidneys
and heart were lower than in the other groups. These favourable effects of
the high beta-carotene diet may have contributed to the unusually high
survival rate in hamsters fed this diet. Further studies are planned to verify
and study this observation.

No Freak'in doubt!  The Pompous part I disagree with simply because I

Yeah, if ya can't dazzle em' with brains; baffle em with bullshit.  Yet I 
persist in a Tiplerian fashion to hope against hope. For me it doesn't take 
much energy to do this, but for others I can see Religion getting in the way 
of a sane life. Or whats an Ontological Epistemology for?  Perhaps a 
didactic, dialectical, noeticism? To which the Dalai Lama said: "What Choo

I think in time of plenty, social bonds widen.  People in extreme poverty
tend to only care about their immediate family.

I don't believe that it's the specific activity that causes the
dead fingers (extremeties) -  it's _how_ you do the activity. It
sounds to me that you may not be supporting blood circulation
in your hands, and holding some of your upper body in a static
contraction. Is it possible to ride your motorcycle in a more
relaxed fashion- ease up on the grips (safely) ?

So about driving -

Certainly I made my RSI worse during my most injured years when
I drove that beautiful Route 9 drive to Big Basin Park- curvey twisty
turns, with my hands gripped ultra-hard on my car's shift handle
and the steering wheel.

But I also can still excerberate my old injury by holding the hammers
of hammered dulcimer instrument tight or by holding the handlebars of
my bicycle tight for long parts of my bicycle rides.

My own experience from these last 5 years of learning about my RSI
injury, is that once I taught my body new ways to  move and carry itself
so that muscles were not held static for long periods of time
(breaks help too), the healing began. (Many other factors
were involved in the healing process too.)

Take a good look at how you are moving and keep that blood
flowing. It's really important. Maybe Biofeedback can show
you some things too (in my opinion, it's the most efficient way
to learn how to move differently and in a relaxed way.)

You can look at my RSI page too and see if there's anything appropriate
for your injury (it's for computer users, but maybe you'd find
some useful things on it):

I will give up meat.  I will give up excess calories, fatty foods and

...but give up Jar Jar Binks?  Even I have my limits!

Well, she doesn't seem too keen on a MFF arrangement, but MMF or MMFF would
be fine with her.  Of course, putting two heterosexual males in the same
household is asking for trouble (maybe she thinks I'm being unreasonable on
that point? :-)  ).

This is actually a good example of why I added the "gender balance varying"
part of the above quote.  You don't want an arrangement that puts people who
aren't interested in each other in bed at the same time, and you don't want
anyone sleeping alone either.  For that reason I think that larger groups
will tend not to work unless the people involved are bi- or homosexual.

People work toward basic needs, such as food, first.  After food, shelter,
finances are taken care of, then social bonding will become important.
Social bonding is secondary to the immediate physical needs.

I've had keyboard-related wrist problems, during the course of which I
noticed a similar result.  It seems that driving alone doesn't have any
effect, but if I'm already having problems then driving will aggravate them
much more than using a keyboard.

How about "The Critical Approach to Science and Philosophy" edited by Mario 
Bunge. It is a collection of essays from about 35-40 different reputable 
scientists, logicians, mathematicians, and philosophers in the spirit of 
Karl Popper. I forgot the publ. and copyright.. I highly recommend!

Extropians!  Please help:  Ive been asked to give a talk on short notice,
(as in tomorrow evening) to an engineering society to which
I belong.

I decided to talk on nanotechnology.  The pitch is ready
except for a nanotech timeline.

What should I put in there?

1959:   Feynmans talk Plenty of Room at the Bottom
1969:  Gina Miller is born
1986:  Engines of Creation by Drexler
1992:  Nanotechnology by Drexler
Nov 1999: Nanomedicine by Freitas

etc.  What are the most important milestones?

Thanks!  I do appreciate the help.  I have a copies of
Nanotech, Engines and Nanomedicine at home.  Perhaps they
have timelines in there.  I would forward this on to the nanotech
group but dont know the address, and im at work..   spike

               Mars Polar Lander Mission Status
                      November 8, 1999

     Engineers say they are close to resolving a potential 
problem on NASA's Mars Polar Lander uncovered by the NASA panel 
appointed to investigate the recent loss of the Mars Climate 
Orbiter.

     The NASA investigation board, chaired by Art Stephenson, 
director of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, 
Ala., found that cold temperatures could affect the performance 
Mars Polar Lander's descent engine, which begins firing at about 
2 kilometers (about 1 = miles) altitude during the descent to 
Mars surface.  As a result of the finding, a team of engineers at 
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.,  has 
developed procedures to warm up the engine system prior to 
firing.  In addition, the team has analyzed descent engine 
performance at a range of temperatures to assess its predicted 
performance upon arrival.

     Updated operations plans call for turning on propellant 
system heaters several hours prior to the spacecraft's entry into 
Mars' atmosphere.  This strategy will increase the expected 
temperature of the descent engines to 8 degrees Celsius (46.4 
degrees Fahrenheit).  Analysis indicates that at this 
temperature, the engines will perform as designed.  

     Ground-based testing of an actual descent engine was 
conducted last week at the descent engine manufacturer's test 
facility.  The initial test results suggest acceptable engine 
start-up performance is achieved when the catalyst bed, where 
engine firing initiates, is at temperatures as low as -20 degrees 
Celsius (-4 degrees Fahrenheit).  More ground-based test firings 
are scheduled to better characterize engine performance at 
various temperatures.

     On Wed., Nov. 10, NASA will release the investigation board 
findings on the loss of Mars Climate Orbiter and recommendations 
for the Mars Polar Lander mission, which lands on Mars Dec. 3.  

     Mars Polar Lander successfully performed its third course 
correction on Oct. 30, and another maneuver to fine-tune the 
flight path is scheduled for Nov. 30.  The spacecraft remains in 
good health.

     On Nov. 1, the spacecraft's landing radar system was turned 
on for the first time since launch and successfully performed its 
internal self-test. Test results show the unit's integrity is 
sound, and all electrical functional test results were within the 
expected range. The landing radar will not be turned on again 
until landing day. The radar system is activated just after 
separation of the lander's heat shield, following parachute 
deployment, and begins searching for the surface. Once the system 
recognizes the Martian surface, it must generate data for 
approximately 60 seconds, providing altitude and velocity 
measurements to the spacecraft's onboard guidance system for 
powered descent.
 
     Mars Climate Orbiter was lost as it was entering orbit 
around Mars on Sept. 23.  The orbiter and lander are part of a 
series of missions in a long-term program of Mars exploration 
managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for NASA's Office of 
Space Science, Washington, D.C.  JPL's industrial partner is 
Lockheed Martin Astronautics, Denver, Colo.  JPL is a division of 
the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, Calif.

An interesting thought.  Let me rephrase.  In famine and hard times,
one cares about kin as always, and one is very grateful for the aid of
non-kin allies.  It is when one finds out who one's "true friends" are.
But it is not a time when one *invests* in creating new non-kin allies.
And it is a time when one may well "betray" those one doesn't consider
true friends.

In times of plenty, that is the time to invest in creating new allies.
In ancient times, other assets one could invest in tended to be less
durable.  So one invested in allies, by partying and other forms of
leisure with them, and by helping them in times of health need.

There is also a life cycle effect.  When one is young it is a good time
to invest in allies, as those allies can be useful for the rest of your
life.  And your skills at doing other things are less.  So youth is a
time of bonding, via partying and schooling.  When you are old, those
allies are worth more to you, but you invest less to create new allies.

If the world gets richer as you get older, these two effects, times of
plenty vs. famine, and youth vs. older age, counter-act each other.
Each person feels more constant as they age, even as the world as a
whole spends more on leisure, health care, and schooling.

Maybe the invention of the STM, and the famous IBM-logo of xenon
atoms. The first re-engineering of a bacterial protein to do something
useful. The first self-replicating chemical. 

I don't have the years for those, though.

See the reference dates for IBM's work with the Scanning Tunneling
Microscope at <http://www.almaden.ibm.com/vis/stm/library.html#ref2>.

    1990:  Positioning single atoms with a scanning tunneling microscope.
35 Xenon atoms spell IBM.

    1993:  Confinement of electrons to quantum corrals on a metal surface.
Imaging standing waves in a two-dimensional electron gas.

Take a look at <http://www.almaden.ibm.com/vis/stm/gallery.html> for more
information.  This is IBM's nanotech gallery.  They discuss the science and
art of creating things one atom at a time.

You may want to visit the Nanotechnology Timeline site by Sean Morgan.
http://lucifer.com/%7Esean/N-FX/index.html
You may also want to mention the most recent advances or news on the
nanoscale. For example:
*Nadrian Seemans nanorobitic arm built from synthetic dna:
http://www.eurekalert.org/releases/nyu-bnr080199.html
*On July 7, 1999, the American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Science
Policy News reported that "one area of research that is beginning to come in
for special interest from the White House and Congress is nanotechnology.
http://www.aip.org/enews/fyi/1999/fyi99.106.htm
*Rick Smalley testified at a Senate hearing on nanotechnology (PDF)
http://www.senate.gov/~commerce/hearings/0512sma.pdf
*For the first time, researchers have designed from scratch a working,
chemically powered, molecular motor.September 8, 1999
http://www.nih.gov/nigms/news/releases/kelly.html
*Hewlett Packard presents their nanolab and with UCLA collaboration the
self-assembled molecular logic gate (Teramac computer) that has been hailed
on the Web as a major advance in nanotechnology.
http://www.hp.com/ghp/features/nano/index.html
*Viola Vogel, associate professor of bioengineering at the University of
Washington, uncovered the molecular switch operation while investigating
fibronectin, a molecule that plays a role in the cell binding functions of
living proteins.

You may want to look at some of  these and summerize them into your timeline
for your group. I suggest you give them a little of your personal
evaluations as well.

One must distinguish task, kinship and informal social groups. In gregarious
species such as ours, I suppose coorperation for hunting, gathering and
mutual defense, i.e. task-oriented bonding, especially among early nomadic
communities, would have been coincident historically with the "work toward
basic needs" you describe.

HALLOWEEN PROTEST AGAINST 'FRANKENSCIENCE':

This has not been a good year for life-scientists. Anti-GM activists dressed
as genetically engineered monsters took part in Halloween celebrations in
New York and Washington D.C. to protest against what they call
'Frankenscience'.
    The Campaign for Responsible Transplantation were out in force on the
streets of New York's Greenwich Village during the famous night-time
Halloween Parade. They had created a four metre tall puppet of a mad
scientist who wore a dollar sign tie clip and clutched a model of a
pig-human hybrid. A number of 'hybrid attendants' wearing pig snouts danced
around with signs warning of the dangers of xenotransplantation. The
director of the campaign said that Halloween costumes seemed appropriate
because 'it's a very ghoulish technology'. In Washington D.C., Friends of
the Earth marched to a local branch of Safeways, wearing Frankenstein masks
and accompanied by a 'Gene Beast' who the campaigners hope will bring
attention to the genetically modified strawberries that contain a gene for
an antifreeze protein taken from the arctic flounder.

I can see it now,

The guy before Spike finishes up his talk...

    "...and that's how you measure the gloss of paint."

Spike takes the stand... the lights dim...

    "IN THE FUTURE..."

As the words role out of Spike's mouth the audience develops
a mixed look of captivation and worry.

    "...and then we upload into planet-size computers and
    figure out a way to escape into a baby universe with
    Tiplerian properties.  Thank you, and goodnight"

It's good to be extropian.

And don't forget,

1999: Rosalita Associates publishes John Sundman's Acts of the Apostles (see 
www.wetmachine.com for first 13 chapters)a nanotech thriller about Gulf War 
Syndrome and technocrazed extropians, fostering a decidedly darker view of 
the silicon valley religion of turbo-capitalist-informationtology than one 
generally sees on this panglossian list.

2000: Invisible swarm of flying nanomachines released from Foresight 
Institute dismantle Sundman's server, stack of unsold books and subsequently 
Sundman himself, thereby silencing last senior in the class refusing to go 
out for nanocheerleading.

Rah!

EvMick, are you an 18-wheeler driver?  I've always thought that would be a 
great job in some ways.  I love the feeling of freedom, getting out on the 
open road, exploring new parts of the country.  I'm one who always enjoys 
being on the move, so I guess that's part of the appeal. I don't know if 
you've driven through the deep South; religion so permeates the 
road-tripper's environment (freeway signage, radio programs, etc.) that it's 
really quite surreal, not to mention a bit disturbing.

Actually, the very eve of Singularity, when superintelligent AI is no
longer some never-k'never but an immediate prospect, is when I expect
some of the largest social problems.  Remember, we haven't won until the
SI has nanotechnology.

     n/0 where n is nonzero is undefined,

     0/n where n is nonzero is defined
     and is always equal to zero.

     0/0 is indeterminate and can be 
     shown to be equal to any number,
     hence we'd also say it's undefined.

William Gibson's latest, _All Tomorrow's Parties_, his third "bridge"
novel
(after _Virtual Light_ and _Idoru_), is a Singularity Eve story about an
AI
getting hold of nanotech.

SPOILERS


























It's an entertaining book, not because Gibson has the imaginative sweep
of
Greg Egan, but because of the detailed texture of Gibson's descriptive
prose coupled with his wicked sense of humor.  In a sense, we've been
here
before with _Neuromancer_ (in which an AI gets loose and precipitates a
singularity of sorts), but the technological mix has a more late-90's
feel
(no "jacking into the matrix", just accessing the Web with smart
sunglasses;
no chip implants in the brain, no orbital habitats, but nanotech --
explicitly
so-called -- on the horizon).

The AI in this story is Rei Toei, the Idoru, a Japanese virtual pop
icon,
who has given her employers the slip and gotten herself GlobEx'ed from
Tokyo to
San Francisco inside a high-tech holographic projector, where something
Big
is about to happen.

There is also Colin Laney, former associate of the Idoru's,
who has quit his job and is in hiding in a community of the homeless
living
in cardboard boxes in the depths of the Tokyo subway.  He is aware of
the approaching singularity because of his ability to see "nodal points"
is the past and the future, due to his exposure to an experimental drug
in childhood (one of the less-plausible elements of the story).  Laney
watches the approaching nodal point with his data goggles from his
cardboard
box, where he subsists on sugar, caffeine, and cough syrup, and
coordinates
the movements of Berry Rydell, the "rent-a-cop" from Gibson's earlier
"bridge"
novels, whom he has hired to quit his job in L.A. and travel to San
Francisco
to look after Rei Toei.

The "baddie" in all this is Cody Harwood, a shadowy billionaire and
power-behind-the-throne who is explicitly compared to Bill Gates in the
book.  He is also aware of the coming nodal point, and his priority is
to
make sure that he wields the same power after the shift as he has
before,
even if he has to kill people to do so.  He has hired a team of
world-class
assassins to carry out his instructions.

The nanotechnology in the book is about to be unleashed on the world
(and this is one of the points where Gibson's sense of humor is evident)
by means of a chain of "Lucky Dragon" convenience stores (a sort of
Seven-Eleven out of Singapore), which is about to install a system of
"nanofax" machines to enable scanning and assembling of physical objects
all around the world.  Harwood is the brains behind this rollout;
the convenience-store service is simply a "front" to enable him to
deploy
a world-wide network of assemblers/disassemblers -- what real use they
will
turn out to have, even Harwood is not certain.

It's all set in the usual Gibsonian milieu of knife-wielding hustlers
and street criminals, ninja assassins, and heavy-handed corporate types.
It's a quick, fun read.

The Dallas Morning News reports today on new developments regarding the
proposed re-creation of the infrared imagery from the Waco raid in order
to try to resolve the question of whether it shows gunshots.

The FBI offers a new explanation for the flashes seen on the FLIR video:

Previously they had suggested that they were reflections from blowing
debris and broken glass.  Calling them "unexplained" is not a very strong
answer, in my opinion.  I would still like to know why they only seem
to occur in a certain area and when seen from a certain angle (assuming
that the full tape confirms this pattern).

An interesting point is made by someone on the other side:

> "The only way to resolve this is experimentally," said one expert

This is a surprising comment, because it seemed to me that the flashes
were relatively obvious and well defined compared to the background noise.
I'm not sure what effects he is imagining which would lead to a low
probability of seeing them.  It almost sounds like he's doing a little
preparatory CYA in the event that the re-creation doesn't show flashes;
he can explain it as due to the "low probability of interecept".

The article also says that the FBI has offered to run a private re-creation
for Danforth's people, because they can get security clearances.  However
the new letter from Danforth's office indicates that he would prefer the
test to be run openly, for public view.  The House committee backs
Danforth, and it looks to me like Justice will be forced to back down and
cooperate.

People also come together in crises, sometimes.

But we evolved in a cyclical environment.  It'd make sense to bond during
plenty, and use the bonds during hard times.  Anthropologists think they see
this in the gift cultures of a lot of gatherer and peasant societies: one
person with a big kill or bumper crop throws a feast, spreading the wealth.
Primitive insurance.

Wow!  I didn't realize we had psychics here on the list!  I will take my own 
stab at it.

2004: Gina meets a handsome, virile and brilliant multimillionaire who is 
entranced by the possibilities of nanotech.  They meet at a Foresight 
Institute conference and it is "love at first conversation!" The man does 
think Gina being beautiful is a big plus too!

2004: Later in the year they get married by none other then Eric Drexler, 
father of nanotech, who got special permission from city hall to do the 
honors.

2005: With Gina's encouragement the Foresight Institute suddenly has a very 
major influx of cash to keep it going in style.

2006: They have their first child, a girl, who is named Carla Drexler ____. 
:)

2007: They have a dog named Disassembler who is true to his name!

2008: They have twins, a boy and a girl, who are named Nano and Assembler. 
:)

2008:  For some odd reason after this event Gina posts much less often to 
the extropian list.

2009: Gina celebrates her 40th birthday and still looks great!

2011: Carla starts school and the teacher wonders why all the pictures and 
playdough sculptures resemble nanoassemblers.  She meets the mom at a pta 
meeting and realizes why.

2013:  Nano and Assembler start school.  The teacher asks them where they 
got their names.  After a half-hour lecture on nanotech from the twins she 
wishes she hadn't! :)

2020: Before even the  home nano-replicator comes out on the market Gina has 
one!  She tells everyone on the extropian vr node how great it is!

2021:  At this point all her kids have the habit of winning their school 
science fairs.

2022:  Carla Drexler does her science fair project on working nanotech.  
There is a glitch and the nanobots destroy the school!  But no one is hurt 
in the incident and she figures out how to rebuild the school so she wins 
the science fair.  Carla gets high marks for demonstration.

2029: Gina celebrates 60th birthday and still looks great.  She is touched 
as friends give her as presents various blueprints of things she can make in 
her home replicator.  Gina says, "Ahh, thank you", as each gift pops out."

2029: Later in the year Gina and her husband fly in their aerospace plane to 
the University of California campus on the moon.  The twins are graduating 
and she is a proud mama!

2035: The singularity hits!!  World in chaos as A.I.'s flex their muscles 
and demand equal rights with humans.  Many old-time extropians say this 
cannot be happening.  World President Eli Yudkowsky and secretary of state 
Max More broker a peace.  The world is saved!

2035: Later in the year in the midst of a "transformed in ways we cannot 
conceive of world", Gina uses her position on the United Nations 
nanotechnology board to put an end to hunger and lack of adequate shelter.

Then to celebrate this Gina takes nano therapy from Dr. Frietas, the family 
general practitioner.  In no time at all she looks thirty again!

2039:  Looking better then ever, Gina celebrates her seventieth birthday.  
She is surrounded by old friends from the Foresight Institute, the 
Extropians and other groups dating back to her youth.

Her husband and kids and now even grandkids are present.  This is a truly 
great day.  I even come to visit while riding on the back of my flying 
moosegasus.

The AP reported the premier showing of Michael McNulty's 
new video "Waco: A New Revelation," which is a follow-up 
to his Emmy-Award winning documentary "Waco: The Rules 
of Engagement." This new documentary, narrated by former 
FBI scientist Frederic Whitehurst, alleges that the 
government placed a shaped-charge bomb on top of the 
concrete room, which blasted a hole through its roof, 
killing the woman and children inside. The bomb theory 
was first proposed by Gordon Novel and evidence for it 
is reviewed at IAN GODDARD'S ANTI-AUTHORITARIAN JOURNAL:

Waco Movie Puts Blame on Feds 

By Michelle Mittelstadt
Associated Press Writer
Wednesday, Nov. 3, 1999; 6:39 p.m. EST

WASHINGTON -- A new film on the 1993 Waco siege
suggests federal agents used an explosive charge 
to blast into the steel-reinforced concrete bunker 
where Branch Davidian women and children died. 

As evidence, the makers of "Waco: A New Revelation"
present video footage shot after the violent end of 
the siege showing a gaping hole in the bunker's roof. 
The steel rods used to reinforce the concrete were 
bent inward -- apparently, the film's analysts say, 
by a blast that would have been devastating to 
people inside. 

The movie also contends that cult members were 
pinned down by automatic gunfire as the compound 
was consumed by flames, cutting off their only 
route to safety. 

The film, produced by Colorado-based MGA Entertainment, 
was previewed Wednesday for reporters and others. 

The FBI said, as it has for six years, that agents 
fired no shots. 

"We are aware of no incidents where gunfire emanated 
from any law enforcement source," bureau spokesman 
Bill Carter said. "Our position has not changed." 

Carter said he was unfamiliar with the allegation 
that a "shape charge" explosive device was detonated 
on the roof of the concrete bunker. He also declined 
comment about the documentary. 

Fresh controversy over Waco began earlier this year 
after the documentary's main researcher, Michael 
McNulty, discovered a potentially incendiary tear 
gas canister amid the thousands of pounds of evidence 
held in storage lockers. That discovery led FBI and 
Justice Department officials to recant their 
longstanding contention that only non-incendiary 
tear gas was used. 

The government says its agents played no role in the 
fire or Davidians' death. Cult leader David Koresh 
and some 80 followers perished during the blaze, 
some from the flames, others from gunshot wounds. 

The documentary, which includes interviews with 
former FBI, CIA and military personnel as well as 
surviving Branch Davidians, also asserts: 

-- Because of bugging devices in the compound, the 
FBI was aware of the Davidians' talk of setting the 
place aflame. Bureau officials have long denied that 
they had advance knowledge of the cult members' 
intent, saying the transmissions were too garbled 
to understand. 

-- Federal agents fired from a helicopter at a Branch
Davidian who ventured outside the compound three hours
before the blaze began, according to a videotape 
analyzed by Edward Allard, a former Army night vision 
lab supervisor hired as an expert in the Davidian 
survivors' wrongful-death lawsuit against the 
government. "In our opinion, it's clearly machine 
gun fire from the helicopter," Allard says on the film. 

-- Infrared surveillance videotape shot by an FBI 
plane shows two people rolling out from under a tank 
and firing dozens of rounds from a machine gun at the 
compound, Allard says. "I stopped counting after 62 
individual shots," he says. 

Rep. Clifford Stearns, R-Fla., who attended one of 
two film screenings Wednesday, said the documentary 
should be seen by members of Congress and the public 
alike. 

As to those who might dismiss the film as biased, 
Stearns said: "I don't visualize it as propaganda. 
I visualize it as an attempt to bring questions to 
the American people." 

The documentary is narrated by Frederic Whitehurst, 
a former FBI scientist whose complaints about shoddy
practices in the bureau's crime lab led to a scathing
inspector general review.

-Sensations are stored in different types of memory, begining with
very short term memory.  Memory is passed down to longer term memory
based on how much of the sensations are recognized.  As memory is
passed down it is sorted and grouped with other sensations based on
time recognition.
-Memory program doesn't store the same sensations in memory twice.
-Cognitive program constantly checks memory database for patterns and
catagorizes its findings in sections that may be linkied.
-Catagorizing breaks apart what the robot senses into meaningful
information, sorting by process of pattern recognition.
-Sensations are taken and processed as super high speeds so groups of
sounds like whole words such as "hello" aren't stored but only parts
of the sounds.

-The robot can be programmed to be curious of and interact with its
environment.

-The robot should be able to learn language just as babies do, and
thus effectively communicate with humans.

-Because the robot remembers every position it's in and interacts with 
itself, it will recognize itself and become self aware.

Here's a question for our aerospace professionals (and space groupies like 
me): How quickly after the development of a general purpose programmable 
assembler could a completely "de novo space program" be developed, and how 
many (or rather, how few) people with what expertise would be necessary to do 
it?

Here's the scenario that generates the question: Imagine that a "classic" 
Drexlerian assembler is developed and is available to a group of people 
having the goal of setting up an independent, self-sufficient 
extraterrestrial presence for biological humans as quickly as possible.  
Imagine that this group is working independently of the established aerospace 
companies.  The motivation behind the goal of getting off Earth fast would be 
two-fold: 1) to escape as quickly as possible from restrictions on 
development of transhuman technologies such as genetic engineering and 2) to 
establish some distance as quickly as possible from an Earth where Really Bad 
Stuff might happen once the availability of assembler technology becomes 
widespread.  

The goal is to establish a safe base away from Earth as quickly as possible.  
This base may be a temporary haven - a jumping-off point from which more 
distant, secure and dispersed settlements would be launched, again as soon as 
possible.  Thus, I imagine that the immediate goal is to establish a presence 
on Luna, where raw material would be most quickly available for further 
development.  I know that it takes less delta-vee to utilize resources in the 
asteroid belt, but in this scenario, time is of the essence.

So, what is the minimum set of basic skills and how quickly can the posited 
"small band of nanotech-enabled transhumanists" get off Earth?

I envision the following basic scheme:

<> Some kind of very rapid recapitulation of the history of the manned and 
unmanned space programs.  Thus a basic rocket booster would have to be 
developed and proven with a minimum of tests and versions.  This booster 
would ideally be 1) modular (so that it can be employed for a range of 
payload weights) and 2) fueled by material that could be readily synthesized 
using assembler technology (hydrogen and oxygen from water?)

<> A range of engines and fuel tankage systems that could be adopted to 
exo-atmospheric vehicles of various sizes.

<> Some kind of basic modular robotic spacecraft "bus" would have to be 
developed.  This "Basic Robot Bus" ("BRB") would serve as a core navigation 
and communication module that could be applied to many different functions, 
such as establishment of an independent, secure orbital communication 
infrastructure for the project, both in Earth and Lunar orbits and beyond, 
and should also be easily adaptable to manned vehicles.

<> Modular robotic extensions for the BRB for use in on-orbit and lunar 
surface construction

<> A lunar surface rover chassis for use of the robotic systems in preparing 
a lunar habitat

<> A basic manned spacecraft that could serve as a transit vehicle to be 
boosted up from Earth surface to LEO

<> A basic "hab module" that can be boosted into LEO and made part of a 
translunar vehicle

<> A lunar lander stage that can mate to a standard hab module

<> Modular, scalable life support systems - from spacesuit to "hab module" 
scale

<> (Maybe) a spacesuit.

<> (Maybe) a reentry vehicle in case the whole thing falls through and the 
initial emigrants have to abort the program.

<> A plan for robotic prefabrication of a basic lunar initial habitat.

This seems like the minimum kit necessary to get off Earth in a hurry.  
Assuming the basic technical capability of a fully programmable assembler 
(i.e. the ability to make diamonoid structures of arbitrary size and 
complexity and thence the ability to extract basic elementary chemicals 
pretty easily), how few aerospace professionals would need to be involved?  
What if they brought with them to the task only the knowledge that was in 
their heads and publicly available information?   Given state-of-the art CAD 
circa, say, 2015 (assuming no runaway singularity in the meantime - which I 
do), how quickly could this minimal group start throwing stuff into orbit?  
How quickly could they start remote fabrication of an initial lunar 
habitation?  When could the first people get securely off Earth with a 
reasonable safety margin and a reasonable chance of maintaining their 
presence off Earth indefinitely?  I assume 1) that very simple designs might 
be possible and 2) a secure launch site would be available - but one that 
might not be secure for very long once hardware starts going up.

This thought problem is thrown out with the intention of seeing just how 
difficult the "I'm clearing out as fast as I can after the assembler 
breakthrough" scenario really is.

I'd like to endorse Greg Burch's question as being extremely important,
and add this followup:  

Is there any form of predesign or preplanning that could be done *now*
which could realistically shorten the amount of time, or decrease the
number of people, needed to convert assembler technology to at least one
self-sustaining settlement in Earth orbit?

My sister drives a Mack, I bought her a Delorme GPS receiver that plugs
into her laptop computer, nice big screen.  With Street Atlas 7.0, it
should be less than $200, and has umptyjillion "points of interest"-
basically you have a stripped-down yellow pages built in, with truckstop
references under the "transportation" logo.

The POI's can be searched for within a radius up to five miles (as well as
by name), and can be filtered by various types.  Useful gadget, probably
cheaper than a handheld standalone GPS (provided you have alaptop to plug
it into, but you should be able to find a used pentium model cheap these
days).

For some reason I feel inspired, not to completely co-operate with your
scenario, but to try to shoot it "down in flames" to some extent :^).
Hmmm, the "classic assembler" would presumably be actually a nanofactory
of some kind, something not too different from the "exemplar"
nanofactory described in Chapter 14 of Drexler's _Nanosystems_. There,
we have a quite capable diamondoid-based factory that is to be both self
replicating and programmable for extrusion of many kinds of useful
diamondoid-based products, also able to scale its own copies up to some
quite large size. So, within the limits of the little molecular block
assemblies that the nanofactory is meant to handle efficiently, it does
become a very neat scenario to try to imagine what sort of space
"program" could engineers readily "program"!

One thing that complicates this "classic" scenario is that before we get
such a refined, reliable, and scalable factory, it is almost a given
that some relatively more limited kinds of replicating nanotech will
have to have been developed beforehand. For instance, computers based on
proteins, or on other polymers, or computers based on carbon buckytubes,
might well be common at the time we are imagining -- with this computer
tech (and all the chemistry that goes along with it) being the key to
breaking into the generally "tough and reliable" diamondoid stuff. Now,
if we've got all these great new materials to put into computers and
even into the mechanical structure of rockets and other things, then
maybe at that point we'll be getting into quite an large scale, human
oriented presence in space, *before* we have the "classic" or fully
capable nanoassembler factory. In short, we first have some very
effective bulk scale construction methods using materials that either
self assemble or replicate in a quite limited fashion. Using this, we
*may* have a number of interesting space initiatives already going or in
the works *before* we get to truly "hackable" "Drex-boxes".

The above "nano guesswork" may perhaps seem a little more concrete if I
suggest the possibility of an early, buckytube based, computer chip
factory. Such an early nanofactory might only work if you can build up
the basic components of it on a carefully prepared flat surface, or on
"shelves" made of Teflon, or something like that. Now, in this imagined
phase of development, you can actually "grow" your nanofactory setup,
but only if you add more shelves, the shelves in turn may *not* be
directly manufacturable by your early nanofactory! Meanwhile the
nanofactory as such may be able to churn out some very dense memory
chips, and maybe it could even be scaled up to produce significant
amounts of high strength buckyfibre for construction use. In effect, can
we readily imagine a very useful kind of self replicating "early nano"
that would still be tied to bulk tech for making finished products? What
I am really trying to get at here is that it isn't even clear whether
one would need or want to take such an "early nano" technique to the
Moon. While you are building neat computers and such down here on Earth,
maybe all that you want to take to the Moon with you is some sort of
bulk scale hydrolysis plant for making fuel out of the water that we
know is there!

This idea of getting a lunar outpost together quickly is an interesting
one, however, it isn't clear to me that prototyping all new hardware,
following a programmable factory breakthrough, is necessarily the way to
go? Hackable factories are a very cool idea, however, besides the above
mentioned complications, there is *another* point that bugs me about
this! As I understand things, the best, most capable,
soon-to-be-invented nanotech is most likely to be made of *carbon* in
one form or another, right? Unfortunately, our own Moon seems to have no
carbon content worth mining, so it's sort of a bust for an on the spot
diamondoid factory anyway. Good location, but it doesn't have the right
material for the best of early nanotech! So maybe your early lunar
getaway shouldn't be nanotech so much, or maybe you should go straight
to Mars and its moons, for the carbon?

How few?  Three people- a brilliant mechanical engineer (Dan Delong), a
good all-around systems guy with a mind like a packrat (me), a great
engineering manager/engineer (Jeff Greason), and a bunch of design software
(petaflops and then some).

How fast?  Mighty damn quick.  Having incredible materials available would
help a lot- just today I was talking with Dan on how much I'd like to have
diamondiod materials for rocket engines- great strength combined with the
highest thermal conductivity, far better than copper.

Valves, pumps and actuators are idiosyncratic things, bulky and heavy
compared to the pipes they join (valves on a small rocket engine often
weigh far more than the combustor itself).  With nanotech, the pipes would
*be* the valves and pumps- no actuators.  Control systems would not have
noticable mass, those peristaltic pipes would have embedded supercomputers.

I'd choose a light hydrocarbon for fuel, probably propane at the same
temperature as the LOX, it's almost as dense as kerosene, but has good
Isp.  The tanks would be diamond composite, and as Drexler mentioned to me
years ago, as the tanks empty, they disassemble themselves and are added to
the fuel stream.  This drives the non-payload mass delivered to orbit to
far less than the payload (of course, since anything no longer in use can
be taken apart and reused, everything can be considered payload).

The combustion chamber throat shrinks as the vehicle gets lighter, reducing
thrust to limit acceleration.  The bell gets larger and larger to maintain
ideal expansion until the nozzle extension is less than paper thin (the
stress on that part is tensile in the hoop direction and compressive
axially).

With improvements to CAD software visible on the horizon, and a complete
web source of all engineering data (Quick, what is the enthalpy, heat
capacity, thermal conductivity, and density of oxygen at 157 Kelvin and
34.5 Mpa?) engine and vehicle design would be limited more by the
imagination of the engineers than by the resources available.

I've been thinking about this question off and on for years, and the
timeline keeps shrinking- the only hard limit I can see is the doubling
time of the assemblers and the power available for making fuel.  With a
little bit of design ahead, and a lot of really clever (but non-sentient
software), it should only take hours.

As for setting up a spacefaring civilization- the minimum is enough mass to
start bootstrapping more from extraterrestrial sources, a Library of
Everything (at most a ton or so), a few people, and a good head start.

Drexler wrote of starting a sellar economy by delivering "a hollow shell of
strong material several microns in radius and containing about a cubic
micron of cargo" to another solar system.  See

http://www.foresight.org/EOC/EOC_References.html#0115

A few tons and a few people would be more than enough, with hard nanotech.

Bottom line:  Give me the right tools and I could be out of here tomorrow.

How clever does the software have to be?  I mean, what exactly are you
envisioning it doing?  (I'm assuming that we're using design-ahead to
build nanocomputers that run Linux so that the software can be tested,
in miniature, on existing computers.)

What kind of "design-ahead"?  And how much do you need to know about the

build a hard-nano spaceship in a vat compare to building soft-nano grey
goo that reproduces in the wild?

How fast does that scale up?  Could you evacuate cities, or at least
provide the evacuation vehicles to do so?  Could you fire cities, or at
least buildings, directly into orbit?

Depends on how much you can leverage it from previous work.  The
actual construction of an alternate environment, could in theory
take relatively little time.  The construction of large scale
habitats is limited by energy, element abundances & designs.
If you have the necessary element abundances you can get lots
of power in a couple of weeks.  So then it comes down to designs.

The question of designs comes down to a question of how much mechanical
engineering (esp. of the nanoscale type) is "automated" by circa 2010.  
What you need is "matter" description languages, compilers and verification
tools.  These exist today for the electronics industry, but not for the
MEMS/nanotech industries.

If you had the tools, and you could piggy-back on top of the general
nanotech development on Earth, I think it could be fairly simple and
fast (certainly within the bounds of a few thousand dedicated people,
perhaps even a few hundred).  One key element you would probably want
is a "Sport Utility Vehicle" air-car.  Take your basic air-car design
and enhance it for space operations.  Probably means that you have
to add a big pod on the back for fuel tanks & a rocket engine.
This gets "humans" off the planet.

Then you want a nanotech-based "mass-driver" design for hurling
"matter-pods" of essential elements from places where they are to
places where you need them.  You probably want to make the pods
self-navigating.

I have my doubts about this Greg.  So you get to the moon quickly &
you have an assembler.  You still don't have much of the essential
elements on which your earliest nanochemistry is likely to be based.
Virtually no C, and precious little H & N.  You could take the Freitas
study on self-replicating factories and re-work it based on nanotech
on the moon, but as I recall that study required a lot of supplement
material from earth and that is probably something you would like
to avoid.

I'd argue, you want to jump directly from Earth to a NEAR asteroid,
preferably between the Earth & Venus.  If you could get a carbonaceous
chondrite, that would be great.  Hollow it out and build a city
out of it.  I think the lower gravity wins big for interplanetary
transport.  If you find an esteroid with some ice, great, otherwise
you want to find a nearby comet and send out a ship to haul back
a big chunk of it.  The alternative would be to target a comet,
but these seem fairly loosely assembled and come apart upon heating.

You could also target an orbiting station above Venus since you can
harvest the carbon from the atmosphere (other materials become more
difficult and probably require very messy surface trips).  I think
its important to go "inward" rather than "outward" since your
energy harvest per kg of material available is greater, so you can
construct things faster.

You need computers & nanocompiler software packages and probably
a fair amount of mechanical engineering skill.

Hmmm... your mass requirements are going to be reduced the most if
you breath air as far as you can, then use rockets for the last
boost.  Ideally, you launch your SUV-AC with your O2 tank empty and
fill it on the way up.

> This booster would ideally be [snip]

Why do you want "boosters"?  Ion propulsion is much more efficient
(if you don't care how long it takes to get there).  Mass Drivers
avoid the requirement of having to carry around a lot of "structured"
material that isn't of much use other than to speed you up & slow
you down.  I think you want to make as fast a break with gravity
wells as you can.  If it gets to the point where you have to
start hurling things at each other, the people sitting in the
gravity wells are at a distinct disadvantage (they pay a cost
hurling something at you, and you get some free "added energy"
when hurling something at them).

> <> Some kind of basic modular robotic spacecraft "bus" would have to be 
> developed.

I think all you need is minimal matter-containers with attitude
control.  It seems that you can get lots of energy "fast", so you
have a very different transport mechanism from what we normally
think of.  For example if you are putting things into gravity wells,
you design "minimal splatter" receiving docks, where a long thin
pod comes in and "crashes" into the dock.  You quickly close
the dock doors, have the heat exchangers harvest the kinetic energy
released and then send the nanobot material sorters out to collect
the material shipment.  The nice thing about "artillery" shipments
is that you only pay the costs on one end and you can recover most
of the energy expended on the other if you are really clever.
If we thought about it a little more, I suspect we could build
mass un-drivers that slow the pods down and harvest the kinetic energy
very cleanly.

Two things to keep in mind -- Its only "people" that you have to
keep assembled and have to accelerate and decellerate slowly.
Matter, you accelerate & decellerate quickly and it doesn't much
matter whether or not it remains assembled.  If you have the
infrastructure in place, reassembling it takes only a few hours.

No, throw up the mass and build it in space, no boosters required,
just matter pods.  You want to figure out how to ship the matter
from the place where it is most abundant that has the greatest
energy cost/kg delivered (depends on energy availability and
gravity well depth).  Of course if you want to build things very
fast you may make some sacrifices on this count.

<> (Maybe) a spacesuit.

Why not a "hab-suit" with very sophisticated exo-manipulation
capabilities?  You could live in it for weeks or months while
you constructed larger habs?  Enough solar power collection to
harvest a few hundred watts with complete nanotech recycling of
waste into water and food.  A self-contained space habitat.

If you have lots of design capability available you may be able
to do the SUV-AC transforming into Hab-Suit trick.

It seems you want a general purpose "fetch, carry & manipulate" robot
(with perhaps "dog" level intelligence).

If you are assuming diamondoid, you do not want to go to the moon.
The moon requires a nanochemistry for the assembly of nanostructures
out of Al, Fe, Ti, Si & O feedstock.  All you require for an
asteroid is probably some C & Si + trace element feedstock &
chemistry.  Given current trends I suspect these will be the
most well developed when you need them.

You also probably want more basic mechanical engineers and chemists
than aerospace engineers I suspect.  Most of what they do is figure
out how to construct things that are cheap and can survive in space.
(I'll probably get raked over the coals for that comment...)

However, when you can do "perfect" atomic assembly and are working
with diamondoid materials you have to shift things to a whole new
area.  You have to deal with radiation damage to nanotech materials
(not a skill common among aerospace engineers), you may need to
deal with heat radiation problems (pick up a few infrared telescope
designers), you *will* need to focus on energy harvesting so you
can pull a few people from solar cell development teams.

Well, I suspect if you have something like an air-car, you
could do a back-yard retrofit very quickly.  *You* could start
digging your mass driver hole in your back yard now by contacting
your local water or oil well company now (must be a few of those
down in Texas, eh Greg?).  The teams that have assembled previous
(non-military) mass drivers have only been grad-student groups.

The trick will be power & non-interference as you start launching
high velocity projectiles.  It might be better to buy a piece of
a mountain in a desert someplace.

The *real* question is what will "state-of-the-art" nano-CAD design
packages be like in 2010-2015?  We will have the computer power but
nobody is working on these right now (to my knowledge).  If you
are going to rely on two people (Josh and Ralph) to produce your
software & chemistry you are going to have a long wait.  My read
of the Nanotech conference is that they are the only people working
on these problems.

> How quickly could they start remote fabrication of an initial lunar

I'd always prefer to send the robots there first to do all the dirty
work, but that depends on being able to program them to do the job
reliably and handle "special case" situations.  I doubt our current
state of software engineering is up to that.  In 10 years, who knows?

If you have access to good software & the assembler, complex designs
are probably as simple as simple designs.  Launching is a separate
and interesting question.  Thats why a public-domain air-car to space
vehicle conversion design/kit seems to make sense.  If everyone can
have one, I see it as harder for a government to suppress it.

Regarding mass launchers, you might need stealth designs.  E.g.,
remotely piloted sub-components that can fly below radar level
to a specified location, harvest the power, construct a pod,
disassemble and move to another location.

However, it seems to me that if we are in an environment with
nanotech enabled "ubiquitous" surveillance, all of this might
well be impossible.

> This thought problem is thrown out with the intention of seeing just how 
> difficult the "I'm clearing out as fast as I can after the assembler 
> breakthrough" scenario really is.

In my mind, the big problem is whether or not you will have access
to the assembler...  If we know it is possible (i.e. Zyvex has one)
but there are no nanotech designs to build anything with it
(e.g. ubiquitous nanosurveillance devices), then there may be
an opportunity to put together underground groups that build their
own before governments try to regulate everything.  Of course you
are going to have to be clever about it because you can be pretty
sure if you bought an AFM in the last 2-3 years, the government agents
might well pay you a visit to see what you are doing with it.

The interesting thing about the U.S. and/or other countries is that I
suspect a lot of civil rights are going to get thrown out the window
in the name of national security once people *really* realize what is
possible.

A more interesting question in my mind, is whether the non-nanotech
space technology will exist circa 2010-2015 to get a group of
pioneers (backed by Swiss bankers) off the planet to allow the
development of nanotech unencumbered by government police states.

In this situation, many of the points made by Greg regarding a
re-hash of previous lunar development plans might be quite valid.

It goes without saying that if one is serious about these possible
problems that these are things that should not be discussed in
a public formum such as this.  Whether or not the encryption &
communications software exists today to take the discussion offline
and keep it secure for the next 5-10 years, *is* something I'd
like to hear comments on.

While the light bulbs haven't gone on yet for people who would
be interested in this discussion, you can rest assured that someday
they will.

I'm not sure whether you mean the software or horsepower.

The software we are pretty close to now.  We can do the quantum
simulations on small scales, we can do the molecular modeling
on larger scales, I've got a package from Algor that does the
finite state element analysis for stresses, etc (though not at
the molecular level), Autocad & similar packages handle the
macro scale stuff and I've seen prognostications by people
familiar with M.E. that more and more of this is going to
get fairly automated.  I have to believe that M.E. is developing
standard "libraries" just as the E.E.'s have done.  What *is*
needed is standard libraries at the atomic level!

As far as the horsepower goes, I'm pretty confident that individuals
will have that as well.  Things don't get difficult until after
2010 and by then we should have desktop workstations with 10-20 10+ GIP
processors.  So a 10 machine cluster gets you a couple of Teraflops.
I think Doug may be overestimating his processing requirements a bit.

The thing about most macroscale objects (rockets, cars, etc.) is that
they don't require nanoscale structure.  Relatively defect-free assembly
of materials you cannot currently assemble is what you really want.
Most current materials science focuses on how to make the grain
bondaries smaller and prevent crack migration.  Those problems
go away and the materials get much stronger when you have atomic
assembly.  Because you can consider blocks of perfect crystals in the
macro scale analysis, your computer simulation requirements have some
nice aggregation & simplification properties that let you test the design
without having to go to the atomic level that would require petaflops.

You have a very different situation from having to simulate a single
engine with trillions(^??) of atoms and a large amount of "fluid" to
simulating 1 engine of 10^6 fewer atoms that you are going to use
10^6 copies of.  Its interesting if you compare say American & Russian
rocket efforts.  The American's approach built a huge infrastructure to
manufacture a few large engines while the Russian infrastructure built
more on previous efforts by simply adding on more small boosters to get
the required thrust.  I think Boeing may be moving in that direction with
the Delta program as well.  (Others please correct if I've got any of this
wrong.)

Nanoengineering takes that much further because of the parallelism,
building many small things is much faster than building single large
things.  So we don't have to build a few "perfect" large things, we
only have to build millions or billions of small things with relatively
low failure rates.  Our rocket folks might want to comment on how
their designs and testing requirements get impacted when they have
redundancy factors of millions.

Most of the software already exists today.  There are some hurdles
that have to be gone over for things that don't come into play at
the macro-scale level that are important at the nano-scale level.
These scaling-law impacts are slowly being incorporated into MEMS
design packages.  The hurdle we need to go over is the merging
of the MEMS design packages with the molecular modeling packages.

There isn't much "cleverness" required except when (a) you crossover
between scales (there are currently maybe 3 of these in molecular
modeling) and in finding efficient ways to distribute large
calculations over distributed computing architectures.

>

You might have to know a fair amount.  It doesn't do you any good
to design in a silicon pressure sensor if you don't have any chemistry
to stick Si atoms there.  What you want to do is the macro-scale
designs using some assumptions of material scale & properties (equivalent
to electronic circuit design).  Then below that, the part libraries and
circuit layout tools take over (correspinding to the low level process
specific translations in semiconductor manufacturing) doing the grunt work.
This low level stuff is going to be very chemistry & assembler specific.

Single crystal Fe2O3 (hematite) doesn't have much worse material properties
than Al2O3 (saphire) which is slightly worse than diamondoid but the
assembly chemistries & feedstocks are all very different.

[BTW, sapphire interlaced with diamondoid heat conductors might be your
best rocket engine material because of the higher melting temp.]

> Suppose the drextech is soft instead of hard?
Doesn't work for space if it is water-based.  Soft for space-suits,
ballons or solar sails is fine (even good), but for most of the things
we want to do would require rigid structures.  I can think of some
ways using disulfide bonds to make proteins somewhat stronger I suspect
there are limits. Even of you go to pseudo-biocompatible crystalline
materials (e.g. sucrose or salt), I don't think you want to be building
space ships out of them.

> How does the complexity required to build a hard-nano spaceship in a
> vat compare to building soft-nano grey goo that reproduces in the wild?

Soft-nano assembly *will* be here much sooner, but the design issues are
probably much more complex.  There is engineering science about how to
design beams, valves, screws, etc.  Taking this down to the atomic level
is pretty straight forward.  I can assemble organic "disassemblers"
fairly easily (though expensively) now, but I don't know how to
give them robust defenses or easily provide them with capabilities that
I can't "rip-off" from nature.  The easy engineering of general purpose
bio-catalytic machinery to "effect" a grey-goo scenario is likely
to require more computer horsepower than Doug's rocket engine
simulations because I *do* have to go to atomic scale.

I could design a diamondoid slicing & dicing apparatus *much* easier
[there is some discussion of this in NM] than I could design enzymes
to disolve humans (much less concrete).  Our M.E. skills are way above
our B.E. skills at this point.

Mind you, the design an enhanced flesh-eating streptococcus (if all you
wanted to do was disolve people), seems straight forward, but I suspect
that our ability to block multiple pathways in bacteria will be taking a
leap forward over the next 5 years as big Pharma rolls out a whole suite
of antibiotics (enabled by the genome disassembly of most pathogens).
Given the developing defense prospects and the difficulty of engineering
new pathways that avoid the new antibiotics is difficult, I'm optimistic
that bio-defense will trump bio-offence for the next 10-15 years.

It is worth commenting that I'm not sure that the "Grey Goo" scenario
has had a serious examination by people qualified to judge its development
timeline and/or possible defenses.  Given the difficulty of engineering
concrete disolving enzymes and the fact that even diamondoid slicers &
dicers "wear", and the fact that whether there are enzymes or diamond cutters,
for extended operation, they do require energy supplies that can be cut off,
I wonder whether the "Grey Goo" nightmare is *really* that significant.
It might be feasible, only for say an alien civilization to drop on
a civilization totally unprepared to defend itself against such an
attack, but might not ever work in an environment where you can see
it coming and take precautions.

This is a no-op, given growing arrays of nano-solar cells.  Plenty
of electricty to split H2O.

Fusion is a very long shot.  We don't have working fusion reactors
now so fusion is very unlikely.  You may also be paying a nasty
weight penalty for the reactor and/or shielding.  I think the most
efficient (low radiation?) reactions also require 3He out of the
lunar topsoil or Jupiter's atmosphere.

Its limited by your power scale-up which probably is design limited.

If you give everyone SUV-AirCars evacuation isn't a problem.

Difficult, these probably aren't engineered for the G forces
and certainly have steering problems.  If you wanted to lift
a city up from the bedrock (on rockets), you could do so, but the
power requirements would probably have to include large solar power
satellites.  I suspect a better way to go would be hydraulic
lifting of the cities on diamondoid towers since the power
delivery can take place over a much longer period of time.

    well, i guess that means i should back off my russian nuke sub obtainment 
plans, and lay off my attempts to stockpile the necessary vodka, kailua, and 
(powdered) milk... ;)
    so would someone please comment (or point me to a relevant archive ref) 
on the relative difficulties of moravic-style uploading versus the creation 
of gray goo? was the recent lobster neuron replacement really much of a 
milestone, as in, how far ahead of or behind 'schedule' was it? how are 
things shaping up on this front? and how does the fact that soft nanotech 
research is improving far faster then hard nanotech research enter into this?
    eliezer and cohorts [just in case you have any, eris forbid ;) ], im sure 
you can see where im heading with this...

Always funny to see what outsiders (in this case a bunch of students
from the University of Texas at Austin) think of transhumanism...
Perhaps the Textropians should kick their ass ;-)
http://ccwf.cc.utexas.edu/~ifrj383/index.htm

Quote:

"Our culture must not allow the evolution of humans into a new species
by transhumanistic activists seeking the improvement of the human
condition. If we do, the human condition will only suffer. The
Socioeconomic Impact of transhumanism will be substancial. The high cost
of the technologies allow only a privaleged few to take advantage of it,
which will create a social divide between an elite and an
underprivaleged class and do dangerous damage to human solidarity".

Etc.

I'm afraid that you'd need more than just a few people if
you want to setup a civilization. While the tech side of
the story might be done by just a few, I guess you'd need
at least a few hundred people to start a self sustainable
space village.

"Mighty damn quick" isn't very precise.  And how fast you could develop
the tools is part of the question.  So.. a month, a year, ten years, or what?

There are two issues here:
-- short term vs. long term best uses of resources
-- instrumental vs. other uses of resources

Each competitive environment determines a competitive discount rate, and
those who discount the future either more or less than this rate are at
a competitive disadvantage.  Each competitive environment also determines
the competitive values of various uses of resources, and those who use
resources differently are also at a competitive disadvantage.

Humans today evolved to prefer certain uses over others, and to discount
the future at a certain rate.  To the extent that those preferences are
no longer competitive, humans are slowly being selected toward other
preferences.  Human cultures and organizations can adapt more quickly,
and so are likely better adapted to current competitive pressures.
(I expect posthumans to adapt much more quickly.)

There is quite a bit of slashing and burning, mono-cropping, and strip
mining going on, and a lot of this probably makes competitive sense.
And there are also lots of places where this isn't happening, and a lot
of that probably also makes competitive sense.

On the other hand, there *is* probably a lot of "sentimental" declining
to use resources that puts people and groups at a competitive disadvantage.
And there is probably a lot of overly-aggressive use of resources, which
also puts those people and groups at a competitive disadvantage.  I see
little reason to think the overall trend is one way or the other.

Two thousand years from now competitive forces will have had plenty of
time to remake our solar system.  If civilization lasts that long, I
expect to see very little potentially useful matter that has not become
"useful artifacts," at least among the matter that has been accessible
for a thousand years (i.e., perhaps excluding the interiors of planets
and the sun).  So I expect to see very little in the way of "parks"
that are not also very useful in other ways.  And if energy is valuable,
I expect to see very little sunlight left undisturbed to stream off
into the cosmos.

Since two thousand years is a very short time on the cosmic scale, the
puzzle remains: why do we see so many seemingly untouched stars and so
much unused resources?  The galaxy *is* a big donut, after all. :-)

Now, now, now, lets not get *too* excited by the rantings
of a sophmore in college.   I've backtracked the page and
sent a message to the individual/group, I believe to be
the author(s).  I have pointed out that what they imply
(in terms of costs of transhumanist technologies) is unlikely
to be true -- *if* governments support the development of
such technologies for their populations.  If their predictions
or concerns prevent that, then they may come true, not that
it will make any difference.

Whenever you deal with claims like this, you should simply
ask the question:
  "Why should any "genetic enhancement" technology be any
  more expensive than a vaccine?  [Or even worse "catching"
  a cold?!?]

Since vaccines are moderately inexpensive (and colds even
cheaper), you have a very difficult position to justify
if you claim everyone cannot have them.

Unless exclusive patent positions protect all the avenues
of a specific enhancement it is unlikely to be "expensive".
Even if those patents exist, it becomes public domain in
a couple of decades (which in terms of lifespans of millennia
is nothing).

When someone spouts unsubstantiated rhetoric, treat it as
such.  Do your research and respond accordingly.  There is
no need to kill them now, when we can torture them for 20
years until the patent laws expire and we can administer
the generic transhumanist treatments... :-)

Getting off the planet isn't the problem.  I agree with Doug that
a dedicated group of engineers could do that quickly--perhaps in a
few weeks.  The problem is how to survive off-planet when we get
there.  Biosphere notwithstanding, we have insufficient knowledge
of what is necessary to sustain human life.  We know there are
hundreds of species of bacteria living symbioticly on us, but we
haven't even named them all yet.  We've had astronauts in orbit
for a few months with minimal resupply, and they have few health
problems other than some musculo-skeletal degeneration, but nobody
knows if humans would be fertile in those circumstances or what
pieces of Earth biosphere are needed to eliminate the resupply.
Rebuilding a viable population wouldn't take more than a few tons
of humans--a dozen young, healthy, diverse fertile women and a
dewar full of sperm--but any small lack of foresight or setback
that prevented them from bearing healthy fertile children would
doom the colony, and we'd need about 16 years before we'd know.

It would be nice to have something close to a "design team in a box", with
complete materials properties, stress analysis, CFD flow modeling, detail
design, and manufacturability analysis all in one integrated package.  "I
want a throttling valve for 500 kg/s liquid oxygen at 20 MPa, 10% to 100%
flow and cutoff, to fit in this volume and require minimum mass,
reliability of six nines, fail closed (or open), and don't forget materials
compatibility so that it won't self-ignite."  The engineer then chooses
from an array of options presented by the software, and fifteen minutes
later, after the CDR, the complete part spec is downloaded to the
manufactory.  Part is in hand an hour later, assembled into the vehicle an
hour after that.

In that case, you roll back the materials to bulk compositions available
today, such as zero-CTE dispersion hardened copper instead of diamond
(sigh).  Then you have soft nano robot machinists operating conventional
machine tools for most of the fabrication.  If effective micro-scale hard
manipulators can be built cheap, these can be sacrificed by the million for
tasks such as propellant tank welding (in the extreme, a 100 micron crawler
is mostly a thermite charge for doing a spot weld.  It crawls into place
and goes phhht on command.  Kinda like dinner in the Restaurant at the End
of the Universe.)

I was limiting myself to known physics and chemistry, not considering
things like Bussard's electrostatic confinement fusion.  Certainly if the
economic resources are available to the conspirators, er, planners, then
thousands of tons of propane and LOX could be stored well in advance.  If
soft nano can build decent solar arrays, and the doubling time is short,
then a few square miles of desert land (or a bloom at sea) could provide
gigawatts of power to synthesize kilotons/day of propellants.  Fuel could
be made most quickly by fermenting biomass, and LOX is a nickel a kilo even
these days, mined from the air.  One gigawatt could produce 100 kg/s of
propane/LOX from CO2 and H2O via electrolysis and the water shift reaction;
using air and biomass would get that up to 1000 kg/s easily. That would be
40,000 tons of propellant in under 12 hours, enough to put about 500 tons
into orbit or 100 tons onto the moon with low performance rocket designs.

Here you mostly run into the rocket equation and power demands, which then
have economic and political impacts.  Sure you can put 500 tons into orbit
in one lump, but the beast is 40,000 tons at launch, burns 270 tons/second
of propellants, and the jet power is over a terawatt.  The noise at 100 km
range is 120 dB- folks will *object* to this.  Not to mention the 1000 ton
empty first stage that falls out of the sky at the speed of sound 200 km
downrange.  Hard to evacuate LA that way.

With cheap labor, cheap engineering design, and cheap raw materials (mostly
scrapyard steel and seabottom ooze), big rockets could be built quickly and
cheaply.  Details would depend on the exact capabilities of the soft nano,
but with soft nano doubling like bacteria, a day would be enough time for
the manufacturing.  I'd want to launch a few and analyze the results before
riding one myself, call it a week for the sluggish humans to catch up with
the machinery.

Perhaps I should have said "economy" instead of "civilization".  And most
of those people shouldn't be engineers, since even in the best of times we
aren't very cultural anyway :)

The problem, as usual, is more on the social side than the technical.

This is funny: transhumanism is bad because it may "...put a
damper on after-life beliefs and cause conflicts with many
religious people that want to experience their life after
death."

ROTFL,
Frank

P.S.: I think we have to counter such views by spreading the
idea of self-ownership which includes the freedom to end
one's own life when one wishes to do so. We won't force
anybody into immortality... :)

(Concerning the anti-transhuman website)

I don't know which is more irritating.  Their half-baked, sophomoric ideas or those spinning GIFS.  Pardon me, I'm still dizzy from cruising their page.
  
It's interesting that some of their links go to Ander's pages.  By sending traffic to Anders they could be helping the cause of transhumanism as much or more than their feeble criticism may damage it.

I used to live in Austin, Texas and I wonder what made them select this target and not something else like illegal immigrants or satanism?

Someone from the WTA might want to e-mail the lecturer
involved and see if the following paragraph can be removed
or changed:

"...transhumanists advocate the creation of a new "master
race" very similar to Nazism and are forming alliances such
as the World Transhumanist Association to support more
research in technologies that will help integrate machines
with humans and produce a perfect cyborg being, which may
destroy key elements of humanity."

As long as we are fantasizing about this, let's define the rules properly.
You said:
>(i.e. the ability to make diamonoid structures of arbitrary size and 
>complexity and thence the ability to extract basic elementary chemicals 
>pretty easily),
and,
>Given state-of-the art CAD circa, say, 2015

And I'd add that said CAD was written and tested ahead of time for use with
your general purpose assembler.  And that you can obtain the use of same without
government/military/Luddite mob oversight.  And you have a launch site far from
control by any hostile government (for example, far from the U.S. government).

And, assuming that pre-general-purpose-assembler nanotech does not make your question
a moot point,

My answer is: one person.  Not very long to get to orbit, months, but a long time to
self-sufficiency.  More people, much less time, to a point.  I think a networked
bunch of space enthusiasts like us could do a very respectable job in a few years,
given fatal motivation.  You are asking for complete independence from earth?  Much harder
than partial independence.

Maybe a good question would be: what would be the optimum number of people for the
project?  I think about 200, and they all get to go up as soon as possible.  A genetically, socially stable village.

Goals in order might be:

-Transport to earth orbit
-low orbit space station, initially a few folks (and an assembler: station grows
  and morphs)
-Transport up an enormous mass of raw material and propellants, far more than
  immediately needed, then: material independence from earth.
-Trans lunar transport and lunar landing
-Lunar mining (and another outpost, more people)
-Efficient launch of mass from lunar surface (mechanical, forget that silly
  mass driver idea)
-Completely closed cycle life support, with only propellants and carbon supplied
  from stores
-Large space colony(s), send up a whole lot of us like-minded folk
-Asteroid and Mars mining and colonization, sustainable independence from earth

It's a lot to contemplate, and it won't come easily.  As has been mentioned in other
replies so far, pre-design would help a lot, but I guess that wouldn't start in earnest until the assembler appears immanent.  And there is always a lot to learn about reality.

On the other hand, if the goal is to get-the-hell-out-of-here ASAP without being
detected, I imagine:

A secret development project among a handful of fanatics begins, to design and
simulate the whole shebang before launching anything.  Some time passes.  Then, with
no warning, from the depths of the ocean rises a 100,000,000KG launch vehicle
carrying 200 colonists and a whole lot of raw material.  A luck has it, only one
ocean going ship is destroyed by the sound footprint (10 KM from the launch site in
mid-ocean).  2,000,000KG makes it to earth escape velocity on a Hohman transfer orbit
to mars or the asteroids.  The Earth's military goes on high alert and prepair to
launch until they realize the ship isn't coming back.  On the way there, the
colonists figure out how to survive.

Probably the fact that their course is entitled "English 309: The

I'm pretty sure this page is a joke.  Check out this brilliant economic
observation from the "Socioeconomic Impact of Transhumanism":

          "Some might say that as these technologies are explored more
fully, the cost would decrease.  While economics typically supports
this, the fact that transhumanism relies on theoretical technologies and
their continuing refinement makes this untrue.  Continual refinement
costs a great deal of money, and the fact that the technology does not
yet exist doesn't lower the cost."

Wow, that's a doozy.

...although now I've I just read a post by Bryan Moss pointing to the 
university class this assignment was created for -- a 300-level course,
no less.  On the bright side, it sounds like a fun course!  I wish we
had courses like that.

Just point out how bad the essay is from spelling to
economics to logic, and invite the lecturer to learn more
about real tanshumanists from the source available (which
you will be so kind as to point out).

The worst thing you can do is take this kid seriously; he
doesn't deserve it.

So, a lynch mob by the textropians (they still do those types of things
down there I guess, don't they...) is probably not in order.  I even
invited the responsible party to make it to the next Extro conference.

NASA is beginning to work on gene expression studies.  I'm fairly
confident that within a few years we will be able to pick out the
"gravity activated" regulatory factors and be working on ways to
manipulate them via drugs or GenEng.

Lee my good fellow, why on Earth would you want to continue
propagating the alphabet soup that constitutes our genome?
Are you a closet luddite sent to spy on us?

Seriously, if we can take the human genome apart in less than
a generation, I don't see why we can't engineer a better one
in the same time (given the march of the underlying technologies).
[The point to this is highly questionable however, given the possibility
of nanotech and uploads, but we'll assume we want some fallback
position in case a luddite virus wipes out the uploads.]

Even if we map every effect of every allele of every gene in the
human population, the fact is that those genes don't do anything
except _in the context of the environment in which they evolved_,
and we don't know nearly enough about what that environment must
contain for the process to be sustaining.  What if there happens
to be some bacterium in the uterus that plays a vital role in fetal
development, but that can't survive in low gravity?  Unlikely I'm
sure, but there are thousands of other little bits of Earth that
won't be taken with us, and while terrestrial life is robust, I
don't want to bet the farm on it.

Reproduction the old-fashioned way may be an old, inefficient and
haphazard technology; but it is a _proven_ technology.  And some
of us still enjoy it.

Amazing.  If it is an actual course, they need to spend at least one or two live email sessions with Max More where they could query him in real time.  Or Perhaps a video conference would be be better.  And/Or the students could correspond with ExI list members as part of their course content.  It would be a great way to get a few new members!

Thank you, Robert, for exposing these young intellects for the monsters
that they are! :-)  

That was my impression on reading it - college kids just trying to make
a grade.  In english and rhetoric courses like this one, writing an
earnest-sounding polemical attack is the easiest way to get your 3
credits.

I'm startled to see you make this claim. I agree with Eric Drexler
that keeping these discussions out of the public eye is far the
more dangerous course of action. As I write, I'm quite sure that
there are several research projects in foundational nanotechnology
being carried on in secret by the governments you are trying to
hide from.  Keeping our research secret from the public (and thereby,
unknown to other groups who might help us) is the best way to ensure
that the military labs will be able to maintain their lead over
labs that publish.

As for the problem of CAD tools for nanotechnology, I think we
need a survey of existing molecular-modeling software, and a
requirements document (or more simply, a delta) focusing on the
differences between the requirements of a designer working on
mechanical-phase nanotechnological designs and the requirements
of a designer working in solution-phase on the development of
new drugs, proteins, etc. The bulk of existing
molecular-modeling packages are targetted to the requirements of
the latter sort of designer. The key step in progressing to the
next generation of molecular CAD software is clearly stating the
requirements delta, and then designing and programming software
toward that delta.

So we need a paper, preferably several papers, stating the
requirements (in the software engineering sense) for
molecular-nanotechnology CAD, and stating how they differ from
the requirements to which the current crop of molecular modeling
packages have been programmed.

I think Lee Daniel Crocker is quite right in pointing out that we have few
clues how to maintain a biosphere capable of supporting a human society
indefinitely offplanet. More fullscale biosphere closure experiments are
needed, and *much* more information is needed about species (bacterial and
otherwise) symbiotic with human beings, and our ability to get along without
them in the Long Run.  Symbiosis includes not only endosymbiosis, but for
example the "air-scrubbing" soil bacteria that were used in Biosphere 2.

If they can't spell, I'm not worried about them.  Let's just let them go

ALCOR FOUNDATION CRYOFEAST '99, December 18, 1999

The annual CryoFeast will be held in Los Angeles, Silicon Valley and other
locations (to be announced.)  If you are an Alcor member and would like to
co-host a CryoFeast in your location, we welcome your participation!
Texas?  Boston?  Sweden? England? 

CryoFeast Co-Host Locations:
	
Southern Calif. -- contact: natasha@natasha.cc,  310 306-3129
Northern Calif -- contact:  judy@muhlestein.com, 408-782-2942 or Carl Shaw
at carol@carol.com (Party starts at 4:00 p.m. at Judy and Mark
Muhlestein's home.)


**LA CryoFeast '99:	Saturday, December 18, 1999**

6:00 - until Party!  Eat, drink and be merry Pot Luck dinner.  Bring your
favorite delicious dishes. And, for those of you who would rather expand
your brain than your belly, we have books from some of our favorite authors.

While others may be a little behind the times in giving thanks for the
harvest; we cryonicsts are giving thanks for the technologies that may help
us to live healthfully and indefinitely.  

The annual CryoFeast is an Alcor Foundation tradition bringing together
Alcor members and other life extension enthusiasts to celebrate our
continued efforts and accomplishments in cryonics and life extension.  As a
CryoFeast, guests are asked to contribute to the Pot Luck dinner as well as
any talents for making the party a fun-loving event.  

For many years the CryoFeast was held at Dr. Timothy Leary's home in
Beverly Hills.  The past two years, we gave the theme a spin and decided
that having co-hosted CryoFeasts in varied locations would enable people to
get together all over the World.  There have been a number of artistic
events occuring in and around the CryoFeasats.  The Boston location
co-hosted by Tony Reno and Roderick Carder-Russell has been creative in
designing their own style of party, and Silicon Valley's parties at Niki
Freeman's home and also co-hosts Dave Krieger and Geoff Dale, among others.
In 1997, we had six different CryoFeast locations around the World. 

This year, as tradition, I will present an Internet.art Virtual Operning
Reception: "The Aesthetics of Memetic Evolution 3"  Internet.art which will
be up at www.extropic-art.com/aesthetics3.htm on **Friday, December 17,
1999.** 

For more information about the Annual Co-Hosted CryoFeasts 1999: contact me
at natasha@natasha.cc or 310-306-3129.  For moreinformation about Alcor
Foundation and cryonics,  please visit Alcor's Web

ArtSci99 is being SPONSORED BY 12 Point Rule, Ltd., LEONARDO JOURNAL (MIT),
ARTBYTE Magazine, and PROXIMA /Theatrical Supplies & Services, and is a
co-production of Art & Science Collaborations, Inc.(ASCI) 718 816-9796 and
the Extended Studies Program of The Cooper Union for the Advancement of
Science and Art. 212 353-4195 

(If anyone would like to meet me in Manhattan for this Conference, I will
be facilitating the Breakout Session #2 after Panel #2:  "Techno-artists,
humanistic scientists, and artists-engineers abound. Pre-millennial
bandwagon or true Renaissance? This panel will seek to examine what is
different about today from any other period (e.g. 1960s) of strong,
art-science relationships and define some of the factors behind this most
recent convergence.")

For Information on the Conference:

http://www.asci.org/artsci99/index.html

ArtSci99 is a two-day symposium devoted to examining the history and nature
of exemplary art & industry programs, "Modern-Day Leonardos," and the new
artist-scientist teams that presage the future of art-sci collaborations.
The biggest challenge lies in reaching-out to the various scientific
communities and gaining their support and involvement. But what type of
scientist or artist wants to collaborate? And why? 

Scientists at the top of their fields have achieved success by
understanding creativity as central to problem-solving. This means engaging
in a process that is fluid and flexible. These scientists are most likely
to be the ones who value collaborating with artists on projects that
require both of their unique and various perspectives. Today, we find more
and more artists inspired by and interpreting the impact of developments in
the wide and quite diverse fields of applied and theoretical science,
medicine, psychology, mechanics and technology. As well, many scientists
are looking for ways to interpret their work visually and aurally and to
provide a more humanistic rendering of discoveries in their field. 
The event format for ArtSci99 will include: keynotes, presentations by
artist-scientist teams, panel discussions on topics dear to the heart and
work of both artists and scientists, topical break-out sessions for more
personal interaction, social activities, and pre-event online discussions.
This program has been devised to achieve specific objectives: *dispel
misconceptions, *move beyond polar stereotypes, *inform and inspire re:
historical and current collaborations, *illuminate the strong commonalties
between art and science, *increase mutual understanding and respect through
communication, and *perpetuate a nurturing environment for collaborations. 

Our artist and scientist panelists will tackle a variety of questions in
relation to the nature of collaboration on the following topics: Reports
from the Front: What was the nature of past art-sci collaborations?;
Art-Sci at the Millennium: Why Now?; Scientific Theories Defining
Creativity and its Effect on Collaboration; and Bio-Ethics: The Response by
Art and Science. 
ArtSci99 will be important not only to artists and scientists but to
educators, researchers, writers, representatives from the technology
industry and city/government agencies, funding sources, and anyone who is
captivated by the intersection of art and science and interested in the
implications of its future direction. 

For 11 years, ASCI (Art & Science Collaborations, Inc.), a NYC-based
non-profit organization, has produced member services and public events
that highlight and nurture the intersection of art and science. Visit
http://www.asci.org for history & projects. ArtSci98 -- brought together
top research scientists, artists, writers, and theorists from fields as
varied as astronomy, chemistry, marine biology, computer animation,
invention, science fiction, mathematics, digital special effects, visual
art and music. This distinguished group presented the concepts of their
most current work in relation to the nature of creativity. (Archived program)

Yes, but the premise of the discussion, here, is that the Earth is becoming
immanently uninhabitable (post assembler) in who knows how many ways, else why
leave in such a rush?  So: given not much choice, would you bet that we can't
figure it out?  With Advanced nanotech to pry into the minuscule eco-details and
also to manipulate them?

Looks like we could send independent redundant colony seeds.

Isnt that just like an aerospace engineer to suggest that approach? {8^D

This is old ground, but I will ask again: what is the advantage of
a dewar of sperm over a dewar of embryos?  Remember, that
first generation of children will likely be required to mate with
*each other* therefore it is desireable to have them genetically
unrelated.  And, one woman could carry tens of thousands of
them.  I admit it is a high risk approach, but consider greatly
parallel redundancy, and at least one should take hold.

I got in trouble for suggesting this last time around, about 8
months ago, but looks to me like the potential mothers of
a new race could have their birth canals surgically enlarged
before they go, in order to give them a better chance at
delivering their own babies alone and surviving the ordeal.
Have we any doctors on the list?  Suggestions?  Human
babies have huge heads, compared to the young of other
species, do we not?

Next, consider using left over military missiles.  I was on
a study back in 1994 in which we were studying what we
could use the solid rockets for, that were obviated by
the signing of an arms limitation agreement with the commies.

If we removed all the nukes and support equipment, could
we use those things to give a rich people joy rides in LEO?
Answer:  almost.  If the person were not large, and we
dispensed with *all* the luxuries, and we could settle for
a really low orbit, then yes a cheap former-nuke-carrying
solid rocket could be adapted, however this still doesnt
help us in GB's scenario.  We would need something
Saturn V-ish, and that would cost buttloads of money.

Of course, Im still not getting at GB's question, since
 I was assuming the old fashioned approach and he was
assuming nanotech, about which I know too little to
speculate.  But this much I will stay with: the first colonies
will need small crews, both in stature and numbers.  Maybe one,
Probably two women on each launcher.  This minimal crew
notion will likely hold, even with nanotech.  spike

THE GUARDIAN
THE OBSERVER

Einstein's E=mc^2 'was Italian's idea' 

Rory Carroll in Rome 
Thursday November 11, 1999 

The mathematical equation that
ushered in the atomic age was
discovered by an unknown Italian
dilettante two years before Albert
Einstein used it in developing the
theory of relativity, it was claimed
yesterday. 

Olinto De Pretto, an industrialist
from Vicenza, published the
equation E=mc^2 in a scientific
magazine, Atte, in 1903, said
Umberto Bartocci, a mathematical
historian. 

Einstein allegedly used De Pretto's
insight in a major paper published
in 1905, but De Pretto was never
acclaimed, said Professor Bartocci
of the University of Perugia. 

De Pretto had stumbled on the
equation, but not the theory of
relativity, while speculating about
ether in the life of the universe, said
Prof Bartocci. It was republished in
1904 by Veneto's Royal Science
Institute, but the equation's
significance was not understood. 

A Swiss Italian named Michele
Besso alerted Einstein to the
research and in 1905 Einstein
published his own work, said Prof
Bartocci. It took years for his
breakthrough to be grasped. When
the penny finally dropped, De
Pretto's contribution was
overlooked while Einstein went on
to become the century's most
famous scientist. De Pretto died in
1921. 

"De Pretto did not discover
relativity but there is no doubt that
he was the first to use the equation.
That is hugely significant. I also
believe, though it's impossible to
prove, that Einstein used De
Pretto's research," said Prof
Bartocci, who has written a book
on the subject. 

Einstein's theory held that time and
motion are relative to the observer
if the speed of light is constant and
if all natural laws are the same. A
footnote established the
equivalence of mass and energy,
according to which the energy (E)
of a quantity of matter (m) is equal
to the product of the mass and the
square of the velocity of light (c).
Now known as: E=mc^2 . 

The influence of work by other
physicists on Einstein's theory is
also controversial. A German,
David Hilbert, is thought by some to
have been decisive. 

Edmund Robertson, professor of
mathematics at St Andrew's
University, said: "An awful lot of
mathematics was done by people
who have never been credited -
Arabs in the middle ages, for
example. Einstein may have got the
idea from someone else, but ideas
come from all sorts of places. 

"De Pretto deserves credit if his
contribution can be proven. Even
so, it should not detract from
Einstein."

As I know you know, the best source of info on conferences and other events 
relating to nanotech is Foresight's web site.  I've never come across an 
event in another source that wasn't also listed there.

Nature

Sterling, B. (1999). Homo sapiens declared extinct. Nature, 402, 125.

Yes, human beings have finally gone, but the 24-hour global party continues.
AD 2380: After a painstaking ten-year search, from the Tibetan highlands to 
the
Brazilian rainforests, it's official - there are no more human beings.
"I suppose I have to consider this a personal setback," said anthropologist Dr
Marcia Raymo, of the Institute for Retrograde Study in Berlin. "Of course we
still have human tissue in the lab, and we could clone as many specimens of
Homo sapiens as we like. But that species was always known primarily for its
unique cultural activity."...

This appears to be part of it.


I've only just started this book, but I can hardly put it down,
it's packed with usefull heuristics (venture capitalists expect a
tenfold return, 4-1 is a normal founder/worker equity ratio for a
startup, 10% of salaries for bonuses etc) and where the real money
and power are. (Hint: it's not Wall Street and the NYSE)

Not only all that, but it's a swell read....

I'd say must reading for Extropians investors and budding SI's.

Very refreshing, if I am interpreting it right.  The moral is that we should
not be so concerned that our descendants carry on our genetic code, but that
they carry on our culture.  Here we have a presumed posthuman acting in a
manner which we find understandable and familiar.  He cares about extinct
species just as we do.

Even in this forum we often succumb to a form of chauvinism, in which any
future which isn't dominated by humans is seen as a failure.  Particularly
with regard to predicted human vs machine wars, we automatically side
with the humans, without asking which group is more deserving morally.
We need to start thinking in broader terms and not identifying so closely
with our genetics and metabolism.

Hi, extropians!

I just thought that you as educators and scientists of the 21st century 
could be interested in my recently-opened and long-awaited 
explosively-controversial website:

http://www.conrado.net/free_science.html

into which I have put so much love, and so much effort to insure the 
accuracy of the facts. Also,

http://www.conrado.net/arthur_c_clarke.html

.. ..deals extensively with the very promising new energy technologies which 
are at last emerging in fuel cells and other electrochemical techniques, and 
which could indeed instantly regenerate our choked dying biosphere and put 
an end to the fossil fuel age.

.. ..

However, I think.. .. that.. .. . I think that it is about time we stopped 
being mesmerized by the robotic and hedonistic messages from ``The Matrix``, 
woke up, and realized that this is just NOT the technologically-enhanced but 
humanly-directed world that, for example, Clarke and Kubrick envisioned for 
2001. I think that we still have time, however, to make it by 2010 to where 
the film ``2010: Odyssey Two`` brightly and upliftingly assured us we could 
be; but for this to happen, we need to, in my view, stop looking at the 
beatifically-promised, lulling, ``peace-bringing`` New World Order as the 
solution, and realize that, despite what Clarke and the charming post-modern 
ecumenistic Russian fellow whose website handles Clarke books may think, the 
New World Order will NOT witness the ignition of Jupiter and the liberation 
of mankind from its blue oceanic cradle.

Indeed, both Navigators of our Future have, in my view, fallen for the Great 
Luciferian deception, and in their probable pride of being initiated into a 
Secret which is no more, they may have failed to realize that The New World 
Order is actually PART of Lucifer-Rising, and Lucifer wants to bring, not 
the peace and enlightenment it promises.. .. .., but the robotic and 
mechanized merging of any vestige of human individuality into an infernal 
collective Borg-Global-Brain.. .., and then The Black Sun for All Earth on 
December 21st 2012, The Zero Barrier. If you think that what happened to 
some of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago was catastrophic wait for what 
will happen if we now allow the New World Order to go through.

But, don't worry, Jupiter CAN be ignited, and the Star Child knows how.. .. 
The Reptilian shadow is not going to win. Get us out of the atmosphere now. 
12 years to critical mass.

My contact addresses are all on my website if anyone is further interested. 
I recently graduated in Physics from Cal Tech.

loVe,

Conrado.

They would not be our species, but predominately mechanized humans might be homo
mecha.  What are the next post-sapiens, and how are they described?

An artifical intelligence, with the capacity to be called life, would be a new
species, I guess its own phylum or whatnot.  I search to see Kingdom, Phylum, Class,
Order, Family, Genus, Species.

Philogeny or phylogeny is an interesting subject of which I know not so much.  Where
taxonomy is classification, philogeny is the study of evolution.

In those kinds of terms, the comparative advantages of a synthetic basis are
several, as well, of course, comparative disadvantages.  The first advantage that
comes to mind is computational speed, but that is certainly tempered by the utter
inadequacy of a conventional computer to emulate a brain.

It would not be surprising that some of the most advanced mecha would be organic.

You mention human chauvinism, in the very long term I think such attitudes are
beneficial for the species.  Our most ancient rituals are of birth, love, and death,
these are the seeds of art.  Xenophobia is not necessarily good, but it is not
necessarily bad, in some sense it is a preservatory imperative.  Xena is good.

I have not read the article, and find its premise amusing.

Even if/when people are technologically and spiritually capable to fully transcend
the flesh, I'm sure many would still choose to journey within it.  There would be a
large amount of time to do so.

I would add to this that I believe there is a real difference between homo

history through the development of post-humanity, I believe that it could 
happen in such a way as to preserve the positive aspects of humanity 
(unfortunately, I suspect some of the negative aspects may be inherited as

say that though Homo sapiens may have past, Humanity seems to be quite

Michael Moorcock story of The Eternal Champion, summoned to be the champion 
of mankind, but who discovers that it is his own race who are the monsters 
and must be purged from the Earth to save the much more civilized and humane 
Eldren.  Another case where blood isn't thicker than water.

    I got quite a laugh out of his reply.  It was completely irresponsible 
but I remember the mentality of those guys in College just trying to get a 
passing grade with the least amount of thinking possible.  Much easier to 
laugh at them now when they're not bringing you down with them.

We discussed the page in Aleph a few weeks back, and our general view
was that while the page was bad and incorrect, it touched on many
issues that we transhumanists easily get misunderstood on (are we
creating a master race?), or things that are not obvious to most
people (why is life extension likely to become relatively cheap?). So
the issues brought up should be carefully refuted. I have for a long
time been thinking of setting up a web page with links to anti-TH
texts together with refutations and explanations. Perhaps we should
even write a "Frequent Misunderstandings" text like an FAQ.

The article is readable on www.nature.com using free registration, but I
believe in the past some people have said this does not work for them.
Since the article is freely available by this means, I have taken the
liberty of copying it here, with apologies to Nature.  The author turns
out to be science fiction writer Bruce Sterling.

============================

Homo sapiens declared extinct
Yes, human beings have finally gone, but the 24-hour global party continues.
Bruce Sterling

A D 2380: After a painstaking ten-year search, from the Tibetan
highlands to the Brazilian rainforests, it's official - there are
no more human beings.

"I suppose I have to consider this a personal setback," said
anthropologist Dr Marcia Raymo, of the Institute for Retrograde Study in
Berlin. "Of course we still have human tissue in the lab, and we could
clone as many specimens of Homo sapiens as we like. But that species
was always known primarily for its unique cultural activity."

"I can't understand what the fuss is about," declared Rita "Cuddles"
Srinivasan, actress, sex symbol and computer peripheral. "Artificial
Intelligences love to embody themselves in human forms like mine, to
wallow in sex and eating. I'm good for oodles of human stuff, scratching,
sleeping, sneezing, you can name it. As long as AIs honour their origins,
you'll see plenty of disembodied intelligences slumming around in human
forms. That's where all the fun is, I promise - trust me."

The actress's current AI sponsor further remarked via wireless telepathy
that Miss Srinivasan's occasional extra arms or heads should be seen
as a sign of "creative brio", and not as a violation of "some obsolete,
supposedly standard human form".

A worldwide survey of skull contents in April 2379 revealed no living
citizen with less than 35 per cent cultured gelbrain. "That pretty well
kicks it in the head for me," declared statistician Piers Euler, the front
identity for a collaborative group-mind of mathematicians at the Bourbaki
Academy in Paris. "I don't see how you can declare any entity 'human'
when their brain is a gelatin lattice, and every cell of their body
contains extensive extra strands of industrial-strength DNA. Not only is
humanity extinct but, strictly speaking, pretty much everyone alive today
should be classified as a unique, post-natural, one-of-a-kind species."

"I was born human," admitted 380-year-old classical musician Soon
Yi, speaking from his support vat in Shanghai. "I grew up as a human
being. It seemed quite natural at the time. For hundreds of years on
the state-supported concert circuit, I promoted myself as a 'humanist',
supporting and promoting human high culture. But at this point, I should
be honest: that was always my stage pretence. Let's face it: gelbrain is
vastly better stuff than those grey, greasy, catch-as-catch-can human
neurons. You can't become a serious professional artiste while using
nothing but all-natural animal tissue in your head. It's just absurd!"

Gently fanning his wizened tissues with warm currents of support fluid,
the grand old man of music continued: "Wolfgang Mozart was a very dull
creature by our modern standards but, thanks to gelbrain, I can still
find ways to pump life into his primitive compositions. I also persist
in finding Bach worthwhile, even in today's ultracivilized milieu, where
individual consciousness and creative subjectivity tend to be rather rare,
or absent entirely."

Posthumanity's most scientifically advanced group, the pioneer Blood
Bathers in their vast crystalline castles in the Oort Cloud, could not
be reached for comment.

"Why trouble the highly prestigious Blood Bathers with some trifling
development here on distant Earth?" demanded President Arno Hopmeier
of the World Anti-subjectivist Council. "The Blood Bathers are busily
researching novel realms of complex organization far beyond mere
'intelligence'. We should feel extremely honoured that they still bother
to share their lab results with creatures like us. It would only annoy
Their Skinless Eminences if we ask them to fret over some defunct race
of featherless bipeds."

A Circumsolar Day of Mourning has been declared to commemorate the
official extinction of humanity, but it is widely believed that bursts
of wild public enthusiasm will mar the funereal proceedings.

"When you sum them up," mused Orbital Entity Ankh/Ghih/9819, "it's hard
to perceive any tragedy in this long-awaited event. Beasts, birds,
butterflies, even the very rocks and rivers must be rejoicing to see
humans finally gone. We should try to be adult about this: we should
take a deep breath, turn our face to the light of the future, and get
on with the business of living.

"Since I've been asked to offer an epitaph," the highly distributed
poetware continued, "I believe that we should rearrange the Great Wall of
China to spell out (in Chinese of course, since most of them were always
Chinese) - 'THEY WERE VERY, VERY CURIOUS, BUT NOT AT ALL FARSIGHTED. '

"This historical moment is a serious occasion that requires a sense of
public dignity. My dog, for instance, says he'll truly miss humanity. But
then again, my dog says a lot of things."

Neither group is inherently more deserving, IMHO. Morality is
subjective, after all. Morals are only "good" or "bad" in the context of
personal supergoals, which are essentially arbitrary. So humans (us!)
will be defending their interests, and the machines theirs, and they'll
*both* be right. Remember folks, the moment you die (permanently), the
universe might as well cease to exist. Nothing matters anymore. So let's
focus on staying alive.

I don't think we should wait around for advanced nanotech before
we start trying to understand our biosphere and how to replicate
it.  I'm puzzled and frustrated that so few biosphere closures
have been funded so far. If we take the defeatist attitude that
the Earth will be uninhabitable soon regardless of what actions
we take to try to prevent this outcome (which is not my
inclination), then we certainly ought to be trying to understand
the "proven technology", as Crocker puts it, that has sustained
us so far. We have zero experience in maintaining viable
societies over the long term in space, just as we have zero
experience in reanimation from cryostasis or mind uploading. It
would be foolish to destroy (or fail to study) our current life
support systems before their replacements have been developed
and *tested*. 

Also, in re Bradbury's objections to Crocker's biological
traditionalism, the human genome was not designed, and it was
certainly not designed with any goals of readability or maintainability
in mind. It is growing clearer that our genome is completely riddled
with every computer programmer's nightmare: multifunction code
passages. Tweak this neurotransmitter which has this benevolent
effect, and you will find that the tweak also causes two or three
malignant changes in function, as well as four or five neutral ones
and perhaps one other unexpected improvement. No matter how well
we understand gene expression and ontogeny, the multipurpose use
of most of the sophisticated molecules in our body will make tweaking
the design extremely difficult for human engineers.  Granted,
machine assistance may make the problems tractable, but I think
its too soon to make specific confident predictions about the
ultimate capabilities of human genetic engineering and how soon we
will be able to migrate ourselves out of the local optimum of human
function into some better, but posthuman, design.  If you think
the planet will become uninhabitable very soon, then we need to
start figuring out how to make primate societies and the biospheres
that support them viable in space. We may not be able to change
ourselves as fast as we would like.

I would tend to lump together group minds, human-level AIs,
human/computer hybrids, neurohacks, extra-neuron augments, and
genetically engineered geniuses as being "us".  Not really that much of
a difference.  The basic style of cognition is pretty much the same. 
And we'll all share the same fate when the Powers show up, whatever the
heck that hidden variable contains.

So far, den Otter would seem to be the only person with the
self-consistency to admit that not wanting AIs to transcend implies not
wanting *anyone* else to transcend.

Maybe 'The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark' by Carl Sagan 
fits into your query.  It is not primarily a 'textbook' about logic (although 
it contains elements of that); Rather, this book is an active attack on all 
kinds of mysticism and sloppy emotional/sentimental thinking, and exposes the 
illogicalities, but also the cruelty and dangers, in a large set of examples 
of non-rational acting and thinking.  I like this book.  I think this book 
will remove a lot of prejudices and sloppy thinking in someone who reads it 
who is already halfway 'converted' to rationalism.  

(Sagan, the 'white knight' slaying the memes of irrationality in his readers, 
and leading them to the 'light' :-) of rationality.)

Okay, that's an excellent critical reply.  I feel I should be able to explain
what these memetics people are so 'groovy' about.

(Sorry if the reply below is too long, too much brainstormed, and contains
some redundant repetitions.)

---

Conceding immediately that I am not a specialist in psychology or in any of 
the psychological cognitive sciences (I'm just a programmer with an interest 
in machine learning), I do think that memetics gives a clearer, that is, more 
objective/materialistic/reductionistic, view on many issues studied in 
psychology and the cognitive sciences, relying less on hard-to-define concepts 
like 'consciousness', 'feeling', 'emotions' etc. 

Memetics just observes that humans copy around among themselves, and sometimes 
mutate, bits of information (fashions, behaviour patterns, theories, etc.); 
arbitrarily calls a 'unit' of such copied-around information a 'meme'; and 
then observes that this copying-around and mutating process which memes are 
undergoing is just exactly the process of EVOLUTION.   That's all that's 
needed as basics in memetics.  I think these basics are very observable and 
hard to dispute. 


> How is 'memetics' a more powerful tool for
> understanding thoughts, ...

I think that thoughts *are* memes.  The set of things qualifying as 'thoughts' 
comprise e.g.: theories about how the world functions, moral ideas and beliefs 
about how a person should behave in certain circumstances, etc.  Anything 
capable of being expressed (verbally) as a 'thought' is capable of being 
copied around between humans as a 'meme'; therefore, thoughts equal memes.  
A human is a thought-processor, i.e., a meme-processor.  

The process by which the brain processes memes does not have to be 'conscious' 
at the bottom level; it can (probably is) hard-wired in at that level.  

Built on top of that level you can have 'conscious' thoughts, i.e. you can 
consciously process and reflect on memes.  I think that the kind of conscious 
meme-processing (reasoning) we rationalists do really is the execution of 
'semi-unconscious' reasoning hehaviour which we rationalists have 
(semi-unconsciosly) absorbed and copied from sources in our surroundings.  
(The meme for cold rational reasoning, the meme for suppressing base emotions, 
the meme for disrespect of sloppy emotionality, the meme for loving 
self-control and being in charge of yourself, the meme for believing in 
individuality and personal freedom, ...) 

How 'thinking' can 'feel' conscious can be explained, I think, by the 
observation that associations between 'feelings/emotions' and memes is 
probably also *learned*.  That is, when picking up a meme (say, the meme for 
honesty) you also pick up the things that associate the recipe for honesty 
that can be expressed in words ('you should be honest') with all kinds of 
emotions: e.g. associating being yourself not honest with the feeling of fear 
(of becoming punished or unmasked by others), of pride (of persisting in your 
honesty despite difficulties), or hope (of future rewards for your honesty), 
etc.  Maybe this is an aspect of what the brain does when processing memes: 
managing and storing these connections between memes expressed through 
language and the 'feelings' which are also 'used' instinctively.  Thus 
explaining how 'memes' could have a (learned) emotional aspect and how 
'thoughts' and the process of 'thinking' can feel conscous to the person who 
does the thinking. 

> ... emotions, ...

Emotions are, by definition, instinctive things which are genetically 
hard-wired into a human.  There is nothing emotional per se about memes; 
however, I think that memes are definitely associated by any human individual 
with a *lot* of emotions (see above).  So that's where in my opinion memetics 
does fit into the picture in the 'integration' of consciousness. 

> ... or consciousness,

'Consciousness' is a *very* hard-to-define concept.  What *is* 
'consciousness' ?  I think that maybe there are a lot of different concepts 
which have become sloppily aggregated under the common name of consciousness, 
and that the term 'consciousness' is rather unwieldy entanglement of concepts. 
Everyone seems to have his own definition of consciousness.  

Cognitive psychologists seem to view consciousness basically as a 'feeling' 
thing.  If you can feel a thing (like pain), then you are conscious of it, 
they say.  But that leaves open the question: what *is* ''feeling'' really ?  
Why does feeling gives a persion the idea that he is ''consciously'' feeling a 
thing ?  Memetics per se has little to do with this view of consciousness. 

If you see consciousness as a person's outook on life, as his world-view, then 
that means you say that consciousness equals the culture of a group of people. 
But culture equals the memes stored in that group of people.  

I think that there are many different kinds, ''tastes'', of consciousness.  A 
child of 3 years old, a rationalist of 40, a deeply religious orthodox 
believing in heaven and hell, all have (I think) a diffent 'consciousness': 
they not only 'think' differently, but they also have different emotions 
associated with the events occuring around them to which they respond -- that 
is, they also 'feel' differently. 

I have this suspicion that when you make a thing (machine) that exhibits
behaviour that is in any way 'intelligent', i.e. behaviour that seems to be 
aimed at actively enhancing the thing's survival, then that thing will 
automatically be 'conscious'.  Is a bacterium conscious when it has this 
behaviour of actively grabbing food particles it bumps into ?  Does the 
bacterium have any 'feelings' when it grabs the food particle ?  If you define 
'feeling' as "an instinctive and automatic bodily reaction, working probably 
chemically, triggered by events in its environment, inducing the organism to 
be disposed more to certain kinds of action and less to other kinds of 
action", then I think the only honest conclusion is that the bacterium DOES 
feel; and also, therefore, that it does have (a kind of) consciousness.  

I think consciousness comes automatically, inevitably, in any organism or 
machine that exhibits behaviour aimed at its own proliferation.  In a 'higher' 
organism (like humans), this automatically gets you the kind of complex 
'consciousness' that we humans 'feel' in ourselves.  I think any organism is 
automatically 'conscious' about anything in its environment that is of 
importance to its survival/proliferation and to which it is capable of 
reacting (either by hard-wiring and/or by programmed/learned behaviour). 

In a species that does many things with memes, like us humans, memes are a 
part of that individual's environment with which he interacts; therefore, how 
he interacts with memes determines a large part of his consciousness.  Note 
that behaviour patterns that are never or seldom expressed verbally (e.g. 
clothes fashions, the behaviour pattern of answering when someone asks you a 
question) are also copied around between humans, and therefore are also memes. 

I think the main way memetics can help in understanding 'thinking', 
'consciousness', etc. is to brush off a lot of traditional, emotional, 
irrational stuff in our thinking about these things.  Lower animals are just 
dumb machines reacting entirely intuitively to their environment; humans are 
the same machines, but equipped with an organ (the brain) which executes a 
dumb machine-like process which copies, stories, and sometimes (randomly) 
mutates memes and connects memes with lower machine-states (the intuitive 
'feelings').  Thinking and the generation of new ideas is just the 
evolutionary process with memes as replicators.  Evolutionary means 
mechanical, without inherent intelligence, and 'driven' by dumb 'random'.  
That's all.  Everything mechanical, and and the basic operation of it does not 
need the concepts of 'emotion' or 'consciousness'.  Instead, I think that 
exacly *because* it does not rely on the concepts of 'feeling', 
'consciousness' etc., this mechanical explanation of things can help *explain* 
what 'feeling' and 'consciousness' really are.  With this mechanical point of 
view, you kind of look at these things from the other side, from the outside 
(as any scientist should try to do), instead of from the inside as an organism 
that is itself trapped in its own 'feeling' and its own experience of its 
consciousness and using its own feelings of consciousness as basis of its 
reasoning.  

It is, I think, precisely this 'looking-from-the-outside' viewpoint that
makes these memeticists so 'groovy' about memetics.

We needn't worry ourselves with extinction any more than we should worry 
about
a simple bug in a program. Thanks to genetic engineering, we can bring back 
the
Dodo bird, some dinosuars maybe, stool pigeons, etc.(getting a tad ahead of 
myself). If this is what fundamentalist reactionary creationists are
fearing - "Frankinscience" - then, as far as I can tell, they aren't too 
keen on focusing
on environmental issues which warrant more attention than useless 
"science-bashing".

'Rocket Boy' predicts fast voyages to the planets 

                 By Joe Bauman
                 Deseret News staff writer

OGDEN  A new propulsion system using antimatter soon may open up the 
solar system to much swifter exploration, the original "rocket boy" of 
the movie "October Sky" says.
                       
"I think the next time we go (to the moon) we're going to go with a
whole new manner of propulsion," Homer Hickam said Tuesday, speaking 
before a rapt audience of hundreds of students and members of the public 
at Weber State University's Val A. Browning Center.
                       
"And these devices, which I call 'space drives,' are actually in the 
works today in Huntsville, Ala."

Researchers at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville are 
working on a system using antimatter, he said. Antimatter is an exotic 
form of matter that annihilates ordinary matter as soon as it
comes into contact with it, releasing tremendous amounts of energy.
                       
"October Sky" was the movie version of Hickam's best-selling autobiographical 
book, "Rocket Boys," about his struggle to obtain a higher education while 
growing up in a hardscrabble West Virginia coal town.

He and his high school partners won university scholarships when their 
extensive rocketry experiments led to first place in a national science 
fair. Hickam became a NASA engineer, and before his retirement last year 
he was payload training chief for the International Space Station.
                       
"Huntsville got its first delivery of antimatter about six months ago," 
he said. Researchers there are encouraged about the possibilities of using 
it to power a new type of space drive, he said.
                      
"We're talking about engines 1,000 to 10,000 times more powerful than the 
most powerful chemical rocket system that we've got today."

If the federal government properly funds the research, he added, "they 
believe, and I believe too, that they could actually field one of these 
space drives within a 10-year period. . . .
                       
"We would basically be able to bump out to the Moon in a matter of hours," 
rather than take several days, as the Apollo astronauts did. A visit to 
Mars might take 10 weeks each way, instead of the projected 10 months in 
each direction.
                       
During a Deseret News interview, Hickam described technical problems 
that face the development of the space drive.
                       
"The major technical hurdle, of course, is how to handle large quantities 
of antimatter. It's extremely powerful stuff. And that's what they're working 
on right now."
                      
Electromagnetic fields would be used to contain the antimatter, and that 
will require a great deal of energy, he said. Probably antimatter will be 
used as an energy source to start a fusion reaction to power a spacecraft.
                       
Other technical hurdles must be overcome, including developing new forms 
of metallurgy. "I really think that we're up to it. So I think we could do 
it in 10 years."
                       
Would it require a research and development program on the scale of the 
Apollo Moon landing project?
                       
"No, I don't think so  I think a much smaller scale. Of course, we'd 
be building smaller drives at first, primarily for robotic type missions."

According to Hickam, a project on the scale of the Apollo effort might be 
needed to build a true starship using the space drives, and "we're a long 
way from that."
                       
In his Browning Center talk, he said the space drive could open the solar 
system not just to exploration or scientific research but actually to 
colonization. People could go there to work.
                       
"I am, after all, a West Virginia boy, so I would personally like to see 
the Moon mined," Hickam said.

The United States could use the new space drives, leading the way to 
colonizing the solar system, he believes.
                       
Ever since the end of the Cold War, the United States has been 
"really . . . looking for something greater than itself," Hickam said.

As far as Hickam is concerned, that "ought to be going out and settling 
the solar system and bringing to the United States and the world all that 
it contains."
                       
He recalled an incident that profoundly affected him during his youth 
in West Virginia.
                       
Hickam was in trouble for his rocket experiments. But then a preacher 
comforted him, telling him that he had had a dream that men would go to 
the Moon and that Hickam would be one of them.

When the minister awoke he went to the Bible. His eyes happened to fall 
upon 2 Peter 3:13,

"Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new 
Earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness."

It took Hickam a long time to understand what the preacher meant, he said. 
Then he finally understood, "my life would be dedicating to fulfilling the 
promise," which would be the opportunity of mankind to look for new heavens 
and new Earths.
                       
The solar system is filled with mineral wealth, but more importantly, it has 
an inexhaustible supply of energy. He believes one of the most significant of 
these supplies is the helium-3 that covers the Moon, the result of deposits 
from the solar wind that continually blows from the Sun.

"Helium-3 is the perfect fuel for fusion reactors," he said. Hickam thinks 
it is no coincidence that mankind is able to reach the Moon to mine it just 
at a time when fusion reactors may become practical.

"The root problem there (in Third World countries) is the lack of cheap 
and plentiful energy resources," Hickam added.

The United States can lead the way into space, harvesting energy and 
other resources that can benefit the world, he believes.

Yep. So...work hard to become that Power.

Actually it implies not wanting anyone or anything else
to have a head start. An "unfair" advantage. To transcend 
before you do. As it is unlikely that anyone can become a 
Power all by himself, synchronized ascension of the project 
team is the obvious solution.

I honestly do not know whether or not "I" (the dynamic pattern
encoded in my synapses, or however you care to take it) can be
neatly extricated from my genetics and metabolism. It may be so,
but the question is still wide open.  I nonetheless accept the
possibility of mind uploading because I know that in principle all
details of genetic expression and metabolism can be simulated with
a sufficiently powerful computer system. But that kind of uploading
would not leave my genetics and metabolism behind, it would simply
change the "platform" on which they are implemented. I hope that
after such a transformation, function-preserving repairs and redesign 
will be easier than in the flesh, but I do not expect them to be
easy, by any means.

In the meantime, I may have to compete for resources with
superintelligent machines that can outperform me in every department.
I'm not too worried about this because I understand the Principle
of Comparative Advantage. Nor do I have any intention of offing
myself just because my platform is suddenly obsolete and cannot be
redesigned and retrofitted rapidly enough to keep up with events.
I intend to maintain a niche in whatever economy/ecosystem develops
whether or not I can make a transcendent leap into posthumanity or
must remain as profoundly human as I am now (with the exception of
a few little niceties e. g. limited lifespan, speed of thought)
for many centuries to come.

May I add:

[1] Wolf, A., "Textbook of Logic", l938, Allen & Unwin, London

     Comment: Although otherwise antiquated by an exclusive treatment
     of traditional Aristotelian Logic, this book contains one of the best
     summaries of those logical fallacies committed in conversational
     arguments and ordinary human discourse [Appendix J, p. 359ff].

[2] Curtis, C.P. & Greenslet, F., "The Practical Cogitator", l953, Cambridge, Boston

[3] Kosko, B., "Fuzzy Thinking", l993, Hyperion, New York

     Comment: This work does not critique "fuzzy thinking" but in fact
     advocates it.  Helps acquire perspective on the historical idols
     "The Law of Contradiction" and "The Law of the Excluded Middle".

[4] Search Engine: enter "Critical Thinking" for a compilation of online papers.

     Comment: I recommend, for ease of use and effectiveness, "Google":

Interesting comment.  I would have said that a possible
universe actualized by and within the finite experience
of [N] can no longer be perceived; but that it does matter
insofar as it was communicated and experienced vicariously
by others, thereby perpetuated as memory.

In this context, "staying alive" means one's continuing
investment in the evolution of a unique ontological vision,
and, as noted by others in this thread, complying with
those ad hoc personal rules that have proven to be of
instrumental value.

We can't talk about our plans for the universe as most people won't be
thinking that far ahead.  But we can tell our desipient, belligerent, and
nave critics to read the FMPfWD.


Frequently Misunderstood Plans for World Domination

Q.  Does transhumanism advocate creating a master race?
A.  No comment.

Q.  Won't merging with computers make us less human?
A.  Only if it's done right.

Q.  Is transhumanism a "New Age" movement?
A.  If that works for you.

Q.  Do transhumanists strive for some kind of idealistic
    technological utopia?
A.  Remember that first commercial for the Apple Macintosh back in
    1984?  All those mindless slaves marching in unison and a
    supreme dictator monitoring and controlling everything?  And
    then that heroic lady comes along and frees everyone with that
    hammer?  Well, that's us without the lady and the hammer.


And so on.  (Actually, the answer to the second question is basically a
real one.)

Having a explanation ready is always useful but it must be read, earnestly
considered, and fairly represented.  Many people, as we are all aware,
simply don't respond to arguments.  I witnessed this a couple of times
recently during the Kansas education committee vs. evolution business: a
reporter asks a Kansan why he refuses to accept evolution; "I just don't
like the idea that we came from monkeys" is his reply.  A good rule of
thumb: evolution first, singularity later.

I would almost say that the text which started this thread, that on the Web
pages of some random students, is barely worth a response.  (Don't be
fooled by the title of the parent English class, which most likely does not
treat technology in any way recognizable to most of us but engages in the
nonsense which passes for scholarship in many university and college
humanities departments.)  But stepping in before students can be
well-rewarded for sloppy thinking (and they too often will be) might
demonstrate that someone is paying attention.

So I am certainly not discouraging developing materials and promoting
discussion.  There are a number of considerations involved with dealing
with those unfamiliar with or critical of transhumanism; some on this list
have expressed serious interest in designing tactics and strategies.
Eventually the public will end up in some kind of discussion about the
science and technology; that is clearly already happening to some
extent---though much of it is media hype---for cloning (which many,
strangely enough, actually confuse with uploading), AI, and genetic
engineering.  But in my opinion the most important thing is to just keep
working.

What is the traffic, by the way, on crit.org?

Sorry for this, people, one of those `Anyone been raped and speak English?'
questions.

I've just changed machine and [win98] OS, bringing myself at last into the
late 20th century. Eudora has suddenly grown new muscles. I find that my
clumsy spelling mistakes tend to do Horrid Things to my mail. It's the
damnable keyboard shortcuts. Love the idea, hate what happens when I
mistakenly hit Control-D instead of Cap-D and my entire fucking
carefully-crafted two page letter vanishes two lines before I was about to
queue it. Control-Z doesn't bring it back. 

So: anyone know how to disable the shortcuts? (Yes, I've looked at the Help
menu and FAQs and like that - no luck so far.)

Thanks, Damien

I have never understood the X-file Cult (nor the Star Trek "Fan
Club") -- bad science, monotonous plots, Bill Shattner -- although
someone said he and his corset had been replaced ...  In a totally
phony exercise in largesse, I pass along the "All-new Official Site
of The X-Files" to which a search engine aberration sent me:

http://www.fox.com/frameset.html?content=/thexfiles/index2.htm

Again, for reasons incomprehensible to me, the page has a hotlink
called "Amor Fati" upon which, as a member of the Nietzsche Cult
and Fan Club, I had to click with this result:

-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-

The Latin phrase "Amor Fati" translates to "Love of Fate."  Friedrich
Nietzche (1844-1900) used the phrase in his work, "The Gay Science":

"I still live, I still think: I still have to live, for I still have to think.
Sum, ergo cogito: cogito, ergo sum. Today everybody permits
himself the expression of his wish and his dearest thought; hence
I, too, shall say what it is that I wish from myself today, and what
was the first thought to run across my heart this year--what
thought shall be for me the reason, warranty, and sweetness of my
life henceforth. I want to learn more and more to see as beautiful
what is necessary in things; then I shall be one of those who make
things beautiful. Amor Fati: let that be my love henceforth! I do not
want to wage war against that is ugly. I do not want to accuse; I
do not even want to accuse those who accuse. Looking away shall
be my only negation. And all in all and on the whole: some day I wish
to be only a Yes-sayer."

-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-

I haven't the faintest idea what this has to do with X-files, nor which
imp of the perverse composed this message with the evident intention
of embarrassing me.

Yes; delete the entire Eudora program -- hold down the shift key when press-
ing "delete" to assure its complete destruction, and then download at no cost
Netscape Communicator, Version 4.61.  That should do it.

Here's a simple low-tech solution.  Just use a pocket knife or other
suitable tool to gently pry up on the control key, popping it up out of
the keyboard.  On some keyboards there are actually two small plastic
moldings, nested one into the other, which make up the control key.  It
should be easy to do this without damaging anything.  Take careful note
of how the removable plastic key cap came out of its seat so you can
later put it back in the same way, when you want to use the key.   While
the key cap is out, hitting its seat (the place on the keyboard) with
your finger should not actuate the key's function.  There will probably
be a small spring sticking out.  Leave it there, and don't lose it.  If
you like you can put some tape over the seat to keep the spring from
getting lost, and to keep foreign objects from falling into the exposed
seat. 


Alternatively you could leave the key cap in place, and tape a small
solid barrier in place covering the key, which would prevent the key from
being accidently pressed.

We had a thread on this once before but cannot recall how it
turned out:  in the old days, when one vowed till death do us
part, that only meant 15-25 years average, because of the shorter
lifespans, all too common tragic death of the mother during
childbirth, etc.

We hear that this is the age of divorce, but has anyone
corrected for the longer lifespans of moderns?  Is the halflife
of the average marriage actually increasing with time?  Are
there studies on this, anyone?  spike

Quite interesting - though strangely enough, you can't see stats on
public opinions.

I carefully filled the questionnaire and - surprise!- Harry Browne came
as recommendation #1, followed by Orrin Hatch and others.

Nov 13, 99

*FEED magazine has an article on nanotechnology. "Thinking Small." Mark
Pesce (co-inventor of VRML) on molecular-scale manufacturing, the gray goo
problem, and how nanotechnology will change the world as we know it.
http://www.feedmag.com/invent/pesce.html?alert

*Ultra-tiny machines are becoming big hope for scientists. After years of
preliminary research, hope and hype, business and industry are starting to
enter the strange, invisible world of the very ... Very ... VERY
small.Government agencies, leading universities and major corporations are
rapidly expanding their efforts to design and build machines and structures
on the scale of atoms and molecules. This exploding new discipline -- known
as ``nanotechnology'' -- has become a top scientific priority in Congress
and at the White House.
http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/breaking/merc/docs/029581.htm

*Plastic Pillars of the Microworld. Rome wasn't built in a day, but a
nanosized version of it may be thrown up that quickly in the near future. At
the International Symposium on Cluster and Nanostructure Interfaces here
last week, researchers described a new technique capable of creating arrays
of plastic pillars, each less than a micrometer across, that resemble
nothing so much as tiny versions of the great columns of Rome's coliseum.

I have noticed that often, when people are talking about transhumanism and 
posthumanity, there is an undercurrent or sometimes outright statement that 
being "human" is bad and that progressing from humanity through transhumanity 
to posthumanity will purge all that  "human" stuff. 

Well, "human" and "humanity" are terms with many layers of possible meaning 
(it's almost as bad as "God").  However, to most people that I know, it has 
generally good conotations and often represents what they cherish most in 
themselves, others, and their cultures.  So to suggest that we need to 
somehow abandon our humanity often leads to a nature defensive reaction.  
They think you're talking about eliminating most of what they value in life.  

When I talk about the desire to be transhuman or even posthuman, I try to 
keep an emphasis on the "human".  I want to take what is best about being 
human, and expand upon it.  Perhaps I am conservative in this regard.  I want 
to preserve indefinitely the joys I currently have in life, and expand to 
encompass new ones.  I believe the being I seek to become will have as much 
emphasis on the human as the trans or post.  


I keep coming back to the idea of childhood.  I have always been an odd 
combination of young and old.  When I was a child, I often took part in the 
adult conversations, and was interested in adult things, but I also liked to 
climb trees and ride my bike.  And even at an early age, I said that I wanted 
to enjoy the age I was when I was that age, for it would come only once.  
Back then I was fresh and excited to discover the wide world, yet it was like 
there was a wise old voice in the back of my mind guiding me.  As I grew 
older, I have worked hard to keep my childlike wonder and joy in life, so now 
there is a youthful voice in the back of my head laughing and urging me to 
play.

I see transhumanism in much the same light.  In my humanhood, I have the 
voice of the posthuman I will become guiding me forward, but I like being 
human.  And when I pass through the singularity, I fully expect to enjoy my 
posthumanity, and to have a human voice in my mind reminding of what wonder 
there is in being a young sentient.  I will no more discard the human I am 
now than I would the child I once was.  They are all me, and I cherish every 
facet even as I seek to grow more.

This is my vision of transhumanism.  I believe it is also one that is less 
threatening to the general population.  If any of you believe we should 
abandon all of our humanity, even what is good, then I must disagree.  I tend 
to think, however, that this is not the goal of most transhumans.  If that is 
so, then please, be thoughtful about how you use the term "human".  It means 
more than meat and irrationality, and I think we might be alienating people 
from transhumanity who might truly benefit from it.

The Once and Future,

Having mentioned some reasons why the "hard nanotech" might take longer
than one might like to reach fruition, I find the prospects for getting
viable communities of people into space *soon* to be as problematic as
ever. Although I argued earlier that space development could get a good
start with just "partial" nanotech, I must admit that big time space
access and relocation, with survival basically independent of Earth,
might well have to wait for the "real deal", i.e. the "hackable"
factory, or "matter compiler" or classic nanoassembler, (or whatever
else you may want to call it, call it a "Grail", maybe, like in that
Phil Farmer novel, _To Your Scattered Bodies Go_).

The way it looks, we had just better take all reasonable environmental
concerns seriously, because what we have here on Earth really is the
only game around, at least until we can build molecules all the way up
to the point where we have programmable factories and the
Nano-Singularity as a consequence. If it's any consolation for us outer
space dreamers, isn't this at least a bit reassuring, in the sense that
we've got a ways to go, for instance, before any possible radical
military effects of these "hacktories"? Presumably, the "hard" nanotech
capabilities, with power densities needed for handheld laser weapons and
suchlike, are not likely to burst upon us for at least another 25 years
or so, anyway.

Finally, now that I've mentioned security related matters, are there any
really bright ideas for lessening possible dangers of nanotech, short of
running far, far away, that is? Someone is going to tell me that AI's
will take over and take care of it all, I'm sure, but I'm really more
interested in whether organizations of relatively ordinary humans could
somehow deal with this competently?

Bravo, Glen.  That is exactly how I feel.  The singularity is not and should 
not be a brick wall where you can never go back to being 'merely human', but 
a (albeit vast) augmentation of what we humans value most, love, courage, 
curiosity, and altruisism.

I'm hoping to get some **VERY** rough (prototype) software working which does

Set up a group of people or a new mailing list discussing this ?

Greg, your question has given me many hours of pleasant ponderations.
Doug is more advanced than I am in the field of heavy lift, so I will
defer to him, however I must admit to being somewhat less optimistic.
With hard nanotech, we get stronger, lighter materials, which would
be a godsend to the space colonist, but at the end of the day, I must
say getting a space colony going with rocketry will still be difficult and
expensive...  UNLESS:  we can reduce the size of... us.

If we must carry full size humans [especially gorillas the size of *you*
Greg {8^D  ] to orbit, it will take rockets pretty much the size we are
accustomed to today {8-[.   But if we could tinkerbellize to the scale
of 10 cm, which should eventually be possible with strong nanotech,
holy schlaMOLY we could make some wicked cool space colonies,
and of course the rocket problem would already be solved: preadaptation
from the time we were still huge apes, as we are today.  Even if we could
get down to the size of Darwin your pet lemur, it would make the whole
process vaaaaastly more practical.

I would then agree with Doug: give us *that* tool and we could be
outta here tomorrow.  spike

Ja, I was thinking the same thing.  Even running far far away probably
wont help much because nanobots travel much better than we do.  If the
earth gets grey gooed, its only a matter of time before all the rocky
planets catch it too, from meteors striking the earth and kicking up
a tiny amount of goo into interstellar orbit.

And of course, if nanotech capable humans start using nanotech to
carry colonies, the infection spreads even more rapidly.  And even
if some humans manage to escape earth ahead of nanotech, the
knowledge in their collective minds that nanotech is possible means
it is only a matter of time before they invent it on board and suffer
the same fate as earth.

Let us work like hell to make nanotech our friend and keep it
under control somehow.

Antisingularitarianistically speaking, the same problem applies to
that technology too, eh Eliezer?  It *will* be able to find us.  spike

The displacement of the idea that facts and evidence matter by the idea that
everything boils down to subjective interests and perspectives is -- second only
to American political campaigns -- the most prominent and pernicious
manifestation of anti-intellectualism in our time.
-- Larry Laudan, Science and Relativism (1990)


For some years I've been troubled by an apparent decline in the standards of
intellectual rigor in certain precincts of the American academic humanities. But
I'm a mere physicist: if I find myself unable to make head or tail of
jouissanceand diffrance, perhaps that just reflects my own inadequacy.

So, to test the prevailing intellectual standards, I decided to try a modest
(though admittedly uncontrolled) experiment: Would a leading North American
journal of cultural studies -- whose editorial collective includes such
luminaries as Fredric Jameson and Andrew Ross -- publish an article liberally
salted with nonsense if (a) it sounded good and (b) it flattered the editors'
ideological preconceptions?

The answer, unfortunately, is yes. Interested readers can find my article,
``Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum
Gravity,'' in the Spring/Summer 1996 issue of Social Text. It appears in a
special number of the magazine devoted to the ``Science Wars.''

What's going on here? Could the editors reallynot have realized that my article
was written as a parody?

In the first paragraph I deride ``the dogma imposed by the long
post-Enlightenment hegemony over the Western intellectual outlook'':

that there exists an external world, whose properties are independent of any
individual human being and indeed of humanity as a whole; that these properties
are encoded in ``eternal'' physical laws; and that human beings can obtain
reliable, albeit imperfect and tentative, knowledge of these laws by hewing to
the ``objective'' procedures and epistemological strictures prescribed by the
(so-called) scientific method.
Is it now dogma in Cultural Studies that there exists no external world? Or that
there exists an external world but science obtains no knowledge of it?
In the second paragraph I declare, without the slightest evidence or argument,
that ``physical `reality' [note the scare quotes] ... is at bottom a social and
linguistic construct.'' Not our theoriesof physical reality, mind you, but the
reality itself. Fair enough: anyone who believes that the laws of physics are
mere social conventions is invited to try transgressing those conventions from
the windows of my apartment. (I live on the twenty-first floor.)

Throughout the article, I employ scientific and mathematical concepts in ways
that few scientists or mathematicians could possibly take seriously. For
example, I suggest that the ``morphogenetic field'' -- a bizarre New Age idea
due to Rupert Sheldrake -- constitutes a cutting-edge theory of quantum gravity.
This connection is pure invention; even Sheldrake makes no such claim. I assert
that Lacan's psychoanalytic speculations have been confirmed by recent work in
quantum field theory. Even nonscientist readers might well wonder what in
heavens' name quantum field theory has to do with psychoanalysis; certainly my
article gives no reasoned argument to support such a link.

Later in the article I propose that the axiom of equality in mathematical set
theory is somehow analogous to the homonymous concept in feminist politics. In
reality, all the axiom of equality states is that two sets are identical if and
only if they have the same elements. Even readers without mathematical training
might well be suspicious of the claim that the axiom of equality reflects set
theory's ``nineteenth-century liberal origins.''

In sum, I intentionally wrote the article so that any competent physicist or
mathematician (or undergraduate physics or math major) would realize that it is
a spoof. Evidently the editors of Social Text felt comfortable publishing an
article on quantum physics without bothering to consult anyone knowledgeable in
the subject.

The fundamental silliness of my article lies, however, not in its numerous
solecisms but in the dubiousness of its central thesis and of the ``reasoning''
adduced to support it. Basically, I claim that quantum gravity -- the
still-speculative theory of space and time on scales of a millionth of a
billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a centimeter -- has profound
politicalimplications (which, of course, are ``progressive''). In support of
this improbable proposition, I proceed as follows: First, I quote some
controversial philosophical pronouncements of Heisenberg and Bohr, and assert
(without argument) that quantum physics is profoundly consonant with
``postmodernist epistemology.'' Next, I assemble a pastiche -- Derrida and
general relativity, Lacan and topology, Irigaray and quantum gravity -- held
together by vague rhetoric about ``nonlinearity'', ``flux'' and
``interconnectedness.'' Finally, I jump (again without argument) to the
assertion that ``postmodern science'' has abolished the concept of objective
reality. Nowhere in all of this is there anything resembling a logical sequence
of thought; one finds only citations of authority, plays on words, strained
analogies, and bald assertions.

In its concluding passages, my article becomes especially egregious. Having
abolished reality as a constraint on science, I go on to suggest (once again
without argument) that science, in order to be ``liberatory,'' must be
subordinated to political strategies. I finish the article by observing that ``a
liberatory science cannot be complete without a profound revision of the canon
of mathematics.'' We can see hints of an ``emancipatory mathematics,'' I
suggest, ``in the multidimensional and nonlinear logic of fuzzy systems theory;
but this approach is still heavily marked by its origins in the crisis of
late-capitalist production relations.'' I add that ``catastrophe theory, with
its dialectical emphases on smoothness/discontinuity and
metamorphosis/unfolding, will indubitably play a major role in the future
mathematics; but much theoretical work remains to be done before this approach
can become a concrete tool of progressive political praxis.'' It's
understandable that the editors of Social Text were unable to evaluate
critically the technical aspects of my article (which is exactly why they should
have consulted a scientist). What's more surprising is how readily they accepted
my implication that the search for truth in science must be subordinated to a
political agenda, and how oblivious they were to the article's overall illogic.

Why did I do it? While my method was satirical, my motivation is utterly
serious. What concerns me is the proliferation, not just of nonsense and sloppy
thinking per se, but of a particular kind of nonsense and sloppy thinking: one
that denies the existence of objective realities, or (when challenged) admits
their existence but downplays their practical relevance. At its best, a journal
like Social Textraises important questions that no scientist should ignore --
questions, for example, about how corporate and government funding influence
scientific work. Unfortunately, epistemic relativism does little to further the
discussion of these matters.

In short, my concern over the spread of subjectivist thinking is both
intellectual and political. Intellectually, the problem with such doctrines is
that they are false (when not simply meaningless). There isa real world; its
properties are notmerely social constructions; facts and evidence domatter. What
sane person would contend otherwise? And yet, much contemporary academic
theorizing consists precisely of attempts to blur these obvious truths -- the
utter absurdity of it all being concealed through obscure and pretentious
language.

Social Text's acceptance of my article exemplifies the intellectual arrogance of
Theory -- meaning postmodernist literarytheory -- carried to its logical
extreme. No wonder they didn't bother to consult a physicist. If all is
discourse and ``text,'' then knowledge of the real world is superfluous; even
physics becomes just another branch of Cultural Studies. If, moreover, all is
rhetoric and ``language games,'' then internal logical consistency is
superfluous too: a patina of theoretical sophistication serves equally well.
Incomprehensibility becomes a virtue; allusions, metaphors and puns substitute
for evidence and logic. My own article is, if anything, an extremely modest
example of this well-established genre.

Politically, I'm angered because most (though not all) of this silliness is
emanating from the self-proclaimed Left. We're witnessing here a profound
historical volte-face. For most of the past two centuries, the Left has been
identified with science and against obscurantism; we have believed that rational
thought and the fearless analysis of objective reality (both natural and social)
are incisive tools for combating the mystifications promoted by the powerful --
not to mention being desirable human ends in their own right. The recent turn of
many ``progressive'' or ``leftist'' academic humanists and social scientists
toward one or another form of epistemic relativism betrays this worthy heritage
and undermines the already fragile prospects for progressive social critique.
Theorizing about ``the social construction of reality'' won't help us find an
effective treatment for AIDS or devise strategies for preventing global warming.
Nor can we combat false ideas in history, sociology, economics and politics if
we reject the notions of truth and falsity.

The results of my little experiment demonstrate, at the very least, that some
fashionable sectors of the American academic Left have been getting
intellectually lazy. The editors of Social Textliked my article because they
liked its conclusion: that ``the content and methodology of postmodern science
provide powerful intellectual support for the progressive political project.''
They apparently felt no need to analyze the quality of the evidence, the cogency
of the arguments, or even the relevance of the arguments to the purported
conclusion.

Of course, I'm not oblivious to the ethical issues involved in my rather
unorthodox experiment. Professional communities operate largely on trust;
deception undercuts that trust. But it is important to understand exactly what I
did. My article is a theoretical essay based entirely on publicly available
sources, all of which I have meticulously footnoted. All works cited are real,
and all quotations are rigorously accurate; none are invented. Now, it's true
that the author doesn't believe his own argument. But why should that matter?
The editors' duty as scholars is to judge the validity and interest of ideas,
without regard for their provenance. (That is why many scholarly journals
practice blind refereeing.) If the Social Texteditors find my arguments
convincing, then why should they be disconcerted simply because I don't? Or are
they more deferent to the so-called ``cultural authority of technoscience'' than
they would care to admit?

In the end, I resorted to parody for a simple pragmatic reason. The targets of
my critique have by now become a self-perpetuating academic subculture that
typically ignores (or disdains) reasoned criticism from the outside. In such a
situation, a more direct demonstration of the subculture's intellectual
standards was required. But how can one show that the emperor has no clothes?
Satire is by far the best weapon; and the blow that can't be brushed off is the
one that's self-inflicted. I offered the Social Texteditors an opportunity to
demonstrate their intellectual rigor. Did they meet the test? I don't think so.

I say this not in glee but in sadness. After all, I'm a leftist too (under the
Sandinista government I taught mathematics at the National University of
Nicaragua). On nearly all practical political issues -- including many
concerning science and technology -- I'm on the same side as the Social
Texteditors. But I'm a leftist (and feminist) becauseof evidence and logic, not
in spite of it. Why should the right wing be allowed to monopolize the
intellectual high ground?

And why should self-indulgent nonsense -- whatever its professed political
orientation -- be lauded as the height of scholarly achievement?

> A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies

We have to go beyond this moral idea that it is not 'right' that these things 
can happen or that the 'standards' are not OK in some parts of the academic 
world.  People who know some bits of good technology and some good scientific 
tricks should USE them, directly, to gain benefits for themselves; thereby 
demonstrating directly that these tricks and technologies work.  And thereby 
*bypassing* entirely those stuffy, bureaucratic, self-important and brain-dead 
people being 'exposed' in this story about the article in 'Social Text'. 

Technology and science is a living and utilitarian thing, which must always 
demonstrate its usefulness directly and materialistically; it is not a thing 
like ''art'' or ''politics'', in which people's arbitrary opinions count more 
than the real, objective, self-demonstrating usefulness of a thing.  The 
basics of science and technology is the simple common sense that says that a 
theory or a bit of technology must be *useful* (else why bother with it).  I 
have some confidence that this will more or less automatically keep groups 
engaged in science and technology rid of the kind of thing described for the 
Social Text article.

You bet.  A large fraction of the project (maybe 75% of the lead time and
10% of the money) could be done before the assembler breakthrough.  If we
had a firm date for the invention of the necessary nanotech we could
schedule the whole project around that to optimize our chance of success.
Since we don't have such a date we should a) start work early and b) make an
effort to develop better nanotech projections.

I think that preliminary work like locating a viable launch site, dealing
with the local government and working out preliminary hardware designs
should all begin a good 5-8 years before anyone expects to see a
general-purpose assembler.  Working out a good colonization plan is
something we could start doing now - it doesn't take any much money at all
and it will be critical to a successful project.

That seems a little optimistic for the 2010-2015 time frame, but only a
little.   I'd say you may have such a tool, but it will have the same kinds
of problems as modern software - it will take significant effort to use, it
won't handle all of the tasks you'd like it to, and it will produce bad
designs just often enough that someone has to actually check its work.  I
think it is realistic to expect the human engineering effort needed to
produce a working system to fall by a factor of 10.  If you want to be
really optimistic you might hope for as much as a 100-fold reduction, but
anything beyond that is unlikely in that time frame (unless there is a
breakthrough in self-improving AI, in which case all bets are off).

Now, I think we can reasonably look for similar improvements in pretty much
everything else related to the project, and of course the fact that it isn't
a government project is probably good for an order-of-magnitude cost
reduction all by itself.  However, that still leaves me with a cost estimate
of several million dollars for a new launch vehicle, and per-unit production
costs of several hundred thousand dollars apiece.  That is great compared to
current practice (we get a launch cost of maybe $10/lb to LEO), but it still
costs real money (a few $10K per person, with minimal baggage).  Therefore,
a meaningful colonization effort will require at least moderately deep
pockets.

Thanks for the several messages on and off list.

I've since realised that my random deletion prob is not in my new version
of Eudora (since the same thing, it turns out with a bit of experimenting,
can happen with the old one), but in my new keyboard, which is slightly
smaller. And I hadn't tried looking in the Trash for accidently deleted
text (d'oh), which will probably save my ass when my fingers do the
jaywalking during the retraining interval... (I *had* tried Control-Z, as I
mentioned, which didn't do the trick, so I stupidly assumed the text was
gone for good.)

Thanks for the tips, everyone.

Cheers, Damien

I think you both overestimate the problem.  Building a 'natural' biosphere
is well beyond our current knowledge, but we don't need to do anything of
the sort for life support.  Providing air, water and climate control
requires only mechanical systems and a decent energy source.  Providing food
is simply a matter of growing crops, which is something we do know a lot
about.

Mind you, I do think we would be wise to do everything we can to maximize
the colony's resources in this regard.  We should take along a good
assortment of experts in related fields, as well as a good variety of plant
and insect species (no 'one person growing one crop' scenarios, please - we
don't want the colony to fail because we happened to pick the one plant that
doesn't adapt well to low gravity).  However, I see no reason to think that
moving food production into space will be anywhere near as difficult as
creating an entire biosphere.

Hello,

I was not sure what to make of David Bowman's websites.  I think he is 
serious but sometimes thought it was a joke of some sort.  I liked some of 
the ideas about academic feudal systems and how scientific establishments 
don't always like new trains of thought.  I found his views on life after 
death interesting.  But when he went on about intelligent reptiles among us 
using mind control tech to pass for human in the British royal family he 
lost me.  And what is the deal with the Luciferian Deception, the black sun 
and the year 2012?  It looks like a trend may be developing to create odd 
websites about transhumanism.  What do the rest of you think?


best regards,

John Grigg

If we _can_ remember it, does it then acquire a point? What point?

Good idea, and in addition, we can appreciate what Alan D. Sokal
has done in this article. He has, IMO, debunked "Cultural Studies."

He has demonstrated not just the irrelevance of "Cultural Studies," 
he has noted the uselessness of "Cultural Studies."

I looks to me like the term "transhumanism" may get away from us, because no one
has copyrighted, trademarked, or patented it. Like the word "natural" on food
products and building materials, anyone can use it, and anyone can define it
(except Daniel Webster).

Rave on,

Dear Glen,

Your post has moved me deeply, and evoked "thoughts that do often lie
too deep for tears". Hegel, in his Phylogeny of Ideas, the Dialectic, sought
to "lift up" ["aufhebung"] such antinomies within intelligible "syntheses"[i].
This model -- history as a dialectical process -- became the basis of Karl
Marx's socioeconomic analyses but not the development of Charles Darwin's
evolutionary mechanism.  The former is "rational", the latter is not. So this
is the first "root metaphor": the process "humanity" ^ "posthumanity" =
Set { ? }.

The second root metaphor appeared in Plato, attributed to Socrates, of
"anmnsis", the Greek term for recollection of fundamental truths about a
Form {Gk. eidos [eidos]}[ii]. For this, I invite you to read INTIMATIONS OF
IMMORTALITY FROM RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD by William
Wordsworth[iii].  Here are several relevant excerpts:

[1]      THERE was a time when meadow, grove, and stream,
          The earth, and every common sight,
                    To me did seem
                  Apparelled in celestial light,
          The glory and the freshness of a dream.
          It is not now as it hath been of yore;--
                  Turn wheresoe'er I may,
                    By night or day,
          The things which I have seen I now can see no more.

[2]      --But there's a Tree, of many, one,
          A single Field which I have looked upon,
          Both of them speak of something that is gone:
              The Pansy at my feet
              Doth the same tale repeat:
          Whither is fled the visionary gleam?
          Where is it now, the glory and the dream?

[3]      Heaven lies about us in our infancy!
          Shades of the prison-house begin to close
              Upon the growing Boy,
          But He beholds the light, and whence it flows,
              He sees it in his joy;

[4]      Full soon thy Soul shall have her earthly freight,
          And custom lie upon thee with a weight
          Heavy as frost, and deep almost as life!
          What though the radiance which was once so bright
          Be now for ever taken from my sight,
              Though nothing can bring back the hour
          Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower;

[5]      The Clouds that gather round the setting sun
          Do take a sober colouring from an eye
          That hath kept watch o'er man's mortality;
          Another race hath been, and other palms are won.
          Thanks to the human heart by which we live,
          Thanks to its tenderness, its joys, and fears,
          To me the meanest flower that blows can give
          Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.

[6]      Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:
              Not in entire forgetfulness,
              And not in utter nakedness,
          But trailing clouds of glory do we come.

[7]      Thou best Philosopher, who yet dost keep
          Thy heritage, thou Eye among the blind,
          That, deaf and silent, read'st the eternal deep,
          Haunted for ever...

I wish, Glen, I could continue with the universe of associations
born of your letter.  You have touched on a quintessential issue
for Transhumanists, and to a degree for Extropians:

          "Last night I Chuang Tzu dreamt I was a butterfly;
          But how do I know that today I am not a butterfly,
              Dreaming I am Chuang Tzu?"

There is so much more to be said; perhaps we might initiate a
discussion by private correspondence?

With genuine empathy,

Bob

Ask the cosmonauts how they and everything they were living among
smelled after the end of a long stay in Mir. (If you can't find a
cosmonaut, ask a sailor who has done a long tour of duty on a
nuclear submarine.)  Foul air is an unsolved problem for long-term
missions.  Biosphere 2 experienced no foul air problems (although
there was that bit about uncured concrete stealing the oxygen)
although earlier biosphere closures had, because they pumped their
air through a soil bed with a variety of carefully chosen bacterial
cultures growing in it.

As we extend human presence in space to larger populations and
longer stays, more problems of this kind are going to come up.
Your assertion about "mechanical systems and a decent energy source"
has *never* been tested in a closed biosphere with a large human
population over a long period of time, and I see no reason to accept
it in advance of such testing.  Don't confuse wishful thinking
with practical optimism.

The setup you propose with its "mechanical systems" *is* a biosphere
which will have to be created, so of course moving self-sustaining
food production into space will be exactly as difficult as creating
an entire biosphere. The question is, will the biosphere you create
succeed or fail, over the long term, in supporting the lives of a
human society or not.

Dear Glen,

You are very close to a major personal breakthrough.  Now push that line where
you stop and everything else begins.  Be everything, cherish everything.  Let the
human/transhuman distinction become a difference that does not make a difference.

I just finished "Bloom" by Wil McCarthy.

I suppose you could say it's "post - singularity".  It has to do with 
nano-tech gone "bad".  I read it......that's about all I can say for it....I 
doubt I'll read it again.  No complaints (not specificlly....about the tech 
anyway...or other asumptions...)...it's not a "happy" book though....and I 
like to "like" what I read....I've read Vinges books many times..

Uh-huh.  Nuclear submarines have the same problem after a couple of months
down.  So what?  Bad smells aren't lethal, and besides, the problem in
conventional vehicles has as much to do with overcrowding and severe
weight/volume/power constraints as anything else.

It seems to have escaped your attention that we are discussing a space
program with access to nanotechnology, not one that is limited to 60s-era
electromechanical contraptions.  The processes needed to purify air and
water are no more complex than those we would be using to produce fuel and
chemical feedstocks from natural materials.  That being the case, it seems
perfectly reasonable to expect these problems to be quite easy to deal with.

Food production is more complex, as I said before, and we would be well
advised to bring along lots of alternatives and allow ourselves a shakedown
period in which to stabilize production.  However, once again I can see no
reason to expect agriculture in a space colony to be much more difficult
than the ordinary kind.

Perhaps you could point out some specific problems that you think would be
show-stoppers?

There is a vast difference between building farms and creating a rain
forest.

Agricultural production requires only that we successfully grow a few dozen
plant species in an environment where temperature, light levels and
atmosphere composition are all subject to direct external control.  This
will, of course, require that we support a small variety of insects and
microorganisms that are essential to the survival of said plants, but you
don't need a complete ecosystem.  As long as you can maintain the system in
a stable state with a reasonable amount of human intervention you're in good
shape.

The "Biosphere" approach, in contrast, requires that you create a completely
self-sustaining ecology.  You end up with at least an order of magnitude
increase in the number of species involved, lots of extra biomass, and an
unmanageable mess of interlocking feedback loops that are almost impossible
to manage.  Making it work at all will be far more difficult than in the
agriculture approach, and making it produce food with any reasonable
efficiency will be nearly impossible.

Solution: defeat the olfactory organs using special nasal implants.
This solves the bad smell problem, but also allows the space colonists
to satisfy themselves (sort of) with the same food all the time, since
all food would taste about the same anyway.  This solution would
also extend human lives in the here and now, since taking away
the sense of smell/taste would encourage one to eat less.  spike

I cannot possibly do a thorough job of placing your remarks within the
scope of a much larger context where [A] they become more generally
meaningful, and [B] they may be subject to proper analysis and criticism.
You have made some sweeping generalizations and described some
parochial views that, in my opinion, are sometimes merely simplistic and
that sometimes are, because of a bias to which you are entitled, of limited
explanatory value.  I wish to emphasize, however, that I am replying to
your post because it expresses, in a very lucid and intelligent way, one
perspective on matters worthy of respectful examination.

At this time, I will limit myself to responding to your introductory quotation
with some contrasting ones. I do not consider this response argumentative
at all -- it is meant to complement in a preliminary constructive way your
essay, which I consider one dimensional rather than incorrect as such.

or how it originates; and even if some superior intelligence were to tell

It's an experience like no other experience I can describe, the best thing that
can happen to a scientist, realizing that something that's happened in his or
her mind exactly corresponds to something that happens in nature. It's start-
ling every time it occurs. One is surprised that a construct of one's own mind
can actually be realized in the honest-to-goodness world out there. A great
shock, and a great, great joy.

Finally, like it or not, Science can no longer isolate itself from the Humanities,
including especially their influence on public opinion and politics.

"In short, while scientists have generally considered themselves to be the
intellectual descendants of the "Benjamin Franklin" model of the benevolent
scientist, bringing enlightenment to humankind, too often scientists are
actually perceived by the public to be more in the "Dr. Frankenstein" mold,
unleashing scientific havoc on an unsuspecting world.

"The lesson we need to draw from this phenomenon is increasingly evident:
Modern scientists (and their first cousins, engineers) must become as adept
in dealing with societal and political forces as they are with gravitational
and electromagnetic forces--and, candidly, up to this point I would not
give us a passing grade. Today's scientists are no longer constrained
simply by the laws of nature, as was generally the case in the past, but
also by the laws (and attitudes) of the land."

Have any singularitans drafted a critique of the following site?

It's a well written essay, I have some problems with some of his
points(especially with regards to AI vs. human intelligence), but in
general it's a very well-reasoned argument.

Of what use is your belief in your current temporal life; how do you
know, as opposed to imagine, that there exists a distinct substance
having the attributes denoted by "Replicant"? Introspect: don't you
find that every referent of the pronoun "I" is a memory, and that you
cannot perceive any object called "Replicant" except a complex of
images and associations referred to the past of this non-existent
object by means of recollection?

There is no difference whatever psychodynamically between recalling
the past of your postulated current existence and recalling a postulated
personal existence that existed in the past.  Who you once were, now
are, and will be may all be involuntary fantasies which do not exist in
"your" consciousness but simply in the stream of "a" consciousness.

And, if the above it untrue, what empirical evidence can you cite to
falsify it?

Nothing unusual here; c.f. "Christianity", "Platonism", "Empiricism", "Situational
Ethics" or "Existentialism" generally, "Transcendentalism" and so on. The issue
that is raised is whether "Transhumanism" is a Secret Society requiring control
over the rites of initiation and confirmation, or whether it is merely the type of
label needed only by those who require others to authenticate their identity.

If one thinks of "Transhumanism" as a doing rather than a being, then the
outcomes of different practices will determine who "really" deserved the name,
and by then it won't matter.

I agree.  I think it makes a person smarter and more efficient to simply
excise useless memes and activities like "Cultural Studies" out of his life. 
(''Free Your Mind'' :-).)  The energy spent on such things subtracts from the 
energy an individual can spend on things that are (personally, egoistically) 
useful to him, i.e. things that increase one's own strength, knowledge, etc. 

I found your posting of Sokal's story very interesting, educational, and 
thought-provoking.  It is highly useful to know WHAT kind of memes to be on 
your guard against.

I just finished "Fashionable Nonsense", by Sokal and Jean Bricmont.
I highly recommend it.  Besides just giving some good yucks at the
expense of postmodernists, it has some excellent philosophical
discussions.

Yes, something like this would be *very* useful indeed. We certainly
won't improve our chances of making it past the Singularity just by
talking about it. This "space program" to create at least one offplanet 
habitat which could sustain a group of, say, 100-1000 people (depending 
on the interest in this project) long enough for them to transcend could
be part of a greater "Ascension Initiative" (or AI for short), which
might also include:

-An uploading node, along the lines of Joe Strout's
proposal (http://metalab.unc.edu/jstrout/uploading/murg.html)
-A "survivalist" node that prepares one or more "nuke-proof" shelters
which could do the same as the offplanet habitat in case of a 
severe society-crippling, non-nanotech war or disaster (a fully
self-sufficient cryonics facility should always be included, for
obvious reasons). 
-A nanotech research node as, which might, among other things,
try to design some basic software for replicators to make
tools, structures, food etc. which will be needed for the creation
and maintenance of viable space habitats.
-A financial node to (partially) fund all of the above, and anything 
else that may be necessary.

Needless to say, all of this would by no means guarantee 
success, but at least we could say that we've *tried*.

While Sokal's well-publicized nuking of postmodernist BS is a laudable 
exercise, it by no means establishes the irrelevancy of the traditional 
questions addressed by the humanities.  Saying that science and technology 
exist in a world of "utility" apart and immune from the fuzzy-edged questions 
addressed by philosophy and the arts is just as dangerous as the 
postmodernist subjectivist melt-down.  

Science and technology can tell you the "is", but the scientific method, 
standing alone, cannot tell you the "ought".  Ultimately, science and 
technology will provide us with a complete list of what we CAN do, but we'll 
still have to face the question of what we OUGHT to do.

A small group of folks associated with Foresight got together and talked 
about this question in February of this year.  We produced a short paper, 
which ought to be published soon - so said Ralph Merkle last night.  The best 
suggestion we could come up with was to try to emulate the process that 
occurred with genetic technology in the 1970s, where a regime of 
self-regulation developed and was slowly adopted into regulatory law.  In 
short, the group suggested prescriptions of release of freely autonomous 
replicators into the environment and some technical safeguards against 
mutation.

The group was not optimistic that these measures could completely and 
reliably prevent a nanotech disaster.  The best hope was that one could be 
forestalled until defensive technologies caught up with and surpassed 
offensive ones (which the technologists believed would precede effective 
countermeasures - thus creating a "zone of danger" of indeterminate length).

The latest set of messages seem to present a very mixed bag.

As Greg setup the initial scenario as, *having* a "classic" Drexlerian
assembler, I'm going to have to side with Doug and Billy on the
probability that we can get up there fast and produce livable
environments.  The only thing that would prevent that is a lack
of preparation on our part (i.e. not producing the tools we expect
will be required in a timely manner) or a very well organized
police-'world' environment arrayed against the colonizers.

Some of the discussion seems to have run off into the realm of
can we get off the planet *to* develop biotech/nanotech to
its full capabilities (i.e. how do we avoid the police-state working
against us).  I think the answer here is that you don't.  Since nanotech

is basically "small" technology, I think you can work on it away from
the 'light of day' and be successful.  When you need big stuff you
can assemble it from little stuff.  Big brother is going to have a hard
time doing global tracking of nanotech mass-drivers that launch
self-assembling nanobots into orbit at supersonic speeds from random
points around the world.

One thread seems to focus on the problem of getting off the planet fast
because we must to survive (presumably due to creeping grey goo).
I want to go on record that I think Grey Goo is an irrational fear
given the logical development trends.  Grey Goo does have mass
(element abundance), energy and disassembly design constraints.
I do *not* believe that those will be easy problems to work around
and they do suggest possible avenues for defense.  The only scenario
I can imagine in which Grey Goo becomes a serious threat is if a
significantly enhanced amoral intelligence develops and designs it *or*
self-evolution is allowed on a much faster than real-time, real-world
simulation.  Without one of those two situations, I believe that
defenses
would keep pace with or even ahead of any offenses.

With regard to the stale atmosphere issues, these are taken care of by
molecular sorting.  With regard to food production, people seem to be
still thinking ancient-tech.  A full complement of nutritious & tasty
gruels with all the necessary vitamins, proteins, fats & carbohydates
will be able to be produced in bacteria/yeast, directly from sunlight
or electricity, using biotech, long before we have hard nanotech
available.

With regard to the patchwork code of the human genome and our ability
to augment it, we will have to see how things turn out.  I would offer
a couple of comments -- studies show that mutations in a majority of
genes do not result in fatal defects and transgenic animal studies have
shown that we often have backup systems for any single function
(this makes sense given that the prototype mammalian genome has been
duplicated at least twice).  So I think there is going to be a lot of
junk
and a lot of extra stuff we don't need.  The question will become --
do you simply bite the bullet and generate as many new "improved"
genomes as fast as you possibly can, recycling the failures (as nature
does) or do you wait a little, expand your computational capacity and
do all the genome experimentation in silico where you don't have to
worry as much about whether people see you feeding the dead babies
to the hydroponic yeast blob?

Unfortunately, the regime has never been tested as it has since turned out 
that our engineered organisms do poorly in the wild. We probably *could* 
design invaders if we wanted to but the traits we want actually seem to harm 
the organisms in the wild.  Added to the fact that most successful invaders 
don't cause serious problems for humans anyway, the chance of a catastrophe 
was always small, so we don't know how much good the safeguards did us.

Deliberate bio- or nanowarfare might be a different story, but that's not 
under discussion here.

As I pointed out, we have little info on whether such measures can even 
forestall a nanotech disaster.

Perhaps so. Can you relate a few of the traditional questions addressed by the
humanities which science does not (or can not) also address (besides the
singular issue of moralism, which I think avoids the hard questions)?

As for what we "OUGHT" to do:
Authority belongs to the one who best answers those who question authority.
Anyone who wants to know what we ought to do can ask me. <innocent grin>
You "ought" to see my list.

But seriously, I think Richard Dawkins has contributed to the clarification of
how scientists can identify "what we ought to do" in his essay "The Biological
Basis of Morality." I suspect that deep down, everyone really agrees on "what we
ought to do." We just disagree (sometimes) about how to do it.

As I see it, science can achieve success in social policy making ("political
science"? Not!) equivalent to what it has achieved in chemistry or astronomy. As
neuroscience reveals more about how human brains function, we can learn more
about what we ought to do to extend and amplify our sentience. One thing I
advocate that we do involves further debunking of "Cultural Studies" and other
pseudo-science nonsense.

Ultimately, the questions I'm talking about are value questions: As the 
Greeks formulated the ultimate question, "What is the good?"  I don't know 
what you mean when you say that "the singular issue of moralism . . . avoids 
the hard questions".  What we judge to be good and bad IS the question.

I understand the humor here, but it is funny because of the merit of the 
question.  Look at the very formulation of your response: "the one who BEST 
answers" - well, how are we to judge a good answer, much less a "best" one?

I agree with you that much that has formerly been seen as fundamental will 
become instrumental - i.e. we will be able to DO the things we choose to do 
better and with fewer compromises.  But the insight upon which the basic 
concepts of transhumanism are based ultimately makes appeals to "how human 
brains function" a challenging basis for a value system.  Satisfying the 
needs of "human nature" becomes a shaky foundation when that nature becomes 
mutable.  Your formulation above reveals that you seem to value "extending 
and amplifying our sentience" as a fundamental value.  I do, too.  But 
explicating WHY that is a fundamental value is important and may well not be 
within the realm addressable by the scientific method.

I haven't read Sokol directly, apart from what is published here.  I didn't 
perceive him claiming that humanities were bad, just that fuzzy thinking and 
ignoring facts hurts.  You *could* do scientific and scholarly work in 
"cultural studies"; I thought the point was that the editors of that magazine 
were not.

On a distantly related note, I heard several contestants at the last Van 
Cliburn competition perform a sonata, in serial style, by Carl Vine.  
Although he works hard to make it more palatable (e.g. putting the 
dissonances in such different registers you don't notice them), it's still 
pretty nasty.  Towards the end, I *distinctly* heard the tune for "na na Na 
na NAAA na" (the children's taunt).  Perhaps some of the participants in 
these modern sillinesses are in on the joke?

Title
  Mitochondrial DNA--all
  things bad?. [Review] [27 refs]
Source
  Trends in Genetics.  15(3):91-3, 1999 Mar.
Abstract
  Mutations in mitochondrial DNA
  (mtDNA) are undoubtedly associated with a diverse spectrum
  of human disorders. More controversially, it has been
  claimed that they accumulate during ageing, and that they are responsible for
  an age-related decline in bioenergetic function and tissue viability. Here,
  we review the evidence for this assertion, concluding that claims for the
  age-accumulation of mtDNA mutations are based largely on
  non-quantitative methods, and that no clear, functional deficit of
  mitochondrial respiration has been shown to result from such
  lesions in aged individuals. The mitochondrial theory of
  ageing, however attractive in principle, is supported by very little hard
  evidence. [References: 27]

Break out the rotgut.

Unbridled enthusiasm, unshared, has lain waste to your technique, child.  
Stream of consciousness is the beginning of writing, not the end.  

My advice:

1)  Take a class.  Or,

2)  Take what you've got and rewrite it, half as long.  Then write it again, 
half as long, again.  Then throw it away.

And god, stop wasting our time.

Considering how "journalists" fill up magazines and newspapers with "Cultural
Studies" tripe, your advice seems eminently worthwhile. Who knows, perhaps
someday "Cultural Studies" will morph into something useful, as alchemy became
chemistry, and astrology became astronomy. But I wouldn't count on it. It may
become something like another Marxist world view. We ought to study "Cultural
Studies" to see how much damage it inflicts on otherwise healthy young minds.

Yes, that precisely states my intent in posting the Sokal piece. IMO, we need to
guard against memes which carry an agenda of political control and cognitive
coercion, memes founded on reactionary systems of consensus ideology, memes
which derive from a power base locked in ancient connections to privilege and
inherited status, memes which emerge as a consequence of tribal identities as
opposed to empirically ascertained information, in short, memes which oppose
extropy. --J. R.

Replicant had asked, "it is of no use if we can't remember it, [so,] what's the
point of this fantasy anyway?" in reference to reincarnation.
To which I responded that remembrance does not, in itself, confer any point of
its own. IOW, the "point" of anything does not necessarily rely on one's memory
of it. A forgetful mind reincarnated must (obviously) remain forgetful. "You"
didn't remember then, so "you" can't remember now, because the lack of memory
got reincarnated along with the rest of "you."

A reincarnated amnesiac must, by definition, have no memory of a former
existence (to preserve the accuracy of the reincarnation). Hence, Gurdieff
admonished "Remember yourself" to break the cycle.
It comes down to understanding the meaning of the word reincarnation (or Eternal
Recurrence, in Nietzsche's lexicon). Literal or simplistic metaphors tend to get
in the way of understanding underlying principles and physics.

I don't believe in the popular (supernatural) notion of reincarnation, and
suspect that Siddhartha Gautama used the (Hindu) idea of reincarnation as a
device to encourage people to wake up from entrancing ideas of metaphysics. Pure
consciousness (objective awareness of reality) recurs as pure consciousness in
different manifestations (bodies), without regard to identity or personality
(because identity constitutes contamination of otherwise pure consciousness).
This reality requires no supernatural mumbo-jumbo. Consciousness (or algebra,
for that matter) reincarnates, or replicates, in brains which maintain the
patterns involved. The complexity of reality rather consistently outpaces the
brain's attempts to remember all of it.
Reality has no universal point, so points remain pointless, and the adventure
continues to continue.

Only if it wouldn't compromize your continued survival and 
well-being. What's up this ethics debate anyway -- I thought
that rational ethics based on enlightened self-interest were
the default in transhumanism?

Actually Greg, I'm not sure this is the case.  My recollection of the
mid-late-'70s was there was a lot of debate over whether or not these
things should be regulated and whether or not there were any dangers.
After looking at it for a while the scientists came up with the relative
scale of dangers and implemented with the P1-P4 scaling system that is
in practice today (P1 is relatively non contained, P3 is for bugs
such as HIV and has positive pressure labs and throw away materials
and clothing, while P4 is for Ebola and leans strongly towards
remote-manipulation).  [I've worked in a P3 lab.]

Now, I suspect the "regulatory" penalties for violating these are
not particularly severe, but common sense and fear of loss of
reputation keep scientists following them.

I imagine that a clever group could review the biotech containment
levels and adapt them to nanotechnology fairly easily.

In my mind, you have to divide the problem into wet biotech & hard nanotech.
We do now release into the environment autonomous replicators that we
have patched in various ways.  The interesting thing is that these
have precious little in the way of ECC or failsafe mechanisms.
What is going to be interesting is that our ability to create highly
complex organisms from the ground up is going to advance by leaps
and bounds in the near future.  It is doubtful whether we can predict
all of the consequences of the release of such organisms and so we
need to be thinking hard about preventing self-replication, adding ECC
and failsafes.  [I've got some ideas about this but I can't discuss
them.]

Now, with hard nanotech, things are simpler, since there isn't a
"huge" incentive to release *mutating* replicators.  I've got no problem
with releasing self-replicating solar-cell constructors because they
only have a solar cell construction "system" and can reliably copy it.
You design in ECC and failsafes and you can get reliability out to
any desired level.  The only "catch" comes in when the programs are
*so* complex that they have wierd "glitches" as current software
systems do.  If our software engineering abilities and program
prooving abilities continue to advance, I would hope that these
problems can be minimized.

Designing self-contained  highly "intelligent", reliable nanotech offensive
weapons that can tolerate macroscale defenses *will NOT* be easy.  First
they are going to be radiation senstive.  A shielded directional radiation
emitter makes a good defensive weapon.  Second, they have limited current
capacities.  You put a nanocockroach between the ends of a 120V 20A
circuit and it better be a good insulator otherwise its "poof".
The same could be said for high intensity micro-torches (exceeds
heat capacity of the nanobots) and/or diamond studded gestapo boots
(exceeds pressure capacity of the nanocockroaches).

Add this to our ability to starve the nanobots (energy or material-wise)
and I think the picture is not so grim.  To every "defence" against
an "offence" there is a counter-offence, but designing these things
*will* take time.  As I've said before, it all comes down to designs
and unless someone cracks the design problem in a way that is much
further along the exponential curve, I would expect defense to balance
offense (or accidents) fairly well.

Hi Bryon,

You wrote,
>What makes you think there's a difference between these two
>things?

Please excuse me butting in here (but), perhaps | what-we-ought-to-do | and |
what-we-can-do | belong in different categories because, although we ought to do
everything we can do to augment, expand, increase, improve, and intensify life,
the very idea of doing so implies that some things diminish, devalue,
disintegrate, destroy, and demean life. So, we ought to do the former, while not
doing the latter, because doing the latter will (eventually, inevitably)
preclude us doing anything more.

Partial explanation: Don't do things that prevent doing more things (because
doing so removes the possibility of learning more about what we ought to do,
which may comprise a special set of things to do, or not to do). "Cultural
Studies" forms an intricate facade behind which to go back to sleep and stop
considering the ongoing spectacle of complex evolution that science continues to
uncover (and technology continues to accelerate).

Ah, but do we "judge" things as "good/bad" or do we respond from a visceral and
biological and genetic basis to elements of our environment? Perhaps we ought to
consider (or stop denying) the biological/genetic basis of value judgments.

"becomes" mutable? When did nature ever display anything other than mutability?
Evolution, especially societal evolution, _requires_ mutability. But the
pervasiveness of natural mutability does not necessitate a denial of objective
science, as "Cultural Studies" would like to persuade everyone.

Explicating why sentience (or super-sentience) represents a fundamental value
does not pose a problem if we take a moment to look into it. It represents a
fundamental value because it answers questions -- even questions such as this
one -- and therefore, and thereby, validates itself. Scientifically, we can
observe this fact in our own consciousness: the value of sentience resides in
its ability to inform us of value. Circular? Perfectly.

Explicating why extending and amplifying our (accurate and relevant) sentience
constitutes a fundamental value to a non-carbon-based entity may present a real
challenge. When the opportunity presents itself, I'd like to have a go at it
(for the betterment of science and the ascension of life, as well as for the
challenge).

Cheers,

The scientific study of culture sounds feasible.
Science tells us we _can_ study culture, but it doesn't tell if we ought to
(right Greg?).
IMO, no government, agency, or political group would stand to benefit from a
truly scientific study of culture, because such a study would obliterate the
validity of political denominations, since politics depends on disagreement as
to forms of governance (which unbiased science would resolve).

Sokal's (probably repeatable) experiment shows that scientific study of culture
does not currently exist. His experiment further illustrates that if scientists
ever decide to study culture scientifically, they ought to call it something
other than "Cultural Studies" since that term refers to a body of work separate
and discrete from science.

Yes, indeed, we just haven't finalized the question of whether to act according
to enlightened self-interest because we can, or because we ought to. If we do it
because we can, our work may never get done (so much to do, so little time). If
we do it because we ought to, we may never do anything at all, because we may
find that doing nothing best suits our enlightened self-interest (sitting
quietly, doing nothing, enlightenment comes, and questions evaporate by
themselves).

So you won'y throw out the useful baby with the bullshit bathwater, 
I suggest reading COMPLEXITY AND POSTMODERNISM by Paul 
Cilliers, where he maintains that postmodern techniques, which 
allow us to more coherently linguistically grasp and represent 
systems comprised of a multiplicity of differentially weighted 
distinguishable but inseparable factors interrelating in dynamically 
recursive ways, lend themselves naturally to the task of verbally 
describing/explaining complex systems.

Y'know, even if you accept that some postmodern techniques have value, it's 
hard to tell whether that particular statement is baby or bathwater :-)

If that's basically a quote I think I'll wait for the abridged version.

    i was under that distinct impression. if anyone endorses an alternative

I would hope, rather, that the group recommended *pro*scription of flirty
nano.

Or do you mean something like `carefully delineated protocols prescribing
how such releases might be circumscribed'?

                     Excellent and lucid explanation of basic complexity 
concepts 
                     Prof. Cilliers's elucidation of the key elements of 
complexity theory is not only informative but fascinating reading. 
He has taken two
                     subjects (complexity and post-modernism), each of 
which can be frustrating and confusing to the average reader, 
clearly explained
                     them, and then convincingly related them to each 
other. By describing each of these subjects in the context of the 
other (in true
                     post-structural style), Prof. Cilliers makes each of 
them more understandable. Highly recommended! --This text refers

are inappropriate and indeed do an unjustice to humanity when 
placed in today's
                     complex world - and Cillers clearly identifies why 
this is so. Bravo.More! More!

                     the book presents to the reader. It is very well 
thought out, cogent and I would recommend it to anyone who is

                     cross-disciplined approaches to understanding 
concepts. I appreciate the process oriented nature of his thesis

even to the general reader. --This text refers to the hardcover

Cilliers outlines the

Actually, we looked into the history of the P1-4 containment regime pretty 
closely before our meeting - both how the original Asilomar Conference came 
to be and its aftermath.  The P 1-4 regime is a matter of regulatory law in 
that it is now known as the "NIH Guidelines" and have been adopted by the US 
military and the equivalent agencies of a number of other countries.  
However, you're right that reputation tends to be the strongest factor in 
spreading and maintaining the bio-containment guidelines' force and effect.

We're hoping that a similar process can be recapitulated with nanowork.

I suggest you talk with Ralph Merkle about this - he's thought about it a lot 
in terms of "hard" nano and some of the approaches he's thought of seem to be 
applicable to biostuff, as well.

Actually, I've been convinced that weapons far short of smart Grey Goo can be 
made with first-generation assemblers.  In fact, the "smart dust" that's 
being played with now that has minimal MEMS capabilities may be able to do 
some of the nasty things I've seen explained.  I'll give you a hint: All it 
has to do is be made (or replicate) in VERY large numbers, be light enough to 
be airborne and CHANGE COLORS.

BTW -- when will you be back in the States?

Here's a bothersome point that I was reminded of on reading Greg Egan's
novel _Diaspora_ (though I'm sure it's been a nano-concern all along),
namely the danger of a deliberate, exponential, military buildup. In the
_Diaspora_ novel, the transhuman societies somehow maintain what they
think of as a wisely nonexponential or nonexpansive security
arrangement, where they leave enormous tracts of natural resources
completely untouched. This despite the fact that they could very readily
get into colonial competition for settling those resources -- or for
using them to build an overwhelming force of arms. No fighting over the
resources of asteroid Ceres for them, their Coalition has voting Ceres a
mineral preserve, or something, and that is that!

In reality, it isn't at all obvious how to nonviolently settle
sovereignty claims over newly accessed resources, or what sort of
beaurocracy one should trust with administering any nature preserves, or
Neutral Zones. Also, if there are sovereign states that you don't trust,
how do you know what kind of offense they may be developing under cover,
on their own turf? For instance, I don't know, myself, that recent
bombings of Iraq have done anything effective to control hidden
bioweapons, so what if we were dealing with a nanofactory driven arms
race instead? Seemingly, if two sides get into an exponential arms race,
this is a recipe not only for fighting over space resources, but also
for converting the Earth's surface into a shell of nanoweapons. Or, have
I missed something here, something about "exponential rate of capital
increase" that I don't understand?

Seems like I'm having a logical pessimism attack, here, or something.
First, space settlements seem problematic, at least in the "pre-matter
compiler era". Now, it's far from apparent how to avoid getting swamped
in a fast buildup of weapons, even if you try to class some weapons as
"defensive" in character! Basically, we need the Coalition of Polises to
come around and just bomb the heck out of anyone who violates the
Neutral Zone conventions -- say, maybe it's not that hard a problem, if

I'm more familiar with the debates that raged through Cambridge, MA and NYC
and they weren't as calm or rational as some of the West Coast discussions.

I did some research last night and it turns out the language & policies has
been adopted by the WHO and is creeping into the Bio-Weapons treaty ammendments.

Yep, at ASG we never once had a city or state official show up and
want to review our lab techniques (though we were at P2 level or less).

The large numbers part will be tricky since that really requires a
very big factory or self replication.  MEMS could go in the self-replication
direction but it would require a lot of engineering.  Obviously a
flying cloud of MEMS-bots could make visual surveillance from space pretty
worthless.  You would have to fly in insect-bots (that are being
worked on), and radio or fly out the information.  Well have that
type of surveillance anyway because it works much better in places
where there are forrests or caves.  As you have pointed out there
is a big difference between a military action in the Person Gulf
and one in Vietnam or Yugoslavia or Afganastan.  The needs will
drive the development.  So we will have to cross these bridges
anyway since defense budgets are large enough to support factories
with high production rates in lieu of actual self-replication.

What will be interesting is to see how quickly the rest of the world
picks up on this, since IMO, the U.S. has a very big MEMS lead (much
greater than say biotech) over most other countries.  What most people
do not see is the probability for the big leap in MEMS I think will
come -- it is much easier to retrofit old semiconductor fabs for MEMS
production than it is to retrofit them for the next generation semiconductor
production.  Now the interesting thing is that that means that it will
be mostly the U.S. and Taiwan, Malaysia, Korea and perhaps Japan that
will be the MEMS production leaders.

There is a declining Return on Investment as you get bigger because you
have increased communications delays and power costs.  Until we adopt
fundamentally different time scales for entertaining "thoughts" (weeks
or months) it may not make sense to utilize all of the natural resources.
(Sure you can turn all of the asteroids into VR simulations of "you",
but what good does that do "you"?!?  We still haven't resolved the
question of whether, assuming you "own" the asteroids whether you
can pull the plug on them when you enter your artistic stage and
want to devote them to some other use...)

The two main motivating forces I see for colonialism were:
 a) a desire for freedom -- but in a personal VR, you have the
    "ultimate" freedom.
 b) the quest for "rare" natural resources (e.g.  gold, silver,
    spices, etc.) -- these aren't "rare" in a nanotech environment.
    Biotech makes all the "spices" you want, and "gold" (e.g.
    carbon) is relatively abundant but you have a problem of
    getting the carbon to where the energy is or the energy to
    where the carbon is.  [Mass transport from the Oort cloud
    to the inner solar system is time consuming and may waste
    mass resources.  Energy beamed from the inner solar system
    to the Oort cloud is going to take time because you have
    beam dispersal and have to grow large receiving antennas.

> or for using them to build an overwhelming force of arms.

In a nanotech environment, the concept of an "overwhelming"
force of arms is very questionable.  You have to guarantee
that you have disassembled *every* last little bit of nanotech
in an enclave that can have berserker potential.

If you presume that we can be as "rational" as possible, then
it makes sense to cooperate (game theory says this is most
efficient).  We have to allocate resources in an ever
diminishing ROI situation, there will only be a few logical
paths to pursue.  What will be the "gold" is clever designs
that can provide the most efficient "thought" using the smallest
resource increments -- energy, matter or space.  Probably
"consortiums" pool resources to develop those on varying
time scales (decades, millennia, gigayears, etc.)

> In reality, it isn't at all obvious how to nonviolently settle
> sovereignty claims over newly accessed resources,

There are two obvious possibilities:
  a) First to claim it gets it.
  b) First to have a plan to optimally use it gets it.

The "claiming" of North America & Africa or the exploration of
the Pacific islands provide a good basis for (a), and the
American farm & railroad land grants provide a good basis
for (b).

You don't but a sovereign state can't "nano-nuke" another state
if it potentially has hidden berserkers or strong allies.  You
only get to be "untrustable" once, unless enclaves/sub-entities
evolve to the point where they have no survival instinct at all.

Yep, it makes the cold war look simple.  In those cases the
"intelligence" groups could roughly estimate what was being done.
In a nanotech environment that is hard unless you have complete
"openness".  Since nano-surveillance is cheap & semi-intelligent
one would argue that those who are trustable are those who let
you observe everything.  The question is does the clever
"dispersed" development & assembly approach that I've mentioned,
work around universal surveilance?

> Seemingly, if two sides get into an exponential arms race,

Why should you fight over resources if there is so much resources
that you can simply go claim something "unclaimed".  When you
get to the point where you are claiming "big" stuff or "distant"
stuff where the costs of turning it into something "usable"
are expensive anyway, it makes more sense to divide up the
risks and benefits among as many parties as possible.  It
depends a lot on whether you think (a) an individual; (b)
an economic consortium; or (c) a political entity is going
to lay claim to Jupiter or Saturn.

> Or, have I missed something here, something about "exponential rate of

No, you understand it -- the physical stuff increases exponentially
but that doesn't mean that "efficient" designs do or your ability
to use it effectively does.  If I put one grain of rice on your
front lawn tomorrow, and two the next day and 4 the day after
that you are going to have a *big* problem figuring out what
to do with the rice somewhere after the 25th day.

Claim: The Resource Base grows so much faster than the population
that there is no incentive to fight over the resources until
uploads or AI arrives.

I don't need the surface of a planet covered in berserker bots
to feel safe, I only need a few hundred of them scattered in very
different locations.  Or you simply need strong allies.

Well, say you are one of the powers -- what constitutes a good
development plan for the available resources and what constitutes
a bad development plan (worthy of bombing if you violate the
neutral/nature/zoo zone)?  I.e., how do you "consciously" decide that
the proposed development is a good allocation of the resources?

Perfect !  I love it !  There you have it, the much-sought-after 
scientifically-based ''value system'' all expressed in a single statement.  In 
my opinion, the statement ''best = the most successful'' is identical to 
''increasing of extropy'', and also identical to ''non-moral'' (meaning that 
morality is *irrelevant* to it).  Morality is a waste of time.

Then there is the question _why_ you would want to build
an overwhelming force...

If you have a number (say 20) of economically equal
consortiums rivalling with each other, they'll all do
what they can to keep their part of the pool.

This includes making sure that the others play by the
rules and that no consortium grows too strong. Since
every one of those consortiums will usually have 19
others opposing it when it doesn't play by the rules,
there's a pretty good incentive to play it safe.

A feudal system like the one in the Dune books also
seems like a good candidate for a semi-stable government
system. When light speed becomes a barrier in the speed
decisions are taken, the current system of decisions-by-
instant-information won't work any more.

We need a system that will keep on going, even when the
individual consortiums are in fierce competition and
unable to quickly exchange information with each other.

If FTL travel will ever become possible, we might even
end up with the situation where a weekly postage shipment
will be faster than radio transmissions. Just think about
what that would do to our current information age thinking!

The ideal goverment system would be strong enough to keep
going independantly of the will of the players.

War is already economically unfeasible. It's been a few
hundred years since we last had a war where the winner
also came out with an economical benefit.

As more and more countries are converted to market
economies and the fundamentalists can no longer compete
(economics will always defeat idealism) wars will cease
to be commonplace.

With wars, we have more and more to lose and less and less
to gain. Currently this is because the information age has
caused our economies to become very much interlocked with
each other.

In the far future, when/if the light speed becomes a barrier
to instant communications and the exchange of information like
we have now, wars will be economically unfeasible because the
various parties involved will all be so distant from each other
that the agressor will automatically lose its reputation with
the others and will be faced with distrust from the others.

Also, such a spread out mankind will make it impossible to form
superpowers. That is because the communications delay inside
such an empire will be too large to have every subpower in such
a coalition react as one or even have them have the same opinion
on things.

Coalitions like that have failed to do that even during the cold
war; the Romans and Gengiz Kahn (sp) have shown us that the
maximum feasible communications delay between different parts of
an empire is about one week, with the time to military intervention
in those remote areas having a maximum of about 4 times that.

Nanotech could make the restrictions even stricter, with the time
to react being shorter, the gains to be smaller and the risks
becoming so large that nobody in his/her right mind would ever
risk fighting a war.

The threat of nuclear mutual annihalation was enough to stop us
from beginning a third world war. I believe that with nanotech
the balance will tip even more into the risk-avoidance zone.

Indeed. When a cup full of nanites could be enough to destroy
a major part of a civilisation, who will be taking that risk?

Every consortium should have diplomats stationed at the others,
each having a bunch of bezerker nanites with them, to be unleashed
when the civilisation they are stationed has crossed the limit.

Could the threat of mutually assured destruction be any stronger
than this?

A good plan doesn't waste resources (in the eyes of the others)
and doesn't threaten the others. As soon as one consortium starts
implementing a plan that endangers the others or is too wasteful
with resources (again, in the eyes of the others), it will be
curbed.

Couldn't we just fix the problem instead?  I mean, come on, the navy doesn't
even bother with air conditioning on most vessels - I doubt they have ever
worried much about something as 'nonessential' as odor control.  You'd think
a good air sanitizer would be fairly easy to build with modern biotech and
filtration techniques, let alone those of 2005-2010.  Surely by 2010-2015 it
won't be all that expensive a problem to fix?

Representative Bob Barr Demands a Report on "Project Echelon"
The following is a release from Rep. Barr's office:

BARR MOVES TO EXPOSE "PROJECT ECHELON"
HOUSE ACTS TO REQUIRE SURVEILLANCE REPORT

        WASHINGTON, DC -- According to reports to the European
Parliament and others, a multi-national system known as Project Echelon
intercepts phone calls, faxes, e-mails, and radio transmissions from
around the world.  Some two million such communications per hour are
reportedly intercepted.  This information is then reportedly routed to
intelligence agencies, which search it for particular information of
interest.

        Under language Barr added to the Foreign Intelligence
Authorization Act for FY 2000, adopted today by the full House, the
National Security Agency (NSA) which manages Project Echelon, the CIA
and the Department of Justice, will have 60 days to report to Congress
on the legal standards they use on communications intercepts involving
American citizens.

        "If American intelligence agencies are intercepting, receiving
or distributing communications involving our citizens without court
orders, or legal authority, they are doing so outside the bounds of the
Constitution.  If Project Echelon exists as reported, all Americans who
care about the integrity of our Constitution should be concerned,"
declared Barr.

        "Everyone who places a high value on our right to privacy should
be encouraged the House of Representatives has today taken the first
step toward requiring the Intelligence Community to prove adequate
procedures are in place to protect that right," said Barr.

        "I strongly encourage the Intelligence Community to prepare this
report using unclassified material whenever possible.  As more and more
Americans become concerned about threats to their privacy, the
reassurances only a public report can provide are essential.  Our
intelligence agencies need public support to do their jobs effectively,
and this amendment provides an important opportunity for them to boost
that support by answering our questions honestly," Barr concluded.

        Barr, a former CIA official and United States Attorney, serves
on the House Judiciary and Government Reform Committees.  Government
Reform Chairman Dan Burton has also committed to hold hearings on this
matter.

It's mostly an argument against the nano-Santa Claus viewpoint, which few of
us support in the first place.  Those of us who expect the nanotech
revolution to look more like the computer revolution (i.e. fast exponential
improvements, but not an instant achievement of Nirvana) find nothing at all
persuasive there.

There was some argument about this on the list about a year ago, which you
may be able to find in the archives.  I'd also suggest viewing the
geniebusters site through http://www.critlink.org, since several people have
posted commentary on it using CritLink.

No, you haven't missed anything.  Nanotechnology makes it almost impossible
for multiple sovereign powers to coexist on a single planet, because they
will tend to find themselves forced into an exponential arms race that
converts the entire mass of the planet into industry and weaponry.  The fact
that there is no room to deploy effective defenses against many high-tech
weapons makes the problem even worse.

Spreading into space, and especially interstellar space, makes the problem a
bit more manageable.  Defense becomes easier, the cost of exploiting
resources rises, and in general the potential for a secret military buildup
becomes much less destabilizing.  That could give you a situation where
peace has a reasonable chance of prevailing.

>From Rocketeers to Solar Sailors 

At the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Scientists Are Building Robots to 
Explore the Solar System -- and Even Making Plans to Sail to the Stars

To quote in part:

"On a sweltering summer day this year, a small team of scientists attempts 
the unimaginable: Working among the 150 structures on JPL's 156-acre home 
in La Canada-Flintridge, they are dreaming of a voyage to the nearest star,
Alpha Centauri, a journey that would take the most advanced existing
spacecraft 
tens of thousands of years. The JPL team hopes to design a vehicle to fly at 
one-tenth the speed of light, cutting travel time to less than 40 years. If
such a journey seems unfathomable, consider this: These scientists and
engineers 
are devoting their careers to a mission that won't fly until long after they 
are dead. 

It's like the 15th century explorers who set out for the Americas, for
Africa, 
says Dr. Charles Elachi, the ebullient but low-key Lebanese-born scientist
who 
heads JPL's Space and Earth Science Programs. They didn't know, step by step, 
how they would explore new continents, he says, but they had the confidence 
that they would figure out ways to overcome the hurdles.

Why? We've all seen that in the cold war there were 'enough'
weapons to ensure mutual destruction. With nanotech that point
will be reached much earlier and the 'enough' will be even
more extreme. After that there shouldn't be any incentive to
build more weapons (since there's no need for more).

No, this makes the problem a lot less problematic. When the
superpowers can ensure mutual destruction using just 1% of
their production power, there's no need at all to use the
rest for military too.

It could be quite an improvement over the 30% needed during
the last cold war...

In fairness though we do have many people here and in nanotech circles
who expect a much faster transformation.  See Eliezer's recent posts about
his Singularity Institute, for example.  So it is quite appropriate for
critics such as Lyle to address such claims.

A correction, the URL is http://crit.org.  You can get to Geniebusters via
Crit directly via http://crit.org/http://www.geniebusters.org.  I agree
that this is a useful way to access the site, although I suspect that
the author is unaware of these annotations and hence not in a position
to respond.

I submitted the following letter to the editor:

	Anthropocentrism without humans?

	Anything that softens up people's inability to think that the future
may be very different from the present is surely a good thing. Systematic
scientific and technological progress, a mere few hundred years old, has
already changed the world in radical ways. There can be little doubt that
the human organism too will sooner or later be dramatically changed, or
rendered obsolete through artificial life forms. Yet Sterling's picture is
still much too nave, and the posthumans he describes are unrealistically
anthropomorphic. Once there are artificial intellects that are as smart as
humans then it won't be long before they are much smarter (or at least much
faster). Even replacing parts of the human brain with some high-tech "gel"
will not get you that far if you are competing with entities whose
computational structures are not limited in that way. To avoid becoming
obsolete, you will probably have to leave the human body behind altogether,
and conceive of yourself as software that can run on any sufficiently
powerful processor.

	Software can copy itself in a fraction of a second. With
reproduction so swift, computational resources (the "Lebensraum" of these
uploaded beings) soon become scarce. Evolution theory predicts that the
posthuman world will soon be dominated by life forms that have cast away all
human rudiments not contributing to reproductive success in a fitness
landscape which presumably looks very different from the environment where
Homo Sapiens evolved. It would be surprising if the outcome were anywhere
near as anthropomorphic as Stirling's article suggests.

Hello everyone,

I went to see "Pokemon, the first movie" with a date and her bestfriend's 
five year-old and found to my surprise that I enjoyed it.  The film would 
make for good conversation between youngsters and their extropian parents 
considering some of the story concepts.

It starts out with a genetically engineered super pokemon awakening in a 
secret island lab.  It feels emotional turmoil at wanting to know it's 
purpose for living and lashes out by destroying the lab when it realizes it 
is meant to serve humans.  The story switches between "cute sequences" and a 
darker tone that is seen in more mature anime.

The film explored on a surprisingly deep level for what it was the possible 
effect of a superior genetically engineered being coming of age in our 
world.  After some major clashes this being has a moral awakening and has a 
change of heart.

Ash, the hero of the story, displays dynamic optimism in his approach to 
dealing with things.  He refuses to give up in stopping the protagonist no 
matter what the odds.  And he treats his pokemon with respect and love.

Of course I would have never seen the film if not that my date and her 
little friend wanted to see it.  You all believe me don't you? :)


sincerely,

John Grigg

It would not resolve the disagreements in values - if you like blue
and I like green, which color do we paint the building in? We have to
do politics to resolve that dispute, be it a compromise or something
else.

Again, if it's going to be functioning in space, with a closed
boundary, with living organisms in it, then it *is* a complete
ecosystem. The question is not whether or not you need a
complete ecosystem, the question is whether the ecosystem you
construct will flourish or die.

The system you describe, a closed system with just a few
species, has actually been attempted in early closure
experiments. It proved, empirically, unstable. So I don't know
why you feel that we already know how to do this when past
attempts to do so have failed.

Perhaps you should familiarize yourself with the history of the
research. The early closures all *failed* at some point and had
to be opened. The current complex approach which you dismiss
developed in response to an exploration of those failures and
successful attempts to remedy them.

You are welcome to go into space with just a few species and die
after six months or so, but I have other plans.

Right spot on, precisely so, yes indeed, because science can tell us what we can
do, and biological cues tell us what we ought to do. Combining the "what" with
the "why" (and, btw, thanks to everyone who contributed input from both
directions), provides a solid basis from which to make policy decisions. The
time has come to replace moralism ("Cultural Studies" arrogates the
postmodernist subset of that dreary subject) with scientific decision making
based on real life needs.

Gee whiz, I'd like to see a report on it too. I mean, if it doesn't take too
much time.
(You know how long, verbose, and padded those reports tend to get.)

Okay, forget the report. This paragraph has convinced me: I want a Project
Echelon for my own personal use!
It sounds better than collaborative filtering and individual news filtering
combined.
Microsoft should include Project Echelon-Express with Windows 2002.

Leave it to the decision making authority/architect.
Non-politicians decide what colors to paint buildings everyday.
Authority belongs to the one who best answers those who question authority.

Yes, but if you work away from the "light of day" you slow down
the process of diffusion of innovation. Many labs will be
reinventing wheels unnecessarily. I don't know why you want to
slow down the process with secrecy. There is a *reason* why
publication is recognized as a fundamental part of the process
of scientific research.

If you slow research down, people will die unnecessarily as a
result. I can't countenance that, myself.

I don't think the basis of this fear is Gray Goo at all (which
would indeed be irrational).  I think the basis of this fear is
the emergence of biotech and nanotech warfare, the destructive
potential of which (for conventional biota such as we currently
still are) dwarfs the destructive potential of nuclear warfare at
present. Genetically engineered plagues are not very difficult to
make compared to making, say, a serotonin-knockout strain of mice
for neuroscience research (we already have ten or so such strains).
Botulin toxin can be produced easily by biotech, dissolved into a
DMSO vapor, and dispersed by a variety of means. Etc, etc, etc.
Rather than to Gray Goo, I might refer to Nick Szabo's essay on
Green Goo.

I do not see any mention by you of means by which you will
prevent the emergence of the two situations that you admit would
give us cause for concern.  Amoral intelligences already exist
in plenty, and will start enhancing themselves in short order if
they have not already. And there are people whose posthumanism
extends as far as antihumanism... such people may already be
engaged in fast self-evolution research.

I see zero economic pressure for the development of such technology.

I'm still not convinced that effective in silico simulations of
ontogenesis can be done without atomic-level detail, and that is
a pretty tall order. Handling dead babies on a regular basis is
just plain bad for human beings psychologically, so I don't plan
to do any of that.

	Having spent six years in the US Navy's surface fleet I can and do
assure you the US Navy considers air conditioning _very_ important. Its
first value is cooling high-powered electronics. Compartments containing
radar sets and communications equipment are generally colder than any
other place aboard except refrigerators. Air conditioning's second value
is crew comfort. If you lived with fifty other people in a space little
larger than a two bedroom apartment, the only way to combat odor is air
conditioning. Finally, an all-metal ship absorbs a good deal of heat.
Without air conditioning, the structure becomes dangerously warm and
people inside it for extended periods risk heat exhuastion.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                         November 15, 1999 
 
WATCH RARE PASSAGE OF MERCURY BEFORE THE SUN ON WEB TODAY
      
     Today, a rare astronomical phenomenon occurs when Mercury 
passes directly between the Earth and the Sun for the final time 
this century. This particular Mercury transit will be of a 
particular type that has not occurred since the invention of the 
telescope, and is not expected again at least through the 23rd 
century. 

     An important reminder -- do not attempt to view the Mercury 
transit with the naked eye or with a telescope or binoculars. The 
Sun can cause severe eye damage and even blindness. Telescope 
images of the event from JPL will be fed live on the Internet at 
http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/mercurytransit today between about 1 to 
2:15 p.m. Pacific time (4 to 5:15 Eastern). 

     Mercury will graze just inside the Sun's disk for less than 
an hour between 1:11 p.m. and 2:10 p.m. as seen from Los Angeles. 

     Mercury, the planet closest to the Sun, passes Earth every 
116 days. But because Mercury's orbit is tilted seven degrees 
relative to Earth's orbit, only about one in 23 of Mercury's 
passages between the Sun and Earth results in a transit.  The 
most recent Mercury transits occurred in 1970, 1973, 1986 and 
1993, but they were not visible in Los Angeles.  After the 
November 15 transit, the next one visible from Los Angeles will 
take place on November 8, 2006.
 
     NASA's Telescopes in Education project, managed by JPL, is 
sponsoring telescope coverage of the event. JPL is managed for 
NASA by the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, Calif.

Thank you, Geoff, for bringing this to fascinating
site to my attention. Before now, I've never seen a
*good* critique of "Engines of Creation". Now I have. 

Like you, I have reservations about a sentence here
and there, but overall Lyle Burkhead's article
"Nanotechnology without Genies" is well-reasoned.

His overall point reminds me of what has happened so
far with nuclear energy and it's original promise of
"energy too cheap to meter". The promise was based on
the simple physical fact that the energy levels
producable with nuclear reactions are orders of
magnitude greater than with chemical reactions.
However, when we actually went about constructing
nuclear energy plants, we found we needed to staff
them with so many well-trained people and include
layer-upon-layer of safeguards (not to mention the
costs of continually assuring the public that it was
safe) that, ultimately, the energy produced costed
more than that produced by coal-burning plants (which
is a shame, since burning coal is so much more dirty,
provided the nuclear plant is a good one that is run
right.)

His overall point ALSO reminds me of the so-called
"productivity paradox" associated with
computerization, and certain total-cost-of-ownership
arguments about PCs.

Plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose???

I agree on all points.  An insurance policy is wise, though.  

I want to see the day when this planet is turned back into the park it once was,
and we live in an even better place.  Then we watch to see which creature next
develops sentience and spikes.  The post-spike party would be something to see.
It would be hard not to intervene in the development of a species.
And that makes me wonder how many times other civilizations have developed on
this planet.  It's possible.

I thought it was the CO2 that the concrete stole.  Made a carbonate of it.

Does anyone know if the Biosphere 2 folks fixed this problem and re-closed the
Biosphere?  There was talk of painting the concrete...

frontier.

About the series

On the eve of a new era in space, as humans ponder colonizing other
worlds, when new planets are being discovered, and while hope is high 
that life exists elsewhere, we asked five people who know about the 
final frontier to share their visions for the future of space 
exploration and discovery.

I've answered my own previous question on the Biosphere 2 problem:

Excessively high organic content in the soil resulted in high CO2 production
and high O2 consumption.  CO2 was adsorbed by the concrete, and plants did
not make up the O2 loss.

URL for Biosphere2: http://www.bio2.edu/

Current research focuses on experiments on CO2 and various ecosystems.  It
always seems that the best scientific experiments are the failures, which get
recycled into new experiments.

Sorry to take up the extra space with my last post.

Hello - is anyone here going to be at Capricon?  (Chicago, January 27-30.)
The theme of the con is "Armageddon", so, what with being one of the
planetary experts on the subject and all, I finally gave in and decided
to try my hand at SF convention panels.  Now I'm trying to gather
panelists. 

The panels are:
"Nanotechnological warfare:  Apocalypse in real life." and
"The transhuman Singularity:  The rise of greater-than-human intelligence."

If you're going to Capricon and you think you'd like to talk about
either or both of humanity's available options, please contact me.

Info on Capricon is at http://www.capricon.org

On the contrary - Lyle has already posted meta-commentary there.

In a spacecraft one is *severely* weight limited.  With nanotech it would
be possible to solve the problem, but without it, it is not clear to me
how one would avoid the problem of organics condensing on the cold
walls of the craft and then vaporizing when they were in the sun.  spike

Thank you for trying  :-)

There must be some temporary problem.
Recently, the server was attacked by some religious hackers who
wanted to fight the "Devil worshipers".   Hope, not again.

I don't have any time for my website lately.
Would be nice to do some collective work on it.
Anybody interested?

But I've been attending the local twelve step Pokemon addiction support

Okay, this looks like a job for a Luciferian.
Anti-luciferians nuked the luciferian domain, so they should strike back with
devilish diligence.

When the luciferians get the domain repaired, how would you like to upgrade your
site? More content? What kind?

OK, check me if I'm wrong, but isn't this a bit like asking why any
group of people or any society would tend to expand based on accessible
resources? For one thing, there is a reproductive, or evolutionary
selection pressure in favor of those who both want to, and are
successful at, expanding. This may sound like circular logic, but that's
evolution for you! We should generally tend to see the success stories
of differential selection, rather than the ones that got left behind in
the race.

To this you should add 

c) the desire for power, whether over other people or over the material
world in general

d) the desire to become influential in the sense of adding to the
success of the ideas, thoughts, or lifestyles that one values the most

e) the inadvertent, or preconscious tendency that humans share with
other living things, to create a certain "influence on history" for
those who happen to be evolutionarily successful

Note that "colonial" is often used to refer to the 19th century West's
empire building and global resource mining. IMO, the term could also be
appropriately used for any particularly intense modern competition over
disputed resources, especially if the resources are newly accessed, like
space resources or ocean resources. What occurs to me is that maybe it's
just politically incorrect to refer to current or future
territory/resource races as "colonial". A better term would be --?
Anyway, following my concern that future societies could get into
"colonial competition for settling resources", I also mentioned that new
resources might be employed by one side for "building an overwhelming
force of arms".

Well, by that reasoning we had better watch out that the representative
factions from every past war don't find some opportunity to poison our
breakfast cereal tomorrow morning! Seriously, in the relatively long run
scenarios that we are discussing here, active shield systems,
nanomedical upgrades, normal security arrangements, etc., are all
supposed to help prevent us from being anonymously murdered by some
random little bit of nanotech that someone hid away.

Where I think Robert Bradbury perhaps begins to answer my earlier
concern about exponential arms races is when he says:

It may well be true that even a fairly advanced, replicable nanofactory
setup would have some definite limits in terms of what sheer volume of
manufactured weaponry would anyone find manageable or maintainable.

Also:

Ah, now we've got the whole exponential growth problem back again! Say
that our nanofactory building power seekers have their setup programmed
with sophisticated AI? Or, say that the nano-system software upgrades
itself so reliably that it might as well be a strong AI system in terms
of the control that it gives its builders? This won't happen tomorrow,
but it *may* happen as an outgrowth of true nanofactories, on the other
side of the Nano-Singularity, as it were. Same result if the builders
are keen on upload production in the name of pioneering a transhuman
society, such a society might well hit a biosphere killing exponential
growth curve.

In opposition to the concern that anyone would engage in an exponential
arms race, Rik van Riel wrote:

As I recall, there was a lot of debate about how much was enough and
whether the other side might have a decisive *more*. Even in the absence
of AI, suppose we'd had quite capable nanofactories during the Cold War,
mightn't the mass of weapons have come out worse, maybe even *much*
worse?

Optimistically, I tend to think that a combination of "active shield"
defense systems plus a strong, world level offensive deterrent, *should*
be able to dissuade anyone from kicking into "hyper" nanoweapons
production. Notice, though, that this is potentially a real problem,
also, it doesn't seem particularly easy to decide just when a
"difficult" state should be hit with a deterrent. For instance, do you
wait until there is evidence that State X has produced one whole
mountain load of weapons, or do you wait for two whole mountain loads,
is the deterrent one of bombing, or of disabling their tech somehow, and
so forth? Certainly, it looks to me as though we can't afford to ignore
such problems, even if it's true that the very worst scenarios require
particularly advanced technologies! In sum, I just don't know, how *do*
we prevent nano arms races -- or is maybe just as well to let such races
run their course, until everyone involved pulls back from the brink,
exhausted?

The Leonid Meteor Shower will be returning this Wednesday 
and Thursday night.  The Leonids are one of the falling stars of the meteor
shower recurring annually in mid-November.

The Leonids are debris from comet Temple-Tuttle.  This year's
shower is expected to be heaviest since 1966 - heavy enough
that the Air Force is concerned about satellite damage from
electrostatic discharges (not from impact).

"Don't forget to look up after the moon sets at about 1AM EST. 
If you can get a clear dark sky you can see up to 1,500 shooting 
stars per hour." (Dr. Fiorella Terenze)

NASA is tracking them at http://www.leonidslive.com.

Cheers!

Actually, I would consider that politics. The architect will have to
balance the wishes of the neighbours, the owners of the building, his
own aesthetic views, costs and everything else; I would consider that
a (small) political decision. As I see it, politics is about making
decisions together with other people, acting in the public sphere.

A good heuristic.

Well, I suspect "good" is in the eye of the beholder.
I'd be much more comfortable with people who are actually
well versed in the various technologies required saying
what they view can or cannot be done.  The semiconductor
industry is littered with claims, by people *well versed*
in the technology, about "hitting the wall".  We haven't yet.
If the "experts" on a technology can't do a decent analysis,
I'd say non-experts are in a much worse position.

> Like you, I have reservations about a sentence here
> and there, but overall Lyle Burkhead's article
> "Nanotechnology without Genies" is well-reasoned.

I'll simply take the comments from his first page:

| 1. Nanotechnology is commensurable with other technologies.

Only in so far as other technologies are "designed".
Nanotechnology is the only technology that can assemble
nanotechnology factories that can assemble nanotechnology
devices.  Biotechnology is the only other similar technology
(and it really is a form of nanotechnology).  All other
technologies (say microelectronics), use *other* technologies
(say machining, grinding, element purification, crystal growth,
etc.) to enable the production of microelectronics.  For them
to be "commensurable", you can only discuss technologies which
are self-replicating.
 
| 2. Automated systems always exist in a larger context which
|    is not automated.

So what?  Ultimately we exist in an "unautomated" universe
(at least we believe that).  He is right, to some degree
that "they won't design themselves", they do have to be
bootstrapped.  But humans do *not* do molecular modeling,
the computers and the software to do the modeling have been
have been "enabled" by human designers.  It is now the case
that much of the work in microelectronics, drug design, etc.
is done by the computer with the human just checking the results.

| 3. Artificial intelligence is irrelevant.

Tell that to Boeing and look at their documented reduction
in engineering design time & reworks on the 777 (designed
entirely on the computer).  There isn't much "AI" in the
software systems they are using, but what there is makes a
difference.  This claim has no validity unless the "I"
under discussion is something radically different from what
most humans do.

| 4. Making things with atomic positioners will be at least
| as expensive as making them with biotechnology or bulk
| technology.

I don't simply disagree with this statement, it is clearly
wrong.  The cost of something depends on the cost of the
raw materials, the energy required for assembly and the
speed of assembly.  Nanotech & Biotech tend to be better
than bulk assembly because they use less raw materials than
bulk technology.  Biotech has a big advantage in terms of
"energy required for assembly" because nature has been making
the reactions cost efficient for millions of years.  Nanotech
will have to work hard to catch up but should win in the end
because biotech only harvests energy at the first level
at a 1% efficiency, while nanotech can push that to 30%+.
Nanotech wins big over biotech because you can have active
material transport rather than diffusion transport so it
assembles much faster providing a higher production rate.

All three technologies, nanotech, biotech & bulk tech have
to factor in design cost and amortize it over a production
run.  Low volume, high complexity parts will be expensive.
Because nanotech & biotech *may* have much greater complexity
(which is one of their advantages), they may have increased
design overhead.  But then what you are getting had better
be something that can't be produced by bulk tech (otherwise
there isn't much point to the exercise).  An example would
be mass produced intelli-Al2O3-bricks that can assemble
themselves into a building.  Stronger, so you need less
raw materials and since they are self-assembling (i.e. they
read the plan and stack themselves) you have taken much of
the labor cost out of a building.  Since you can amortize
the design over millions of buildings, even bulk stuff
designed from nanotech seems cheap in the big picture.

So, your fuel costs are lower.  These predictions were made
before the design costs and safety and waste disposal
overhead were taken into account.  The design costs are
particularly significant, since *because* of the high energies
involved, they have to provide robust safety margins.

You should read Freeman Dyson's commentaries on the nuclear
industry (in several of his older books).  Part of what killed
us was complex designs by multiple vendors.  The French got
it right by adopting a single standard design, mass producing
it and having an experienced construction & operating industry
that could work with that standard design.

It would be interesting to have comments by an economic
libertarian or even just a die hard capitalist as to when
competition fails due to the high costs of engineering
complex systems for which there is only a very small market.

As far as, the nuclear industry goes, I'm glad it did/is
failing.  I want to burn all the coal and natural gas we
possibly can.  The "threat" of global warming is going to
create allies between the "ecologists" and the nano-engineers
when we can offer a cheap solution for getting rid of all the
accumulated CO2. Its the CO2 in the atmosphere that provides
the *free* construction material for my future toys.

Rock on.

Robert

His overall point ALSO reminds me of the so-called
"productivity paradox" associated with
computerization, and certain total-cost-of-ownership
arguments about PCs.

** GENETIC FUTURE WILL BE CONSENSUAL, OR WON'T BE AT ALL
A recent report by the science and technology watchdog committee of the
French Parliament on the state of biotechnology in France and future
prospects focuses its advice to M.P.'s (deputies and senators) on how to
get France into the race and the French into the loop. The Serusclat report
begins with a catalog of the new technologies associated with genetic
study, therapy, and engineering, enthusiastically presenting what biology
will bring to the 21st century. The bulk of the text then goes on to
outline the initiatives that will need to be undertaken if the vision is
not to go awry. The number one concern for France manifested in the report
is not lack of gray cells but rather overly constrained brains; France does
not havether nearly enough of what will likely drive this brave new field:
innovative new bio-tech firms. Citing a potential $7 billion market in 10
years, the report urges taking steps to encourage
researcher-entrepreneurship in new firms and establish "biopoles" to boost
idea-flow. More basic even than innovation and transfer, in the view of the
report's authors, is the need for public information and debate on the
scientific, ethical and philosophical issues looming around biotechnology.
Some researchers fear a backlash when spectacular advances make headlines
prior to any discussion of the stakes. Others point to public fears
released by genetic modification of edible plants as a harbinger of
potential reactions against medical applications of genetic engineering
skills, up till now widely accepted in France. The report urges a series of
initiatives from science theme parks or "Genoscopes" to "DNA graduate
schools" for lawyers, police, politicians, and other decision-makers. The
thrust of the recommendations assumes that if French society is to get
fully behind a large-scale biotechnology program it will be because the
great questions posed by this new frontier-what will a human being be? To
what extent is human life inviolable, untouchable? What are the risks, and
gains, associated with various advances? -Have been confronted openly. The
report's authors also raise the potential danger of genetic discrimination
and other abuses associated with genetic testing as well as individual and
parental "rights not to know," and they express concern over the tendency
to perceive the human genome as a patent field. All in all, there will be
no bliss in ignorance here. (Le Figaro, November 4, p20, Catherine
Petitnicolas)

** MOBILE CELLS
French researchers have succeeded in reconstructing in vitro the mechanism
by which cells move about. The principal dynamic element is the protein
actin whose filaments extends in the direction of the movement and retract
behind the cell as it gets rolling. Learning how to trigger cell movement
artificially is giving biologists a better idea of how cells do it
naturally, which will presumably pay off in therapeutic advances. For
example it is well known that the listeriose bacteria infect human cells by
borrowing their actin wheels; the better they move the more virulent the
infection. As a result of cell mobility research the cell-wall molecules
implicated in bacterial movement and entry into cells can be recognized.
The team is also gaining insight into possible molecular strategies to be
taken against unchecked proliferation of malignant cells. (Le Figaro,
November 3, p14, Virginia Tournay)

** BIOMASS AND BIODIVERSITY: A POSITIVE SLOPE
In what has been billed as the largest experimental field study in the
history of the discipline of ecology, an EU funded program, Biodepth,
employed dozens of researchers from 1996-1998 to carry out a continent-wide
research project on the effects of plant diversity on total biomass
production. 480 plots of land, each 4 square meters, located in 8 sites
across Europe representing all of the European climates were sterilized of
all preceding growth and sown with one of 5 different seed mixes, ranging
from monoculture to a maximum of 32 plant varieties. Beginning with the
harvest of  1997, results were unambiguous; by weighing total biomass from
every plot, researchers found that cutting the number of varieties in half
led to a drop of 80 grams of biomass per square meter. Moreover, leaving
out one of 3 main families, legumes, grains, or grasses, led to a drop of
100 g/m2. Guesses as to why include complementary niches and/or
mutually-positive interactions among varieties. The team now wants funds to
explore another topic: whether and to what extent biodiversity can soften
the blows from the vagaries of  climate change such as drought, freezes,
too much water, extra nitrogen and other shocks to an ecosystem. In any
case, the conventional wisdom about the efficiency of monoculture in
farming has been shaken by the study's findings. It may well be that the
plant kingdom finds strength in numbers when absorbing the ravages of human
activity. One, of which, it turns out, is monoculture. (Le Monde, November
6, p26, Pierre Barthelemy)

** DON'T COUNT YOUR COMPLEX PROTEINS BEFORE THEY'RE HATCHED
About 11% of all pharmaceutical products sold worldwide contain complex
protein molecules, or a market of $11 billion. A startup in Nantes is the
only firm in Europe and one of the firsts in the world to be working on a
novel way of producing these molecules, by getting hens to do the work. The
technique, which is in a pre-production phase, consists of breeding hens to
lay eggs in which the desired proteins are present. It is based on
discoveries made by the joint CNRS/INRA/Ecole Normale Superieure-Lyons
Laboratory for Cellular Differentiation on how to extract totipotent bird
embryonic cells that can be cultivated for long periods of time. The lab
and its longtime industrial partner Grimaud spawned Vivalis to develop a
profit-making way of producing complex proteins for the pharmaceutical
industry, with a scientist from the lab taking over scientific control of
the new outfit. $5 million will be invested in Vivalis over 6 years,
refining technical and commercial aspects of the business, at which point
they expect to be breaking even. Cellular culture is the most common way to
grow simple proteins, but when it comes to recombined ones eggs have
several advantages; they are perfectly hygienic, and the method will cost a
fraction of what cellular culture costs. (L'Usine Nouvelle, November 4,
p59, Emmanuel Guimard)

** WHEN YOUR BANDAID BECOMES YOU
The birthplace of the bio-reabsorbable surgical screw, in case you are
asked, is the Artificial Biopolymer Research Center at Montpellier
University's School of Pharmacology. Developed as a better way to fasten
grafted ligaments together, the 7mm $250 screw is one of a number of
medical uses being dreamed up for synthesized biopolymers by the Center's
hybrid staff of  chemists, biologists, pharmacologists and others.
Bioreabsorbable materials are better than the older more well known
biodegradable objects since the latter require an enzymatic digestion and
therefore run the risk of triggering an immune system attack. Artificial
polymers, on the other hand, are biomaterials synthesized from human
protein and become the substance they are attached to: bone, ligament,
skin, gums or artery. A biopolymer plate instead of a metal one for healing
bone fractures promotes stronger reknitting since the bone cannot fall into
the bad habit of demineralizing while it lets the steel do the work. Other
biopolymer applications heal skin grafts or keep cleared arteries from
clogging again. The Center's director is not stopping at that, however, as
he depicts pharmaceutical uses for biopolymers as vehicles whose slow but
steady absorption by the body would allow for much more efficient (95% of
an aspirin is not absorbed, he points out)-and possibly more effective-drug
treatment programs. Even techier, he envisions biopolymers constructed to
penetrate certain types of cells while carrying a pharmaceutical payload.
And why limit reabsorbable materials to medical uses? Garbage bags, yogurt
containers and diapers could all be made to be assimilated by harmless
bacteria or fungi, the Centers' scientists-clearly absorbed in their
subject--point out. (Midi-Libre, October 22, p2)

** BRIEFLY

EUROPE... 60 eminent European biologists and geneticists have registered
their strong disapproval of the decision by certain member nations to cut
their contribution to Union sponsored collaborative research infrastructure
in biology and genetics. If the European Commission allows this to happen,
the European Bioinformatics Institute in Cambridge will see its operating
budget cut in half. Directors of the Max Planck Institute, the European
Molecular Biology Lab (Heidelberg) and other leading researchers are
raising their voices to point out that European genetic research is in
danger of falling badly behind and that Europe needs a more coherent common
research policy. (Le Figaro, November 4, p20)

START UP HERE... The research ministry's fervent desire to get research
results onto shop floors has apparently outstripped its means. The first
annual innovative firm prizes sponsored by the Ministry were handed out
with much ado last month, but ministerial glee was matched by
disappointment from many of the recipients as they read the fine print. The
impressive prize sums will be handed out in monthly checks for 18-24 months
to help defray the "research costs" of new firms Second surprise: the funds
are awarded on a matching basis since they are meant to cover no more than
50% of the firm's research budget. Meanwhile the CNRS has announced the
inauguration of 3 enterprise incubators, to be located in Grenoble,
Toulouse, and Gif-sur-Yvette (near Orsay, outside of Paris), where the CNRS
hopes to midwive 50 new researcher-parented firms per year.

LA HAGUE... Recognizing that in France the nuclear industry could use as
much good press as it can get, the new PDG of the leading nuclear energy
firm Cogema-she herself the subject of a lot of press-moved quickly to
launch a bold full-page ad campaign pushing the message "we have nothing to
hide from you." The ads publicize Cogema's new web site devoted to public
information on nuclear plant functioning, including webcams placed within
their La Hague plant and detailed data on all aspects of plant operation.
Transparency becomes virtual invisibility, however, when search engines
cannot find the Cogema site, and when its home page forgets to provide a
link or an address for the plant info page. Don't misplace this address:
www.cogemalahague.fr. (Le Figaro, November 4, p20)

RHONE-ALPES... Possessing the densest research population of any region
other than Ile-de-France (Paris), Rhone-Alpes has taken further steps to
capitalize on the presence of 600 publicly funded labs and 12,000
scientists within its borders, mostly clustered around rival research twins
Grenoble and Lyons. The new multi-year spending strategy is to promote not
competition but cooperation as the two cities taken on specialized roles.
Grenoble will head a regional network focusing on microphysics,
digitalization, and multimedia while Lyons will do the same for
biotechnology. Labs in each city will of course contribute to both
initiatives. Lyons hopes to acquire an international position quickly in
"after genome" research.  (Les Echos, October 14, p1, Marie-Annick=
 Depagneux)

BUDGET... Funding for public non-military research and development will
increase for 2000 by 1.3%, according to a report prepared by the
administration for the Parliament. Within that figure, university labs will
get 3.1% more than in 1999, while operating budgets for public (including
university) labs will grow by 3.5%. The recently created (1999) National
Science Fund, whose vocation is to sponsor high priority research, will
have $200 million to spend in 2000. High priority areas include
biotechnology especially labs and firms working on "after genome" projects.
National strategies in this area can now be facilitated by the existence of
a network of bio-incubators (the FFBI). (Le Quotidien du M=E9decin, November
4, p23-24, S.H.)

I would argue that you would want to get rid of all the organisms
but one, man.  We have starting examples of this in the barrier
facilities in which many rodents are maintained.  We can readily
synthesize the vitamins provided by our current bacteria, so why
not eliminate the parasites entirely?  It certainly would lower
our energy requirements.

You have to deal with time scale differences.  Over the long
term our existing ecosphere is probably unstable.  What we
now see is due to long term downstream effects of earlier
biosphere changes.  Those changes continue even today, just
slowly enough that we don't realize many of them.

I doubt *any* complex system can be constructed that is not
unstable or very chaotic.  Only if you have relatively simple
systems can you have some hope of predicting and following
all of the interactions.

If you are trying to recreate a biosphere with pre-existing tools
(microorganisms and higher plants & animals), then you probably
have to go for complexity (because nature has evolved to be
that way).  If you are willing to apply energy & chemical fixes
and you aren't losing any "mass", then the system is by definition
self contanined and you can drive the imbalances in any direction
you want.

I'd go with no species, a database of the existing biochemical
pathways and DNA sequences for the enzymes involved in them and
a chemi-synthetic system that let me synthesize any of those enzymes.

With that and some electro-chemical/nanotech patches
e.g. 2Fe2O3 <=> 4Fe + 3O2, 2H2O <=> 2H2 + O2, CO2 <=> C + O2)
I have no problem with long term survivability.

We need to worry about real problems like radiation damage.

Regarding the nanotech development for Space development:

Not if you have a top, down distributed effort.  Private development
is usually aware of what public development is occuring but the
converse may not be true.  Private development would borrow and
steal from everything -- government & university labs, NASA, patent
filings (after all patent law is difficult to enforce in space and
why would you care anyway if you are in emergency "escape" mode?).

You do have to have enough secure communication between the groups
to provide redundancy (in case one approach fails) without too
much duplication.

> I don't know why you want to slow down the process with secrecy.

Only to the degree that there are overhead costs associated with
secrecy does it slow things down.  You might lose valuable
insights or criticisms into fruitless approaches if you have
wide public review, but things are moving so fast now that
few scientists bother to publish negative results or waste
their time telling others that something might not work.

> There is a *reason* why publication is recognized as a fundamental
> part of the process of scientific research.

Publication works in *scientific research* because you want verification
that the conclusions are correct.  There is a *big* difference between
engineering (which is most of what Greg wanted) and scientific research
(I've personally learned this the hard way).  In engineering all you
need to know is whether or not it works.  Reality provides a much
better review than any collection of your "peers" (rockets that don't
work blow up).  The only point on which we may disagree is the amount
of "engineering" vs. "research" that might be required to fullfill
the goals of getting a sustainable enclave into space.

Well, then, I suspect you are up in arms about the drug industry
and the FDA, since their current approaches do kill many (due to
the unavailability of drugs that could work for a subset of the
population) in the name of protecting a few (for whom those drugs
may be dangerous).

I think that the process of peer review for paper publication may
slow things down just as much as any secrecy efforts might.  What

Ah, but if this were perceived as a "real" threat (say the
bioweapons treaties were never signed by a majority of countries)
do we not have the technology to develop antisera or perhaps even
vaccinate against or develop drugs that interfere with B-toxin?
All of the fear of B-toxin was developed in an era when we knew
nothing of molecular biology.  In those days suppression of the
bacteria was all you could do.  Now-a-days it might make more
sense to vaccinate everyone against it or simply add engineered
bacteria that secrete a B-toxin binding & sequestration protein.

I think these things are threats because we haven't focused any
attention for developing defenses against them, not because we
cannot do so.

If you have a pointer for the Green Goo essay I'd like to review it.

Yes, but they are not operating completely unseen by us or without
our anticipating their possible strategies and developing appropriate
countermeasures.  The real dangers lie in things we cannot see or
do not suspect.

While I may be strongly posthumanistic, I doubt I'm antihumanistic.
I do not envision a situation in which as a post-human SI, I would
really care to eliminate the primitive inhabitants of Earth (though
I might give strong consideration to converting it into a more
efficient simulation form). :-) 

My suspicion would be that competitive pressures & awareness of
the feasibility of conscious evolution would drive some subset
of the human species in the SI direction and the rest would
eventually die out.  Why be actively anti-humanistic, when I can
simply be passive and let nature take its course?

Its already being done.  There are 60+ complete genomes currently
known and the funding to unravel the functions of the unknown
genes in those genomes exists (gotta give the Ph.D. candidates
something to do ...).  It will not happen overnight, but will
move forward quickly as more automated methods become available
and we become more clever about the experimental and computer
methods that can be applied to these problems.

The economic pressure is clear, it is a population of ~10 billion
people in the not to distant future (that argument was presented
to me several days ago by the Dep. Director of the Inst. for Agric.
Biotechnology in Moscow).  The problem is that the pressure doesn't
exist much in the developed countries where we can feed ourselves.
In the lesser developed countries there are fewer resources and less
development in the labs, but what they lack currently will be balanced
in the future by shear #'s of inexpensive hands and population/economic
throw weight (as well as the fact that they can rapidly leverage the
technologies & information we have so painstakingly assembled).

Agreed, you gotta get into space and build one darn big supercomputer.

Why?  So we are hard-wired to think dead babies are bad.
If your life (or the survival of the species) depended on a
rapid turnover of dead babies to develop workable neo-genomes,
then I suspect you would be willing to adapt.

[Please note when the news reporters or others read this note

I saw it with my six & eight year old sons, and wasn't as impressed.
The genetically engineered creature is supposed to be a enhanced version
of an existing creature.  These enhancements are assumed to make it mean
and selfish.  It learns to make enhanced clones of other creatures, and
so naturally it plans to destroy the entire world except for its own
island with its creatures.  When challenged by a few original creatures,
it wins until they somehow convince it that it isn't fair to use their
enhancements.  Then they fight to a draw, at which point they conclude
that fighting is bad.  And so naturally all the new creatures fly off
into the sunset, apparently going into another dimension or something.

So the morals of the story are that enhancements are bad and unfair,
enhancements are likely to make you mean and want to destroy the
unenhanced, and it would be intolerable to have a world where the
enhanced and original live in peace together.

Which is of course what they think they are doing - if you believed
that Satan and his minions were running websites, then crashing them
would really be playing with the devil. :-)

Seriously, it is interesting to note that so far we have (to my
knowledge) been attacked by religious fanatics. This might be a good
sign or a bad sign, depending on your view.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                         November 15, 1999

MARS PENETRATOR PROBES NAMED FOR PIONEERING POLAR EXPLORERS

     NASA's Deep Space 2 microprobes, due to smash into the 
surface of Mars near the planet's south pole on Dec. 3, have been 
named Amundsen and Scott in honor of the first explorers to reach 
the South Pole of Earth.

     Paul Withers, a graduate student at the University of 
Arizona in Tucson, wrote the winning essay in a public contest to 
name the ambitious space mission. His was among a NASA-record 
17,000 entries submitted.

     "A century ago, Antarctica was the Earth's only unexplored 
continent. Then expeditions led by Amundsen and Scott landed 
there, striving to discover its secrets, seeking knowledge, and 
finding a land of stark beauty," wrote Withers, who studies the 
thin upper atmosphere of Mars.  "Scott perished in Antarctica. 
His memorial's inscription reads:  'To strive, to seek, to find, 
not to yield.' These are aims of the Deep Space 2."

     Norwegian Roald Amundsen explored the Northwest Passage 
before leading the first successful expedition to the South Pole, 
reaching it on Dec. 14, 1911.  Robert Falcon Scott led an English 
team to the South Pole in January 1912, only to discover the 
national flag left during Amundsen's earlier arrival.  Although 
blizzards and starvation claimed Scott and his entire team on 
their return trip, a search party found the team's scientifically 
valuable diaries and notebooks.

     The main purpose of NASA's miniature probes is technical, 
not scientific: flight-testing advanced technology that could be 
used by future planetary surface microlanders. Constructed to 
survive an abrupt impact at 644 kilometers (400 miles) per hour 
with the layered terrain common in the south polar region of 
Mars, the two Deep Space 2 probes also carry sensors to search 
for the presence of water ice about three feet below the surface, 
as a secondary goal.

     "Deep Space 2 joins Mars Polar Lander as the first missions 
to venture to the south pole of Mars, so it's only fitting to 
name the microprobes after the two explorers who first set foot 
on Earth's South Pole," said Deep Space 2 Project Manager Sarah 
Gavit. "Like Amundsen and Scott, Deep Space 2 will have to 
survive great odds, including not only braving the elements but 
also crashing into the terrain with unbelievable force."

     A gift certificate for CompUSA merchandise worth $4,000 will 
go to Withers. The prize, provided by Lockheed Martin Corp., the 
Boeing Co. and CompUSA, will go directly from the donating 
companies to the winner. The top 25 finalists will receive one 
copy each of a Deep Space 2 poster signed by project team 
leaders.

     Participants in the contest were instructed to choose two 
people from history (not living), characters from mythology or 
fiction, two places or things in some way associated with each  
other, or a combination of the above elements. Submissions had to 
be accompanied by a short written composition of up to 100 words 
explaining why the entries would make good names for the probes. 
This essay was used as the tiebreaker if more than one person 
submitted the same pair of names, which happened in the case of 
the winning submission.

     The Deep Space 2 probes are piggybacking on NASA's Mars 
Polar Lander spacecraft, which was launched on Jan. 3, 1999. Each 
probe has an entry system consisting of a basketball-sized 
aeroshell with a grapefruit-sized probe inside. Released from the 
cruise stage of the Mars Polar Lander on Dec. 3 before it enters 
the atmosphere of Mars, the probes will dive toward the surface 
with no braking system beyond their cone-shaped exterior surface. 
Unlike any spacecraft before them, the probes must endure impact 
forces up to 60,000 times the force of Earth's gravity as they 
hit the surface.  

     Upon impact, the aeroshell will shatter and the forebody of 
each probe will bury itself up to about one meter (three feet) 
underground, while the aftbody remains on the surface to transmit 
data back to Earth through NASA's Mars Global Surveyor 
spacecraft.  If successful, Deep Space 2 will demonstrate 
innovative approaches to entering a planet's atmosphere, 
surviving a crash-like impact and penetrating below a planet's 
surface. 

     The mission is managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
(JPL) in Pasadena, CA.  JPL is a division of the California 
Institute of Technology, Pasadena.

Robert, twice in the last month or so you have made claims like this.
The first time you made many long posts, and I offered some detailed
contrary analyses (last on Sept 18).  You then stopped posting
and privately told me you didn't have time to discuss it then.  A few
weeks later you again made several long posts, and when I challenged you
to respond to my earlier analysis, you (on Nov 5) suddenly said publicly
you didn't have time to talk more.  Now again you start again posting
on this topic.  So, do you want to discuss this topic or not?  Or
is it just that you don't want to discuss it with me?

Indeed.  In fact, I think Lyle Burkhead is right that this Santa Claus
view is the natural one that most readers get from Engines of Creation,
and that Drexler has not explicitly enough disavowed it in print.  Thus
it is fair game for Lyle to critique.  I do think Billy Brown is right
though, in saying that few smart folks who take nanotech seriously are
thinking of this Santa view.

Of course the electronics have real A/C (overheating computers don't work
very well, after all), and naturally the rest of the ship has to have a good
enough forced circulation/heat management system to keep the crew alive and
functional.  My point was simply that *comfort* is not a priority (except
maybe in the flag bridge...).  The goal is to keep the temperature between
(roughly) 55F and 90F, not to maintain a 70F office-building environment.

Actually, in Eli's scenario the rapid change is a product of superhuman
intelligence.  The nanotech is just a convenient tool for the SI to use - if
there weren't any such thing you would still get a Singularity, it would
just take a little longer.

I know that newcomers usually go through a phase where they think there will
be  a 'Nanotech Day' when suddenly you can do anything, but they usually get
over it after a few months.  I don't know of any serious thinkers who hold
to this view - do you?

No, the question is whether you need to imitate a natural biosystem, or
whether some functions can be performed by mechanical systems.  Your
arguments notwithstanding, all experience to date suggests that the answer
is a definite yes.

Exactly who has performed such an experiment, when, and under what
circumstances?  AFAIK nothing of the sort has ever been attempted, because
no one has ever needed to do it.  Biosphere definitely falls into the
overcomplex, naturalistic approach that I argue against.

I notice that you still fail to actually list any specific problems with the
simple approach to long-term life support.  Is this, perhaps, because you
can't name one?

A not-completely-insignificant quibble: I would say "The cost of a product
depends on the total quantity of human effort (direct and indirect) required
to make it."  Energy and material costs are really just indirect human labor
costs.

IMO it can be very instructive to view cost issues in these terms, because
it makes it very easy to see where you do and do not have big cost changes.
It makes it obvious pervasive automation has such incredible economic
potential, while making it easy to see that nuclear power does not
automatically mean cheaper electricity.

Most people who have commented on Lyle's site have pointed out that he
critiques the "Santa Claus" view of nanotech, which no one takes seriously
anyway.  However, Lyle's site includes a lot more than that.  Most
notably, he argues that nanotechnology will not make ANYTHING cheaper at
all, a view which I think NOBODY except him holds, as well as a critique
of the importance of artificial intelligence, which many of us do take
quite seriously.

After all, most of us agree that nano-assemblers would be hard to program,
indeed, perhaps Very Very hard to program, but the point of this is that
once the program is written, we never have to write the program again.  
He makes the point about how hard it would be to get the nanites to shape
shift from one thing to another, that it would be at least as hard as
programming Windows 2000 from scratch.  This is true, but then comes the
flip side: once you DID do all that programming, shape shifting into
Windows 2000 would be as easy as INSTALLING Windows 2000, if not easier.
He makes the point about how hard it would be to get the nanites to build
a battleship, but seems to overlook the fact that ONCE we program the
nanites to build a battleship, we can tell the nanites to make more
without much effort.

His critique of AI is especially weak, IMO.  Many of us do think that
we'll be able to create an artificial intelligence which is as smart as a
person, and that it will be able to augment itself so that it will be
smarter than a human not long thereafter.  Lyle strongly disagrees,
arguing instead that "Automated systems always exist in a larger context
which is not automated."  Certainly all PRESENT automated systems operate
this way, but no one is arguing that AI exists now, but only that it CAN
exist in the future.  He argues against what he calls the Bootstrapping
Theorem:  "It will be possible for human-equivalent robots to go beyond
the point of human equivalence, even though it is not possible for us." My
defense: the biggest reason it's not possible for us now is NOT our own
complexity.  Rather, our biggest bottleneck presently is that it's very
difficult for us to examine the precise state of our own brains in detail,
and even more difficult for us to make precise, detailed changes.  An AI
would NOT have this problem, and would therefore be at a great advantage
in terms of augmentation.

Many AI people believe that if we ever got a human-equivalent AI, it would
not only augment itself beyond human capacity, it would do so
exponentially.  Lyle counters that this is certainly not the case,
basically because there is "No Moore's Law for Software."  What he fails
to notice is that the regular old Moore's Law of hardware will do the
trick.  The programs of 1990 (presuming they don't crash outright on newer
systems) now run hundreds, if not thousands of times as fast as they did
on the systems for which they were originally designed.  If an AI merely
thought in exactly the same way as a human did, but one hundred times
faster, that alone would represent a huge step forward in intelligence.

I've debated with Lyle Burkhead <lybrhed@earthlink.net> a great deal
about this and I really don't think his position is entirely consistent. Back
in March, soon after his geniebusters web page went on line, he was on
this list giving all his reasons why there would be no singularity, but
then Lyle said the following which seemed to contradict all he said before:

    >hang on for another 20 or 30 years, *and* if you affiliate yourself
    >with the right group, it won't be necessary to die at all.  [...]
    >We are heading for one of the great extinction events in the history
    >of this planet, probably the greatest extinction event in the last 200
    >million years.

I agree with that but was a bit dumbfounded by the juxtaposition. I wrote
" If extinction for most and the permanent elimination of death for a few
  is not big enough to be called a singularity or a discontinuity in human
  affaires, then I don't what is. Death is the most constant framework in
  all of civilization, if that ends I don't know what will happen but I do know
  things will be different, very very different." He made some sort of
  response to my comment but for the life of me I can't remember what it
  was, if it was enlightening I know I would have.

Hmmm.  Actually, this theory is lacking, too, unless you're merely
asserting that total quantity of human effort is just ONE of the things on
which the cost of a product depends.  Indeed, your theory reminds me of
Marx's "labor theory" of value, which leads one into serious problems,
IMO.

At any rate, there's at least two more factors at work which you don't
take into account here.  The first one is (surprise!) demand.  If demand
is low, or even better, if you've got a monopsony on the market under
consideration, the cost of the product will be lower, despite the fact
that the total labor required to create the good is the same.

The second factor is capital.  Suppose I've got a goose who lays a special
kind of egg that nobody else anywhere in the whole world can make (unless
they buy my goose).  Clearly, the total quantity of effort required to
acquire these eggs is very low: I merely need to feed the goose daily;
feed is cheap.  But, nonetheless, it would be very reasonable for me to
charge a LOT MORE for those eggs than the cost of the feed and my trivial
labor feeding the goose, especially if demand for these eggs are high.  
The goose, in this case, is a special kind of capital, which, due to its
rarity, is quite expensive, thus increasing the cost of the egg beyond
that which would be expected based on human labor alone.

The cost of the product is determined by demand and supply; the supply is
determined both by human labor AND the capital required to create the
product.

Automation thus has economic potential only if it's *cheaper* than human
labor (which we can only say once we've taken capital into account re:
cost of products).  Note also that nuclear electricity need not save us
any human labor at all in order to yield cost benefits...  it only needs
to be the case that the cost of nuclear energy (labor + capital) is less
than the cost of, say, coal energy (labor + capital).

This is only true in the opening phase of the arms race, when human
civilization looks is spread across the surface of the planet and you your
ability to replace people with hardware is severely limited.  Things get a
lot worse after that point.

As nanotech and AI become more advanced the military forces of a nation
become more and more resistant to both nuclear attacks and indiscriminate
green goo.  They can build deeply buried manufacturing facilities, build
combat robots with heavy radiation shielding and robust nanotech immune
systems, and move all military personnel into armored bunkers.  As the
bunkers get deeper and the robots get tougher most world powers will respond
by building bigger nukes, more virulent goo, and more and more sophisticated
robotic armies.

There are several unfortunate trends here.  The first is that the
survivability of military forces tends to increase over time, because
burying yourself under a mountain is easier than moving one.  As a result
the chance of nuclear weapons being used actually increases, which is a
shame because the environment and civilian population on the surface are
still very fragile targets.  There is also a strong incentive to build very
large robotic armies, because a) you can't destroy one with cheap weapons of
mass destruction, and b) other things being equal, big armies tend to beat
smaller ones.  I don't see the incentives changing until someone invents a
new super weapon capable of physically disrupting the entire volume of a
planet, or until all of the Earth's mass has been converted into an optimal
mix of shielding, weapons and industry.

Now, I would hope that we'll see a significant migration into space long
before then.  Spreading across the solar system would help because it would
make it much easier to defend a civilian population, since any attacking
force must cross a large amount of open space where it can be detected with
relative ease.  Interstellar colonization would be even better, because it
would make the time required to launch an attack comparable to the time
required to build a navy capable of stopping it.

Mind you, all of this only applies to civilizations that are not yet doing
mega-scale engineering.  Once you start remodeling entire solar systems the
whole dynamic would change yet again, and I'm not sure what the result would
be.

Hi, Billy; how ya'll Textropians doin'?
Sorry, I have been out of touch for so  long, but I have been taking some 
serious Computer Science courses this semester, and often it's all I can do 
to remember to do all the necessary things, etc., and so I often forget to 
do all the other things, such as update my new email addresses. I decided to 
use the new free Net accesses (Altavista, netZero), and so my new email addy 
is randysmith101@hotmail.com.

Now, as you may remember, I spent some time in the Navy aboard a nuke sub, 
and yes, I can assure you, they DO stink! They do have air "conditioning", 
such as it is, but it does not for the most part regulate temperature, 
except in certain electronics spaces. Instead, it "scrubs" the air, removing 
CO2, CO, etc, and replenishing the O2.

The air in a sub underway, and even in port, with the hatch open, is a most 
foul, repellent and tenacious stench, an unsavory combination of the myriad 
petroleum derivatives used for lubrication products, and years worth of the 
odor of the various bodily secretions from the unwashed sailors encased 
within, which build up an odious film upon the interior wall of the sub.

I'll never forget it...

Yep, but more like 45 to 110. In one location, you may nearly freeze, and in 
another, sweat profusely.

One thing I wanted to mention, for those trying to plow through Lyle's
Geniebusters pages via his arrows, there is a table of contents at
http://www.geniebusters.org/00_contents.htm which provides a more
accessible entry into the otherwise linear sequence of pages.  (Thanks to
the critlink software for revealing this link.)

Lyle's main point is not so much that nanotech transformations will be
slow, but that there will be no "genies", as his URL www.geniebusters.org
implies.  He criticizes AI genies as much as nanotech ones.

Many people expect AI and nanotech to go hand in hand, either one
leading to the other, not necessarily overnight but in a short time
(months?).  Once you have both available I think there are a great many
serious thinkers who expect overnight change.  See the discussion at
http://infidel.org/~exi/eo/articles/vc.html, particularly Nick Bostrom's
reasoning for why AI and nanotech will arrive close together.

Lyle quotes Drexler as writing in
http://www.foresight.org/EOC/EOC_Chapter_3.html#section05of05:

: This design-ahead process seems sure to occur; the only question is when
: it will start and how far it will go. Years of quiet design progress
: may well erupt into hardware with unprecedented suddenness in the wake
: of the assembler breakthrough

"Unprecedented suddenness" does not necessarily imply overnight, but it at
least carries connotations of extremely rapid change, as does the phrase
"the assembler breakthrough".

Yes, I'm looking forward to it, although the first snows arrived this
week, and it's cold!

Europeans should have a good view this time. (Southern Spain is
especially good)

Some friends and colleagues of mine at ESOC in Darmstadt
are involved in the tracking of the Leonids for ESA. They put
together this informative Web page for real-time meteor counts.

http://www.esoc.esa.de/pr/leonids.php3

On this web page, they will display real-time meteor counts from
three independent sources:

1) The counts from ESTEC scientists operating video cameras in
Southern Spain
2) The radar and optical data from the campaign organized by CRESTech
(Canada)
3) The counts made on-board a plane organized by Peter Jenniskens
(NASA-Ames)


I attach a press release that gives more information.

LOOK OUT FOR THE LEONID METEOR SHOWER

The 1999 Leonid meteor shower should produce a fine display in the early
hours of the 18th of November, Professor Mark Bailey of Armagh Observatory
will tell the Royal Astronomical Society's meeting on Friday 12th November.
Research done at Armagh, and by other experts around the world, suggests
that an unusually strong shower is on the cards this year when Earth passes
through streams of dust that have been shed by Comet Tempel-Tuttle.

Professor Bailey is putting his confidence in the work of his colleague
at Armagh, Dr David Asher, who collaborated with Rob McNaught of the
Australian National University. They believe they have discovered enough
about the location in space of the dust streams responsible for the meteors
to give 2.08 a.m. on 18th November, give or take 5 minutes, as the time for
the peak of the display.

The number of meteors is more difficult to assess. Dr Asher says, "It's
marginal as to whether the meteor activity will reach storm level in 1999,
but however strong it turns out to be, European longitudes are ideally
placed for observing the outburst". His best estimate is a maximum of 20
meteors a minute visible to a single observer in ideal conditions under a
clear, dark sky (conditions rarely experienced by casual observers).
Professor Iwan Williams of Queen Mary and Westfield College, London, who
has also done research on the Leonids, is more cautious, but said "Most
models lead us to expect a better display than last year". Neither Asher nor
Williams expects anything like the spectacular storm of 1966, when the rate
reached 40 a second for a brief period.

Professor Bailey comments, "It is sometimes said that comets are like
cats: they have tails and are unpredictable. If that's the case, predicting a
meteor storm has to be about as easy as herding cats! But Asher and McNaught
believe they have discovered how to do it. The 1999 Leonids will be a
serious test of their method."

Minimising the Danger to Satellites

A reliable method of predicting strong meteor showers such as the Leonids
has real practical value. The Leonids are the fastest of all meteors,
plunging into the Earth's upper atmosphere at 71 km/s -- 40 times the
speed of a rifle bullet. Despite their small size, the tremendous speed of
the Leonids means they pack a mighty punch.

Apart from knocking a spacecraft off alignment or causing physical damage,
such collisions can also generate a cloud of plasma which may cause
electrical shorts or damage a spacecraft's sensitive electronics.

This threat is not simply theoretical. In 1993, a European Space Agency
satellite called Olympus spun out of control, possibly as the result of an
electrical disturbance caused by the impact of a particle from the Perseid
meteor shower. There are currently more satellites in orbit around the Earth
than ever before, all of which pose a tempting target for one of nature's
miniature missiles.

Fortunately, impacts with spacecraft are quite rare, but satellite operators
around the world will be monitoring the situation very closely and taking a
variety of precautions.

"There could be a lot of activity, but we just don't know for sure," commented
Dr Walter Flury of the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) at Darmstadt
in Germany. "It's better to take precautions now than be sorry later."

The European Space Agency's Space Science Department will provide
information on meteor numbers to ESOC every 15 minutes. Using this data
and radar counts from other sources, ESOC will be able to issue a security
alert, warning spacecraft operators to power down their spacecraft or turn
them away from the storm.

One of the largest targets, the NASA-ESA Hubble Space Telescope will be
manoeuvred so that its mirrors face away from the incoming meteors and its
solar arrays are aligned edge on to them during the Leonids' predicted peak.

Apart from reducing the exposed area of giant solar arrays, operators may
shut off power to vulnerable electrical components of satellites. In the
case of ESA's two European Remote Sensing (ERS) satellites, all of the
science instruments will be switched off during the peak of the Leonid
activity.

Even spacecraft located some distance from the Earth may be at risk. ESA's
Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) studies the Sun from a vantage
point 1.5 million kilometres away, but it, too, will be turned so that its
main navigational aid, the star tracker, is pointing out of harm's way.

Expecting the unexpected

Since meteor showers -- the Leonids especially -- are given to springing
surprises, it will definitely be worth watching out on the nights of both
16/17 and 17/18 November, any time between 11 p.m. and dawn, though
after midnight is best.

Meteor watchers awaiting the Leonid shower last year (1998) were taken by
surprise when a spectacular display of bright meteors occurred 16 hours
before the predicted time for the maximum of the shower. However, the
explanation for this phenomenon was discovered afterwards by David Asher,
Mark Bailey, and Professor Vacheslav Emel'yanenko of South Ural University,
Chelyabinsk, Russia, and was published in April (see RAS Press Notice
99/09, http://www.ras.org.uk/ras/press/pn99-09.htm). They showed that
the bright meteors were seen when Earth passed through a dense arc-shaped
trail of particles shed from Comet Tempel-Tuttle in the year 1333.

NOTES

Meteors are caused by small fragments of material, mostly no larger than a
grain of sand, which burn up as they enter Earth's atmosphere at high speed
-- around 71 kilometres (45 miles) per second in the case of the Leonids.

Leonid meteors are dust particles that have come off Comet Tempel-Tuttle.
Most of this dust is still following the comet fairly closely in space. The
comet takes 33 years to complete an orbit around the Sun, and planet Earth
ploughs through its main dust trail when the comet returns to our vicinity
every 33 years. In the years when this happens, a strong shower or storm
takes place. Particularly intense storms were recorded in 1833, 1866 and
1966. In the years between returns of the comet, a very small number of
Leonid meteors are seen in mid-November.

Some meteor showers produce about the same rate of meteors around the
same date every year. Regular annual showers happen when the dust from
a comet has spread around the whole of the comet's orbit, something that
takes place gradually over a long period of time. An example is the Orionids,
a shower in late October each year caused by dust from Halley's Comet.

The Leonids are so-called because the trails of the meteors belonging to
the shower appear to radiate out from a point in the constellation Leo. But
this is an effect of perspective. In reality, the meteor particles enter the
atmosphere along parallel tracks from the same direction in space.

People who wish to observe the Leonids are recommended to wrap up in
warm clothes and find a cloud-free, dark site away from city lights,
preferably with a good view towards the north-eastern horizon. Between
about 11 p.m. and dawn, they can expect to see rapidly moving shooting
stars anywhere in the north-eastern sky, emanating from the 'sickle'
(a backwards question mark) made up by the stars in the head of the
constellation Leo.

Yeah, the same amazement occurred to me. But we don't know for sure that anyone
messed with the server that hosts lucifer.com (still down, as of now). Even the
servers at Onelist.com, eGroups, and (gasp) AOL occasionally go down --
apparently all by themselves. Entropy happens.

Great, so we have a situation like Renaissance Italy - oh, wait, that wasn't
very peaceful, was it?  Well, how about Germany before unification (ah, no,
lots of wars there).  Feudal Japan?  Modern day Africa?  Hmm, this doesn't
seem to be working out...

The problem with a 'balance of power' approach to stability is that you can
never have a perfect balance.  Different countries vary significantly in
both their actual power and their willingness to use it, and that inevitably
leads to a certain amount of jockeying for position.  Obvious attempts at
world conquest will be resisted (like Napoleonic France), but more subtle
efforts with more limited goals will often succeed.  Over time the relative
strengths of the different powers will vary, and sooner or later you'll get
a situation where someone can actually win one of those wars of world
conquest.

Besides, the best known way to prepare for a future war is to keep the peace
and encourage domestic growth through low taxes and minimal regulation.  If
you ever get far enough ahead in the economic race you can mobilize the
military fairly quickly, and in the meantime you can put up a convincing
impression of innocence.  How does an association of equals deal with this
problem (and would we really want it to)?

Really?  I think the ideal system would be one where there aren't any
sovereign states in the first place.  Of course, I don't know how to build
such a society, but I do know how to do a lot better than the 'strong
central government' approach.

Since when are wars about economics?  OK, maybe some of them are, but that
is usually the case only in small wars where neither side has any intention
of actually destroying the other.

Big, nasty wars tend to be fought over hate, fear, or ignorance.  Either we
want to kill all those weird people on the other side of the hill who talk
funny, or we are afraid they are going to come kill us, or we think (usually
incorrectly) that we will gain some great benefit by ruling both sides of
the hill.  Frankly, I don't see any of these motivations going away until we
can change human nature.

???
You must be reading a different history book.  In mine, usually took more
like a month to get a message across either of the states you mention, and
armies could take the better part of a year to arrive.  The Persian empire
had even longer delays, and so did the British empire back in the age of
sail.

The fundamental constraint is simply that the central government must be
able to act swiftly enough to prevent the provinces from successfully
rebelling.  It is not at all clear how the combination of long life spans,
increased intelligence and nanotech manufacturing will affect this equation.
It should also be noted that in more modern states the constraints are
greatly relaxed by the fact that the provinces don't want to rebel in the
first place.

But it can't.  See my other post on this thread for details.

That isn't a threat at all.  A small cache of Nanobots can't do anything at
all to an equally advanced civilization that is prepared for nanowar.  The
best you can hope for is to kill a small group of civilians - somewhat like
a modern terrorist bombing.

So, if anyone has the temerity to try to build a J-brain everyone else will
nuke them into extinction?  No thanks.

Happily, it seems religious fanatics spend too much time quarreling among
themselves to take up a quarrel with extropy.

On the "No Singularity?" thread, John Clark agrees with Lyle Burkhead, who
wrote:

This elicits the alternative theory that to religious fanatics (and who knows
who else), extropians may appear just another non-threatening group of religious
fanatics.

I thought it was generally agreed that survivability was a stabilizing
trait, not a destabilizing one.  It means that a first strike will only
invite a retaliatory attack which you cannot defend against.  It keeps
you in a position of mutually assured destruction.  From this situation
it is possible to negotiate downwards to a wary and watchful peace,
which is close to what we have today.

The danger is when the opposite happens, when survivability is lost due
to some breakthrough which makes the first strike effective.  Then if
both sides achieve this state it is completely unstable, as the one which
attacks first will survive and the one which does not will be destroyed.

If nanotech really does increase survivability more than first strike
killing power then that would be very good news for the prospects of

Any Vorlon who tries that interrogation routine on me is going to be
forcibly reminded that he isn't bulletproof.  Unlike Delen, I'm not silly
enough to worship a race that has had technology for a million years and
hasn't managed to do anything with it.

'Cost' and 'Value are two very different quantities.  The cost of producing
something is proportional to the total human effort that was required to
make it.  The market value of the same item is a completely different thing,
and it is influenced by all sorts of other factors (as you correctly point
out).  The two quantities are related only in the obvious sense that
products whose cost is higher than their value will not be produced.

Perhaps I should use the term 'Production Cost' instead?

I read a review of this book in the Economist, and
the reviews on Amazon.com:

The River : A Journey to the Source of HIV and AIDS
by Edward Hooper, Bill Hamilton

"is thesis, that HIV made the jump from simians to humans
via the administration of oral polio vaccine in Africa in
the 1950s, is still controversial, but his arguments are
powerful, broad, and undeniable--all that is lacking is
conclusive proof."  -- Amazon blurb

I am amazed that things could go this badly.  I
wonder how many lives were saved by vaccines in Africa,
to weight against the possible cost of inducing the
AIDS epidemic.  I don't think vaccines had any
measurable influence on deaths in the US.  See:

of Medical Measures to the Decline of Mortality in
the United States in the Twentieth Century"

A scientific approach to making decisions together with other people, acting in
the public sphere would, I imagine, eliminate biases which interfere with
obtaining the most successful decisions. Cutting politics ("A strife of
interests masquerading as a contest of prinicples. The conduct of public affairs
for private advantage." --Bierce) out of the loop, would meet with the strongest
resistance from powerful politicians (whom the scientific method would also
prune from the decision making system).

In this scenario, neither you nor I would decide which color to paint the
building. We'd both agree to let the expert system decide.
Eventually, we'd let the SI make all these kinds of decisions. (Didn't we have
this conversation once before?)

It is interesting to note that some particularly aggressive companies are
moving to change this situation today, without advanced AI.  The idea is
that instead of having isolated islands of automation connected by manual
processes, you should have an ocean of automated data manipulation with
occasional islands of human labor.  As your pools of automation become
connected you tend to realize dramatic cost savings and process
improvements, which provide the incentive to keep the improvement process
going.

The Internet offers the potential to extend this way of doing business to a
global scale, and we all know how much effort is going into making that
happen.  I expect that the general level of automation will continue to
increase until it reaches the limits of what can be done with then-current
AI, at which point each new improvement in automation technology will spread
as quickly as an important software upgrade does today.

'What is your name?'  'Billy Brown.'  'IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR NAME
IS!!!':

> 'Cost' and 'Value are two very different quantities.

I actually want to take issue with your definition of "production cost,"
since I think you are using it wrongly.

While the production cost of product X is not affected by the demand for
product X, it IS affected by the price of capital, which, in turn, is
affected by demand for capital.

Consider a case where I'm trying to build widgets, and widgets require
iron to build, along with $1 of labor to make the widget.

Now, you can read this in one or two ways.  One way of looking at it is to
say that the cost to make a widget is the cost of the labor plus the cost
of the capital.  If the iron needed for one widget costs $5, then, the
cost to make a widget is $6.  This is what I'd normally think of if I
tried to specify a production cost.  Note that it DOESN'T depend on the
demand for widgets, but it STILL depends on the cost of *capital*.

Alternately, you *could* try to stick to your guns and say that
"production cost" is $1 in this case, saying that it is, by definition,
the cost of the labor necessary to make a widget.  "Production cost" is a
technical term, after all, so you can define it to be whatever you like,
so long as the predictions come out right in the end.

> The two quantities are related only in the obvious sense that products
> whose cost is higher than their value will not be produced.

However, we notice that "production cost," when it is defined to be the
cost of labor, does NOT validate the claim you make above.  If iron costs
$5 and the "production cost" is $1, but the market value of widgets is $3,
I will not want to produce a widget, despite the fact that "production
cost" is lower than market value.

Here you might object: "You forgot about the INDIRECT human labor involved
in making the iron!  If production cost is the cost of human labor
required to create the iron PLUS the cost to turn that iron into a widget,
the figures should work out in the end."  However, this STILL doesn't make
your claim above work out.

Suppose no one is willing to pay more than $7 for a widget.  Suppose that
the market value of iron is $5.  According to MY definition of production
costs, which includes labor and capital, the production cost is $6, so I'm
making a $1/widget accounting profit.

Now suppose that the demand for widgets and the production cost
of (iron + widgets) both remain constant, while the demand for IRON
sharply increases, so that iron now costs $8.

By your definition of "production cost," the "production cost" of widgets
remains the same as it was before (whatever it was).  However, by MY
definition of production cost, the production cost is now $1 of labor plus
$8 of capital = $9, which is more than the market value of widgets.
Clearly, in this case, I should not produce any widgets.  But you asserted
that "... products whose [production] cost is higher than their value will
not be produced."  But in this case the cost of labor has not changed, so
if your claim about "production cost" as you have defined it is true, then
I should not shut down.

So either your definition of "production cost" is wrong, your your claim
about what when a firm should shut down is wrong.  If your claim is wrong,
then we would have to define some other kind of cost, perhaps the "total
cost," which is given by "production cost + cost of capital," where if
total cost is greater than market value, the product will not be produced.
But this begs the question as to why we have invented this "production
cost" term to begin with, when we already have a perfectly acceptable term
in place: the cost of labor.  Ockham's Razor tells me that, instead, we
should take the simpler route, and say that "production cost" is the cost
of labor plus the cost of capital, rather than creating a new entity,
total cost, to make the same prediction.

Excellent! Let them waste their time on newsgroups. Personally, I never touch
the toxic stuff.
I know Sasha has had (and no doubt will have again) a few links to newsgroups on
his website, but I'll bet he doesn't spend much time participating in them.
Except perhaps to use them in experiments with news filtering, right Sasha?

It depends on what survives.  If starting a war means your entire country is
destroyed, but your missiles survive and can therefore destroy your
attacker, no one will start a war.  If, OTOH, a ruthless government can
expect to survive an attack and rebuild, the situation becomes very
unstable.  There is a temptation to go ahead and use the nukes, especially
if advanced technology also makes it easy to rebuild afterward.

Moderately advanced nanotech would allow a society to build entire military
bases and industrial complexes thousands of feet below ground, where they
would be very resistant to weapons of mass destruction (WOMD).  Mature
nanotech would allow an entire nation to move several miles underground,
with the surface given over to missile defenses and robotic weapons.  In
this scenario WOMD no longer live up to their name, MAD becomes impossible
to achieve, war between superpowers becomes feasible again, and the
collateral damage from any significant war could easily sterilize the
surface of the planet.

Good new if you are da fuhrer.  Very bad news if you are a whale, or an
environmentalist.  Uncertain news for ordinary citizens - you trade a small
risk of complete annihilation for a much higher risk of moderate casualties.

I think what Billy is saying is that the iron (which would normally be
considered raw material, not capital) costs $5 ultimately because that
is the cost of the labor to make that iron.  Someone had to mine it,
refine it, etc., and the efforts of all of those people are what produce
the cost of $5 for the iron.

The one correction I would offer is that there is a profit component to
the cost.  These widgets are going to be sold, hopefully, for a profit.
Ultimately they are worth more to society than the work which went into
producing them.  The resulting profit gets distributed among the people
who created the labor.

Some share of this profit goes to the people who made the iron, and
some I can keep.  This is where the market factors come into play.
Those profits which are retained by the iron makers look to me like
costs of production.  They reduce my own profits.

If iron is scarce and iron-production is profitable, then iron will be
more expensive and iron makers get to keep more of the profits than me.
If iron is plentiful and there is little profit in its production,
then it will be cheap and I get to keep most of the profits.

In your golden egg example, suppose your goose doesn't lay golden eggs,
but some kind of super-advanced computer chips.  Suppose it is a nanotech
goose that you have invented and no one else has this technology.
Now electronics companies want to buy your chips and use them in their
devices, which they can sell for a lot of money.  However because of your
monopoly you can retain most of the profits which those companies receive.
To them, the cost of your chips is high, even though the human labor
going into producing them is not very great.

Survivability is different from opportunity to retaliate, which is what
you're describing.

Low survivability:  When opportunity to retaliate is high, and
survivability is low, you get mutually assured destruction.  When
opportunity to retaliate is low and survivability is low, first strike
becomes effective.

High survivability:  However, if opportunity to retaliate is high and
survivability is high, war may erupt, rather than mutually assured
destruction.  High survivability with low opportunity to retaliate doesn't
make any sense.

Thus, (surprise!) having a low survivability is a necessary but not a
sufficient condition for nuclear stability in a MAD world.  To get MAD
stability you need low survivability AND ample opportunity to retaliate.

Which is why the US and the USSR agreed somewhere in the
1960's ('70s?) that they would not build defensive weapons
to shoot down each others missiles.

Enemies or not, your own political and economical survival 
is always more important than the demise of the enemy.
Especially when multiple parties are involved.

It's not about it being peaceful. The point is that the wars
in Renaissance Italy were:
- nondestructive
- about economics, with hardly any fighting going
  on if there wasn't something to be gained
- not threatening to the 'stability' of Italy as
  a whole
- a pretty good incentive to encourage new inventions,
  economical advances, science and art

While the time may not have been a peaceful one for the
citizens of that time, it has been a very good time for
the development of the country as a whole (and for the
culture we still have today!).

Thanks for your response.  Indeed I believe the differences between 
human/transhuman should blend together.  Life as continuum.  And believe me, 
I cherish it all.

Perhaps I'm closer than you know, I just come to it from a different 
perspective than most I've met.  Every so often I have felt my sense of 
identity expand both temporally and spacially, encompassing at first my 
family, my community, my past and future selves, my ancestors and 
descendants, stretching further yet to encompass the earth, the galaxy, even 
the universe.  Unlike, say for example buddhists, I never lose my sense of 
self, but it is grows to such a degree as to result in much the same thing.

Those are when I am feeling the connections in all things, but there are 
differences as well.  The whole has parts, and my consciousness is mostly 
confined to a small part.  One and many, I embrace both sides of the coin, 
for both views have their uses.  But before all else, I AM.

OK... but in that case "production cost" depends on the demand for labor,
which seems to contradict the way Billy characterized it.  In this
example, the demand for iron-making labor rose without an increase in the
demand for turning-iron-into-widgets labor.  Since "production cost,"
defined this way, is just the sum of the value of the labor, production
cost rose when demand rose.

Billy, on the other hand, seemed to be saying that production cost did not
depend on demand, but was simply determined by how much actual work was
needed to cause the thing to come into existence.  I'd argue that there is
no way of thinking about production cost OR value which does not bring
demand into the picture, even at the most fundamental level.

(BTW, the reason I called the iron "capital" is because I was, at first,
going to provide a different example, in which there were two ways of
making widgets, one which included iron and required little labor, and one
which did not include iron and was labor intensive.)

http://www.skeptic.com/03.2.harris-aids.html is a 1994 article by
Dr. Steve Harris, who is active in cryonics circles and a real sharp guy
(probably known to many list members), refuting some of the objections
of the "AIDS reappraisers".  You don't find this kind of analysis very
often because most workers in the mainstream just hope the gadflies and
conspiracy theorists will go away.  It is great that Steve has taken the
time to put the controversy into perspective.

Here is an excerpt from the abstract:

: It is concluded that HIV/AIDS skeptics have chosen overly broad
: definitions of AIDS which are not clinically useful, and which would,
: if employed, result in many confusing diagnoses of "AIDS" and "HIV-free
: AIDS" in people with good prognoses. HIV is one of a closely-related
: family of viruses which causes AIDS-like immunodeficiency diseases
: in a number of animals species, and HIV/AIDS skeptics have ignored or
: minimized this research in order to construct needlessly complicated

    I have been thinking lately about the whole selfish vs selfless debate, 
and about how both sides seem to me to be missing something.  I used to 
preach what I referred to as benevolent self-interest (yes this is very 
similar to certain ideas in venturism and extrosattvaism), but even that 
seems less than complete of a description now to me.

    I believe that the most important quality in the universe is self.  But 
not my self alone.  All selves are valuable to me (though I do have 
favorites).  I am interested in bettering the lives of all selves, mine and 
others.  Of course, my main focus will be on doing what is best for myself 
and those others I have the closest contact with.  I believe in 
responsibilities of proximity and scale and competence.  The closer you are 
to a self, the greater your responsibility (and who is closer than yourself), 
the smaller the scale, the fewer people need act (and a single person is the 
smallest scale, so you and a few others should in general be able to help 
with most problems that effect just you), and of course the greater your 
ability to render assistance in any situation determines responsibility (as I 
have had medical training, especially ACLS, my responsibility to respond to 
an injured person is greater than that of someone who has only seen CPR on 
TV).  Now, this theory puts great emphasis on taking care of yourself as much 
as possible because 1) you are usually, but not always, in the best position 
to do so and 2) by caring for yourself, you help lighten the burden of 
responsibilities on those around you.  But it is not a sink or swim concept, 
nor does it forget the other person.

    Essentially, what I am saying is that each and every person is important. 
 I have heard it said before that each person is a universe within 
themselves, and when they die, a whole universe dies.  I believe to a certain 
degree this is true.  Further, the ability to care, to feel, to desire, this 
is in my estimation the most valuable thing in the universe.  It must be used 
with care, and it must be afforded respect.

    Altruism is unsatisfactory because it usually misses the trees for the 
forest, ignoring the person you could do the most good for, yourself.  
Selfishness is as bad for it often doesn't even know there are other trees, 
much less a forest.  I believe we must always remember that we are, if you 
will, a tree among trees, who all together are the forest.  We are not 
diminished for being this one tree, nor are the other trees devalued just 
because they aren't this one tree, nor are they diminished because they 
compose the forest, nor is the forest lessened because we discern it is 
composed of trees.  

    So I say leave behind the question of whether to aid others or look after 
yourself.  Do both, as much as you can.  Look about yourself and see what you 
can best do to make our universe a decent place to be.  True, more often than 
not we will be able to do precious little in any one situation, but if we 
keep striving great things can happen.  I plan to.  How about you?

It is perhaps a natural outcome, but also a bit discomfiting, to see
just how divergent various ideas about the future can be, even among
people who seemingly have a lot of common interests -- like, for
instance, the *nanotechnology* theory that Eric Drexler so effectively
pioneered and popularized. Strange how scientific ideas get
characterized in slang terms, even among scientists, with, say, Drexler
being painted as a mythical "Santa Claus" and with one Lyle Burkhead as,
perhaps, "The Grinch that Stole Christmas"? It all kind of reminds me of
that infamous, and unhelpful, April 1996 "Scientific American" article
where Drexler's talk of molecular manufacturing was characterized as a
"Cargo Cult" science. This "Santa Claus" talk carries the exact same
implication, right?

Now, if I focus on the whole "Cargo Cult" deal, the real Cargo Cults
were a situation of remote islanders in such places as New Guinea,
trying to obtain European-style consumer goods via magical rituals. In
regard to this, one point that occurs to me about "Santa Claus views"
and "Cargo Cults" is that our consumer society already is a kind of
Cargo Cultist's dream come true! What do certain smart aleck
commentators think the original Cargo Cultists were trying to imitate
anyway? I mean, those poor guys didn't hallucinate the existence of the
foreign goods that they wanted access to so badly; really their only
problem was lack of economic opportunity, not to mention lack of
education in the science behind the trade goods.

Supposedly, the "Cargo" guys were silly because they used the wrong
theory for getting what they wanted, while only little kids would
believe that a man in a red suit will bring you a bicycle. My question
is, what does any of this have to do with whether molecular factories
could ultimately be programmable or not? In the Cult analogy, who was
sillier, the tribesman who tried to get Cargo the wrong way, or the one
who would respond to descriptions of factory assembly lines with the
comment that "serious people would never believe that"? Actually, when
you think about it, there'd be a good chance of the same person being
wrongheaded both ways at the same time, i.e., the Cultist might well be
too technically unimaginative to believe in assembly lines, while being
too hopeful to give up on varying his usual ritual methods.

People are sure a funny lot, and it may seem strange, but it looks to me
as though the *real* cult of scientists and corporate people is to
display a sort of hidebound conservatism, perhaps in spite of having
some intuition about what may be possible in the future. Seemingly this
is done in the interest of looking more "respectable" than the next guy.
You know, computers will never need more than 640K of memory, that sort
of thing. Anyway, when I blip onto the Internet, and get some shareware
or freeware, or shop around, or whatever, I'll be sure to drop an email
to good old Santa for making it all possible. I mean there must be
someone out there responsible for all the things that these scientists
insist are *impossible* to the dyin' bitter end, *until*, "oops, yes,
its been done, and I helped, you know, I knew we could do it all along",
etc, etc, ad nauseum.

The problem with this theory is that HIV-1 (the one we're mostly worried 
about) is a descendant of a chimp virus, and chimps were in no way involved 
with making polio vaccine.  There has been some discussion of the relevance 
of a monkey cell used for some vaccine production (I forget which) but that 
could only have spread HIV-2, and only if that monkey is the HIV-2 source.

Um, Billy?  Vorlons *are* bulletproof.  This was established fairly
thoroughly during the fourth season.  (Okay, so this transcends the
concept of mere "pedantry", but I can't help it.)

Besides, you can't blame JMS for running all his civilizations in
slow-mo.  Going through the next million years worth of progress in
twelve seconds may be the most computationally realistic result, but
Vinge is the only one who's managed to make a human-readable drama out
of it (_A Fire Upon the Deep_).

Besides, I was deeply touched by the "Human Encounter Suit" in _The
Deconstruction of Falling Stars_.  The torch passes on, and burns
brighter still.

The metal may have 2 uses: computation, which presumably requires
energy, or memory, which requires very little energy (occasional
rewriting to offset cosmic ray damage in excess of ECC limits
seems unavoidable).

The computational throughput of a parallel processing "computer" system
will be highest value when the material resources are utilized in such
a fashion that you get the greatest amount of computation done with the
minimal amount of interprocessor communication delays and energy costs.

So the best situation to setup is m1 at the thermodyanmic limits
and m2 with the leftovers.  For example, this could be m1 = 0.999(m1+m2)
and m2 = 0.001(m1+m2).  You can't use any more metal at m1 because
you are using all the power of your star *and* are radiating at
the lowest background temperature possible.   You may develop
m2 but it is hardly worth the trouble, since the cost of shipping
information to m2 (in terms of energy and months to years of transit
time) makes it hardly worth the effort of any additional computation
you got back (after more months to years).

I agree that metal-limited Dyson spheres *do* show decreasing returns.
The further out from the star you go, the cooler the layers get and the
less energy you have to do useful work.  If you want a "global" maxima,
your conclusion is correct.  But *unless* the AS-SI has agreed to work
for me full time for the next 10 billion years (for free of course),
it makes little sense to split m1 & m2 evenly.  It makes much more sense
to make the RB-SI a Matrioshka Brain (hiding the star, operating at the
thermodynamic limits) and make the AS-SI a Jupiter Brain (harvesting a
small fraction of the stellar output, waiting for more metal to be produced).

In a subsequent message, I wrote

I agree, if transport costs are high, you don't go harvest metals
and ship them home.  You either breed them locally or make do with
what is available.

> And when transport costs are zero, m1 = m2 = (n1 + n2)/2.  And for

In the long run, you will orbit to places where transport costs
are lower (in theory, if you can predict the motions of all of the
stars in the Galaxy, you can apply small delta-V's that over long
time scales (millions of years) bring you in very close proximity
to locations (stars or gas clouds) where quantities of metals are
available and transport costs are very low.

> So we should see at least P(n2) power intercepted from star 2.

Only if it is of some benefit!  We always come back to this
point.  Say m2 is enough for an AS-SI-JBrain.  Is there any
point to the construction of this if over the last billion+
years, billions of JBrains have been constructed and they have
"thought" everything that JBrains are capable of thinking?

Do cockroaches question whether to reproduce?  No.  They do
it because they are programmed for it.  Do humans question
whether to reproduce?  Yes.  Because they consciously question
whether the benefits exceed the costs.  If we assume the
evolution of intelligence goes hand-in-hand with the evolution
of rational-thought, then you have to answer the question of
what justifies the production of something that is only capable
of thinking things that you thought ages and ages ago?

The point of reproduction (IMO), is to hopefully get something new
and better.  If you are up against thermodynamic limits, that
probably becomes increasingly difficult as the universe ages.

If you believe sacrificing your potential for that of another entity
then equi-division of metals might make sense.   Once you have decided
to harvest everything that provides benefit in excess of the
investment, then the question is whether there is any benefit to
leaving behind "handicapped" JBrains.  That sounds like a pretty
sadistic thing to do.  As a JBrain it is going to be pretty clear
that you got somebody's leftovers.

It takes a small fraction of the metal in a system like ours to harvest
all of the sunlight (and hide the star in the visible region).  It
[probably] takes more metal than we have available even after
dismantling all of the planets to *optimally* use the energy the
sun is producing.  So we can rapidly evolve to the low-SI level with
a hidden star but may take eons to evolve to high-SI levels.

Sure, a few of the textropians can go off and colonize nearby
stars, but they are going to be *years* behind us on the SI
evolutionary curve.  You could set your sights on a bigger
star (more energy), but that has a shorter lifetime and
suffers from larger inter-SI node propagation delays (bigger
stars with more energy means the radii of the "hottest"
computronium layer must be larger to prevent melting).  You
could shoot for a metal rich star that would have a resource
base for faster post-SI evolution, but as soon as you got
a few million moon-sized telescopes up and running you might
discover the sky filled with individuals who have been
pursuing your strategy for much, much longer.

I certainly agree that the math outlined above makes sense.
If we were striving for some "global galactic optima" your
argument might sense.  But in striving for any galactic optima,
you have to solve a planning problem that involves information
this is ~100,000 years out of date (the light-speed distance
across the galaxy).  On SI timescales a *lot* can happen in
that length of time.

If we could assume that drives & justifications for colonization
in humans would apply in SIs, then staking out metal claims might
make sense as well.  But if *you* are going to claim them, the
claiming entity must be an "owned", non-self modifying subsidiary.
Questions:
 - If Columbus had known the Americas were populated with cultures
   far older, wiser and more powerful than his, would he have set sail?
 - Is there a galactic market for metals claimed given the high costs
   of transporation?

I'm optimistic that *if* SIs exist already, we will see them before
we have the ability for interstellar colonization.  So framing
the exploration/colonization question within that framework is useful.

If SIs do not exist, then survival scenarios (enclaves, escaping
bio-nano-goo, etc.), interstellar colonization and galactic optimization
discussions are useful.  If this is the case, then we also have another
interesting problem to discuss -- why is the development or survival of
intelligent life so darn difficult?

Also, some of my claims regarding communications costs have raised
some eyebrows.  A very brief & rough summary of my thoughts in
this area, and the references (what people really want) is now up at:
  http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/MatrioshkaBrains/LogP.html

I'll do my best to answer questions but it may take another 2 months.

Frankly, I'm leaning towards the idea that even human minds will still
function better without a self-image.  I mean, I have one or two ASIMs
(ASIM:  Alternate Self-Image) that I can use if I need a personality or
something, but on the whole, the Universe is a cleaner, simpler place if
you don't try to distinguish between the several modules composing your
"self" and the rest of the Universe.  So, yes, both selfishness and
altruism are kind of missing the point - but the better way isn't a
compromise between them; the better way is the truth - modelling the
Universe without artificial distinctions between the quarks composing
"Eliezer" and all the other quarks.

It's just easier to think without all the artificial asymmetries.  It's
just easier to think when you're not trying to warp reality because of
your emotional attachment to some particular outcome.  Maybe that's what
they call Zen - I wouldn't know, I don't have any formal training in
Zen.  It just sounds Zenny:  Enlightenment is like sneezing, and the
self is the snot.

I thought this essay by Greg Johnson might be helpful in this thread.  At
least, it might clear up some issues before ditching the self concept.

For the record, I think the self concept works well and is based on reality.
The human mind acts as a unity -- in as much as anything that we normally
think of as a unity acts thus.  I think improvements on it probably will
too, but that remains to be seen.

Cheers!

Dear Transhumanists:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I herewith take the liberty to announce the recent start of a new mailing 
list called

                ``The Artificial Intelligence Research Club''

This mailing list will discuss how to practically construct an AI that should 
become self-aware.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The purpose of the mailing list is to serve as a sounding board, and as a 
medium to exchange technical information and through which possibly to 
construct individual cooperations, to people who are themselves engaged in     
constructing (parts of) a self-aware AI. 

Anyone already working on constructing (parts of) a self-aware AI is hereby 
*warmly* invited to join the mailing list. 

The mailing list will, it is hoped, contribute to each subscriber's own, 
individual, activities in the field of AI.  It is intended as the 
information-exchange portion of a kind of ''research group'', but there is no 
formal ''research institution'' behind it claiming ownership of any idea 
posted on the mailing list. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The mailing list is not intended to discuss the morality or any political 
issues related to a possible self-aware AI.  People who think that it is 
morally 'bad' that people should think about constructing a self-aware AI, are 
urged *not* to subscribe to the mailing list. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To subscribe to the mailing list, 

     -   Send a blank email to intelligence-subscribe@topica.com;
   -or-  Visit http://www.topica.com and look up the ''Artificial Intelligence 
         Research Club'' mailing list there;
   -or-  Contact any of the people already on the list or any of the list 
         owners, 
              Clint O'Dell (clintodell@visto.com) or 
              Menno Rubingh (rubingh@delftnet.nl), 
         personally via email.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For more information on the ``The AI Research Club'', or on where to find 
information about it on the Web, contact Clint or me by email.  Please feel 
free to inform anyone who might be interested in cooperating in the ``The AI 
Research Club'' discussion group of the existence of the mailing list.

Potential Consequences, Opportunities?

http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_523000/523161.stm

By BBC News Online Science Editor Dr David Whitehouse 
A physicist has suggested that a peculiar type of black hole could be made in 
the laboratory. It would be just half a metre wide and made of electrons. 

Until now making black holes in the lab has been the stuff of science 
fiction. 

The disaster scenario for an Earthly black hole usually begins with an 
experiment involving a high-energy particle accelerator that smashes 
sub-atomic particles together. 

Big bang 

Particle accelerators are designed to collide particles together at 
incredible energies to recreate the conditions of the big bang. Matter and 
energy are indistinguishable in the explosion and obey laws that do not come 
into play in our everyday universe. 


 
Accelerators use tunnels kilometres long to generate extreme particle speeds 
But what if something went wrong and scientists inadvertently made a black 
hole that sank into the Earth, taking up residence at its core? 

It would eat away at our planet, devouring it from the inside at an 
ever-increasing rate. Within an hour, the Earth would be gone replaced by a 
hole in space and time. 

However, the creation of a black hole on Earth was not thought to be at all 
feasible - until now. 

Electronic black hole 

Theoretical calculations carried out by Murat Ozer of King Saud University in 
Saudi Arabia suggest it would be rather easy to make a black hole in the 
laboratory - but it would not be a black hole as we have imagined them. 

It would be a black hole for electrons only. All other particles and light 
would be able to pass in and out of the black hole but once an electron went 
inside it, it would be forever trapped. 

Ordinary black holes occur as a result of gravity. When an object's gravity 
is strong enough to prevent light from escaping it becomes a black hole. 

In black holes our everyday notions of space and time break down. Nothing can 
emerge from a black hole once it has gone inside. 

'Rather easy' 

But said Dr Ozer, talking to BBC News Online: "A black hole for electrons, 
could be built in the laboratory rather easily. You would need a Van de Graaf 
generator, a metallic sphere and a supply of electrons." 

"If you made one in air it would be half a metre across. If could be smaller 
if it was in a vacuum," he added. 

Studying electronic black holes would help us understand gravity black holes, 
as they would have many things in common. 

So perhaps the time may not be far off when we can study black holes in the 
laboratory. But I wonder if this would be wise? Do we really know enough 
about them to be sure they would not pose any danger?

I checked his paper at http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/9911011 and
honestly, I think it is bullshit. I do not understand his proposed
unified theory (it seems to be a geometric form of electromagnetism),
but the "black hole" he proposes (which is indeed half a meter in
diameter and only works for electrons) seems utterly silly - if you
charge up a one ton sphere to 10^5 V (which is done all the time with
van der Graaf generators) it would become a black hole that would suck
up electrons from the vicinity. This is not observed, and if he is
right small charged objects like ions also ought to become black
holes. 

Also, I seriously mistrust articles that refer only to the author's
previous articles, a standard textbook and one classic paper. 

Consequences: maybe this can manage yet another science scare, but it
is also an opprtunity to demonstrate some critical thinking to people
and point out exactly why few physicists will likely take zer
seriously. It is simply not very good science.

A black hole half a meter across would mass more than the entire Earth. 
Earth converted to a black hole would be about a centimeter across;
Jupiter, I believe, would be six meters.  So register me as going with
the skeptics.

To quote in part:

PASADENA, Calif. - To further extend humankinds reach into the cosmos 
during the next century, future planetary missions will depend on
establishing 
robotic outposts, Edward Stone, director of the NASA Jet Propulsion
Laboratory 
said Tuesday.

Speaking at the 46th annual meeting of the American Astronautical Society, 
Stone said such outposts are a necessary next step in the 40-year history of
exploring the solar system.

Let me paraphrase to see if I understand you.  You seem to be saying
that creatures at one star care only about the energy and metals at
that star.  Thus the only interest they have in other stars is to
collect metal from those stars and bring it back home.  This interest
is temporary, because eventually they have more metal at home than you
can use, given their limited local energy.  Also, they have no interest
in the energy at other stars, because energy is too expensive to
immediately transport or to store awaiting a low cost opportunity.

Empirically, I think this predicts that we will not see metal planets
around visible stars.  This is a prediction we should be able to
verify in the next twenty years or so.  I presume you use "metal"
in the usual astrophysical sense of everything but H and He?

It also predicts we will not find effective ways to transport or
store energy.  But how hard would it be to surround a star with a
parabolic mirror to direct starlight to a different system?  Or to
power a laser directed there?  Perhaps you want to argue that the
local demand for energy will also satiate, as well as the demand

For myself, I find that my self image developed very early and with little 
conscious direction, and have found it quite a useful part of my modeling of 
the universe.  I often frame things in a very egocentric manner, not 
necessarily out of a sense of my own importance, but rather due to my 
intimate familiarity with all things Glen.  By relating everything to myself, 
I have a quasi-stable common point of reference from which I can begin to 
explore the universe.  Also, my self image has grown and developed over the 
years, becoming fuller and richer and deeply connected by associations to som 
much of life.  Does this mean I see through "Glen"-colored glasses?  Probably 
to a certain extent, but I have always had the capacity to imagine and 
empathize what other states than Glen-ness are like, so I can use that to 
check my perceptions (which I often do).

BTW, have you been using one of those ASIMs in your posts here?  Because to 
me you've always seemed to have quite a strong sense of self in them.  Or 
maybe I'm just projecting onto your blank canvas<g>.

Ten billion years seems far too short a time for a billion

The space of possible things to think is so big that I'm sure
there are many things a Jupiter Brain could think of that even
much bigger brains that have been thinking for ten billion years
would have never gotten around to.

OK, a show of a hands here; raise your hand if you think that being
a Jupiter brain is such a pitiful existence that a merciful creator
would never even create you in the first place (you're better off dead).

So it seems you agree that visible stars with metal planets, and which
have been that way for a million years or more, almost surely don't have
local civilizations.  So the puzzle is, if there have been billions of
other civilizations around for billions of years, why haven't they
created "colony" civilizations around those stars?

Consciousness is irrelevant.  The question is, what strategies
does evolution reward with more reproduction?  Intelligent creatures
can more quickly figure out what those strategies are, with less
blind search, but it still remains that evolution selects for
creatures that adopt strategies that induce more reproduction.

Given the time-scales of billions of years you invoke, why is
it a problem if it takes a few thousand years to create a colony?
How can it be evolutionarily better not to reproduce at all via
colonies?

If there were trillions of creatures attempting to colonize
the universe, then maybe it wouldn't be worth the effort for
you to try as well.  But that would only be because you expected
it to all be already colonized by the time you got there.  You
can't use this, however, as an argument why these stars never get
colonized.  Why aren't all these stars taken, and so now dark?

We are pleased to announce we have published a new article at Journal of

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Hickman, "The Political Economy of Very Large Space Projects",
Journal of Transhumanism, Volume 4, November 1999.

While popular science writers typically describe the benefits to be derived
from their favorite very large space  development project in detail, their
treatment of the crucial initial capitalization of such projects is
typically sparse or implausible. Capitalization is a crucial problem for
these projects because the total capital investment required is very large
and the investment takes a very long time before producing economic returns.
"Chunky" investments are unattractive to most private investors and lenders.
Very large space development projects are best understood as massive public
works projects which are necessary to open frontiers. Despite the
libertarian sentiments in much of the popular science writing on very large
space development projects, government would likely have to play a large
role in capitalizing such projects.

Agency to prepare bill to ban human cloning

Yomiuri Shimbun

The Science and Technology Agency will shortly start work on a bill to
prohibit human cloning, which will be submitted to the regular Diet session
in January, government sources said Wednesday.

In its draft of the final report compiled the same day, a subcommittee on
cloning of the Science and Technology Council's bioethics committee said
that human cloning should be proscribed by a law that is legally binding.

The report is to be submitted soon to a meeting of the bioethics committee.
The agency will then discuss penalties and punishments for violators of the
law with related ministries and agencies prior to preparing a bill for
submission to the Diet.

The council is an advisory organ to the prime minister.

It will be the first time in the country that life science-related studies
have been regulated by law.

Since the birth of Dolly the sheep in Britain in 1996--the first cloned
mammal--many people have become worried about the technology being used to
clone human beings.

Britain, Germany and many other major nations have legally banned human
cloning. However, in the United States, although discussions have been held
and bills have been presented, so far the U.S. Congress has passed no legal
restrictions.

Though lagging behind other major nations in this field, Japan has chosen to
implement controls similar to those of European nations.

During discussion on the draft of the final report, members of the cloning
subpanel concluded that cloning human is of no positive use, and is
therefore not worth doing.

It also said cloning violates respect for human life and poses safety
problems for those born as a result of cloning technology.

The subpanel also pointed out that using government guidelines as a control
measure would only influence doctors and researchers who belong to
institutions, and would not affect the private sector.

Thus, it concluded it is necessary to legally prohibit operations to create
human fetuses at an early stage of development by use of cloning technology
and then implant them in human or animal bodies.

This decision was obviously influenced by the fact that in the United
States, which has no laws to restrict human cloning, some private
institutions have publicly announced that they are willing to clone humans.

However, the committee also said that the law should be reviewed in three to
five years, taking into consideration future technological development. This
is because means of restricting human cloning as well as public opinion may
change, according to the sources.

Meanwhile, the committee avoided reaching a conclusion on the cultivation of
embryonic stem cells (ES cells) that are used to create fetuses. These cells
can be grown into human internal organs, utilizing the same techniques used
in the human cloning. This is because such studies may be useful in other
fields in the future, according to the sources.

They decided to continue to discuss the matter in a subcommittee of the
bioethics committee that specializes in human fetuses.

In August 1998, the Education Ministry banned the application of cloning
technology to humans, even if the fetuses were not brought to full term,
under the ministry's guidelines.

However, the guidelines proved to be insufficient, when it was revealed
earlier this month that a research group at Tokyo University of Agriculture
had carried out experiments despite government guidelines.

Furthermore, it became obvious that there were no effective measures to
prevent further such experiments.

On what basis are you assuming that all worthwhile private researchers
will join *your* research effort? I'm assuming private, nonpublishing
research efforts will be fragmented, and without regular publication and
discussion in open forums, many labs will be entirely unaware of the
existence of many if not most non-publishing labs.

Communication is only as secure as its participants. Such a network will
be extraordinarily leaky, since you will doubtless be employing many
scientists trained in the conventional, publication-oriented style of
scientific research which currently dominates all fields of research.

Of course I'm up in arms about that, and have been for decades. But this
is utterly irrelevant. 

Apparently you think that *all* the necessary basic scientific
research required to establish a mind-producing society offplanet
has already been done, and that only engineering work is needed
now.  I wish that were the case, but given that none of this stuff
has been tested yet... I suspect that taking a technology from the
theoretical applied science phase into the engineering phase will
generally be the best way of turning up flaws in existing theory,
and that at least a few fundamental scientific results (with
according modifications to scientific theory) will turn up in the
course of the engineering work.

Frankly, I doubt your contention that secrecy will not slow down
the engineering work (although you seem to concede that it would
slow down work in basic science), but our difference does seem to
come down to my expectation that implementation of what are now
only sophisticated designs on paper *will* lead us to discover new
things about the structure of matter, just as it has throughout
our history as a science-practicing species, whereas you seem to
expect (for what reasons I know not) that moving a whole fundamentally
new technology from the drawing board into reality will result in
*no* important new discoveries about the structure of matter.

I was arguing against secrecy, not for peer review. People can
publish their own stuff on the web, and peers can decide whether
to link to it or mirror it or not. There is no need for peer review
to slow down publication...  it's only a credentialing mechanism,
after all.

Uh, vaccination is a way of activating the immune system to respond to a
living organism. Botulin toxin is a molecule, not an organism. Perhaps
you will find a way to anull the toxicity of cyanide too? That would be
a neat trick.  B-toxin kills more quickly than bacteria could
sequestrate it.  Yes, yes, eventually you might have an active defense
in your bloodstream, ready and waiting, but post facto administrations
of nanotech would not be timely enough to help here.

But all of this is beside the point, since people will soon be
designing new toxins as fast as defenses against the traditional
ones are developed. I picked the B-toxin in DMSO example because
it's a weapon that could be developed for trivial time and cost in
any prokaryote biotech lab. (Note, prokaryote biotech is *much*
cheaper and simpler than the eukaryote biotech we see in the
prolongevity news.)

Oh, I agree. But that doesn't mean that these things are not currently
threats, and it doesn't mean that they will not remain threats until
sometime after defenses have been developed AND tested.

I highly recommend the other papers at Nick's site also; his work on
smart contracts is far more important than this essay, but this essay
just happened to be relevant to the discussion at hand.

Okay, but you still aren't convincing Mr. Bad over there, who grew
up in a Eurasian battlefield and has since seized a small national
government and used it to obtain a few large multinational
corporations. He's been kicked around since birth, enjoys human
company only to tyrannize it, and generally thinks that human beings
stink, with (in his case) pretty good reason.

Uh. Genome sequencing is hardly the same thing as producing and
testing wholly artificial diets for indefinite use. And the only
test of any of this stuff that will do for an engineering trial
before taking the system off into orbit to live in it indefinitely
is closure, long-term carefully monitored ecosystem closure. Again,
I see zero economic pressure for the development and testing of
this technology. Genome sequencing isn't even remotely related to
what I was talking about. You were talking about molecular sorting...
how do you get from there to genome sequencing?

Well, that's fine, but how come I don't see any market going on right
now? Where are the closures? You're promising me the economic pressure
will develop, but I've heard similar arguments in the early 1970s that
as soon as the planet's population hit six billion, there would be a
frantic push for space. I'm unconvinced. I've read Julian Simon; frankly
I think population "pressure" will just make things even easier for us,
so we can procrastinate space development until long after the means of
inexpensive destruction of the current (only) biosphere have been
developed and deployed.

If you want to have this technology available (by which I mean
thoroughly tested in real physical situations, *not* just in computer
simulation) in ten or twenty years, when we will probably need it, we
need to start developing it *now*. Yet, right *now*, there is zero
economic pressure for its development and testing. This is a problem.

Uh, yeah, but we wanted to do the simulations so we could get into
space, didn't we? Cart before the horse and all.

Hmm. I think you misinterpret what I meant by my oriinal remark.  Let me try
to clarify.

Robert was talking in general terms about the cost of good in a far future
with advanced nanotech and AI.  In this context he remarked that the cost of
goods is ultimately constrained by their energy and matter content.  I
offered that the constraint is actually the labor content of said goods -
energy and matter content are important only to the extent that they require
effort to produce.

Now, obviously there are contexts in which this is not the case.  My remark
was actually intended to apply only to societies which are relatively
advanced (i.e. post-industrial revolution) and are large enough to support a
robust market, but are still sufficiently small that they do not experience
scarcity of plentiful natural resources like sunlight and rocks.

In that situation I would say that sentient labor is the major expense for
the economy as a whole, and that reducing the labor content of a product is
the key to reducing its production cost.  Scarcity premiums, monetary
distortions, and other such issues are transitory in nature, and in a
healthy economy they will be minor factors in any event.  Profit is more
enduring, but it usually represents a major cost issue only in very risky or
very uncompetitive markets, and both of these conditions tend to be
transitory in a society with rapid technological progress.

The reason I mention indirect labor costs is simply to remind readers that
the labor content of a product is usually much greater than it appears.  For
example, the labor content of your widget includes the time of the engineers
that design it, the workers who build it, the staff who keep the company
running, the people (at another company) who mine, refine and process the
materials that go into it, the transportation workers who deliver said
materials, the people who design and build the machinery used to manufacture
the widget, et cetera.

Huh?  I thought the labor theory of value was discredited along
with the rest of Marxism.

You'll find them hard at work on the sci.skeptic, sci.astro, alt.origins and 
alt.atheist newsgroups.  Not much energy left for us.
(end of reproduction)

It is only a matter of time before transhumanism and extropianism is taken 
up as a target for evangelical criticism, mark my words.  In time there will 
be at least several evangelical websites that will have articles denouncing 
transhumanism.

I am a Mormon and I can tell you a huge amount of energy goes toward 
debating my church.  Of course with the strong Mormon missionary effort this 
is seen as a means of dealing with it.  Video programs and books are also 
regularly cranked out in this effort.  This is done out of a desire in their 
eyes to do what is right I believe but also a great deal of money is 
generated doing this.

Evangelicals like to find new pastures to criticize and so it is just a 
matter of time till extropianism is targeted.  Expect to be discussed on the 
Bob Larson show, the LaLonde Brothers tv program, the John Ankerberg tv 
program, Jeremiah films as well as by others.  These programs will be 
broadcast nation and even world-wide on a regular basis.  And in time, Hal 
Lindsey, the LaLonde brothers, Dave Hunt and others will be writing books 
about extropianism and transhumanism that will sell many copies, believe me.

The Extropian Institute will probably be focused on since in is a formal 
organization with some interesting individuals in it.  I am sure these shows 
and books will single out Max and Natasha.  Down the road I expect extropian 
leaders being invited to debates on these evangelical programs which will 
later be broadcast nationally and also sold to the viewership.

I believe the motives of these evangelicals in the mass media to be largely 
sincere actually.  They feel compelled to bring to the notice of the 
membership anything against their paradigm so they can refute it.  A 
comparison will be made of extropianism against evangelical interpretations 
of the Bible to show where transhumanism differs and thereby is clearly 
wrong and so wicked in their view.

Ironically, this entire effort of theirs will lead to far greater exposure 
of extropianism.  It could even backfire in that some adults and expecially 
teens may find themselves attracted to transhumanism.  But on the whole it 
will have a uniting effect on the flock which is a major desired effect of 
such endeavors.

It is just a matter of time for these events to happen.  It should be very 
interesting to watch them play out.


Sincerely,

John Grigg

I'm not talking about imitating a natural biosystem. I'm talking
about constructing a closed ecosystem, which is the phrase that we
use to describe the kind of systems you are advocating also. My
argument has been that there have been only a few closure experiments
done so far, and therefore that "all experience to date" is simply
too little information to warrant the kind of assertions you are
making.

Oh, so you're *admitting* that you have no evidence, and that you
haven't even studied the empirical results of the various closures
that preceded Biosphere 2 (all of which were much less ambitious
and closer to your desired criteria).  In that case, we are in
complete agreement. You're indulging in wishful thinking, and it
was misunderstanding on my part to think that you were claiming
that the technology already exists and has been tested.

In the meantime, you might want to look into the Yevgeny Shepelev
closure of 1961 (try google.com, and you might even find out about
other early closure experiments that I haven't come across yet).
The history of these experiments is pitifully short and our current
ignorance of closed systems (such as our lives will depend on
utterly if we are to leave this planet permanently in our
current form) is woeful.

I'm arguing that we need more research. If you're arguing that we
don't, then please point me to where I can find the empirical
results that support your arguments. In this crucial field, the
basic scientific research has barely even begun.

Your term "sentient labor" is a bit unclear with regard to machines.
What would you predict would happen to costs as more labor is taken on
by machines?  Would it matter if the machines are as smart as people,
or even smarter?

It would seem on the one hand that you could just treat them like any
other tool, like a shovel.  Count how long the tool lasts and what
its own production costs are (including labor to design it, etc.).
Include maintenance costs for the tool as well.  In the case of an AI,
maintenance costs might include time spent periodically refurbishing
and reorganizing the software state, elaborate versions of today's
garbage collection systems.  This might require the AI to, say, spend
time interacting with a high-information-quality environment, or to be
dormant while the software refreshes itself for another work period.

Or you can treat the AI like a person, and figure that its efforts
count as labor.  The wage it can earn will depend on how common such
labor is, which will in turn depend on the production costs for the AI.
Instead of maintenance costs, we say that the AI wants to spend time
engaging in recreation or sleep, and will seek a wage adequate for these
outside activities.

These seem to be two different ways of looking at the same situation,
but they apply the cost analysis in a completely different way.  Is
it really meaningful to say that all costs are due to labor, if it is
ambiguous what counts as labor?

Many people have argued that as machines take over more tasks, everything
will become cheaper because less labor is involved.  Lyle in his pages
argues that machines are, in effect, labor.  The mere fact of substituting
a machine for a human being does not inherently make products cheaper
because the machine has expenses just as people do.

Now, I think the flaw in Lyle's reasoning is that machines are designed
to have lower expenses and be more productive than people.  But he is
right in that the economic gain is not due directly to the subtitution
of a machine for a person, which an overly simplistic analysis based
on costs-as-labor might suggest.  Rather, it is only when machines are
economically able to do the same work for less money that we have a
true savings.

Economic production is traditionally analyzed based on inputs of labor,
raw materials, and capital.  Perhaps in the future the distinction
between labor and capital will become blurry in the case of robots.
At that time we might see that people, too, are in a sense another form
of capital.  The sharp and historically contentious distinction between
labor and capital may come to be seen as an illusion.

So those Shadows "killed" Kosh with their bare claws, but nothing else could
touch him?  Bah!  I think Vorlons are exactly as bulletproof as those
invisible monsters the Shadows like to breed - you just have to use some
real firepower on them, that's all.

Of course, I don't recall the episode you're referring to, so maybe I've
missed something.

I can forgive any authors for not having a Singularity - it kind of gets in
the way of the story, after all.  However, they should at least give their
aliens some token degree of progress (preferably something comparable to
20th century Earth).  As far as I can tell the B5 universe has some kind of
inverse exponential progress, where the more you know the harder it is to
learn something new.  How else do we explain the fact that the Mimbari lost
only one vessel in their genocidal war against humanity, but the young races
are actually able to inflict significant casualties on the Shadows?

Of course it was necessary for the plot, but to me that is just a sign that
B5 is a fantasy story dressed up in SF trappings.  Nothing wrong with that,
I suppose, but it leaves the Vorlons with no more 'older and wiser'
credibility than Tolkien's elves.

Someone else said this too, but Billy is talking about costs, not value.
Value will of course depend on how much people want the product, but
costs are independent of how much it is desired.  So I don't think it
is correct to compare Billy's arguments to Marxism.

How hard is it to clone a human? I heard, from a biology major, that it's
*relatively* easy, that she could do it herself with a few thousand dollars
worth of equipment. Does anyone know if this is correct? If so, I recommend
to everyone reading this to learn as much about cloning methods as possible,
if you are in a position to do so. Cloning for the purpose of procreation is
pretty pointless, unless you have medical problems making you infertile. Its
use in anti-aging technology is understated though. Stem cells which new,
young organs could be grown from would be rejection-proof if cloned from the
individual they are to be placed into. It's also possible that neural stem
cells could hold as much promise in combating general aging-related dementia
as they do for specific diseases like alzheimer's and parkinson's, or maybe
even enhance memory and cognitive function in normal individuals. Given the
hysteria over cloning, and its imminent banning (I'm 99% confident it will
be banned for several decades at least), it's important to set up an
infastructure of some sort in which research and medical usage of cloning
can be done illegally.

In fact, John, two young Mormon fellows visit me every week-end -- not for
the purpose of religious conversion, but to discuss theological matters and
the relationship of Religion to Society.  Of course, I have been educated in
the Doctrine in the process, and consider it a valuable addition to my know-
ledge base.  At least my visitors do NOT have a seige mentality, but a very
mature attitude toward ideological wars.

My question is: what wait?  Why not launch a non-lethal pre-emptive strike?
Mission: to demonstrate that an ideological attack would be self-defeating,
and to emphasize common points, like the belief in the perfectibility of human
life (without getting lost in purely semantic issues)?

Real in the sense that it is actually flying, and also, seriously cool!
It's a Japanese coaxial helicopter with four small engines.  Ultimately simple
controls, an it might even go on sale soon.  This is the way to beat the
traffic on Hwy. 237 (on the way to your Space Command job in the Blue Cube at
Lockheed) 8^}

Specs: 155 Lbs empty, 40Hp, 13.1' rotor diameter, 185LB pilot max, 485 Lb Gross.

I'll also mention the coaxial helicopter kit I mentioned some weeks ago, another
proper flying contraption for the intrepid aeronaut:

	Neal Stephenson has just published a new book called _In The
Beginning...Was The Command Line_.  Stephenson is best known for his three
extropic novels _Crytonomicon_, _The Diamond Age_ and _Snow Crash_, but is
apparently trying his hand at non-fiction.  This book appears to focus on
the history of computation and its effects on society; knowing Stephenson's
style, it should be interesting.

It should be noted that his "black hole" is not really based on
standard GR, so the measurements do not have to be equal. After all,
it isn't even black, since it let's through photons but not electrons.
The more I think about it, the sillier it appears.

It looks like we got the Leonid meteor storm. 2500 meteors per hour!! The
predictions seemed to be right on. 

I hope that some of you looked up, and saw them. 

(I couldn't- it was snowing ..I'm very frustrated about the weather 
here....)

Capital and raw materials are not infinite, and are
thus -always- in a position of relative scarcity.
There are millions and millions of possible ways of
allocating them (including leaving raw materials
unexploited for future use.)

Due to this relative scarcity raw materials and
capital have a value. This value is
determined/discovered in the market place by balancing
various supply and demand curves. 

Some useful economics terms:

opportunity cost
supply and demand
scarcity
markets

Do you mean expand geographically or reproductively?
Are you claiming that natural selection operates at
the group or societal level on human beings? 
Do you have any data to support this assertion
(whichever one you are making)?

It appears to me that recent examples of highly  
expansionist human groups or societies [expansionist
in the terms discussed, that is- capturing/controlling
resources] have fared quite badly. The examples I can
think of are Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, Soviet
Union.

In the scenario proposed [i.e. a nanotech society
advanced enough to be capable of providing
reality-level VR and an end to scarcity] an individual
motivated strongly by the desire for power over others
or "the material world" who could not sublimate that
desire in a VR simulation would be extremely dangerous
to all other members of that society. They will have
vast powers to deal with that threat, and probably
would.

And this is assisted by colonialism [intense
competition over disputed resources] how? In a society
where resources are abundant the control of resources
conveys no influence. On would become influential by
maintaining a reputation for reason, creativity,
rationality, helpfulness, etc.

I saw this machine, and talked with the inventor at the EAA convention last
summer. He said kits would begin at around $30K US. THe copter is capable
of landing safely on any two engines, and has chip detection in the gearbox
to warn of wear. Looked like a fun gadget, at least for sunny daylight use.
It's not a true helicopter, in that it has no blade pitch controls. It's
essentially two big propellers that you hang from. If all the engines quit,
it could autorotate you straight down, without much control sideways. I
believe they were going to put a ballistic parachute on top of the rotors,
in case of catastrophe.

The November NASA Tech Briefs (page 16) had a blurb on another personal
VTOL craft - a twin ducted prop 'exoskeleton' with embedded intelligence
that could refuse to operate except for autorized users. The company is
Millennium Jet of Santa Clara, California. Sounds a bit too overly complex
in the processor department for my liking, and it can't autorotate as the
coaxial machine could. Definitely a case for a parachute...

John, the Ankerbergs, and the Teletubbie-bashing Fallwell's will only whack 
at Ttranshumanism & Extropianism if it plays in Peoria. Why should they 
abandon their focus on Liberals, Secular Humanists, Satanism and abortion; if

Yes, and even then we need not have a sudden "singularity" transition.
(Though see http://hanson.gmu.edu/aigrow.pdf)  And we need not be
anywhere near a Nano-Santa "Post-Scarcity" society many hope for.

For economists, this distinction is already very blurred.  Economists
think of "labor" as the time people put into work, and "human capital"
as all the investments that people make in themselves which make them
more productive, such as education and health.  Economists have long
accepted that most capital is human capital.  All that other stuff,
machines, companies, buildings, etc. actually gets less income than
human capital.

I disagree with Greg here (and appear to agree with Curt Adams).  I think that
"ought" questions are a subset of "is" questions. There is some matter of
fact regarding what it is that I want, and what it is that I would want if I
understood myself and the world better.  If you knew enough about my brain
and the world I live in, you could figure out what I want.  And as far as I
can tell, all interesting moral/ethical/ought questions are equivalent to
questions about what various creatures want.

"Science" and "humanities" are both approaches that are in principle capable
of helping us find out what we want.  The post-modern is one particular
style within the humanities, and some post-modern approaches are likely more
effective than others.  Most likely there are also several approaches which
are best described as neither science nor humanities.  The question is
which, if any, approach is more effective in helping us find out what we
want.  And we should keep in mind that people tend to exaggerate the
differences between approaches.

I haven't seen a thing (due to the weather), but I have
experienced a severe heisenbug day yesterday...

It looks like all events that disturb the earth's
magnetosphere have a very bad influence on computers,
especially those that don't have very good grounding.

I've had about 15 bezerko mouse / kbd events yesterday
and segfaults for processes that usually run stable for
weeks. Elsewhere in the world other people have seen
strange events concerning computers too -- a sparc
classic crashing _twice_ in a day, multiple errors in
computers that otherwise run without an error for
weeks on end, etc...

Only time for a quick note this morning -- I hope to be able to write some 
more on this issue this weekend . . .

For now, let me ask you a question, Robin: Can we question that what we DO 
want is what we SHOULD want?

 Researchers Extend Lifespan of Mice
 By WILLIAM McCALL
 Associated Press Writer

     Italian scientists have genetically engineered mice to live up
 to 35 percent longer than normal _ an experiment that offers the
 strongest evidence yet that aging in mammals is controlled by a
 genetic switch.
     The researchers at the European Institute of Oncology in Milan
 deleted a gene in the mice that makes them vulnerable to cell
 damage caused by oxygen.
     Equally important, the mice suffered no apparent side effects.
     Other scientists called the study a major step forward in
 understanding the aging process. The study was published in
 Thursday's issue of the journal Nature.
     ``They hit a milestone in aging research with this study _
 they've found a genetic intervention in mice that make them live
 longer without any side effects,'' said Leonard Guarente of the
 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
     Genetic control of longevity had already been confirmed in worms
 and flies, but not in mammals, which have their own aging process.
     ``We now know for sure that longevity is genetically
 controlled,'' said the study's author, Pier Giuseppe Pelicci.
 Researchers breeded the mice without a gene that produces protein
 vulnerable to cell damage from oxidation.
     The findings could mark a departure from one of the basic rules
 of biology _ namely, that if you tinker with a gene or other factor
 in an animal to add some kind of benefit, it usually comes at a
 cost somewhere else.
     For example, scientists can increase mouse longevity by about 30
 percent by tightly restricting diet and slowing down the
 metabolism, but it comes at a cost of decreased fertility and size.
     The Italian researchers could find no other problems with the
 mutant mice, though Pelicci admitted that the gene's entire
 function is unknown, so problems could still arise.
     The researchers are now investigating the possibility of
 blocking the age-controlling protein chemically, which could lead
 to the development of life-extending drugs.
     But Pelicci warned: ``How many times have we found something in
 mice that was not the case in humans?''
     Oxidation has been suspected in aging since 1956, when it was
 first proposed that free radicals _ unstable molecules with an
 unpaired electron _ attack cells. Oxidative damage has been
 implicated in forms of cancer and in heart disease.
     Joe McCord of the Webb-Waring Institute for Biomedical Research
 at the University of Colorado, who in 1969 helped prove that
 oxidation was involved in cell damage, called the Italian study
 ``fascinating and very significant,'' but noted that oxidation also
 regulates beneficial cellular functions as well as destructive
 ones.
     ``The balance that works best in the laboratory may not be the
 best balance if the animal is dealing with wound healing and
 infections and other kinds of stress,'' he said.

Yes, we can question the correlation between what we want and what we think we
should want.
But, should we question it as much as we do, or do we question it more than we
should?

How would you think this distinction be applied when intelligent
robots, or AIs, or uploaded/simulated humans start to become available?
What would be the distinguishing factor which would make us call the time
they spend "labor"?  Presumably robot working hours are not currently
considered labor.

Perhaps what I really am asking is, what is the fundamental purpose of
the distinction between labor and other inputs, and how can that purpose
best be served when these lines begin to blur?

Has anyone read the excellent sci-fi book entitled Einstein's Bridge by Prof. 
Cramer from UC Berkeley (I believe).   Written in the mid-90's, its ends up 
being another 'go back in time and change the outcome of the earth' (the 
protagonists had opened up a bridge, courtesy of the SSC (super collider) in 
the early years of the 21st century, and nightmarish nano-creatures from a 
hive-like intelligence quickly enter via the bridge and begin destroying the 
earth's inhabitants.) Cramer's premise was that by going back in time, say 15 
years, possibly in an alternate universe, the SSC project was stopped (as it 
was in our reality), and henceforth, humanity is saved.
The question Cramer puts forth is that, when the scientists went back in time 
15 years, to the good ol 90's, the original earth's reality (with the hive 
nano-creatures) therefore never happened.  If so, does that mean that the enti
re Universe in that initial reality also never happened?  I always get bogged 
down with alternate reality stories in that Cramer, and others seem to me to 
imply that only the local reality (viz, the earth, perhaps the solar system) 
is forever changed.  Well, then, what happens to the rest of the universe???
Thanks for any inquiries.

Government scales back its lead role in supercomputing
By Mark Hall


PORTLAND, Ore. -- The U.S. government once dominated supercomputer development
but has surrendered that leadership to industry. That retreat has put
supercomputing technology at risk, according to analysts at International Data
Corp. (IDC).


The analysts spoke here at SC99, formerly known as the Supercomputing
Conference.


During a roundtable yesterday, IDC analyst Debra Goldfarb said the government
lacks a single vision to give supercomputing vendors direction. This has put
commercial users of high-performance computers in the role of providing
leadership to research and development for the highest end of the computer
industry.


"The government has shrunk in its influence at the high end," Goldfarb said.


Analysts said political and economic pressures have contributed to this decline,
in addition to the government's and vendors' insistence on building systems that
serve commercial interests as well.


"The government recognizes that commercial applications need to be taken into
account," said Earl Joseph, also an analyst at Framingham, Mass.-based IDC.


But both analysts agreed that the strategic nature of supercomputers makes it
imperative for the government to step in and work with vendors to continue to
advance the state of the art. The problem is that inside the government,
"religious wars" exist about which direction supercomputer development needs to
take, they said.


For example, at the three major U.S. weapons laboratories -- Lawrence Livermore,
Los Alamos and Sandia -- budget and political considerations forced researchers
to build only a single, shared 100-TFLOP computer destined for delivery in 2004
instead of one for each lab, as some had hoped for.


Dona Crawford, a director at Sandia National Laboratory, told an audience here
yesterday that her research team is trying to construct this system -- and the
network that will connect it to the three labs -- with as many industry-standard
components as possible to keep costs down. She said working with "lowest common
denominator" technologies, such as TCP/IP, are "barriers for us to tackle."


Joseph said, "Commoditization of technology, whether processors or operating
systems, is distracting us from doing real science."

Sure, within a context where we care about what we want.
That is, when it makes sense to say "I don't want to want that."
Such things make sense when we realize that we are not atomic,
but made of parts, spread across space and time.

So I now can want my future self to take a long term view of things,
while my future self might rather focus on short term payoffs.
Or my conscious mind can want my subconscious mind to not get
so hung up on sex all the time.  And so on.

Saying that I "as a whole" want something is analogous to saying
that the US "as a whole" wants something.  Sometimes negotiations
happen within the US and the US ends up taking some actions.  For
example, the US might go to war.  Similarly, negotiations within
myself can result in Robin making choices that can be interpreted
as Robin wanting something.

Bulk matter and energy are so plentiful that nothing short of megascale
engineering can make a dent in the available supply.  What is scarce is raw
materials that have actually been extracted and prepared for use, and the
reason they are scarce relative to demand is that an individual can consume
far more resources than he can produce.

You really ought to look into things a little before assuming that someone
on this list is completely ignorant.  I'm quite familiar with all of these
terms and the theory behind them, and I see no contradiction with what I'm
saying.  If you think I'm wrong, make an argument.  However, I suggest that
you carefully read what I actually said first - your criticism definitely
seems directed at a different argument than the one I made.

I find that pretty surprising, Robin.  I might be willing to grant that you 
and I have read enough game theory to have the underlying chain of 
reasoning in our heads to be able to get from our model of the nature of 
thinking agents to simple rules like tit-for-tat, or the golden rule, but I 
sure don't see how Joe or Jane on-the-street's desires lead directly to 
reasonable ethical rules.  Care to say more?

An ethical rule seems uninteresting to me if no creature in the universe
has any inclination to follow it.  But if some creature does have such
an inclination, it seems that is because the creature in some sense "wants"
to follow the ethical rule.  So ethics only seems interesting to the
extent some creatures want to be ethical.

For the thousandth time, it's not a question of what can or can't
be done.

Newton's Third Law doesn't put any limit on how much force can be
exerted.  Newton doesn't say anything about what can or can't be
done.  He simply asserts that there will always be an equal and
opposite force.  That's the kind of point I'm making in
Geniebusters.  It's a general point about the structure of the
situation.

But some people just don't get it.

In the first book of Euclid's Elements, one encounters the
proposition that in an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the
equal sides are themselves equal.  In the old days before the SAT,
this proposition was used to screen students.  It was called the
pons asinorum, which means "bridge of asses," the point being that
a horse will cross a bridge, but a donkey won't (unless you
blindfold him).  Some students could learn arithmetic, but when you
gave them an abstract proposition in geometry, they just didn't get
it. They would come to that point and stop, like an ass stops
before a bridge.

That article does not address the points raised at the page
I referenced.

As I read it, the AIDS dissidents are split into two main camps.

Duesberg and others, who accept that Luc Montagnier and
Robert Gallo had isolated HIV, that is, that they
had proven the existence of a new, exogenously acquired
retrovirus from AIDS patients. Duesberg then proceeds to
argue that HIV is a harmless passenger virus. The Harris
paper you cited address these arguments.

The other main camp is the Perth Group
[Eleni Papadopulos-Eleopulos, Valendar F. Turner,
John M. Papadimitriou, etc.], whose arguments I
link with the above page.  They point out that there are
well established protocols for viral isolation, and that "HIV"
was never isolated by those standards.  As far as I can tell,
Harris does not address that issue in the paper you cited.

I think he must have addressed these arguments in another
paper, however. Stephan Lanka, wrote an article called
"HIV: Reality or Artifact?", summarizing the views of
the Perth Group, and then a follow-up called
"Dr. Lanka Chats With Dr. Harris", subtitled " Dr. Stefan
Lanka answers critic Steven B. Harris M.D.'s rejoinder to
his paper, "HIV:Reality or Artifact". Both papers are linked
from my page.  I have not been able to find the rejoinder
by Harris. If you come across it, I would be glad to put a
link to it between the other two by Lanka.

Some recent developments have bolstered the arguments of
The Perth Group, IMHO.

In their 1983 study Montagnier and his colleagues took the
supernatant from cultures containing tissue derived from AIDS
patients and banded it in sucrose density gradients. They
claimed that the 1.16 gm/ml band represented purified virus
[Barr-Sinoussi F, Chermann JC, Rey F. (1983). Isolation
of a T-Lymphotrophic Retrovirus from a patient at Risk for
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).
Science 220:868-871]

Some of the proteins and RNAs were considered to represent
the retroviral proteins and retroviral genome respectively.
Subsequently the proteins were used as antigens for
the antibody tests and the nucleic acids for hybridization and
PCR studies.

However, for some unknown reason, up to 1997, neither
Montagniers group nor anybody else published electron
micrographs of the 1.16gm/ml band showing that the band
contained nothing else but particles with the morphological
characteristics of retroviral particles, that is, purified particles.

The reason for this, at least for the Montagnier group, became
obvious in an interview Montagnier gave in July 1997 to the
French journalist Djamel Tahi. When Montagnier was asked
why such electron micrographs were not published, his answer
was because, even after "Roman effort", they could see no particles
with "morphology typical of retroviruses".
[Tahi D. (1998). Did Luc Montagnier discover HIV? Text of
video interview with Professor Luc Montagnier at the Pasteur
Institute July 18th 1997. Continuum 5:30-34]

In March of 1997, for the first time in the history of AIDS,
elusive electron microscope images of 'HIV' collected or
'banded' at the official density required for retroviruses,
1.16 gm/ml, were published, by a research group in Germany.
The electronmicrographs disclose "major contaminants" in "pure HIV".

http://www.virusmyth.com/aids/award.htm is an electron
microscope of this cellular debris. Compare that EM with a proper
viral isolate: http://www.virusmyth.com/aids/news/edhlettercont.htm.

Two 1997 articles in Virology discuss the problems the newly
released EM's raise: HIV expert Hans Gelderblom of Berlin's
Robert Koch Institute, whose photos of non-banded 'HIV'
material have been the industrial benchmark since 1987,
co-authored the first paper which describes the
contamination as "an excess of vesicles" - particles of cellular proteins,
that may contain DNA or RNA. In a consecutive paper, a
US research team from the AIDS Vaccine Programme in
Maryland reveal carefully, "It is unknown how these cellular proteins
associate with the virus" and warn, "The presence of microvesicles in
purified retroviruses has practical implications": both teams discuss the
resulting nonspecifity of  HIV tests.

[Gluschankof P, Mondor I, Gelderblom HR, Sattentau QJ. (1997).
Cell membrane vesicles are a major contaminant of gradient-enriched
human immunodeficiency virus type-1 preparations.
Virol. 230:125-133.

Bess JW, Gorelick RJ, Bosche WJ, Henderson LE, Arthur LO.
(1997). Microvesicles are a source of contaminating cellular proteins
found in purified HIV-1 preparations. Virol. 230:134-144.]

The questions then arise:

1. How is it possible to claim proof for retroviral purification
and thus for the existence of HIV?

2. How is it possible to consider the proteins which banded at
1.16gm/ml to be the proteins of a unique retrovirus, HIV,
and to use them as antigens in antibody tests to prove
infection with a deadly retrovirus, HIV?

3. How is it possible to consider the RNAs which banded at
1.16gm/ml represents the genome of a unique retrovirus and
to use these as probes and primers for hybridization and PCR
tests to prove infection with this virus and in fact to measure
the viral load?

Montagnier and later, Gallo, did not
see particles with "morphology typical of retroviruses".
However, because they saw evidence of reverse
transcriptise activity in the debris that banded at the density
characteristic of viruses, they went ahead and claimed they
had isolated a new virus, later named "HIV" and developed
antibody tests using the proteins from this debris.  RT activity
alone, however, is not sufficient to prove viral isolation.

Human cells, in response to oxidative stress [like constant exposure
to toxins or foreign proteins from injection of impure drugs like
heroin or non-synthetic blood clotting factor, or receptive anal sex]
can produce cellular debris and microvesicles. These arise from
within [endogenous], and are not infectious virus. Some of these
can also settle out at the 1.16 g/ml band characteristic of virus particles.

What we call HIV could be a product of the bodys own genetic material.
Each one of us carries genetic remnants of ancient infections in our
genome. These remnants are usually referred to as human endogenous
retroviruses or HERVs. [Just this week, Dr. Cullen, a Howard Hughes
Investigator, published an article in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Science about a HERV recently discovered that is similar
to "HIV." ]

Its now recognized that HERVs are likely involved in
a number of biological processes, including the way cells
in the body differentiate. There is also preliminary
evidence that HERVs may be involved in some disease
processes that affect the bodys immune system.

There is also evidence that HERVs can be activated by a
variety of factors such as chemicals, radiation and viruses.
If cells get damaged by toxic insults, HERVs may be
awakened from their ancient slumber. "HIV" may well be a
byproduct of that type of cellular damage.

The HIV antibody test might simply be picking up on
human-produced HIV material. In this case, a positive
test would mean that cells of the body had been
sufficiently damaged to generate a reaction. A positive test
would be a marker of disease  not necessarily that
HIV is the cause of AIDS.

If Harris (or anyone else) could reference EM's which
show a proper viral isolate, and confirm that the DNA or
RNA extracted from that viral isolate codes for all the
proteins; then step one of proving that a new virus,
HIV, caused a syndrome, AIDS, would be met.
It would mean there was a candidate virus isolated
from sick patients. Then experiments could be done that
satisfy Koch's Postulates.  Until a virus is isolated, how
can one productively argue about whether that virus does or
does not cause a disease?

Game theory is useless unless you know the payoffs ahead of time.
Those payoffs--which are inputs to game theory, not outputs--are
nothing more than personal desires.  Game theory can only tell you
how to achieve those desires, not what they should be.  Results
like Axelrod's are very suggestive, and they shed light on how
things like the golden rule may have evolved; but don't forget
that Axelrod's robots had only one goal: get money.  He discovered
that the best way to do that is often to play nice; that does
nothing to support whether "playing nice" is or isn't a worthy
goal in its own right.

Simple desires of ordinary humans are a powerful and fruitful
base from which to reason about ethical questions.  Take this
statement of J.R.Molloy, for example:

  "A scientific approach to making decisions together with other
  people, acting in the public sphere would, I imagine, eliminate
  biases which interfere with obtaining the most successful decisions."

He imagines, indeed, because that statement is so utterly 180-
degrees opposite of reality that its consequences can only exist
in his imagination.  We can confidently reason that this premise
will not lead us to rational conclusions about ethics.  Premises
more in tune with reality are likely to lead to better results.
Those premises most useful for ethical reasoning are those about
human desires: not lofty, theoretical, ideological desires like
peace and progress, but simple ones like food and sex that we can
observe the reality of directly.  What other realistic base can
there be?

In today's issue of the journal "Nature"  Pier Giuseppe Pelicci reports
that he used genetic engineering  to deactivate the p66 gene in mice.
The resulting mice lived 30% longer than the non engineered mice.
Doctor Pelicci suspects that the mechanism is similar to the one
that increases longevity in mice that  have a severe restriction
of calories in their diet except there are even fewer side effects,
the mice do no become very thin and they breed normally. He can
not find any down side to the mice at all but he speculates there must be
one someplace because otherwise evolution would already have found
this fix; he thinks it might cause a very slight decrease in fertility in young
mice but if it's there it's too small for him to see in his experiments. He also
says that the a drug  that blocks the protein produced by p66 should be easy
to find because it is similar to others that have already been found.

Just a year or two ago I thought it was a big deal when they found a genetic way
to increase the life of a worm even though it made the creature sluggish,
this was done with a mammal and if there are bad side effects they must
be very subtle. On first reading I'm damn impressed.

        The National Academy of Sciences Report "A Science Strategy for the
Exploration of Europa" has just arrived -- a month earlier than I thought it
would.  You can find its entire text at

http://www.nap.edu/books/0309064937/html .  

I've just started reading it --
but the big news so far is that it officially recommends that Europa
exploration be given equal priority with Mars exploration from now on.
        
I imagine this report will serve as the starting point from now on
for all of our own speculations on Europa exploration.  From this point on,
all our previous analyses are somewhat obsolete.  Certainly it will have a
very major impact on NASA's planning; these NAS reports always do.

If the collective blade pitch cannot be lowered to a negative value, the
rotors will *not* autorotate at all, but will simply slow down until they
stall.  At this point you're flying a rock and a chute is the only way to
avoid being street pizza.

It was beautiful and clear here in Mojave- but by the time the radiant
rose, the peak was long gone.  I'm going to write to the folks at Space
Adventures to suggest they do a stormchasing charter much like the eclipse
chasers the have been done before.  The 2001 Leonids are supposed to have a
good storm due to the 1866 dust trail- see 
http://www.arm.ac.uk/leonid/dustexpl.html and
http://www.arm.ac.uk/leonid/dust2001.html for details.

Last year was good here though- I saw about 40-50 an hour, with lots of big
bright fireballs that left trails, and more than a few explosions.

Actually Robin has a paper suggesting that rational actors engaging
in public debate should reduce those disagreements which are about
the underlying facts of a dispute.  In fact to the limited extent I
understand his result, it is rather hard to understand why disagreements
about facts persist at all.

Of course even if people agree about the facts, they will often be
differences in how beneficial various outcomes are to them personally.
This will still be a source of disputes.  But J.R.'s comment about
eliminating biases could be taken to refer to biases due to factual
issues, while leaving room for disagreements about relative benefits.
(Actually these aren't really disagreements; everyone may agree that
action A benefits one group the most while action B benefits the other.
Then it's just a matter of tactics and maneuvering to get the upper hand.)

I don't think you can eliminate the "lofty" desires from the picture.
Maslow proposed a hierarchy of needs, with simple ones at the bottom,
sex and food and the like, and higher ones above them, like peace,
friendship and self esteem.  Once the basic desires are satisfied the
higher order ones come into play.  Most people in Western countries
today have their basic physical needs pretty well taken care of, so
higher order desires play a significant role in their motivations.

You could have looked it up.  But you went to the trouble of

enough to remember?  What is the point of this?

I never said that there won't be any momentous events in the next

It won't be any more enlightening this time than it was the first

#527 in the archive):

Good point. To some extent it's just a matter of semantics. I
should clarify one thing: I don't think the whole process will be
finished within a half-century. It will be well underway by 2050,
but it will take a lot longer to reach a conclusion. Nevertheless I
grant you that on a geological time scale, a major extinction event
and the emergence of a new phylum (or a new kingdom) could be
considered a discontinuity. However, what appears from a distance
to be discontinuous may appear differently if you take a closer
look at it. From a delta-epsilon standpoint, there will be no
discontinuity. In any case, the concept of "the Singularity" is
irrelevant to this discussion.

I am not saying that there will be a "permanent elimination of
death," just that it will not be *necessary* to die, i.e. our cells
will not degenerate. That doesn't mean death will be eliminated for
the few humans who take the trouble to incorporate hard technology
into their cells. Far from it. New diseases will emerge. The arms
race between humans and microbes will continue. Maybe we can evolve
faster than they do, maybe not. The arms race between different
groups of humans will also continue. Violent death will always be
possible. In other words, human affairs will go on pretty much as
before.

In the last 200 years, we have already seen the potential
elimination of death, in the sense that it is no longer necessary
for most people to die young. This has certainly had a dramatic
effect on human society, but the change has taken place within an
unchanging framework. In the coming century we will see a further
development along the same lines -- it will no longer be necessary
for some people to die at all, at any age. This too may have
dramatic effects on society, or it may not, but in any case this
too will take place within an unchanging framework.

Organisms come and go. On a longer time scale, species come and go.
This will continue. As hard life emerges from soft life, organisms
will still eat each other, and on a longer time scale species will
still come into existence and eventually become extinct. (Think of
corporations, which could be considered the prototype of hard life:
corporations come and go. Industries come and go.) Biological
changes, like other changes, will take place within an unchanging
framework.

Since my original "hard life" post was on the old list (not in the
archives), maybe I should restate what hard life is. It is possible
to design cells with the following properties:

1.They have a richer model of themselves and their environment than
natural cells do, and they can control their own evolution.
2.They incorporate new materials, such as teflon, polyethelene,
carbon nanotubes, etc., that natural cells don't have access to.
3.They have more powerful sources of energy than natural cells,
i.e. their chloroplasts and mitochondria are more efficient than
those in natural cells.

This is what I call "hard life." Hard cells will not completely
replace soft cells (i.e. natural cells), but over time they will
relegate soft cells to a minor position in the ecosystem, like
anaerobic bacteria. That's the extinction event I am speaking of. I
have no idea how long it will take, or how it will play out, in
detail.

In the summer of 1998, when I started putting my nanotech notes
together into a web site, I discussed the project with Chris
Peterson.  She said it would be a perfect occasion to use
CritSuite.  (That was before she knew what I was going to say.)  I
agreed.  I *wanted* people to use CritSuite.  If you look on the
Table of Contents page of Geniebusters, you will find links to
CritSuite.  However, when I saw the level of the discussion, I
quickly lost interest.  I haven't looked at the CritSuite comments
for several months.  Maybe some of the newer comments are better.
I doubt it.

In one of the letters that he sends to Senior Associates, Eric
Drexler mentioned that Will Ware and J Storrs Hall had used
CritSuite to comment on Geniebusters -- as if they had said all
that needed to be said.  As far as I know, that has been Eric's
only response to Geniebusters.  (I can't quote him exactly, since I
don't have the letter handy -- it's in a store room.)

Incidentally, Extropians might find something else of interest on
the Table of Contents page.  Look at the bottom of the page.

Would this theory predict that AIDS is non-infectious?  Each person is
manufacturing his own endogenous retrovirus?

How would it explain the epidemiological trail seen in AIDS, which Steve
Harris describe?  One infected person has sex with another, and then
the other guy gets it?

If there is no such thing as HIV, why would everyone's self-manufactured
retrovirus be the same?  Don't we all differ in our genome?

Why do the anti-viral drugs which arrest HIV in the test tube work so
well on people?  Isn't this the bottom line, that mainstream theories
of HIV infection have produced therapies which have greatly reduced the
death rate from AIDS?

What about the monkeys, and the SIV?  Does that not exist either?

I'm assuming a slavery-free society, where anything sentient is a citizen
and gets paid.  In that case automation increases per-capita wealth, either
by reducing prices or by giving everyone more dollars to spend.  Thus, our
ability to automate production is the ultimate constraint on per-capita
wealth.

If you have slave labor, and you want to predict the cost that the overlords
pay for producing goods, the picture is analogous.  Instead of replacing
people with machines you are replacing overlords with slaves.  In the free
society cost reduction is limited by the amount of sentient supervision
required to keep the automation going.  In the slave society cost reduction
(from the overlord's point of view) is limited by the amount of free
sentient supervision required to keep the slaves in line.

Yes.

That seems unlikely.  At worst you might need one instance of the software
to do these kinds of things - then you just load all the other copies with
the data from that instance.  Even that seems unlikely for an end state,
since you don't particularly want an AI slave to learn on its own.

But it is only when the machines are able to do the same work for less money
that we bother to build them in the first place.  Lyle's argument here is
completely vacuous.  Ever since the industrial revolution we have been
replacing people with machines in order to cut costs by reducing the amount
of labor required to do things.  The process has accelerated significantly
with the invention of computers and telecommunications, and we would expect
even primitive AI to create even more opportunities to do the same thing.

Lyle's musings about sentient AI are just a smokescreen raised to confuse
the issue.  We know perfectly well what the economic effects of non-sentient
automation are, because we've been doing it for generations.  We also know
that we have a long, long way to go before we exhaust the possibilities of
this kind of automation. Finally, we can see that nanotechnology would
greatly extend these possibilities by making the manufacturing process more
amenable to automation.  We should therefore expect the current cost
reduction trend to continue for a long time before it runs out of steam.

I don't think it makes sense to lump human and robotic labor together.
Humans (or "free sentient beings", if you want to be precise) are both
producers and consumers of goods.  This means that human labor is always in
short supply, because each human wants to consume far more than he can
produce.

Actually, you don't even need atomicity.  I would divide things as follows:

1.  The way things are (objective reality);
2.  The way things should be (objective morality);
3.  The way we currently want things to be (objective reality, part of 1);
4.  The way we should want things to be (objective morality, converges
to wanting 2)
5.  Our current model of the way we should want things to be (model,
converges to 4)

If 5 (your model of 4) conflicts with your model of 3, then you don't
want to want what you want.

Or in much simpler terms, and leaving out the objective morality:  If
you *want* something, then you want a part of the Universe to change. 
Well, what you want is also a part of the Universe, and you can want to
change what you want.

GENE DEFECT FIGHTS AGEING
Thursday, November 18, 1999 Published at 10:39 GMT
http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_525000/525209.stm

Italian researchers have shown how a defective gene in mammals,
including humans, can lead to a longer lifespan.

They bred mice that could not make a particular protein in their bodies
and found the animals lived a third longer than normal rodents.

Professor Leonard Guarente, at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, US told the BBC: "It's really the first time that anybody
has intervened to extend the lifespan of a mammal without extracting
some cost."

Lack of food, for example, can extend lifespan, but only by making the
animals much smaller.

Commenting on the work published in the journal Nature, he added that
the work held "if not the fountain of youth, more than a trickle of
hope."

Many scientists around the world would like to know more about what
controls longevity, not least because it might open up new ways to
tackle cancer in which cells refuse to die.

But it is already clear many different processes are involved and the
prospect of humans being able to live substantially longer lives remains
some way off. Professor Guarante believes 10 years of research is needed
before any drugs might result from this type of research.

The experimental mice used by a team led by Pier Giuseppe Pelicci of the
European Institute of Oncology in Milan lacked a vital gene.

This protein, known as p66shc, is involved in the management of what is
known as oxidative stress.

This is the damage cells suffer when exposed to certain oxidising
agents, such as hydrogen peroxide and ultraviolet light. Oxidative
damage is thought to be inextricably linked to the ageing process in all
forms of animal life.

But quite why mice that cannot make p66shc should live a third longer
than normal mice is not clear.

The Italian team suggest a cell repair mechanism triggered by oxidative
stress is normally kept switched off by the protein.

The presence of an oxidative agent is thought to alter p66shc chemically
in such a way that the brake comes off, and the repair system moves into
action.

In mice with the defective gene, it is possible the brake is permanently
disengaged, so the repair pathway is always open.

In other words, p66shc-deficient mice live longer because their repair
mechanism works overtime.

It is also possible the action of an oxidative agent on p66shc triggers
a suicide response in badly damaged cells. Apoptosis, or cell suicide,
is one method animals use to protect themselves against cancer.

Past research indicates mutations in mice that lead to increased
lifespan are connected with smaller size or reduced fertility. But in
this study, no such defects have yet been identified.

But the team warn that their results should be treated with some caution
as they pertain to only one strain of mouse, and the effects may not be
reproducible in others.

Further work on p66shc is planned.

The worthiness of "playing nice" relates to how it effectively promotes any
population that practices it. From an evolutionary standpoint, populations that
play nice succeed (reproduce and thrive) more than populations that do not play
nice.

Not quite, because to the degree people do eliminate biases by relying on a
scientific approach to making decisions, they succeed more than people who make
decisions based on personal biases.

Only if we allow our confidence to exceed our imagination.

Exactly. That explains the scientific link of moralism to biology (as per
Richard Dawkins' essays on the subject).

Certainly not what we "ought" to do versus what we "can" do, because (obviously)
we don't _want_ to do everything that we _can_ do.

Science still provides the most complete answers to the questions humans pose
for themselves.

Interesting. Suppose that you yourself had been introduced to geometry
by a math teacher, a teacher who thought you were smart enough to
appreciate what a triangle might be, by analogy with something a bit
more familar. Say the teacher made reference to a triangular corner cut
from a piece of construction paper, for instance. Now after thinking
about this a little, let's say that your reaction was to write an essay
called "Construction Paper Busters" where you insist that whatever the
future of triangles may hold, it would be a mistake to believe that
triangles are construction paper! Who isn't "getting it" in a situation
like this?

In the actual situation of nanotech discussions, which I think we are
supposed to be talking about, the comparison of AI's to genies appeared
in Drexler's _Engines of Creation_, in a paragraph near the end of the
chapter titled "Thinking Machines". This short paragraph opens by
stating that "eventually", "some AI systems" could be expected to have
great technical and social abilities. The paragraph then says that
"given charge of enough energy, materials, and assemblers" such a system
could aptly be called a "genie machine", with the quote marks provided
by Drexler himself, in this case. In other words, it's a comparison, or
analogy, to relate this advanced prospect to something more familiar,
the "genie" of legend. Finally, the paragraph ends by warning about the
"danger" of this particular kind of "engine of creation". Nothing here
suggests that Drexler has confused AI's with genies. More importantly,
nothing suggests that Drexler thinks that technology will solve every
problem for us, which is pretty much the confusion underlying Lyle
Burkhead's "Geniebusters" idea.

Unfortunately, I've seen some signs, myself, that some people respond
far too literally to Arthur Clarke's dictum, that "a sufficiently
advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic". For instance, I've
read some things by Vernor Vinge, for instance, that seemed interesting,
even scary, at first, concerning some sort of unstoppable takeover by
AI's, only to do a double take on why he should assume that a particular
AI would get all the world's resources, unopposed. The point is, if some
people think AI's may have absolutely magical power, that's not
Drexler's problem! You've really missed something if you think that this
is what he means in speaking about programmable assembers,
nanofactories, or what have you? Anyway, while we're discussing this,
let's try for a major advance in geometry -- "Construction Paper
Busters", anyone?

You're making the further unstated assumption that the success of a
population is good; i.e., you are defining moral worth as equivalent
to success of the species.  That's as good a desire as any, but there's
certainly nothing more fundamentally "right" about success than any
other human desire.  There _is_ something unique about one goal that
might make it a good premise on which to base ethical arguments: the
continued existence of the ethical actor.  Individual survival (of the
entity exercising moral choice--whatever its physical form) is unique
in that it is the only goal that is a necessary condition of all other
possible goals.  Taking it as a premise can lead to some useful
conclusions, but alas, I don't think it is fruitful enough to produce
ethical systems as complete as we want.  Species survival might well
be a richer source of ethical premises, but I'm not yet convinced that
there's real value in it.

Quantum mechanics teaches us that reality isn't.

Electrons are both particle and wave, or neither,
depending on how one looks at it. There's no reason
to assume that "reality" is any more real than that.

"rest of the universe" is the space-time area that falls
outside of the light cone of the event. Relativity tells
us that the event is irrelevant to those space-time
points since information cannot travel faster than light.

The picture only changes when you bring into play the
quantum-scale time hysteresis loops that some physisists
are currently theoreticising about...

As far as I can tell (as I posted somewhere recently, maybe here, maybe
>H), morality - ethics, if you wish - is prudential. If it isn't, you get
silly self-subverting loops like: `Tell me why I should be moral?' which
would then have to be unpacked into `Give me a moral account of why I
should be moral; repeat'.

To act prudently implies several subsidiary factors: that you have an
adequate model of your own current and long-term needs, desires, aversions,
etc; that you (can and do) know with some accuracy - ie, again, you can
model accurately - how the brute or unintentional world works; that you can
fairly effectively model the complex interplay of the brute world and other
intentional critters like yourself. 

Failures in any of these subordinate competencies will tend to compromise
the effectiveness of how well you understand the likely impact of your
actions. And chaos limitations mean that even the best stocked mind and
heart is going to make errors in modelling anyway. But we adjust a tad and
start again. 

None of this denies us the opportunity to reassess our goals; in fact, it
almost ensures that we must, from time to time, as more accurate
information about the world and ourselves is gathered, and as our
theoretical models are improved. I don't see any real gulf between Is and
Ought in that sense, except that we need to keep ourselves informed on what
actually *Is*, so as to optimise our chosen *Oughts*.

I find it hard to believe that a very intelligent, unethical and 
power-hungry individual would be contented by playing "Civilization XXV, the 
VR edition!"  Of course that individual could be very dangerous and that is 
why there would need to be checks and balances in society to keep people 
like him or her from hurting others.

You mentioned vast powers that would deal with this threat and the problem 
is that a very intelligent, driven and unethical individual might easily be 
drawn to join the organizations that are to protect society. As they rise in 
status people like this look to bend or break the rules with others like 
themselves.  With the technologies that will come available with A.I. and 
nanotech it will be more important then ever before to stop individuals like 
this.

Of course, with checks and balances and internal policing agencies the hope 
is that a would-be tyrant could be stopped before they got to a position of 
great power.  The incredible technologies we discuss on this list such as 
A.I. and nanotech will make the pursuit of human rights even more 
challenging.


best regards,

John Grigg

Hi Amara -- I looked up while doing my nightly walk to the beach.  It
wasn't snowing here in LA, but the overcast was pretty dense. Sorry the
weather was bad for you.

I heard some local friends were heading toward the high desert and while
driving looked up a bit too much and got pulled over by the police, and
then an escort for a number of miles.  The only stars they saw was on
police jackets and fortunately not shooting.

I'll take a wild stab at it and say 11/17/1999?

The last *even* day would have been, lessee, 12/30/0888.

Hence, we're one of the few people to see an odd and an even day.  Given
a normal human lifespan and positively increasing numbering, it can only
happen during the rollover from an odd-digit millennium to an even-digit millennium.

The last generation to see an odd day and an even day would have been
the generation that saw the flipover from 888 AD to 911 AD.

They have a Web site.  It's a bogus mash of bad ideas and lies.  Ignore them,

Right.  In the case of the Japanese machine, there are four 10HP engines, so
perhaps after 50,000 fleet-hours of flying time, they might be safe.

It was yesterday, 11/17/1999.  And the one before that was Monday,
11/15/1999.  Not too hard to find those, this year.

I suspect I would very much like to comment on the developed thread, but
first I ought to ask what it is about in the opinion of the various contributors.
As I recall, it began this way:

"For some years I've been troubled by an apparent decline in the standards of
intellectual rigor in certain precincts of the American academic humanities."

"The displacement of the idea that facts and evidence matter by the idea that
 everything boils down to subjective interests and perspectives is -- second only
 to American political campaigns -- the most prominent and pernicious
 manifestation of anti-intellectualism in our time."

Sounds like what Frankfurt wrote about: first-order desires and second-order
desires.  First-order desires are those we simply/immediately have.
Second-order desires refer to other desires.

This necessitates self-awareness and introspection.  It is the ability to
have second-order desires that Frankfurt proposes as the definition for a
"person" (as opposed to a "human"), labeling those who cannot as "wantons".

It seems to me that this is a similar problem to that addressed by
second-order cybernetics.  Having no knowledge of the field, however, it's
just a speculation...  Anyone with more info care to comment?

Thanks,

Leonardo

Hi!

>this fix;

This is debatable. As you all know, we are far from perfect organisms. Mice
also have lots of room for improvement and we can't expect evolution to
select them all. It can be argued in many ways the fact that p66 is no
longer important (being an ancient gene that is no longer important, having
another version that is more stable, etc.). Of course it can have some
important function we can't easily detect, but the point is that I don't
think we should assume evolution as a perfect and final process. The
distribution in humans of the various types of cholesterol is an excellent
example (if you're not aware, the most hazardous type of cholesterol is the
most abundant and vice-versa).

Definitely. I've read the article and it seems quite interesting. We've
found genes like this in worms and insects, now mice, humans are next. I'm
certainly in the mood for living through the entire third millenium.

>>> Maybe there should be various factions (like the extropians)
>>> under the transhumanist banner (maybe we need "social posthumans" 

I've just read, with an increasing smile on my face, *ThiGMOO,* by Eugene
Byrne (London: Earthlight, 1999).

A global `Marxist extropian' revolution is fomented by several hundred
`erams' - `Electronic Replication of a Mind-set', also Latin for `I was'.
Built in a British university Museum of Mind, but evicted from there, the
sims take over a secret corporate mega-computer in Islamic revolutionary
desert nation Dilmun, renaming their nano-AI LENIN (Limitless Engine of
Nanotechnological INtelligence'. The revolution calls itself Thigmoo, from
`the habit of speakers at trade union and Labour Party meetings to refer to
unions and the party collectively as "This Great Movement of Ours"....
eventually abbreviated by journalists to "Thigmoo".' 

Told (unreliably) by eram Myles Burnham, gentleman pornographer. Principals
include insistently reactionary Sir John Westgate, head of the History
Dept, Univ. of Wessex, Dr Katharine Beckford, Curator of the Museum, eram
revolutionary Harry Dillon, last human Trotskyite socialist Derek Pilbeam
and his monstrously fat and gluttonous Russian bride Tatiana, various erams
of diverse eras, and Xena-like game figure Ninja Princess Yolanda. Etc.

The opening is misleadingly coarse, broad Benny Hill humour. Things slowly
improve. In fact, the technology at the start - cheap humanoid sexbots
roaming the streets (too advanced), Myles losing control of his speech
processor (insufficiently advanced) - are inconsistent with what develops,
quite amusingly. Well, extropians might not be amused.

The idea here is as follows:

1) There are extra dimensions whose radius is only a bit less
than a millimeter.

2) The reason we don't observe atoms leaking out into the
extra space is because all the matter that we can see lives
in a "3-brane", a three-dimensional extended object or
'membrane'. *This* object has full freedom of motion in all
the extra dimensions, but we are stuck in it or on it, and
only have three spatial degrees of freedom in which to move.

This much is not original to the preprint above; it's a
scenario that has been developed throughout the past year
or so.

The new twist is:

3) The brane we inhabit is folded back on itself in the
extra dimensions. Electromagnetic and other 'gauge'
interactions are confined to the interior of the brane,
but gravity can travel through the 'bulk', the external
space in which the brane is embedded. The dark matter
whose gravitational influence we observe in astronomy is
just ordinary matter in a neighboring fold of the brane:
less than a millimeter away through the bulk, but perhaps
trillions of light-years away through the brane!

Sounds a bit like Ken Macleod's _The Star Fraction_, which I recently
read together with the sequel _The Stone Canal_ (now trying to borrow
the final novel from a friend). It is in many ways the novel to read
together with Virginia Postrel's _The Future and its Enemies_; the
good guys are the dynamist libertarian/trotskyist/space movement,
fighting against the conservative green/luddite/religious "barb" and
the technocratic stasists of the US/UN.

Free market communism? Why not? :-)

But they could be, and there is no good reason not to, other than
believing that robots now don't actually care whether they work or not,
so there is no real labor/leisure tradeoff for them.

You could sensibly talk about a labor/leisure tradeoff for animals,
who do care how much they work, so a beast of burden like an ox does
"labor".

There are actually few issues in robot/human relations that don't
come up in animal/human relations.  If you're clear-headed in dealing
with animals, you're probably mostly ready for robots.

Not so boldly going forth

"...If we find any traces of life in the universe, we could see another
conceptual revolution in the way we think about ourselves and our place in
the universe."

-- Alex Roland, historian 

Will humankind ever travel to the galaxies of distant stars? Alex Roland
thinks so. But the former NASA historian and History Department chair at
Duke University believes space travel and exploration will come into its own
only after some significant technological breakthroughs -- and when such
travel and exploration becomes lucrative. 

On the future on space travel in the next century:

For the next 20 to 30 years, I'm quite sure we're going to see no difference
whatsoever. We're going to have more of what we've had for the last 30 to 40
years, which is, at considerable risk and great expense, sending humans up
into low orbit -- [who] float around and look busy and come back to Earth --
and not really accomplishing very much. And it will continue to be the case
during this period of the next 20 to 30 years that automated spacecraft will
perform the most useful functions in space, and make the most important
discoveries. 

[One thing that could] change that, sometime in the next century, is ... a
dramatic technological breakthrough in launch vehicle development, which
will allow us to get off the surface of the Earth much more efficiently and
much more safely than we can now. And once we can put people and more
supplies and equipment and cargo in Earth orbit more effectively than we do
now, then that will open up space in a way that's simply not available to us
now. 

One other set of activities might make that happen even without a
technological breakthrough -- "war" and "commerce." If we discovered a
large-scale commercial enterprise in space that paid for itself -- then we
might see large-scale space activity, and humans could go into space as part
of the infrastructure. [Or if we see something like the Star Wars defense
system that] was proposed in the 1980s. If we had put up the huge
infrastructure envisaged for Star Wars, people would have gone along to
operate and maintain the equipment at a fraction of the total cost of the
enterprise. But I don't see either of those happening very soon -- either a
military or a commercial activity large enough to justify and support
large-scale human activity. 

On whether the space technologies imagined by popular culture, such as
light-speed travel, will be possible:

We don't know any technology now that can make those happen, nor can we
foresee any technological trajectory that currently is within our grasp that
will lead to those capabilities, because we just don't know how to do them.
Until we get that technological breakthrough, it's impossible to predict
when they're going to happen, or even if they're going to happen. 

On discovering life elsewhere in the universe:

I expect eventually we'll find life out in the universe someplace. Whether
it will be intelligent life is impossible to predict, and whether it will
still be existent is impossible to predict. That is, I think it's possible
to imagine life emerging on other bodies out in space, and running through
its cycle, and going extinct. In fact, you would expect on the law of
averages that we would discover eventually life at all different stages of
evolution, just as space travelers from other places might have discovered
Earth at different times in the past, and found life at a very different
stage of evolution than it is now. 

On what today represents the future of space technology:

I would expect it's probably nano-technology. That is, attempts to build
computers and machines at virtually the atomic level, so that a very small
package can prove to be a very powerful instrument in space -- not just a
passive scientific instrument receiving information, but an actual machine
that can do work out in space. And if that technology proceeds in the way it
now seems to, we will be able to send very powerful instruments very long
distances at very high rates of speed. Also, we can put very, very powerful
instruments up into low Earth orbit at very slight cost. That has enormous
commercial implications.

Well spoken.  My only quibble is that I don't see the value in
the terminology "objective" morality.  If no one wants it, it isn't
interesting.  If someone does want it at some level, I'd rather identify
it as what those creatures (or creature parts) want (or want to want,
or want to want to want, etc.).

 The November 17,1999 edition of the Globe and Mail had an
interesting article on a new 3-dimensional optical storage
technology, which promises to offer 10,000 gigabytes
(10 terabytes!) in a cubic centimeter. Currently a U. of T. group
has produced a working model which packs 1,000 gigs of
write-only memory in a cube. They are working to up this by
a factor of ten, and also plan to upgrade to read/write memory.
  I would have guessed we might have to wait for 50 years for
this kind of memory storage. It now looks it could be available
in as little as 5 years!

Yes, and you would oppose this assumption? If the success of a species (or
segment of a species) does not correlate to its mores, this dysfunction places
it at a disadvantage in relation to less dysfunctional populations, don't you
think?

Without fulfilling the desire for evolutionary success, (iow, unless a
population succeeds) a population cannot go on to other human desires. This
makes the desire for evolutionary success, reproductive success, sucess as a
species, or however one puts it, a "fundamental" desire (as you put it).

The extent to which ethical systems originate in our genes deserves, IMO, a
scientific review equal to or surpassing that given to Sokal's Experiments With
Cultural Studies.

One funny note: Moravec now predicts, "Machines will attain human
levels of intelligence by the year 2040."  In his earlier book Mind
Children, published in 1988, he predicted that computing power capable of
human-level AI "would be available in a $10 million supercomputer before
2010 and in a $1,000 personal computer by 2030."  So in the approximately
ten years since that book he has pushed out the achievement of AI by
ten to thirty years.  This is not a very encouraging rate of progress...

BTW Moravec also has an article in the December Scientific American about
future progress in robotics.

The article above leads to http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/book98/ which
hold links to commentary relevant to Moravec's Robot book.  The links
for chapter 1 include the discussion organized by Robin Hanson about
the Singularity, while those for chapter 7 include a review of Damien
Broderick's book The Spike.

There is a link from chapter 1 to a page of mathematics by Moravec
similar to what I presented recently showing how a true Singularity can
be predicted to arise mathematically with certain assumptions.

Moravec suggests (W is "world knowledge", V is computer speed):

> Suppose computing power per computer simply grows linearly with
> total world knowledge, but that the number of computers also
> grows the same way, so that the total amount of computational
> power in the world grows as the square of knowledge:

Then he assumes that when just people were involved, dW/dt was constant,
but as computers become involved, you need to add a term proportional
to V:

The problem with this line of reasoning is that it is unlikely that the
rate of growth of knowledge can continue to be proportional to total
computing power.  Diminishing returns will kick in, and further there
will be "friction" losses and inefficiency in coordinating the increasing
number of computers (and people) in the world.

Hi Bob,

As I see it, the thread moved from a discussion of the need for rigorous science
in the study of societal evolution to one of debate concerning the role of
ethics in human affairs.

Since I find both these topics interesting, it seemed appropriate to try to keep
the threads going.

In my view, extropians/transhumanists need to continually re-emphasize the
importance of real science over and above the philosophical musings of social
commentators, because social commentary has a habit of tagging along with
political agendas and people with axes to grind.

As for ethics, I think science _can_ clarify this miasma if researchers can
overcome the politically correct aversion to the study of biology as it relates
to human behavior and systems of belief.

Thanks for the follow-up.

Live long and prosper,

In further support of your comments, I'd add that evolution may select for
short-lived individuals in order to speed up the process. By analogy, a species
that reproduces every three months has the ability to adapt to a changing
environment more successfully than a species that takes three decades to
reproduce.

A short life span represents nature's way of increasing the clock rate, so to
speak, for a given population, thereby accelerating the rate of evolution and
adaptability for that population, and in turn, increasing its chances to thrive
as a species (although not so much as individuals).

> How hard is it to clone a human?

Which part?  The cell culture & nuclear transfer technology could
probably be managed by many molecular biology graduate students.

What is hard (or expensive) is:
 (a) harvesting the eggs
 (b) implantation of multi-cellular embryo
 (c) the failure rate (< 1 in 100 successes)

Probaly more like a few tens of thousands of dollars, but not way off.

Actually, cloning *does* make good sense for procreation purposes
if you want to copy people with specific traits.  Yes, I know that
environment may be 50%+ of the picture, but genetics is still some
non-insigificant fraction.

> Its use in anti-aging technology is understated though.

No, I've discussed in various posts.  I think cloning is *overrated*
as an anti-aging technology.  Cloning allows you to make a new body
and brain, and unless you have the technology to create the body
without the brain, you are in highly unethical areas.

> Stem cells which new, young organs could be grown from would be
> rejection-proof if cloned from the individual they are to be placed into.

Huh???  How did we cross from cloning to stem cells.  These are two
different but related things.  Current thinking is that adults still
posesses many stem cells with greater or lesser degrees of "totipotency"
(capability of forming many organs).  I'd give better than even odds
that within the decade, we find a way to make differentiation run
backwards so you can turn a normal cell back into a stem cell
(though it may have more accumulated mutations than a typical stem cell).

Stem cells of various types should give you the ability to grow organs
of various types in the lab (without the requirement for a body).
The only thing that "cloning" provides is the ability to grow the
organs "naturally".  Given the slow growth rate of the organs and
the costs of maintaining a body for many years (until the organs
become large enough) in my mind makes "cloning" for "organ replacement"
a very dismal prospect.

Also worth noting -- the problem currently isn't really "rejection"
(this is fairly well understood and can be controlled "most" of the
time).  The problem really is the overall organ supply relative
to the demand.

The logical steps will be:
  (a) Engineering pigs so they can provide less rejectable organs.
      [Cross-species rejection has not been solved yet, though the
       causes are understood and these are being addressed.]
  (b) Growing orgrans on disolvable plastic frames from stem cells.
      Requires a bit more work on getting growth factors correct
      and being able to harvest appropriate stem cells from the
      transplant recipient or other compatible donors.  [But the
      donor supply goes up signifcantly when you only a few stem
      cells are needed and you don't have to be dead to give them.]
  (c) Re-engineer tissue specific "artificial" stem cells to serve
      as organ substrates.  These will be "enhanced" over the natural
      versions (faster division & growth, better DNA repair, etc.).

(a) and (b) are the current-to-~2010 time frame.  (c) is the ~2005
to ~2015 time frame.  I can't see any progress being made on "natural"
clones for transplants due to the furor it will produce in the same
time frame.  Once people get it straight that the wetware we run
on are nothing more than machines, then people may choose to work
on this but there will not be much point by then.

Cloning *will* get worked on for its importance for people who want or
need to copy their favorite pet or prize bull or horse (in agribusiness).
Here the ethical issues are pretty moot (which may make an for an
*interesting* comment on how messed up "ethics" is).

True.  But these simply require indefinately propagating neuronal stem
cell lines.  These are being worked on.

Well its banned in parts of Europe and the article mentioned was for
Japan, but the U.S. seems to be running a middle path of saying
we do not want to ban these things outright until we clearly see
harm over benefits (few would argue benefits of "cloning" per se,
but many would argue the benefits of stem cell research and related
technologies, so we are being careful not to throw out the baby with
the bathwater).  The Japanese article also made it clear that the issue
should be reexamined in 5 years.

> it's important to set up an infastructure of some sort in which
> research and medical usage of cloning can be done illegally.

Its important to push on the understanding stem cell isolation
and the control of differentiation (development & regression).
A reasonable prioritization based on the relative impacts of
the solutions would be:
  a) solve the organ supply problem
  b) reduce the "cost" of the organs (grow them faster/cheaper)
  c) minimize the rejection problems (make them look like the recipient)

I'm not convinced that "cloning" technologies make any significant
contribution in these areas.

Well, I haven't managed to download this page yet,
 >> http://www.wired.com/news/reuters/0,1349,32621,00.html
one of the trials of working in Russia.

But re:
> I heard Robert mention this at Extro 4 as being on his wish list.

The sequence has been "complete" since ~1998.  I believe I
even found a rough copy on TIGR (www.tigr.org) at one point, but it
seems to be gone now.  You can do Blast searches on the TIGR database
against D. radiodurans sequences so it is "kind of" finished.

There was some discussion of the work on the genome at the
TIGR genome conference in Sept.  Its a strange organism
since it has 2-3 chromosomes (I keep seeing different numbers
quoted).  Most bacteria only have 1 chromosome, though they
may have additional small plasmids.

It may be that they are having trouble finishing the complete
sequence, because it has been known for some time that there
are sequences of the D. radiodurans genome that are toxic to
E. coli (probably even some of those involved in radiation
tolerance).  Those sequences are hard to clone and amplify
and may therefore be difficult to get placed into the sequence.

There is a lot of work still to be done on this organism, but
bit by bit we will begin to see how nature has implemented ECC
for DNA.  One thing that seems apparent is *lots* of redundancy.

D. radiodurans is interesting from the perspective of astrobiology
and bioastronomy because it keeps being offered by proponents
of the Panspermia hypothesis (that the Earth was "seeded") as
an example of an organism that could cross interplanetary or
perhaps even interstellar space.  I believe there was some
discussion of this in the PBS SETI series.

We are TOO successful, as a species, in propagation, as our 
major religions, each wishing to outbreed all the others so that 
larger percentages of various types of believers in the population 
may wield greater power and influence, urge their members to be 
fruitful and multiply far beyond the carrying capacity of our planet.  
We, as a species, remind me of yeast cells dropped in a glass of 
sugar-water (metaphorically the earth), blindly, heedlessly and 
malignantly multiplying until we drown in our own toxic waste 
and/or starve after exhausting all available nutrients.  Our 
burgeoning quantity of life is functioning to the direct detriment of 
our quality of life, as we treat our common home like a reluctant 
lunchbox/outhouse, to be emptied of resources and filled with 
pollutants and garbage without regard to present consequences or 
future generations.

(I don't have time to read the article right now, some quick comments...)

As far as I know, all galaxies have dark matter, hence this would imply
that all galaxies have colocated other-brane partners.  Furthermore they
all have about the same amount of dark matter, so the colocated partners
must be equal in size to the galaxies, despite the fact that galaxies
vary considerably in size.  Also, either there is only one other brane
in the local space, or there are multiple branes but all of them have
colocated galaxies.

I wonder if this theory would predict stars would happen to form near each
other in the adjacent branes.  You start off with a diffuse cloud of gas,
and in one brane it gets compressed, perhaps due to a shock wave from
a supernova.  Now gas in the adjacent brane should be drawn in as well
due to the increased gravitational attraction from the other brane.
It doesn't feel the shock wave but it does feel the gravitational
compression.  If the star formed in the first brane were big enough then
it might collect enough gas to form a colocated star in the other brane.

Or maybe you could have planets in one brane orbiting an unseen star in
the other brane, with perhaps only a very small dwarf in their own brane,
far from massive enough to hold the planets.

The two colocated stars would probably have some relative motion, so
they would actually be in orbit around each other.  This would mean that
many stars would be moving in small circles, depending on the mass of
their invisible companion.  Presumably we could put an upper bounds on
the mass of any dark companion of our own sun because of the absence of
an unknown component of its motion.

It all seems a little too pat.

>From NASA Watch and The Astrobiology Web:

19 November 1999: Bacteria: The Ideal Astronauts?

In August 1996 David McKay and Everett Gibson
from NASA JSC stunned the world by publishing a
paper in Science magazine that reported
evidence of fossilized microorganisms found
within the ALH84001 meteorite that came to
Earth from Mars. In the ensuing months and
years, interest in life on Mars - and elsewhere -
was rekindled.

The notion that rocks could be blasted off of one planet by an 
asteroid impact and land upon another was not exactly new. But could 
life be carried within a rock between planets and survive the trip 
to take root on another world? The trip would not necessarily be all 
that smooth. 

Enter Deinococcus radiodurans. In an article in today's Science magazine, 
researchers at The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) report that they 
have determined the entire genetic sequence of this bacterium. D. radiodurans 
can survive gamma radiation exposures of 1.5 million rads which literally 
blast its DNA apart.
                       
It then reassembles its DNA all by itself with no apparent ill effects. 
This organism can also be completely dried out and then be revived and can 
survive doses of ultraviolet radiation that would kill most other forms of 
life. Sounds like the perfect organisms to send on a long trip inside a 
rock between planets! Indeed, it is so robust that it is being considered 
for use in cleaning up radioactive waste dumps.

                       Full Story online later today ....

Once you start asking whether AI labor should be accounted as "labor",
then you're digging down below the level of abstraction at which it is
possible to talk about an "economy".  Let's ask about standards of
living.  If nanotechnology is around, do standards of living go up? 
Yes.  I don't care how you define the costs of producing things.  I
don't care if you can twist your definition around so that a fancy
dinner costs the same amount in raw material and intelligent labor;
obviously, if you define atoms and labor as the basis of cost and assume
that those costs are the fundamental constant, which is what Lyle does,
then it's tautologically obvious that the cost of dinner is a constant.

But what matters is the standard of living, and if I can have beef
Wellington for dinner every night, at little or no cost in terms of
mental energy and expenditure of physical effort - these being the two
factors that I would define as important to standards of living - then
the nanoSantas have arrived.  And given that AIs, whatever else you can
say about them, are not likely to have to expend "mental energy" to
design a beef Wellington dinner in the first place, much less rerun the
subroutines to produce a specific instance, then this seems like a
reasonable outcome given AIs that interact economically with humanity;
that is, AIs that behave altruistically, or AIs which can be paid in a
humanly comprehensible unit of exchange.  The cost of AI labor *is*
effectively zero to the AIs, and it seems plausible that the cost to
humans will be equally zero.  So however Lyle chooses to define labor
costs, standards of living still skyrocket, more than enough to justify
the phrase "Santa effect".  (This is leaving out the effects of nanowar,
of course.)  Likewise, while Lyle may choose to regard the cost of an
atom as constant, the cost to *me*, the expenditure of my time required,
goes way down once automated asteroid mining arrives.

The parts of "Geniebusters" which are not flat wrong are tautological. 
The entire site is irrelevant.  Have a nice day.

Wow!  To think we will have to wait till the 32nd century before we have 
another odd day!  I wonder how many of us will make it to that distant era.  
We should plan to have the precursor of the far edge party on that day.  Who 
knows, by that date the far edge party may have taken place.  Just imagine 
what the Extro may be like in that year!

By the way everyone, "Happy Unbirthday!"  In one of Piers Anthony's books a 
character explained, "if it's not your birthday, it is your unbirthday!"

J.R.,

Very helpful reply:

"Hi Bob,

"As I see it, the thread moved from a discussion of the need for rigorous
science in the study of societal evolution to one of debate concerning the
role of ethics in human affairs....."

".....As for ethics, I think science _can_ clarify this miasma if researchers can
overcome the politically correct aversion to the study of biology as it relates
to human behavior and systems of belief."

Yes.  I had this in mind when I sent a trial balloon META's way concerning
the work of the Santa Fe Institute in "Theoretical Biology" on Sun 14 Nov 99:

From: Robert Owen:

I thought I might provoke a little controversy by mentioning
the Field of "Theoretical Biology" and stimulate some painful
feelings only to be relieved by posting an opinion of Stuart
Kauffman who studies the origin of life and the origins of
molecular organization. Twenty-five years ago, he developed
the Kauffman models, which are random networks exhibiting
a kind of self-organization that he terms "order for free."
Kauffman is not easy. His models are rigorous, mathematical,
and, to many of his colleagues, somewhat difficult to accept.
A key to his worldview is the notion that convergent rather
than divergent flow plays the deciding role in the evolution of
life. With his colleague Christopher G. Langton, he believes
that the complex systems best able to adapt are those poised
on the border between chaos and disorder.

His most recent books are "At Home in the Universe: The Search
for the Laws of Self-Organization and Complexity", 1995, Oxford
University Press and "The Origins of Order: Self-Organization and
Selection in Evolution", l993, Oxford University Press.

So here is an exercise in "theoretical biology" from the Santa Fe
Institute by MacArthur fellow Kauffman:

"If biologists have ignored self-organization, it is not because
self-ordering is not pervasive and profound. It is because we
biologists have yet to understand how to think about systems
governed simultaneously by two sources of order, Yet who seeing
the snowflake, who seeing simple lipid molecules cast adrift in
water forming themselves into cell-like hollow lipid vesicles, who
seeing the potential for the crystallization of life in swarms of
reacting molecules, who seeing the stunning order for free in
networks linking tens upon tens of thousands of variables, can fail
to entertain a central thought: if ever we are to attain a final
theory in biology, we will surely, surely have to understand the
commingling of self-organization and selection. We will have to see
that we are the natural expressions of a deeper order. Ultimately,
we will discover in our creation myth that we are expected after
all."

   "At Home in the Universe", Oxford University Press, 1995, p 112.

I hope at least one or two readers are sufficiently outraged, or at
least exasperated, that they will post their devastating critique.
For example, do you detect an odor of "teleology"?  Or do you
espy "The Anthropic Principle" sneaking through the back door?
Some kind of neo-Begsonian or Lamarckian decadence? Worse yet,
is this some weird kind of "closet creationism"?

-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-

Received were some highly insightful replies -- some vaguely supportive
of Stuart's work.  Then, after further reflection, I received this from
Athena:

 "I reread the passage from Kauffman's book that Bob sent us, and found
some things to alarm me.  For one, he employs the classic strategy of
conflating things that we know and don't know."

Well, say the issue is: can highly qualified biologists study the biological
determinants of anthropoid social behavior and on the of level conceptual
mentation in our species expand our understanding of the biogenetic roots
of our value- and belief-systems without the "conflation" to which Athena
refers?  That is, without dragging-in the non-empirical disciplines of
"Comparative Cultural Anthropology", "Sociology", and purely theoretical
models derived from "Depth Psychology"and your infamous "Cultural Studies"?  
My "rhetorical" position is one of abject skepticism, but I am ready to learn!

The only difference is that yeast cells don't have technology.

We are extropians here.  We believe that human being can solve their
problems using technology.  And that human beings are far from being the
mindless blights of nature you describe them as.

This originally comes from "Alice in Wonderland", during the Tea Party sequence
with the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, in which they were having an unbirthday
party.  Piers Anthony seems to have liffted it for his own purposes.

They should concentrate on the read/write aspect, since 'write only'
memory is completely useless, if it cannot be read.

Fans of self-aware AI may be interested in following up on the trail
established by AM and Eurisko, Doug Lenat's early programs for evolving
heuristics useful in a particular domain of interest.  Cyrano is a
"thoughtful reimplemenation" of Eurisko, by Ken Haase.  (Lenat was one
of the his thesis advisors.)  His PhD thesis describing Cyrano is online
at http://www.media.mit.edu/~haase/thesis/thesis.html.

Haase's home page http://www.media.mit.edu/~haase describes a distributed
database for AI research called FramerD which he is giving away for free
for research purposes.  Maybe he would be willing to similarly share
his Cyrano sources if you asked him.  You could read the thesis first to
see if it sounds like something which would be useful as a foundation for
your AI.

MacLeod's sf is wonderful, detailed, almost without precedent in this
US-politics-biased genre, and funny as well. 

The direct sequel to THE STONE CANAL is his immensely exciting THE CASSINI
DIVISION, where Borgish posthumans are taken on by libertarian communists
following a flawed Singularity that morphs Jupiter. That's *not* the final
novel, though: THE SKY ROAD shifts back to follow some of the characters of
previous novels into a subtly *alternative* history.

Any indication why the contribution of next-door gravity should then be so

====
In Jupiter's atmosphere, the spectrometer detected surprisingly high
concentrations of argon, krypton and xenon, [...]

       The discovery of these gases in such high quantities at Jupiter raises
questions about how they got there. "In order to catch these gases, Jupiter
had
to trap them physically by condensation or freezing," Owen said. This
process, he
said, requires extremely cold temperatures of about -240 degrees Celsius (-400
degrees Fahrenheit), colder than the surface of Pluto, the planet farthest
from the
Sun. Planetesimals (small objects orbiting the Sun) in the Kuiper Belt beyond
Pluto would be this cold, but Jupiter is more than six times closer to the
Sun and
thus is much warmer. For this reason, Jupiter could not have been the site
where
the three noble gases were originally trapped. 

       "This raises some intriguing possibilities," Owen said. "One
explanation
suggests that Jupiter was formed out in the area around the Kuiper Belt and
was
dragged inward to its present location. Another possibility is that the solar
nebula, a huge cloud of gas and dust from which our solar system formed, was
much colder than scientists believe. A third hypothesis proposes that the
solid
materials that brought these noble gases to Jupiter began forming in the
original
huge, interstellar cloud of gas and dust even before it collapsed to form
the solar
nebula. That would make these icy materials older and more primitive than we
had expected." 

       "If either of the last two hypotheses turns out to be correct, it
would suggest
that giant planets can form closer to their stars than current theories
predict,"
Owen said. "This could help explain the new observations of planetary systems
around other stars, in which such close-in giant planets are relatively
common."

Lewis Carroll, as a playful logician, might have smiled at this happy typo.
So the (appallingly) punnish Mr Anthony lifted it if and only if it suited

This has been proposed many, many times but it doesn't hold water.  A mutant 
allele that doesn't kill its owner early will eliminate the killer gene.  It 
gets any benefits of accelerated evolution, because it's in the same species, 
plus its carriers live longer and have more offspring.  It's the old 
principle of group selection; a group benefit allele can only have 
negligeable costs to individuals possessing it.

Its more likely that evolution does not select for genes
that will slow aging if its likely that the 
individual will die early for unrelated causes.
Metabolic rate is a reasonable first indicator for how
a particular species will live, but species with similar
metabolic rates age at different rates depending on their
survival chances.
The argument being that evolution will 
select for longevity as soon as the individual is likely
to survive to a point where slower aging is worthwhile.
Its quite possible that our greatly reduced rate of aging
relative to chimpanzees is a direct result of our greatly
increased chances of survival (due to our smarts) allowing
anti-aging genes to be selected for.

 ~ SIMPLE TASTES THE KEY, SAYS IRELAND'S OLDEST WOMAN ~


November 15, 1999  Web posted at: 7:05 AM EST (1205 GMT)

DUBLIN, Ireland (Reuters) -- The key to staying young is all in the
mind and simple tastes according to Ireland's oldest granny.

"I feel just the same as I did when when I was 20," said Bridget
Dirrane from Galway in west Ireland just after her 105th birthday on
Sunday.

"Natural, simple foods, lots of greens, fish fresh from the sea and
lots of plain water are the secret," she said of her longevity.

Born on the windswept Aran Islands of Ireland's west coast in 1894,
Dirrane has witnessed some of the key events in Ireland's history --
and America's.

She was in her 20s when she mixed with leaders of the 1916 Easter
Rising revolt against British rule that later led to the country's
partition, and was jailed during the War of Independence.

After emigrating to the United States in 1927, she later canvassed
for former president John F. Kennedy's presidential campaign.

She returned to Ireland in 1966.

IMPORTANT CAVEAT FOR RESEARCH WORKERS: this anecdotal report

Sorry for not being clear before by what I meant about the connection
between stem cells and cloning - my point was that if you create a zygote
cloned from yourself, and do the neccessary biotech procedures to keep the
zygote from becomming a person (i.e. keep it as a mass of stem cells), then
grow organs from these stem cells, the organs will be a perfect match to the
person who gave the cell sample. This would solve issue c) completely.
I believe what mis-led you was my use of the word 'clone' - I define it as
creating a zygote which is a genetic match to some living or dead person -
not neccessarily letting the zygote grow to maturity.
I'd like to add:
d) Legalize organ selling and trading, with strict controls in place to
prevent the theft of organs from living people. There are many people who
would be willing to sell a kidney. Many more who would be willing to take a
cash reward today in exchange for their organs after death. Competition
among organ agencies would solve most of the supply problems. An eBay-like
organ website would be ideal.

No, I don't see any of that. I see techniques informally known as parallel
distributed processing, Boolean nets, neural nets, spin glasses, cellular
automata, classifier systems, genetic algorithms, and swarm computation, all of
which contribute to Kaufman's work on autocatalytic autopoesis. (But not nearly
as well as Kaufman and Langton see them.)

By way of an answer, I direct to to the following:
"Do we invent our moral absolutes in order to make society workable? Or are
these enduring principles expressed to us by some transcendent or Godlike
authority? Efforts to resolve this conundrum have perplexed, sometimes inflamed,
our best minds for centuries, but the natural sciences are telling us more and
more about the choices we make and our reasons for making them."
"The Biological Basis of Morality"
by Edward O. Wilson:
http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/98apr/biomoral.htm
"A Scientific Approach to Moral Reasoning":
http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/98apr/bio2.htm

"The general empiricist principle takes this form: Strong innate feeling and
historical experience cause certain actions to be preferred; we have experienced
them, and have weighed their consequences, and agree to conform with codes that
express them. Let us take an oath upon the codes, invest our personal honor in
them, and suffer punishment for their violation. The empiricist view concedes
that moral codes are devised to conform to some drives of human nature and to
suppress others. Ought is the translation not of human nature but of the public
will, which can be made increasingly wise and stable through an understanding of
the needs and pitfalls of human nature. The empiricist view recognizes that the
strength of commitment can wane as a result of new knowledge and experience,
with the result that certain rules may be desacralized, old laws rescinded, and
formerly prohibited behavior set free. It also recognizes that for the same
reason new moral codes may need to be devised, with the potential of being made
sacred in time."

The Origin of Moral Instincts

IF the empiricist world view is correct, ought is just shorthand for one kind of
factual statement, a word that denotes what society first chose (or was coerced)
to do, and then codified. The naturalistic fallacy is thereby reduced to the
naturalistic problem. The solution of the problem is not difficult: ought is the
product of a material process. The solution points the way to an objective grasp
of the origin of ethics.

A few investigators are now embarked on just such a foundational inquiry. Most
agree that ethical codes have arisen by evolution through the interplay of
biology and culture. In a sense these investigators are reviving the idea of
moral sentiments that was developed in the eighteenth century by the British
empiricists Francis Hutcheson, David Hume, and Adam Smith.

What have been thought of as moral sentiments are now taken to mean moral
instincts (as defined by the modern behavioral sciences), subject to judgment
according to their consequences. Such sentiments are thus derived from
epigenetic rules -- hereditary biases in mental development, usually conditioned
by emotion, that influence concepts and decisions made from them. The primary
origin of moral instincts is the dynamic relation between cooperation and
defection. The essential ingredient for the molding of the instincts during
genetic evolution in any species is intelligence high enough to judge and
manipulate the tension generated by the dynamism. That level of intelligence
allows the building of complex mental scenarios well into the future. It occurs,
so far as is known, only in human beings and perhaps their closest relatives
among the higher apes.

A way of envisioning the hypothetical earliest stages of moral evolution is
provided by game theory, particularly the solutions to the famous Prisoner's
Dilemma. Consider the following typical scenario of the dilemma. Two gang
members have been arrested for murder and are being questioned separately. The
evidence against them is strong but not irrefutable. The first gang member
believes that if he turns state's witness, he will be granted immunity and his
partner will be sentenced to life in prison. But he is also aware that his
partner has the same option, and that if both of them exercise it, neither will
be granted immunity. That is the dilemma. Will the two gang members
independently defect, so that both take the hard fall? They will not, because
they agreed in advance to remain silent if caught. By doing so, both hope to be
convicted on a lesser charge or escape punishment altogether. Criminal gangs
have turned this principle of calculation into an ethical precept: Never rat on
another member; always be a stand-up guy. Honor does exist among thieves. The
gang is a society of sorts; its code is the same as that of a captive soldier in
wartime, obliged to give only name, rank, and serial number.

In one form or another, comparable dilemmas that are solvable by cooperation
occur constantly and everywhere in daily life. The payoff is variously money,
status, power, sex, access, comfort, or health. Most of these proximate rewards
are converted into the universal bottom line of Darwinian genetic fitness:
greater longevity and a secure, growing family.

And so it has most likely always been. Imagine a Paleolithic band of five
hunters. One considers breaking away from the others to look for an antelope on
his own. If successful, he will gain a large quantity of meat and hide -- five
times as much as if he stays with the band and they are successful. But he knows
from experience that his chances of success are very low, much less than the
chances of the band of five working together. In addition, whether successful
alone or not, he will suffer animosity from the others for lessening their
prospects. By custom the band members remain together and share equitably the
animals they kill. So the hunter stays. He also observes good manners in doing
so, especially if he is the one who makes the kill. Boastful pride is condemned,
because it rips the delicate web of reciprocity.

Now suppose that human propensities to cooperate or defect are heritable: some
people are innately more cooperative, others less so. In this respect moral
aptitude would simply be like almost all other mental traits studied to date.
Among traits with documented heritability, those closest to moral aptitude are
empathy with the distress of others and certain processes of attachment between
infants and their caregivers. To the heritability of moral aptitude add the
abundant evidence of history that cooperative individuals generally survive
longer and leave more offspring. Following that reasoning, in the course of
evolutionary history genes predisposing people toward cooperative behavior would
have come to predominate in the human population as a whole.

Such a process repeated through thousands of generations inevitably gave rise to
moral sentiments. With the exception of psychopaths (if any truly exist), every
person vividly experiences these instincts variously as conscience,
self-respect, remorse, empathy, shame, humility, and moral outrage. They bias
cultural evolution toward the conventions that express the universal moral codes
of honor, patriotism, altruism, justice, compassion, mercy, and redemption.

The dark side of the inborn propensity to moral behavior is xenophobia. Because
personal familiarity and common interest are vital in social transactions, moral
sentiments evolved to be selective. People give trust to strangers with effort,
and true compassion is a commodity in chronically short supply. Tribes cooperate
only through carefully defined treaties and other conventions. They are quick to
imagine themselves the victims of conspiracies by competing groups, and they are
prone to dehumanize and murder their rivals during periods of severe conflict.
They cement their own group loyalties by means of sacred symbols and ceremonies.
Their mythologies are filled with epic victories over menacing enemies.

The complementary instincts of morality and tribalism are easily manipulated.
Civilization has made them more so. Beginning about 10,000 years ago, a tick in
geological time, when the agricultural revolution started in the Middle East, in
China, and in Mesoamerica, populations increased tenfold in density over those
of hunter-gatherer societies. Families settled on small plots of land, villages
proliferated, and labor was finely divided as a growing minority of the populace
specialized as craftsmen, traders, and soldiers. The rising agricultural
societies became increasingly hierarchical. As chiefdoms and then states thrived
on agricultural surpluses, hereditary rulers and priestly castes took power. The
old ethical codes were transformed into coercive regulations, always to the
advantage of the ruling classes. About this time the idea of law-giving gods
originated. Their commands lent the ethical codes overpowering authority -- once
again, no surprise, in the interests of the rulers.

Because of the technical difficulty of analyzing such phenomena in an objective
manner, and because people resist biological explanations of their higher
cortical functions in the first place, very little progress has been made in the
biological exploration of the moral sentiments. Even so, it is astonishing that
the study of ethics has advanced so little since the nineteenth century. The
most distinguishing and vital qualities of the human species remain a blank
space on the scientific map. I doubt that discussions of ethics should rest upon
the freestanding assumptions of contemporary philosophers who have evidently
never given thought to the evolutionary origin and material functioning of the
human brain. In no other domain of the humanities is a union with the natural
sciences more urgently needed.

When the ethical dimension of human nature is at last fully opened to such
exploration, the innate epigenetic rules of moral reasoning will probably not
prove to be aggregated into simple instincts such as bonding, cooperativeness,
and altruism. Instead the rules will most probably turn out to be an ensemble of
many algorithms, whose interlocking activities guide the mind across a landscape
of nuanced moods and choices.

Such a prestructured mental world may at first seem too complicated to have been
created by autonomous genetic evolution alone. But all the evidence of biology
suggests that just this process was enough to spawn the millions of species of
life surrounding us. Each kind of animal is furthermore guided through its life
cycle by unique and often elaborate sets of instinctual algorithms, many of
which are beginning to yield to genetic and neurobiological analyses. With all
these examples before us, we may reasonably conclude that human behavior
originated the same way.

Yes, strictly speaking you are correct, if a bit pedantic. The rate of change
caused by Nanotechnology will  be very fast but not infinitely fast and it will not
happen at one exact instant in time. A mathematical singularity can never happen
in the real world but we can come close, the closest to one happened 65 million
years ago in Mexico. That momentous event's only cause was a few billion tons of
dumb rock and ice, I have no doubt that a few billion tons of smart nano machines
would cause even greater disturbances.

Please note, when I use  a mathematical term in discussing human beings it
should not always be taken literally. For example, when I say that somebody's

In a thousand years microbes will probably not exist, humans certainly won't, however
I agree that the problem of computer viruses may not ever be entirely solved.

I don't use the word "impossible" often but I will use it today, it is impossible for the
elimination of death not to have a dramatic effect on society.

    >but in any case this  too will take place within an unchanging framework.

For that to be true the word "framework" would have to encompass everything
conceivable and everything inconceivable, in other words, the word "Framework"
would have to be meaningless or at least useless.

Okay, so evolution invests in genetically-related longevity only when a species
has a survival rate high enough to justify such a genetic configuration. Rather
than giving short-lived animals any kind of evolutionary advantage, this simply
shows that evolution doesn't waste goodies on organisms that don't get a chance
to use them. I think I've got it now, thanks.

Thank you for the information. Apparently, modifying the genes of mice can
extend their life span. If identical modification happened as a result of
mutation rather than engineering, would the mutant individual have a biological
advantage? Could such a mutation occur naturally in millions of years of mice
generations? --J. R.

Biotech Firms Now Aim To Alter Public Opinion
----
By David Barboza New York Times Service
----
CHICAGO - Worried about growing resistance to genetically modified foods,
some of the world's biggest biotechnology companies have decided to mount a
huge lobbying and marketing campaign to counter their critics and combat
what they fear is a rising wave of anti-biotech hysteria.

Makers of genetically modified seeds have taken a beating this year in
Europe, where critics have sabotaged test plots of altered crops and have
fostered widespread distrust of what they call Frankenstein foods.

Now wariness over genetically modified crops is starting to appear in the
United States. Environmental groups are stoking opposition through lobbying
and full-page advertisements; federal lawmakers introduced legislation
Wednesday that would require labeling of food made with genetically modified
crops, and regulators are re-evaluating everything from food safety to the
effects bioengineered crops may have on the monarch butterfly.

The companies have reviewed their stunning public relations loss in Europe
and now acknowledge that there were a number of missteps.

''I think there was a certain navet in our initial approaches to the
European market,'' the chief executive of Monsanto Co., Robert Shapiro, said
in an interview. ''We had been operating on a model that had been used in
the United States. If the question is, have we learned anything in recent
months in the sociology, the media orientation, yes we have learned
something.''

At stake in this contest for American, European and Asian public opinion are
billions of dollars in investments by the biotechnology industry and
American farmers who have rapidly adopted products such as corn and soybeans
that have been engineered to resist pests or producer higher yields.

Until recently, the leading biotechnology companies were reluctant to
respond to criticism in the United States for fear of making the novel foods
an issue. But some biotech executives now say that there is a sense that the
tide may be turning against genetically modified foods and that urgent
action is needed.

And so in recent months, Monsanto, Du Pont Co., Novartis AG and other
biotech companies have formed a series of industry-wide alliances and have
set aside tens of millions of dollars to fight what they view as an ugly
campaign that has vilified the companies - calling Monsanto, for example,
''Monsatan'' and ''Mutanto,'' - and misrepresented their products.

''The protest industry has gone too far,'' said Edward Shonsey, chief
executive at Novartis Seeds Inc. ''They've crossed the boundaries of
reasonableness, and now it's up to us to protect and defend biotechnology.''

Members of the alliances are financing scientific research, organizing
educational forums, lobbying legislators, regulators and farm organizations,
and using their own Web sites to promote the benefits of genetically
modified, or GM, products.

The members have also retained three major public relations concerns in
recent weeks, and many are pooling their resources and preparing a global
advertising and public relations campaign.

''All these forces are coming to bear where we're going to have a really big
battle,'' said Todd Duvick, a food industry analyst at Bank of America. ''We
already have huge quantities of GM foods, and there are companies that want
labeling and companies that don't want them; it's creating a logistical
nightmare. Meanwhile, all the biotechnology companies are trying to protect
themselves.''

The debate centers on a technology that can borrow genetic code from plants
or animals and transfer it to a plant to give it a desired trait. This year,
20 to 45 percent of American corn and soybeans were grown from seed engineer
ed to produce its own insecticidal toxin, and those crops have found their
way into many processed foods.

Backers say biotechnology may eventually lead to crops that have extra
nutrition or can thrive in adverse weather.

But some consumer advocates and scientists, particularly in Europe, say that
not enough research has been done to prove that food made from genetically
altered crops is safe to eat.

In response, U.S. regulators say that no studies have proven that food made
from genetically modified products is harmful to eat, and that all biotech
products now on the market have been deemed safe.

Another concern is the possible effect such crops might have on the
environment. An increasing number of studies suggest that genetically
modified plants could interact with the environment in hazardous ways and
that regulators are not requiring the proper studies to assess the risks.

With critics gaining ground in the United States, the biotechnology
companies feel they need to act.

Monsanto, whose aggressive efforts to gain acceptance for its genetically
modified products backfired in Europe, recently retained Burson-Marsteller,
a global public relations firm, at an annual cost of millions of dollars,
according to people who reviewed the deal. Some of the leading environmental
groups, however, say they believe the new campaign will backfire because it
will raise even more questions about biotech foods.

''They are under the misguided assumption that the more information they put
out the more light at the end of the tunnel,'' said Jeremy Rifkin, the
president of the Foundation on Economic Trends, an environmental group.
''But the more information they put out the more questions people have about
GM foods.'' He asserted that the products were dangerous and said, ''They
think it's public relations disaster, but it's more than that.''

Environmental groups in the United States pounced on the issue in May after
a Cornell University study showed that pollen from corn producing the
insecticidal toxin Bt could stunt the development of monarch caterpillars in
the laboratory.

On Wednesday in Washington, a bipartisan group of 20 members of Congress
introduced legislation that would require labeling of genetically engineered
food.

The Environmental Protection Agency is expected to rule in the coming weeks
on how biotech corn can be planted, a decision that may be influenced by
ongoing studies on the monarch butterfly.

I believe, I'm paraphrasing Eliezer on another topic, when I say
   BLECH!  PHOOEY!!  GROAN!!  KASHMAR!! 
I've got a theory on how gravitational effects on DNA at the time
of chromosomal segregation explains astrological observations
but I'm not going to waste good paper by writing it down.  The
problem here is that data storage bits have gotten too damn cheap...

Please bear in mind a comment offered by a participant at one
of the SETI conferences -- if you give the theoretical
physicists long enough they can explain *anything*!

Hal offered some comments on dark matter abundances that
need clarification.

I believe he expressed the opinion that dark matter abundances
are the same in all galaxies.  I don't believe this statement
may be made with any degree of universality.

Dark matter abundances are "derived" from the rotational rates
of the galaxies.  Galaxies that show relatively rapid orbital
velocities of the outer stars (a failure to decrease in expected
orbital velocity with distance from the center of the galaxy, as is
the case with the planets relative to the sun) are assumed to have
dark matter.

These velocities are determined by the doppler shifts of the stars
(or star "aggregates") from the outer to the inner to the outer
edge of the galaxy to determine the velocity towards or away from us.
Doing this type of experiment requires a fairly accurate spectroscopic
equipment and a fair amount of telescope time.  The only galaxies this
type of measurement can be done accurately for are those that are viewed
relatively "edge-on" to us.  Due to the equipment and sight restrictions
I suspect that quantitative dark matter estimates are available for
only a few dozen galaxies.  I do not believe there are any estimates
on whether the amount of dark matter is increasing or decreasing with
the age of the universe (because to accurately determine this we would
need the rotational curves of very distant galaxies).

There is also the problem that there is more dark matter in galactic
clusters (derived from galactic velocities) than in the galaxies
themselves (including the galactic dark matter).  There is some
recent evidence that some of the dark matter may be neutral hydrogen,
but I haven't seen anyone suggest that this explains away the entire problem.

Amara, if I've gotten any of this wrong, please correct it.

Robert

I like what you say here.  But I think you're glossing over how intertwined,
your well being is with the well being of others.

Communism was about destroying representational democracy aka-republics. They 
liked to deal with capitalists and use them as tools(like Cargil in the USA).

Lets take Ben Wattenberg's's view on this for a moment. Better to say that  
the marrige of (Capital + Technology) X Time = Scarcity of Resources.  If a 
technology is potent enough, it can alter the what the scarcity is.  A 
example would be the development of pull-tabs for soft drinks and beer in the 
1960's reduced the availability (need) for old-fashioned 'beak' can openers.  

As for a singularity altering the human condition, right now it seems that 
climate change will be our singularity; rather then nano, or bio leading  the 
charge. Climate has always fiddled with what us pre-Extropian & 
pre-Transhumans have behaved.

I suspect when this person mean't clonning, she mean't it in a "Dolly" sense 
of the word. This would mean a real live-breathing host -mother of course.  
What is more meaningful to us as a species, is the 'clonning' of organs 
in-vitro; so thay can be trans-planted into people. 

I once heard a British bio-ethicist and scientist say that as long as organs 
did not appear to take on 'full' human form, such as a full human head, etc. 
Most people would find this acceptable. How far away is this technology? I 
will err on the side of caution, and say its more likely to be a successful 
technology of the 22nd century; rather then the 21st.

Spud, old boy, I'll bet you a gallon of fine single malt that human organs 
such as hearts and lungs will be grown from stem cells by no later than 2030. 
 It wouldn't surprise me one bit if it were done by 2015 and I'd say there's 
at least some chance it'll be done by 2010.  Of course, if it's not done by 
2030, you may have to wait till they yank me out of the dewar to collect.

Do we have any evidence, such as extremely odd star formations; that might 
indicate intelligence? A hexagon of stars, might prove to be more efficient 
mathematically, in moving mater, energy, and information then a randon 
scattering; as we appear to have currently.  Unless we gain positve evidence, 
Fermi and Tipler are right. We have met 'intelligent-life' and they is us.

I understand you sentiment in this post and was swayed by its mellifluous
tone.

At a time when the overcoming death is the war cry in the battle on
disease, it seems that the common sense perspective would require one to be
self-aware and self-protective. If the mission is to overcome death and
enhance our humanness, the element of collaborative cooperation is
imperative to achieving the goal and winning the battle.  In that I see
this directive - overcoming diseases and the finality of death - as the
foundation for our future as transhumanists, the concerns of selfishness
vs. altruism seem to loose momentum.  I believe you express this sentiment
below:

>I believe that the most important quality in the universe is self.  But 
>not my self alone.  (snip)  I believe in 
>responsibilities of proximity and scale and competence. (snip)

As you, I find altruism hanging on a coat rack in an antiqued chamber.
Kindness is more available and capable of bringing a positive result,
especially in a transhumansit spirituality, and also self esteem works
nicely with self-responsibility.

Cheers!

There was a post recently regarding a theory derived from looking at the data
from IRAS and asking what the ratio of monatomic to molecular hydrogen is in
galaxies.  Apparently, H2 can't be seen through the atmosphere, so astronomers
made an assumption, which the IRAS data showed to be false.  It had the potential
to explain the missing mass very simply.  Has anyone seen an update on this work
and/or what's the latest on this?

WITHOUT CONSENT

A review of:
Undue Risk: Secret State Experiments on Humans,
 by Jonathan Moreno, WH Freeman, UKP15, ISBN 0716731428

If you made it up, nobody would believe you. Years after the Nuremberg
trials revealed the horrors of the Nazi experiments on concentration camp
prisoners, one of the world's biggest liberal democracies was still
carrying out unethical medical experiments on people. The subjects included
soldiers, prisoners and even some civilians. And the science, much of it
involving exposing people to radiation, was done with the full blessing of
the US government. When Bill Clinton created a commission to investigate,
Jonathan Moreno, a bioethicist at the University of Virginia, was put on
the panel and given access to vast numbers of classified documents. In
Undue Risk: Secret State Experiments on Humans, he recounts that
experience. Charles Seife talked to Moreno to find out what he learnt...

Without consent

"THE UK , like our other allies, thinks we're out of our goddamned minds
for talking about this kind of thing in public and releasing any kind of
classified information at all, ever."

So says American bioethicist Jonathan Moreno. The topic is his own
government's past-and distinctly inglorious--record on human
experimentation. And he has a point: no other nation has allowed scholars
of Moreno's ilk to root through box after box of secret documents looking
for evidence of how scientists, backed by the military, systematically
mistreated human subjects in their studies of the effects of radiation,
chemicals and biological agents. And when other governments get around to
looking at the experiments detailed in those documents, it's fair to say
they won't be eager to unlock all of their own files.

Many boxes contained nothing more than old newspaper clippings. Yet
occasionally, there were documents that told of horrible abuses. Some
examples. In 1949, US scientists wanted to judge their ability to monitor
radioactive plumes. Their solution: deliberately release a cloud of
radioactive iodine into the atmosphere over Washington state. In the 1950s,
US generals wanted to know whether their men would panic in a nuclear
attack. Their solution: parade several hundred thousand US troops in front
of atomic explosions. Or what about the attempts the US Army made in the
1960s to develop a "supersoldier" with skin so tough it acted like a
natural body armour? To perfect the skin-hardening technology, the US Army
needed human subjects, so it turned to a prison in Holmesburg,
Philadelphia. There it found "acres of skin" to play with. The prisoners
were treated with chemical agents, which, when effective, caused
"significant inflammation and crusting".

But for Moreno, one of the worst cases happened in the 1950s when the US
Army persuaded psychiatrists to secretly inject hallucinogenic drugs into
mental patients. "That episode strikes me as the one that really epitomises
how wrong things went," he says. "Hospitals are supposed to be secure
places where you're protected."

The US Army's aim in these experiments, according to a 1951 internal memo,
was to investigate "the utilisation of psychochemical agents both for
offensive use and for protection against them". In other words, they were
looking for mind-control agents. And to this end, they supplied novel
derivatives of mescaline to psychiatrists at Bellevue Hospital in New York.
As Moreno recounts in his book, one of the guinea pigs was Howard Blauer, a
tennis pro admitted to Bellevue with depression in 1952, and who died there
after being given very high doses of a mescaline compound, possibly by
accident. Blauer seems to have known he was being given an experimental
drug. What he, didn't know, according to Moreno, was that the drug wasn't
designed to help his condition.

Of course, freak accidents can blight even meticulously ethical studies.
But what upsets Moreno is the sheer number of studies that failed to meet
the most basic ethical requirement: namely, telling subjects what the
experiment involved and what it was trying to discover before asking them
to enrol. Even the cases where no physical harm was done disturb him.

Few more so than the so-called "science club" studies of the 1940s and
1950s, in which scientists fed radioactive cereal to unsuspecting
youngsters at institutions for troubled adolescents. The experiments were
co-sponsored by the US government's Atomic Energy Commission and the Quaker
Oats company in the US, and carried out by scientists from the prestigious
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. According to Moreno, Quaker Oats
wanted to trace where the iron and other nutrients in their cereals
travelled to in the body, while the AEC wanted to learn more about how
radiation was deposited.

In 1997, Quaker Oats and MIT agreed to pay $1.85 million in compensation
without admitting guilt. Moreno acknowledges that the radiation levels were
too low to do any harm. But that's not the point, he says. The parents
weren't told radiation was involved, or that the research offered no
medical benefits. All they knew was their kids were joining a special club
which would involve outings to watch baseballand a special cereal diet.

"You probably wouldn't give kids at Andover [an expensive boarding school]
breakfast cereal with radioactive tracers in them. There is a real wrong
here. There was a form of discrimination. They were used."

So, unfortunately, were others. Not least the human subjects who were
secretly injected with plutonium by US government researchers in the
1940s--the very experiments that propelled Moreno into the political and
media limelight six years ago.

The Manhattan Project produced a new element, plutonium, which was not only
radioactive but difficult to handle. The US government wanted to know how
it would behave in the human body if it was accidentally ingested. What
happened next, Moreno explains in his book: "On March 24, 1945, a black,
53-year-old cement worker named Ebb Cade had a car accident near Oak Ridge,
Tennessee. Suffering from broken bones in his right arm and both legs, Cade
was taken to the nearby Manhattan Project Hospital. Because Cade's injuries
required several operations to properly set the bones, he was kept in the
hospital for a few weeks. It was long enough, also, for Cade--code-named
'HP [human product] 1'--to become the first of eighteen patients to be
injected with plutonium."

Moreno makes it clear that there's never been any evidence that these
injections caused cancer or other illnesses. The radiation levels were too
low (Cade died eight years later from unrelated causes). Even so, most
people would unreservedly condemn the idea of such research. Which is what
makes Moreno's attitude so interesting.

You'd think that studying such cases for so many years would have turned
him into one of the biggest anti-science and anti-government voices around.
But it hasn't. For Moreno, the offence in these experiments was not that
human subjects were injected with plutonium: given that people were
handling the stuff to make bombs, the US government was right to study
possible adverse effects. No, the offence, says Moreno, was that nobody
asked them first. All but one of the 18 subjects were-like Cade-unaware of
what was happening. And nor can that secretive approach be attributed to
simple ignorance. Quite the opposite.

Among the boxes of declassified documents, Moreno found evidence that US
officials were aware of the need to treat subjects ethically long before
bioethics was born. Take the term "informed consent". Medical ethics books
say that it was coined in 1957 in a legal case. In fact, it appears a
decade earlier in a letter from the general manager of the AEC to a
radiologist who wanted to publish his research from the Manhattan Project
era. The letter remains classified but appears to have forbidden
publication on the grounds that no attempt had been made to obtain informed
consent from the subjects. "That really blew me away because it was taking
place during mid-1947 when the Nazi doctors were being tried," says Moreno.
"If [the Nuremberg trial] was in nobody else's mind, it was in the minds of
the AEC administrators."

But if the US government invented the term "informed consent", why did so
many US Army sponsored researchers choose secrecy and deception? "The
doctors didn't identify with it, because at that time there was a
paternalistic attitude towards people who were your patients or your
research subjects. The military people couldn't identify with it because
the whole idea of informed consent was anathema to them."

Into the early 1970s, the US government continued experimenting on
ill-informed troops and prisoners, as well as unsuspecting civilians. For
some of these experiments, such as the release of harmless bacteria in
airports and subways, the government could never have received informed
consent from each person who would be affected.

Again, however, Moreno's view is surprising. Far from condemning such
experiments, he suggests democratic governments actually have a duty to
carry them out. "We live in a world where small groups that hate the US
enough might be quite interested in creating generalised terror. Is it
politically acceptable for elected officials to decide to do experiments
about how to protect against stuff and in the process perhaps expose some
of us to some risk?" Moreno's answer is yes, but with a big proviso:
governments should find a moral way of carrying out the research.

Even experiments that involve releasing bacteria in subways? Absolutely,
says Moreno. "You can't get informed consent from the whole population, so
what is the moral equivalent? I guess it's letting the public know that
these things may have to be done, and we vote for representatives knowing
they make the decision that these things have to be done."

For Moreno, that includes dealing with the threat of so-called genetic
weaponsviruses or bacteria engineered to harm specific racial groups. Some
believe fears about these hypothetical agents have been overblown, but
Moreno sees them as the biggest reason why governments are going to have to
continue to think imaginatively about how to do human experiments ethically.

And who would Moreno most trust to carry out the research? Ironically, it's
the US Army. These days most subjects in military experiments are recruited
from the Army's own medical units at Fort Detrick in Maryland. "They're
informed, they have a large amount of identification with the work, they're
not getting a lot of money-if any. The Army really has learnt, and does a
better job of this than academia." And most drugs companies. "What
percentage of the funds spent by the American pharmaceutical industry on
research are being spent on research into informed consent? Zero. And yet,
we know that without these people's bodies, there would be no market for
these drugs."

According to Moreno, the US military has learnt from its mistakes and the
horrible abuses detailed in those boxes of secret documents. It's time now
for civilian organisations to take the documents to heart. The point for
all of us, he says, "is that history is not just history".

Ben Franklin was a very intelligent and inquisitive man who were he somehow 
brought to our present era would quickly adapt and do better then many 
people from this time do!  But remember, we are all cut from the same 
genetic cloth so to speak.  Now imagine a man raised in the 20th century who 
dies in the early 21st and is suspended.

He is then reanimated into the very late 21st century.  He may find himself 
economically competing against young people genetically engineered to have 
cognitive abilities that far outstrip him that augment that already 
impressive ability with machines designed for their minds and not his.  Even 
if he uses this cybernetic augmentation he will not be on their level when 
they use it.

Imagine how this man may feel?  Especially if he was in his previous life 
considered very bright as an educated and respected professional.
This whole situation may lower his self-esteem as he sees his prospects for 
work, leisure and mates diminished in this new world.

So Ben Franklin in the 20th century being genetically "one of us" would 
adapt quickly and in time fully assimilate while a 20th/early 21st century 
person could find themselves woefully inferior in mental/physical powers as 
compared to the late 21st century person and experience culture shock that 
never wore off.

Of course, I realize some readers may say that he can be genetically 
engineered to be the equal of the societal mainstream.  But this may not be 
possible for an adult or may be too expensive.  Any thoughts?  Perhaps they 
would just have to wait until technology advanced and they could be 
"upgraded" but then they would probably always be several rungs behind on 
the ladder.

John Grigg

Mista Burch,  I always err on the side of caution, having seen the Futurists, 
scientists and Engineers fall on their asses; regarding technological 
forecasting.  It would be wonderful if what you say occurs.

Yes, provided there were no disadvantages.  If the effect were small it could 
still be
lost through drift (bad luck) but 30% is a lot, even late in life.

>Could such a mutation occur naturally in millions of years of  mice 
generations? --J. R.

There are billions of mice in the world, and each one carries
a few dozen point mutations from the previous generation. So
any 1-base mutation is happening several times a year.  Since
this is a loss of function, dozens of mutations (loss of the start
codon, any splicing goof, most additional stop codons, a couple
of significant base changes, and deactivation of the promoter)
would produce the phenotype.

Of some relevance is work John Tower did on increasing antioxidant
activity in flies.  Some lines got better, some got worse, and
some had no change.  This kind of mutant won't necessarily have a
big advantage.  On the other hand, you wouldn't want to take a
drug for this effect without screening - what if you're one of the
lines that loses?

Perhaps had these wonderful biologists gotten a treatment of lead from a 
firing squad, it might send a 'chiling effect' for non-voluntary human 
experimentation?

I agree with you John that this could come about.  Religious organizations
already do quarrel with extropian ideas on biotechnology, genetic
engineering and evolution theory. 

If the mass media were to pick out a group of thinkers to go head-to-head
with, it seems that the media would be most interested in a group that
draws cultural attention.

This is what usually happens.

Okay, got it. (Thank you for this free tutorial!)
Now, if mice suddenly mutated (or got genetically engineered) so that they could
live 200 years and grow as big as elephants, should we expect them to do so in
large numbers, in the wild? Or would something in their natural environment
interact with the Uber-Mice in such a way as to reduce rather than increase
their numbers? --J. R.

Longer lifespan with no disadvantages would be selected for, roughly to the 
point where only a negligeable number of mice would survive that long due to 
other causes (a lot less than 200 years, I'd think).  If the effects of the 
gene are more complex (only works if a particular set is in the organism, 
useless or harmful otherwise) then selection is less reliable, hence weaker 
and the effect "gives out" earlier.  

Of course longer lifespan may have costs.  In the Rose lab, the long-lived 
strains take longer to develop and lay fewer eggs in the first part of life.

Big size can be either good or bad, so it's hard to say in general.  Big as 
an elephant would, I think, be very bad. Little mice are doing very well 
while the only land animal as big as an elephant (the elephant :-) will be 
extinct in the wild in a few decades if humans don't save the ranges.

On reading the paper in more detail, it is necessary for them to assume
that conditions in the adjacent "brane(s)" are very different from here.
Specifically the matter density must be lower, so that galaxies and
clusters have not yet formed.  If they did, we would expect to see see
missing mass within globular clusters, and it is not present there.

On the other hand the density can't be too low or there wouldn't be enough
to explain the missing mass.

There is a magic value of about 1/4 the local density that looks like it
would work, but it is pretty ad hoc to start juggling parameters like
that.  It's much simpler to assume that the universe is much the same
everywhere.

Thank you for your enthusiasm.
I wish I could say I created this saying.
The line comes from "Eternity" by William Blake:

"Who seeks to bind herself a joy,
Does its winged life destroy.
Who touches beauty as he flies,
Lives in eternity's sunrise."

Combining this with a line from Rabindranath Togore, renders:
"May you live in eternity's sunrise,
on the seashore of endless worlds."

These two lines seem to me to convey even more of limitlessness and timelessness
than the words literally mean.
To avoid charges of plagiarism, I suppose I'd better cite Blake and Tagore when
dropping their words into a bowdlerized complimentary closing.

"I steal everything I know from the sources all around me."

When the effect gives out, do the descendents of long-lived mice return to their
former (and shorter) lifespans?

So, shorter life cycle strains would outperform long-lived strains?

I can think of one disadvantage to longevity. Generally (and this was even
more true in the past), an individuals' offspring care for him when he's
unable to care for himself. This minor drain on your children's resources
could be enough of a disadvantage to mildly impact their reproductive
rates - hence your "long term" reproductive rate (by which I mean total
number of descendants).

Yes, well, if we don't use symbols to point, we'll have to
use our fingers, which would be rude.

And your T'ai-chi is a bit lumpy, don't you think? I made
a cursory effort to decode it as HEX but null; it can't be
OCTAL, so what is it?  Are we in a sharing mood today?

Yes, I can see that. I still wonder if evolution can select for shorter life
spans in a particular population (not necessarily an entire species) via
speeding up the process of adaptation: shorter generations equals more genetic
experiments to run, and hence greater probability of solving problems presented
by a changing environment. If so, this would yield an advantage to a short-lived
population over a long-lived one. --J. R.

I'm sorry I don't know who I am responding to here, but at any rate it
seems just as illogical to refer to "self" as a "quality" as it would be to
regard it as a "quantity".  A quality is a predicate; so what subject or
substance exists such that we can attribute "self-ness" to it?  Note
that whatever it is, it cannot BE a self, but must have the property or
attribute of "self" -- "The grass is green" does not mean that grass IS
"green-ness".

Yes, Cynthia, it seems to me that "self" is a relation but not a relatum; I
mean that "interpersonal" is redundant.  Subjects of sensory deprivation
experiments report, not an exacerbation of "self-consciousness" but
rather a dissociative state in which eidetic imagery constitutes their
universe devoid of any subject-object dichotomy.  "Self-consciousness"
seems to me precisely that condition induced by a perception of some
"object" interpreted as an  "other" (that is, a mirror phenomenon, the
object being "another self"). In my opinion, what is usually regarded as
"self-awareness" is either a subvocal monologue misconstrued as a dialog,
or a unity attributed to a set of serial memories.

I realize this is very general, but a concrete illustration would be a person
total isolated from others, with no immediate expectation of rejoining a
community, who quickly creates the relationship called "self" by means
of a constructed duality. There cannot be an "I" without a "Me".

Finally, I am not denying the reality of individuation; I only mean to assert
that what is meant generally by "self" is a social construct and if reified or
hypostatized as a "substance" the result is an illusion.

Well, this has to be today's winning non sequitur; much more
to the point is:

A certain man asked the famous Mulla Nasrudin, "What is the
meaning of fate, Mulla?" Mulla replied, "Assumptions." "In what
way?" the man asked again.

"Mulla looked at him and said, "You assume things are going to
go well, and they don't - that you call bad luck. You assume
things are going to go badly and they don't - that you call good
luck. You assume that certain things are going to happen or not
happen - and you so lack intuition that you don't know what is
going to happen. You assume that the future is unknown. When
you are caught out - you call that Fate."

of Infinite Songs" is one of my favorites but -- WILLIE?  One

A priest asked: What is Fate, Master? 

And he answered: 
It is that which gives a beast of burden its reason for existence. It
is that which men in former times had to bear upon their backs.  It is
that which has caused nations to build byways from City to City upon
which carts and coaches pass, and alongside which inns have come to be
built to stave off Hunger, Thirst and Weariness.

And that is Fate? said the priest. 

Fate ... I thought you said Freight, responded the Master. 

That's all right, said the priest. 
I wanted to know what Freight was too.

Thanks for the feedback, Cynthia.  I think you are right, that my well being 
is quite intertwined with the well being of others.  However, I wanted to 
emphasize that all other things being equal (an example where they are not is 
when one person is trying to hurt another), everyone's well being is equally 
important, including my own.  I'm just usually better able to promote my own 
well being as opposed to most other people in the Universe (not that I don't 
try to help out others).  But it is equally true that it is difficult, and 
perhaps not even useful, to completely separate out what is good for me and 
what is good for another.  As a person, I almost never do anything for just 
one reason, but I do not believe this in any way lessens or corrupts a good 
deed.  I try to help to make the world better for others AND myself.  I try 
not to act out of purely selfish or purely selfless motivations, as either 
view can lead to an unbalanced viewpoint which often causes someone to 
suffer.  Thanks again for the comment.

I suppose I was being a little sloppy in my terminology (or creative, take

organism, evolved or designed, which possesses a sense of self.  For example, 
I have a self.  My brother, to the best of my knowledge, also possesses a 
self.  It is essentially being a person.  Now, I know a lot of these terms 
are either ill-defined or fuzzy logic, and I'm working on refining them.  I 
hope you've gotten the sense of what I mean, and could make some suggestions

I am glad to here you don't deny the reality of individuation, but I do not 
know that I completely agree to the self being a social construct.  Surely, 
what we think about the self is heavily influenced by social and cultural 
experience, but it seems to me that the self is a mental construct that I 
would have regardless of society.  True, the experience of "other" greatly 
aids in defining the borders of the self, but I don't know that it is really 
the self that is lost in those sensory deprivation experiments.  Rather, 
perhaps it is the sense of other that is lost, so that only the internal self 
remains (though we might agree that without a self and other, there may be no 
practical difference between losing the sense of self and losing the sense of 
other).  All I can say with certainty is that I exist, and that I am aware of 
my own existence.  It may be true that my self is constructed from serial 
memory (in fact, I would argue that a large part of the self is made up of 
precisely that), but its construction doesn't take away from its reality.  I 
do agree that the self is not a substance.

Thanks for the post, Bob.

Here is a very simplified summary of specific ideas derived from the
Works of Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900) that are widely accepted
without the slightest awareness of their origin and even by those
who profess to loathe the author and the philosophy which intro-
duced them.  I wish to thank Paul Brians for his scholarly work and
recommend a visit to his page the URL for which appears at the end
of this post.

[1]   The goal of life should be to find yourself. True maturity means
       discovering or creating your own identity.

[2]   The highest virtue is to be true to yourself.

[3]   When you fall ill, your body is trying to tell you something;
       listen to the wisdom of your body.

[4]   People who hate their bodies or are in tension with them need
       to learn how to accept and integrate their physical selves with
       their minds instead of seeing them as in tension with each other.
       The mind and body make up a single whole.

[5]   Athletes, musicians, etc. especially need to become so attuned
       to their bodies that their skills proceed spontaneously from the
       knowledge stored in their muscles and are not frustrated by an
       excess of conscious rational thought. (C.f. of Zen Buddhism)

[6]   Sexuality is not the opposite of virtue, but a natural gift that needs
       to be developed and integrated into a healthy, rounded life.

[7]   Many people suffer from impaired self-esteem; they need to work
       on being proud of themselves.

[8]   Knowledge and strength are greater virtues than humility and
       submission.

[9]   Overcoming feelings of guilt is an important step to mental health.

[10] You can't love someone else if you don't love yourself.

[11] Life is short; experience it as intensely as you can or it is wasted.

[12] People's values are shaped by the cultures they live in; as society
       changes we need changed values.

[13] Challenge yourself; don't live passively.

Don't know what "ER" is, don't watch T.V., don't go to any
movies except Ingmar Bergman's "The Magician" [because I
have been in love with Ingrid Thulin for years] and Clarke's
2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY [because it is a metaphor, but not
a theory, of everything].

So: hum a few bars and I'll fake it.  A line, phrase, something.

I'm afraid I was never seduced by Babylon 5, but I was well and
thoroughly
seduced 35 years ago by the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, and the few times
I've watched B5 I have always winced in pain at the thinly-disguised
allusions to Tolkien -- "It was the third age of mankind...", the
Rangers,
the Shadows, etc.  Sets my teeth on edge.

Nanotubes Make Tiny Diodes.
Scientists have made another step toward the miniaturization of electronic
devices. In today's Nature, they show that a single nanotube--a microscopic
pipe made of carbon--can act as a diode, a standard electronic component
that allows current to pass in one direction but not the other.

It was a pleasure to learn, Glen, that you made the statement because I
have great respect for your views.

To simplify things, refer to the effort of Depth Psychology from its incep-
tion to deal with basis of all psychoneuroses: primary narcissism. For Freud
this meant "the depersonalization of the Super-ego", for Jung the deperson-
alization of the unconscious "autonomous complexes" supporting the "social
construct" he called the "Persona" (Greek for "theatrical mask"), for Adler
the elimination of compensations generated by a sense of inferiority, etc.
Psychoanalysis, unlike Behaviorism, never denied the reality of selfhood, but
sought to liberate it from the artifacts of repression induced by social
authority figures.

My argument is addressed to the issue of "Personality" which I treat as
as epiphenomenon of relationship rather than an ontological given.

I am copying your entire paragraph because it should be read by those who
have not followed this thread.  Space does not permit a comprehensive reply
but I want to assure you that I distinguish "self-consciousness" from what
was once called "aseity" -- contemporary English has no homologous term.
Spinoza speaks of "God" as "sui generis" -- a similar concept. Aristotle used
the term (in English) "uncaused cause".  The general idea is that, in trying
to describe the basis of "identity" (from Latin "idem" = "same") with respect
to human reflexive cognition and conation (from which the experience of
autonomy derives) we encounter paradoxes everywhere if not outright
contradictions (what Kant called "Antinomies of Pure Reason"). While some
efforts have been made to formulate a suitable "Metapsychology" I am
under the impression that they have not been successful.

I would guess that the essential Axiom is "Unity"[1] and that the notion
of "consciousness" is a gratuitous postulate, because it appears to me to
be certain that "Self" is an agent that cannot be an object of perception
as such.  Without knowing who or what "I am", this post would not exist
were it not for the agency denoted by my name.

     a territory, and "self-consciousness" a virtually useless map designed
     by navigators who always kept the coastline in sight in order to avoid
     falling off the edge.  Take a look at a Tibetan Buddhist Mandala and
     imagine it existing in a virtual psychospace having the property of
     extension but not location.

  Robert Ettinger sent me a copy of The Anti-Aging Zone,
and asked for a review of it. Overall I was not too
impressed with this book. Rather than being a serious
look at interventions on either aging, or disease risk, it
is just a potboiler pushing Sears' high protein diet.
  The book is well written, and it is clear that Sears knows
how to write good copy. Although the Zone diet will not win any
support from main-stream medicine, but it is a lot healthier
than some other high protein diets on the market. His diet
is essentially the Mediteranean diet, emphasizing olive
oil, and lots of fruits and vegetables, with an extra dollop
of protein. He recommends cutting the fat off meat, and
consuming only egg whites (which lower cholesterol), and
discarding the egg yolks (which increase cancer risk).
  Unlike other high protein diets I doubt the the Zone diet
would increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, as Sears
takes some care to avoid the obvious sins in this regard.
High protein diets generally increase cancer risk, but the
inclusion of tofu, and lots of fruits and vegetables, makes me
think the risks associated with increased meat rations would
probably be largely offset. Others considerations such as
increased kidney stone risk, and weakened bones are harder
to evaluate, with the meat and fruits and vegetables offering
opposing effects. A mineral supplement would likely be a good
idea on this diet.
  However the major risk associated with the Zone diet is
increased risk of depression in susceptible individuals. All
high protein diets suffer from this defect, and it is not particular to
the Zone diet alone. This is a consequence of high protein diets
inhibiting tyrosine, and tryptophan transport across the blood/brain
barrier.
  Like most diets, significant weight loss will not occur on the Zone
diet, unless dieters are willing to go hungry. The major reason
why obesity is so common, is regarded by scientists as being due
primarily to a combination of the "couch potato" existence now
favoured by many, and the easy availability of a wide variety of
highly palatable foods. With regard to the former factor, lack of
exercise is not the only fattening  factor in our remote control
dominated existance. Snacking during  television watching,
despite not being hungry is an additional factor.  Weight loss has
been induced in children, by restricting the hours of television
watching.
  The consumption of a wide variety of highly palatable foods is
referred to in the medical literature as the  "cafeteria diet". Feeding
western style human food to rodents for example, in place of rodent
chow, sets the stage for a process of rapid gorging, in which
large weight gains are the net result. The incidence of obesity in Asian
populations is low, despite these diets not being high fiber, high protein,
or even in some cases low fat. It is an unfortunate fact of life that
delicious food encourages many to over-indulge. This is the dietary factor
which is primarily responsible for the obesity epidemic.
  If the reader is interested, as a test I suggest temporaily limiting food
intake to just whole meal bread with no toppings  for a one day.
Record calorie intake. You may be surprised by the  results.
  As an anti-aging or anti-disease risk book the Anti-Aging Zone falls
well short of being satisfactory. Sears does not even deal with the
known side-effects of high protein diets, let alone examine the effect
of diet on disease risk. You will not find  discussions of
the effect of tomato intake on prostate cancer risk, of nuts on
cardiovascular disease, of carrots on breast cancer risk, why you
should  cut garlic cloves open before cooking them  and other such
esoterica.
  Living longer or in better health is not an important goal with Sears,
despite  the title of his book. Rather Sears goes on a confused monolog
in which he discovers the answer to a question that puzzles gerontologists
to this day, why humans age. He has been criticized for trafficking in
falsehoods with his theories concerning eicosanoids. After reading one
scathing review in the medical literature exposing Sears' quackery, I must
come to the conclusion that honesty is one of  Sears' strong points.

And the responses should teach me to never be too dense and epigramatic in 
what I write here, or I'll live to regret it :-)  

Skipping, in a sense, to the end of the discussion (but, as I hope to 
explain, really not the end, but only an intermediate waypoint), J.R. Molloy 
posted an extended quote from an article by EO Wilson published earlier this 
year in the Atlantic:

       "The Biological Basis of Morality"
         http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/98apr/biomoral.htm
       "A Scientific Approach to Moral Reasoning":
         http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/98apr/bio2.htm

which, as it happens, I've previously endorsed to my friends as containing 
very valuable insight into how we might finally be on course to develop a 
truly rational ethical philosophy.  I agree with almost everything Wilson 
says there and in his book "Consilience" about how inquiry into the 
biological basis of human morality can both illuminate what's worth revering 
in biologically-based moral sentiments, and also how we might go about 
developing more rational moral sentiments.

But Wilson's own thinking on these lines leads to what may be the limits of 
at least a biologically-based scientific approach to morality.  As I wrote in 
my review of "Consilience" in Extropy Online magazine

        http://www.extropy.org/eo/articles/gbcurrent.html

Wilson ultimately turns away from the prospect of transcending the human 
animal BECAUSE he sees biology as the only possible basis for a "scientific 
morality": He believes we should not transcend the human animal because it is 
only as humans - with our particular, evolved ethical instincts - that we are 
moral.  Wilson's style of evolutionary morality is ultimately 
backward-looking and provides little basis for a transhuman morality.

Now I do see that Wilson has in fact identified a solid basis for a rational 
and "scientific" morality that can guide humans through transcendence of 
their current biological form, and that is in his reference to game theory.  
By stripping moral calculus to the bare essential of foresight and 
intentionality, we can develop tools for crafting values that ought to 
transcend the accidents of evolution.  Only time will tell whether the kinds 
of rules we seem to have distilled from "toy universes" in simple models will 
be robust in the face of radically augmented intentional actors.  Let's hope 
so.

But to return to my perhaps incautious statement about "science" not 
providing a basis for moral choice, I certainly didn't mean that we can't or 
shouldn't be RATIONAL about moral philosophy.  However, in our rightfully 
high valuation of the scientific method, I think it's important that we not 
fall prey to naive "scientism".  The scientific method is a subset of 
rational thought (and there definitely seems to me to be levels of 
applicability of the classic scientific method of hypothesis, experiment, 
repeatabilitiy and falsifiability) but reason is not only those things.  It's 
not as if our approach to reality has to be "full-blown science or nothing at 
all."

Even within the natural sciences, we see a spectrum of applicability of these 
tools, with physics at one end and, say, evolutionary biology at the other.  
While it is certainly possible to do "experiments" by predicting that, say, 
fossils of a particular type ought to be found in geological formations of a 
particular kind (and then looking to see if they are indeed found there), the 
number of ecological variables impacting living systems makes 
narrowly-focused "experiments" difficult.  

Human behavior in society presents even more difficult problems in applying 
the classic formulation of the scientific method.  The number of variables is 
much higher than in any physics experiment and carefully-controlled 
experimental activity is circumscribed by ethical limitations on just what 
can be done to people.  And consideration of moral issues in any really 
meaningful way is always a question of humans in society.  Thus "science" per 
se - at least with the tools currently available -- makes only an incomplete 
guide to moral philosophy.

With these comments in mind, I'll address some of the posts in this and 
related threads:

I think that's a correct statement of a healthy reaction to Sokal's 
"experiment".  Close readers will know that I never miss a chance to take a 
shot at postmodernist hogwash.  But my criticisms of postmodernism shouldn't 
be mistaken for a belief that pursuit of the traditional humanities isn't 
worthwhile. Use of at least some of the traditional methodologies employed in 
the humanities - especially history, tempered by a deep respect for the 
scientific method as the most certain guide to knowledge - where it can be 
employed, is still a deeply important part of participation in the 
development of culture.

That's probably a correct statement at a high level of generality, but it 
doesn't really address the ultimate questions of moral philosophy.  I think 
the essay by Greg Johnson that Daniel Ust posted in this thread on 99-11-17 
06:42:11 EST sets out very well how pointing to "self-interest" alone doesn't 
provide real answers to ethical questions.  This is hinted at by the very 
term you use, "ENLIGHTENED self-interest": A lot of complexity and many hard 
questions are subsumed under the term "enlightened".

Two posts illustrate what I consider to be an excessive "scientism" regarding 
social and philosophical matters:

I understand and agree with Anders' point, although perhaps the example given 
isn't a good one - after all, the market can sort out architectural 
questions.  (There's an example in my neighborhood. An office building was 
constructed about ten years ago that had a hideous green, textured concrete 
surface.  I remember thinking when it was being finished, "What an eyesore!  
Who would lease space there?"  Well, apparently few people did, because 
eventually the building was completely stripped of the offensive coating and 
re-sheathed with an attractive and creative mix of different glass and steel 
textures.  It now appears to be fully leased-up.)

This smacks of the kind of naive "scientific" approach to society that one 
finds in Marx and his followers.  Substitute "the vanguard party" for "SI", 
and you have the kind of elitist, "we know what's best for society" mentality 
that lead inevitably to Bolshevism.  I honestly can't imagine what process 
you're picturing this SI would engage in to make a "scientific" decision.  
Some kind of balancing of everyone's utility functions based on perfect 
knowledge of their internal brain states?  This sounds like one is merely 
substituting "SI" for "god" and "scientific decision making" for "paradise".

Here I note a personal response to comments of this kind similar to ones I've 
seen from other experts when people address the fundamentals of their 
expertise from what appears to be a lack of basic background in the area.  
With real respect to you J.R., I'm thinking of the frustration I've seen 
expressed by, say Robin when people talk about economics or by Natasha when 
people talk about art without having looked into the basics of the subject.  
I don't by any means wish to discourage "amateur" discussion (in fact, it's 
one of the things I value most about this forum), but history and politics 
are DEEP subjects.  Yes, there's a lot of hogwash that gets propagated in 
these fields (just as there is in economics and art), but it's not all 
hogwash, by any means.  For good or bad, rigorous science ISN'T yet possible 
in the study of human history, politics and law (and may never be), but that 
doesn't mean that one can't find some truth, if only a relative and 
contingent truth.  Navigating these realms is fraught with the danger of 
falling into the traps of total subjectivism on the one hand and simplistic 
scientism on the other.  As it happens, history teaches that both of these 
pitfalls lead to the same result: Totalitarianism.

This is an example of what I'm talking about.  It's probably true that deep 
down, all humans share a few basic needs and desires.  But a study of history 
will show that the devil is definitely in the details.  The disagreements 
about "how to do it" have given rise to a diversity of cultural phenomena as 
rich as anything one finds in biology or ecology.  History also teaches that 
people seeking simple solutions to questions of "the good" usually spill a 
lot of blood.

I think Damien has expressed well the complexities involved in considering 
ethical and social questions:

Or, to put it in terms of the question of "scientific" knowledge of social 
phenomena, people in society are like weather, only more so.  The fact that 
we have far from perfect models and that chaotic processes undermine the 
possibility of perfect knowledge doesn't mean that we can't have a science of 
meteorology, it just means that we have to understand the limits of 
prediction.  Transhuman technologies will, I suspect, only make the matter 
more complex and less predictable because, as I discuss above in connection 
with Wilson's "naturalism", we're looking to make the regime in which moral 
actors can exercise intentionality WIDER, not more narrow.

As a meme, maybe.  As a reality, never.  <Let the SIs decide> may bear a
memetic resemblance to <let Marx decide>, when implemented on naive
hardware, but in reality, the Bolsheviks are human and the SI is not. 
The reality of a state run by Bolsheviks and the reality of a world
rewritten by an SI would be utterly, unimaginably different.  Humans
have always been arguing that their political parties know best.  It's
human nature.  The whole point of building an SI is to get out of the
trap by transcending human nature.

We don't trust humans who claim to know best, because we know that
humans have evolved to believe they know what's best and then abuse that
power for their own benefit.  But to extend this heuristic to SIs
borders on the absurd.  And that makes <turn power over to SIs>
different from <turn power over to me> in practice as well.  The latter
says "Keep playing the game, but give me more points"; the former says
"Smash the damn game to pieces."

> I honestly can't imagine what process

But that doesn't preclude the SI doing so!  The whole foundation of
"letting SIs decide" is the belief that somewhere out there is some
completely obvious answer to all of the philosophical questions that
perplex us.  The very fact that we, the high-IQ Extropians, are
discussing this question in the late twentieth century, and making more
sense than eleventh-century philosophers or twentieth-century
postmodernists, should lead us to conclude that intelligence does play a
part in moral decisions - not just with respect to internal consistency
and game-theoretical stability, but with respect to the basic
foundations of morality.  The very fact that we are making more sense
than Neanderthals (or frogs) should lead us to conclude that
intelligence plays a part.  What lies beyond the human debate?  I don't
know, but I think it's reasonable to hope that beyond humanity lies the
truth.  And if I'm wrong, well, this course of action is as good as any.

Hey, if it works, why argue?  Personally I'd hope for something a little
more exciting, like some kind of provably moral grand adventure, but
your scenario also sounds like fun.

OK, how's this for real-world data:

The U.S. Navy routinely operates nuclear submarines (with a crew of several
hundred men) submerged for several months, and it has conducted a number of
endurance trials in which submarines stayed down for much longer periods.
During such a deployment the air supply is completely cut off from the
outside world and recycled by mechanical systems.  I think this provide
adequate proof that atmospheric regulation can be handled by non-biological
systems.

On the same vessels the entire fresh water supply is extracted from sea
water by mechanical systems.  While this is a somewhat easier problem than
extracting water from sewage, it illustrates that it is pretty easy to get a
steady stream of potable water from a large uniform contaminated source.  It
should also be noted that this was accomplished in the '60s without a
particularly large R&D investment - on can reasonably assume that a similar
effort today could achieve similar results from a wider variety of inputs.

For food supply we can turn to commercial hydroponics technology, which has
proved capable of producing a decent variety of food without any natural
ecology at all.  Its only obvious shortcoming is that it requires
significant inputs of nutrients that would require an excessive amount of
effort to manufacture artificially using current methods - you'd need a
good-size chemical plant, which would probably push the minimum viable
colony population up into the tens of thousands.

Put all this together, and we can definitely say that a large colony can be
made self-sustaining in any environment where large quantities of water can
be found.  Add in the ability of even primitive nanotechnology to
manufacture complex molecules to order, and you can ditch the conventional
chemical plant and get a viable colony of a few hundred.  You can also
replace the requirement for nearby water sources with a requirement for just
about anything containing large amounts of H and O, which opens up a
significant fraction of the solar system to colonization.

So, where exactly is the fatal problem supposed to be?

I don't follow 'closure' experiments for the very good reason that they have
absolutely nothing to do with practical life support engineering.  There are
basically two kinds of researcher in this field - scientists who are
interested in studying how ecologies work, and ideologues who are engaged in
some kind of fuzzy-headed Gaea-worship.  I'm sure the work of the first
group has value to a lot of biology-related fields, but it has nothing to do
with the problem at hand.  Building a practical life support system entirely
through biological self-regulation is probably impossible on any practical
scale unless you can engineer species to order, and even then it is probably
the most complex of all possible ways of solving the problem.

I'd think that for most organs you'd also have to solve the problems
involved in growing blood vessels and nerves in the proper configuration.
How hard do these problems look?

This is interesting.  I don't understand everything I know about AIDS.  

When someone makes things needlessly complicated then I get the feeling I'm 
being lied to.  In other words the AIDS thing has caused my BullShit detector 
to go "off the scale".

Sorry I don't have exact sources but some of the reasons I lean in this

Not anytime soon.  "Make faster computers" is more like "make more efficient
factories" than "make faster airplanes", in that it allows a great deal of
latitude in taking different approaches to get around physical constraints.
Currently we don't see any hard limits on what is possible until you reach
the realm of large-scale nanocomputer networks, and minds with that kind of
hardware to work with would be so far ahead of us that it seems unlikely
that we could accurately predict their limitations.

The current trend is in the opposite direction.  Increasing automation
allows you to replace inefficient human interaction with ever more efficient
types of software interaction, which give huge increases overall efficiency.
Again, I don't see a hard limit until the system becomes so fast that light
speed delays are the limiting factor, and that doesn't happen until you've
gone well beyond most people's concept of a post-singularity world.

Sorry, I didn't phrase that right.  If selection is weaker due to complicated 
genetics,
the lifespan increase selection will be able to establish is shorter.  If you 
introduced
hypothetical improvements with simple genetics and no disadvantages, maybe
mice in the wild would end up with a lifespan of four years (I'm making up 
the numbers)
If the mutations had complicated genetics, maybe the best selection would be 
able
to do is 3 years.

With these particular strains.  Research has shown that some "short-lifespan" 
alleles
carry compensating advantages (for the genes, not necessarily the organism) 
while
others serve no purpose and have eluded selection.  Theory suggests (although 
I'm not
aware of any experimental tests) that genes with important and straightfoward 
"short-lifespan" effects essentially only come attached to compensating 
benefits.

The best area of "natural" effects to look at, by this theory, are 
short-lifespan alleles
which help the interests of the gene rather than the organism - mostly 
fertility 
and sexual selection genes.  It may well be possible to find genes that, say, 
increase
the growth of secretory breast or prostate cells.  Conking those genes will 
reduce
fertility (but we don't care much; we can deal with such problems) but 
they'll cut
your chance of breast or prostate cancer.  Since the genes are evolutionarily 
advantageous, they will exist even if easy to knock out and so be good targets
for medicine.  

We can also look at adaptations for our ancestral environement that are no 
longer
appropriate.  Genes for high LDL cholesterol and adult-onset diabetes seem to 
be
starvation defenses.  Those should also be amenable to intervention, with no 
cost
as long as we keep the supermarkets stocked.

Our best bet for the costless problems (whatever they are) is to look at 
things that
would be hard for evolution to do, so gene knockouts, drug alterations and 
simple
mutations are poor choices.  We would want to bring in novel systems, from 
design
or from other organisms.  An example (from Caleb Finch) would be whale 
anti-cancer
mechanisms.  Whales have a per-cell cancer chance that is orders of magnitude 
less
than yours.  Presumably they have at least one additional layer of defense.  
If we
could figure out what it was, we could take out a stem cell type, splice in 
the cancer
defense, wipe out the cells in the body, and then insert the "improved" 
cells.  Voila,
90% reduction in leukemia.  If we're really lucky, we might be able to 
improve cell
senescence at the same time.

Yes, although this applies only to humans, so we're not likely to find these 
kinds of things by looking at mice.  We might get lucky and find evolution 
has "revived" some mouse problems fixed in other primates.

It can, it's just that any individual advantages will overwhelm the group 
advantage.
Roughly, a group allele benefits only with the frequency of groups going 
extinct.  An individual allele benefits with the frequency of individuals 
dying.  Obviously the latter is far more common, so the selection to improve 
individual fitness is typically orders of magnitude larger than group 
fitness.  

There's an experimental problem in that the power of group selection is 
generally lower than the lowest effects on individual selection we can 
detect.  So we can't say that individual selection on any particular real 
trait or allele is low enough for group selection to go.

It was a most moving poem.  Alda's character is a senior doctor
who is still very competent but has alzheimers and is starting to
become absent minded.  He cannot deal with the latest surgical
techniques, yet can use the old ones better than any young doctor.

In one particularly poignant interlude, the doctor recites flawlessly
a Blake poem he had memorized 3 decades before, yet cannot
recall where he parked that morning.

The poem:  it is about a bird in the meadow, who does not realize
the end of her days is at hand, so she merrily goes about her
business, singing and flying about, whereas the man who watches
from a distance is burdened with the grief of knowing of his own
mortality.  It is a powerful piece.  spike

I've been meaning to reply to this for some time.  I have had a number
of similar ideas, and what I think amounts to a serious critique of
standard objectivist ethics.  I acknowledges the absolute necessity
for treating people as individuals but still come up with an ethical
impulse to service to others.

I think about ethics in terms of time scales.  On the shortest
possible time scale, the moment of the perceived now, i.e. the period
long enough for my brain to signal my body electro-chemically to do
something, take the action and receive the sensory feedback, I can
only do what I want to do.  After all, we each act through our own
bodies, so in some sense it makes sense in those moments only to
analyze our own goals.  This corresponds well I think with Ayn Rand's
selfishness: free of coercion, we each follow our own values.

As you broaden the timescale, and consider the hierarchy of meta goals
(e.g. I move my legs because I want to walk, I want to walk because I
want to go to work, I want to go to work because I want to do my job,
I want to do my job for money, pride, fun, etc.) you find a greater
and greater admixture of other peoples' concerns in the desiderata.
This makes sense, because serving the interests of other sentient
beings in a cooperative way is the only method I know to allow for
peaceful, mutually beneficial existence among them.  If one refused to
consider the interests of others, one would have nothing to offer
them, i.e. no goods or services to exchange.  It's possible one could
become a completely self-sufficient hermit, a la the unabomber in his
shack, but in so doing one would be deliberately choosing a path of
eventual impoverishment, in every sense -- material, mental, and
ethical -- relative to the mass of humanity who enjoy benefit from
constructive engagement with their peers.  No sort of greatness or
glory could be attained that way.  Even a great mind that did seek
isolation would hope to bring back her or his ideas to the public and
thus would serve and engage with the mass of humanity in a substantial
way.

In fact, I most respect those whose value other selves so highly that
on the longest scale they plan to contribute to the good of all
humankind or mindkind, to employ Anders Sandberg's coinage.  On that
scale, one doesn't need to think of oneself at all, since if one has
properly planned for one's one productive work, care, and
self-preservation in the short and medium term, one can trust to one's
labor to earn the means in the future to go on doing so.  So in the
long run others and their desires are paramount in my scheme.

Another way to phrase this is that my ethical system begins with total
respect for the individual's rights and absolute dominion over himself
or herself, but, strangely, finds its telos in service to others.  So
while the instant principle of action is self-interest, my values are
utterly philanthropic.  I think the standard objectivist ethics lacks
any discussion of this ethical telos, though I may simply not yet have
read enough.

Still another way to look at this would be to acknowledge that we all
face the world from within our own skins.  Therefore, we are obliged
to nurture and protect ourselves from moment to moment.  But on a
longer time scale, when our goals may direct the arc of our whole
lives, my values drive me to recognize that there's a lot more good to
gain from considering and working for the good of others, rather than
ourselves, since there is so much more to the world of other people
than there is to any individual.  I'll note that the most successful
businesses have to operate this way; in order to keep on maximizing
profits from quarter to quarter, they have to ask themselves: "What do
other people need and want?" not so much "How can I make a boatload of
money?"

Regards,
James Wetterau

Jim, think of it as a tribute to, not a ripoff of, Tolkien.  I suspect

So, if individuals who live shorter than average lives produce more generations
because of their shorter life cycle, would this tend to overwhelm an opposing
group tendency toward greater longevity?

If reproductive frequency varies among individuals (which, as you point out, it
does), aside from offering an advantage in the form of increased generational
mutability, doesn't faster reproduction give speedy breeders a numerical
advantage, since their genes would increase in the group faster than the genes
of slower reproducers?

Yes, it stands to reason that the group would tend to dilute any mutation
occurring as a result of individual selection. Groups tend to assimilate and
disperse any freak genetically induced traits (at least those which don't result
in infertility). Could shorter life spans, which would increase the frequency of
such occurrences, accelerate the Evolution of the entire group? --J. R.

I see. So complicated genetics tends to resist a simple (genetically caused)
extension in longevity. The more complicated the genetics (along with
accompanying ecological complexities, of course), the less stable a genetically
derived extension of longevity. Does that imply that Evolution selects for
shorter life-spans under certain circumstances? I still find it difficult to
fathom why a population that reproduces or completes its life cycle in half the
time of a competing population does not garner an advantage for itself in that
it can adapt to changing environmental conditions twice as fast.

For example: Suppose a catastrophic event destroys all human technology on
Earth. Dogs and cats, with reproductive cycles seven times faster than human,
could revert to their wild state, become feral, seven times faster than humans
could revert to hunter-gatherer nomadic bush people. This would give the dogs
and cats that got thrust into a primordial jungle an advantage over humans who
could not so quickly revert to feral prehistoric conditions of living off the
land.

Could a shorter reproductive cycle (producing more offspring in a given amount

So, Evolution wants organisms to reproduce, even if it means a greater risk of
developing cancer (for the individual) to do so. That makes sense, since the
species comes before the individual. Why doesn't it make sense for faster
Evolution, via shorter life cycles, to render a biological advantage for a
species? The mutability of bacteria and viruses gives them a powerful strategy
against longer-lived species which cannot change as quickly, yes?

Very encouraging. Extropic genetic engineering trumps and transcends Evolution.

I don't recall the poem and I've employed a very good search engine
associated with an English Poetry Archive using a Boolean search
mode for combinations of keywords suggested above.  For example
bird AND meadow AND mortality, or bird AND flying AND grief, or
meadow AND mortality AND singing, and so on.  Nearly always the
list of poets and poems displayed includes Wordsworth, but NEVER
Blake. [You don't need to include the operator -- just select "AND"
in the checkbox array.]

I recommend you go to this site and use the search facility; it
could well be that this experiment would trigger further associations
and recollections, or just stimulate your intuitive faculty so you
would find your poem without knowing exactly how you did it.

My research was very enjoyable, but the conviction grew on me
that some piece of the puzzle was missing; that I would never find
the right combination but that you might by means of a new keyword.

No, if the extra reproduction gained early exceeds that forgone late (due to 
earlier
death), then the mutation is beneficial to the individual's reproductive 
fitness.  There 
is actually a benefit to faster generation times, since offspring born early 
start
reproducing earlier.  But what counts is the benefit to the organism's 
reproductive
fitness.  Having more offspring early *and* surviving late would be even 
better than
early offspring and early death, it's just often not possible.

Dying early, per se, does not improve your rate of reproduction.  If an 
allele which
hastens death *also* improves net reproduction yes, it will spread through the
population.  Such things appear reasonably common in real life.  However, any 
affect on increased evolutionary rate is negligeable - it's the fast 
reproduction 
which makes the allele spread.

It could, just as mutagenesis can increase evolutionary rates in the lab.
However, if the shorter lifespan is in any meaningful way detrimental to the
fitness of individual organisms, it will be lost anyway.

Incidentally, according to many punctuated equilibrium models, most organisms
are already pretty much adapted to their environments.  Evolution then becomes
a matter of selection weeding out the continual onset of deleterious new 
mutations.  In that case a shorter generation time is no help; you're getting
more mutations from the faster reproduction.

It never selects for shorter lifespan per se.  Shorter lifespan may evolve 
because
it comes as part of a beneficial package-deal or because longer lifespan is to
hard to select for.

The *population* garners an advantage (assuming the 
environment is changing).  But, *all* alleles in the 
population get the same benefit.  Alleles for extended
survival (hypothetically with no other effect) are 
effectively "cheaters" and oust competing alleles for
short lifespan because they also get the benefit of 
their carriers reproducing longer.

Presumably alleles *conducing to* extended *fertile* lifespan (I don't
believe they could have no other effect) might always fare less well,
stochastically, than competitors that permit more frequent remixing of
immunological defence genes, etc. But is that correct? If you live long and
mate throughout that extended span, why should your meioses create fewer or
inferior recombinations than those of your offspring? Outbreeding, I guess... 

It does look to me as if critters without effective predators (elephants by
size, us by smarts, boids on the wing) tend to conserve genetic changes in
the direction of extended longevity - but *we* don't seem to extend
*fertility* very well. Yet the Grandmother hypothesis (that sterile oldies
look after the kids, allowing mother to produce more of the same genes),
while appealing, hadn't worked out mathematically last time I checked.

Diet debates can leave you hungry for facts
BY DAVE BARRY
ONE recent Tuesday morning I was flipping through the TV channels at a
brisk, businesslike, no-nonsense pace, looking for Rocky and Bullwinkle,
when I found myself caught up in a fascinating installment of Leeza Gibbons'
talk show, ``Leeza.'' The theme of the show was: ``Women Who Cannot
Correctly Spell Their Own Names.''

No, seriously, the theme was: ``Superstars of the Diet Wars.'' This was a
debate among top diet experts, who felt so strongly about the correct way to
lose weight that at times they came close to whacking each other over the
head with their competing diet books.

Dieting was not always so complicated. Thousands of years ago, there was
only one diet book, titled ``Don't Eat Too Much.'' It consisted of a big
stone tablet on which were chiseled the words ``DON'T EAT TOO MUCH!'' It did
not sell well, because nobody could lift it, on top of which everybody back
then was busy with other concerns, such as not starving.

In modern America, however, food is abundant everywhere except aboard
commercial airplanes. Dieting has become a huge industry involving many
complex theories that can be confusing to the average layperson sitting on
the Barcalounger, trying to decide whether to open a second bag of potato
chips or simply eat the onion dip right out of the tub. So let's review the
History of Modern Diet Science:

The first big advance came in 1895, when a food researcher named Dr. Wilbur
Calorie made the breakthrough discovery, while working late one night, that
he could no longer pull his pants up past his thighs. After spending many
hours in the laboratory squinting at fudge, Dr. Calorie concluded that
people gain weight because certain foods contain tiny invisible scientific
units that became known, in honor of their discoverer, as ``Wilburs.''

No, sorry, I mean ``calories.'' For decades, everybody operated on the
Calorie Counter Theory of dieting, which basically states that you should
never eat anything that tastes good. Then along came a new theory, the Evil
Fat Theory, which states that you CAN have calories, but you should NOT have
fat; this resulted in the multibillion-dollar Low-Fat Things Industry, which
gave us low-fat brownies, low-fat Milk Duds, low-fat cows, low-fat cologne,
the cast of ``Friends,'' etc.

But there is ANOTHER major theory that says you can eat all the fat you
want, but you CAN'T have carbohydrates; that you can snork down an entire
pig for breakfast, but eat a single Froot Loop and you will bloat out like a
military life raft. The Evil Carbohydrate Theory is extremely hot at the
moment, as is evidenced by the top-selling diet books, which include
``Carbohydrate Beaters,'' ``Carbohydrate Busters,'' ``Carbohydrate
Whackers,'' ``Let's Poke Carbohydrates in the Eyeball,'' ``Carbohydrates
Kidnapped My Wife'' and ``Fight Carbohydrates Through Sorcery the Harry
Potter Way.''

So it's hard for a dieter to know what to think, which is why it was so
helpful for the ``Leeza'' show to hold a debate among the leading diet
experts, including several medical doctors, several people with scientific
initials after their names, and of course Suzanne Somers, who may yet win a
Nobel Prize for her work on the ThighMaster, and who is now a top diet
authority with a book out. It is only a matter of time before she thinks
seriously about running for president.

SO ANYWAY, the diet experts debated their theories, and Leeza walked around
frowning with the deep concern that talk-show hosts feel about everything.
The audience provided feedback by holding up cards that said YES on one side
and NO on the other. (At one point an expert mentioned the first law of
thermodynamics, and Leeza asked if anybody knew what that was, and the
audience consensus was NO). In between there were numerous commercials, most
of which were for law firms that want to Fight For You, although there was
also a thought-provoking one for a toilet cleanser.

Anyway, I watched the experts debate for an hour, and here's what I learned:


a..  The (pick one: low-calorie; low-fat; low-carbohydrate) diet really
works!

b..  Whereas the (pick one: low-calorie; low-fat, low-carbohydrate) diet
will probably kill you.

c..  Suzanne Somers, in all objectivity, thinks you should buy her book.

d..  If you are a human being of any kind, you should file a lawsuit,
because YOU HAVE MONEY COMING!

e..  Speaking of TV attorneys, toilet bacteria grow like CRAZY.
So there are the facts, consumers; it's now up to you to make an informed
decision. Remember: It's YOUR body. And, as such, it wants a chili dog.

Yeah, well.  I just remembered another one -- Za'ha'dum as an
imperfect anagram of Khazad-dum.  Groan.

I suppose.  Marion Zimmer Bradley does it too.  There are two ways of
looking at this:  1) as an homage to "the master"; 2) as a conspicuous
lack of
originality on the part of the influencee.  Of course, if the reader (or
viewer) is altogether unfamiliar with J.R.R.T., it won't matter
to ver at all; otherwise, I suspect that many, maybe even most, would
find it as
jarring as I do.

Another way of looking at it is if one is revulsed by Tolkien -- but perhaps
not by really good fantasy, such as the works of Peter S. Beagle or Lord
Dunsany -- that 1 & 2 above as one and the same.:)

But seriously, others have pointed to a Lovecraft influence on "Babylon 5"
too.  The thing is TV and film often does that.  Look at Sam Raimi's films
and his television series.  All of them rip off what they can shamelessly
from other stories, and that is part of the fun of them -- even when they
are lacking in other merits.  And the other art forms do it too.  None of
this stuff is made in a vacuum.

However, one thing that I do find boring is that most TV borrowings are so
easy to pick out.  In other art forms, the creative recycling of past
material is often buried and more varied.  TV tends to skim only whatever is
close to the surface of the collective unconscious -- so to speak.

One thing in favor of "Babylon 5": at least it wasn't "Star Trek.":)

 impulse to service to others.>>

I would say an impulse toward service to all (myself included), but I'm with 
you.
 
 <<I think about ethics in terms of time scales.  On the shortest
 possible time scale, the moment of the perceived now, i.e. the period
 long enough for my brain to signal my body electro-chemically to do
 something, take the action and receive the sensory feedback, I can
 only do what I want to do.  After all, we each act through our own
 bodies, so in some sense it makes sense in those moments only to
 analyze our own goals.  This corresponds well I think with Ayn Rand's
 selfishness: free of coercion, we each follow our own values.>>

I would agree in general with the most local and fastest events being focused 
primarily on yourself, though I think this also applies to those if very 
close proximity.
 
 <<As you broaden the timescale, and consider the hierarchy of meta goals
 (e.g. I move my legs because I want to walk, I want to walk because I
 want to go to work, I want to go to work because I want to do my job,
 I want to do my job for money, pride, fun, etc.) you find a greater
 and greater admixture of other peoples' concerns in the desiderata.>>

Too true.  As long as there are two or more people in existence, our concerns 
almost certainly will have to interact.

 <<This makes sense, because serving the interests of other sentient
 beings in a cooperative way is the only method I know to allow for
 peaceful, mutually beneficial existence among them.>>

Again, the main difference I would have here is to expand service to all 
sentient beings (including myself).  And by cooperating to acheive a better 
life for all concerned, we are able to do more than any one could do singly.

 <<If one refused to consider the interests of others, one would have nothing 
to offer them, i.e. no goods or services to exchange.  It's possible one could
 become a completely self-sufficient hermit, a la the unabomber in his
 shack, but in so doing one would be deliberately choosing a path of
 eventual impoverishment, in every sense -- material, mental, and
 ethical -- relative to the mass of humanity who enjoy benefit from
 constructive engagement with their peers.  No sort of greatness or
 glory could be attained that way.  Even a great mind that did seek
 isolation would hope to bring back her or his ideas to the public and
 thus would serve and engage with the mass of humanity in a substantial
 way.>>

This also is true to a certain extent.  But are greatness and glory things to 
be sought?  They can be kind of nice, but I think of them more as 
by-products.  I would find a person who annonymously makes contributions to 
the betterment of people would be making as great a contribution as those who 
do so publicly (this annonymity need not be selfless; the person may just 
value privacy and peace).  
 
 <<In fact, I most respect those whose value other selves so highly that
 on the longest scale they plan to contribute to the good of all
 humankind or mindkind, to employ Anders Sandberg's coinage.>>

Yes, I think the longest scale is the one that shows the maximal path to good 
for all.  Mostly because I believe a good life is cumulative, so the longer 
you live a decent life, the better.  And if we all are pledged to aiding one 
another to that goal, then hopefully all it will take is one sentient being 
acheiving eternity, who can then bring the rest of us through if we can't do 
so ourselves.

 <<On that scale, one doesn't need to think of oneself at all, since if one 
has
 properly planned for one's one productive work, care, and self-preservation 
in the short and medium term, one can trust to one's labor to earn the means 
in the future to go on doing so.  So in the long run others and their desires 
are paramount in my scheme.>>

I'd say the desires of others are important, but that my own are paramount 
from my perspective (if for no other reason then I have the most say in those 
desires and their acheivement).

 <<Another way to phrase this is that my ethical system begins with total
 respect for the individual's rights and absolute dominion over himself
 or herself, but, strangely, finds its telos in service to others.  So
 while the instant principle of action is self-interest, my values are
 utterly philanthropic.  I think the standard objectivist ethics lacks
 any discussion of this ethical telos, though I may simply not yet have
 read enough.>>

Absolute dominion over one's self may not be the best course (though near 
dominance is close).  What about those who are incapable of making rational 
decisions through accident or disease?  What of those who have willingly 
accepted responsibilities, but then decide they do not wish to fulfill them?  
I would agree that when working with a functional mind and making decisions 
that do not strongly impact on others, then unfettered autonomy is the best 
course.  However, it is rare that our own actions do not have an effect on 
another.  This must be carefully weighed.  Sometimes self interest simply 
conflicts with philanthropy (or even other self interests).  I agree that 
objectivist thinking (specifically Rand) comes across as being focused on the 
self to the virtual exclusion of all others.  I prefer a more balanced 
approach that acknowledges both the objective and subjective aspects of my 
life.  I am one of many subjective universes built from and interacting with 
an objective one (as well as each other).
 
 <<Still another way to look at this would be to acknowledge that we all
 face the world from within our own skins.  Therefore, we are obliged
 to nurture and protect ourselves from moment to moment.  But on a
 longer time scale, when our goals may direct the arc of our whole
 lives, my values drive me to recognize that there's a lot more good to
 gain from considering and working for the good of others, rather than
 ourselves, since there is so much more to the world of other people
 than there is to any individual.

 Regards,
 James Wetterau >>

I agree that we are obliged to nurture and protect ourselves, but disagree 
that there is more to the world of other people than there is to any 
individual.  Going back to my acknowledgement of the subjective aspect of 
life, each and every person is a subjective universe, derived from the 
objective universe in which we live.  Though the actual contents of any one 
subjective universe may be limited, it is still precious, and I do not 
believe you can successfully quantize how precious.  Each person is of 
inestimable value (to me if to nobody else), thus I am as valuable as any 
other person, and they are as valuable as me.   I chose between the needs of 
myself and others more in terms of practicality than any sense of one being 
more important than the other.  Often, it is my own needs that are the most 
practical for me to meet (and also the most necessary, as if I am to be of 
any good to others, it usually means I need to take good care of myself).  
But again, I would say there is no more nor less to the world of others than 
there is to my own.

Thanks for the comments, James.  They certainly helped me further examine my 
own ideas on this subject.

Oh no Jim, do assume intentional homage to J.R.R.T.  In my own fiction
work I have place many subtle references to Hofstadter, for instance,
in an effort to *celebrate* and call attention to him and his work, such as
the
one found in this sentence regarding Hofstadter and self referencing
paradox.

I have been given permission to use a palace for nanotech discussions.
(until I create my own nanotech palace-which I am planning to) This palace
is open at all hours. If you do not have palace or are not aware of it, it
is a 3D virtual chatroom with visual backgrounds and rooms you can move
about in wearing avatars (lil pictures). You can download this program for
free at:      http://www.thepalace.com
After it is downloaded, you want to go to the palace called "Genetically
Enhanced Palace"
Site ID KEMSZBW6  If you can't find it, you can try to locate it at the
palace website, by looking under G for genetically...... and then clicking
the little red P to the right of the palace name.
 If you don't want to download the palace, you can go in from the palace
website, and instead of clicking the little red P you would click the blue
eye beside it. This of course does not give you all the cool tools that you
can have if you install the palace. (I recommend)
If you need help with any of this you can email me at nanogirl@halcyon.com
and I will help you, I can also help you kick off your start in the palace
if you meet me at the Genetically Enhanced Palace. I won't always be there,
but I will stop in at least daily. I am not the wiz of this palace, so I do
not control the settings in there. I am trying to get a room inside of this
palace called "nanotech" ---or something along that lines. When I get the
nanotech palace I will let you know, but until then---
Remember if you want to talk nano in a cool environment go to "The
Genetically Enhanced Palace!"

A few months is not a very long time.  Perhaps you would feel
just fine committing yourself to being a member of the first
group that gets to test such systems in their twelfth month,
eighteenth month, etc. 

> So, where exactly is the fatal problem supposed to be?

If we knew in advance where all the fatal problems are, technology
would not need to be tested. Our difference is that you are impressed
with the amount of testing that has been done so far, and I am not.
We know how to keep people alive in space for a few months at a
time. We know nothing about how to do it longer than that. We know
nothing about conventional human reproduction in space.  Zip. Nada.
Now conventional human reproduction may become obsolete in fifty
years, or it may not. I don't think it's a good idea to pin the
future of our civilization on the belief that conventional human
reproduction will be completely replaced by different processes
sooner than we will require access to offplanet material resources.

Absolutely nothing, eh?  Strong words. Using prejudices of this
kind to justify a failure to investigate alternative approaches
leads to tunnel-vision research, which is generally the least
productive approach to unsolved problems.  Another unproductive
approach to unsolved problems is pretending that they are already
solved.

As for "closure experiments" being about Gaia worship, I'm not
talking specifically about rich-ecosystem closure experiments,
but *any* and *all* closure experiments, including Mir and your
submarines. You think technology can be designed and deployed
successfully without being tested. I don't. If we are serious
about taking advantage of offplanet resources, and we are not in
a state of Blind Faith that uploading and other technologies
will relieve us of having to study what are the *current*
obvious obstacles to this, then we need to study more long-term
closures. I don't care if they are full of wombats and
woad-painted Wiccans or do all their material transformations in
a laboratory full of glassware and filters, they need to be
closed, and they need to be closed for years, and we need to
study the ways they change over time, including changes
beyond the twenty-four month timescale which have *never* been
studied for any closed systems other than the planet as a whole
and small terraria incapable of supporting a human being.

It is well known that pure water can be obtained from contaminated water
by a process of evaporation and condensation, which is sometimes called
distillation.  When that is done as an intentional activity, the cost of
the resulting purified water is exorbitantly high relative to what people
are used to paying for tap water or agricultural/industrial water, since
the process is energy intensive.  On a nuclear powered ship (submarine or
surface) there is plenty of energy available, so that technique could be
used.  But still, it would probably be cheaper for a nuclear powered
surface ship to store fresh water obtained from on-shore sources than it
would be to make fresh water from seawater. 


Almost all of the tap water and agricultural/industrial water consumed in
the world comes indirectly from the sea, and most of the purification is
accomplished by a process of evaporation and condensation.  The trick is
that the evaporation and condensation step in the purification process is
accomplished free of cost since it happens naturally without any effort
on the part of man.  Seawater evaporates and comes down as rain, and the
rainwater is collected in rivers, lakes, and groundwater.  Nearly pure
water can be collected from those sources, and the additional processing
to make the water safe to drink can be done cheaply.  Those processes are
settlement, filtration, and disinfecting (usually with chlorine). 
Distribution is done under pressure to prevent the introduction of
contaminants during distribution.

Ron,

I beleive that all surface ships of any size make fresh from sea water
even given that the cost of energy can be quite high.  Even my boat can
make a couple thousand gallons a day with its reverse osmosis system.

This is done because even though shore water would be nearly free, the
space to store it would be incredibly expensive.  A 100 footer works out
to about 15,000 dollars a liner foot, and/or about 35 dollars per cubic
foot to purchase so every cubic foot is valued much to highly to make it
a large water tank. Then the energy required to move 10 or 15 tones of
water along with the craft would add up quickly as a continuing cost
factor.

Just my 2 cents worth.

Who do you watch, the millions of people loudly shouting "I will take

     B5 was full of "nods" to various SF sources: the Great Machine from 
FORBIDDEN PLANET, the main Psi Corps character being named "Alfred Bester", 
et cetera and so on. I just read Asimov's FOUNDATION'S EDGE, and the climax 
of that book was REALLY similar to the climax of the Shadow War.

The following story may or may not be authentic (I don't know where it comes
from) but it's very amusing and interesting.

=================================================================

Some time ago I received a call from a colleague, who asked if I would be
the referee on the grading of an examination question. He was about to
give a student a zero for his answer to a physics question, while the
student claimed he should receive a perfect score and would if the system
were not set up against the student. The instructor and the student
agreed to an impartial arbiter, and I was selected.
I went to my colleague's office and read the examination question: "Show
how it is possible to determine the height of a tall building with the
aid of a barometer." The student had answered: "Take the barometer to the
top of the building, attach a long rope to it, lower it to the street,
and then bring it up, measuring the length of the rope. The length of the
rope is the height of the building."
I pointed out that the student really had a strong case for full credit
since he had really answered the question completely and correctly. On
the other hand, if full credit were given, it could well contribute to a
high grade in his physics course. A high grade is supposed to certify
competence in physics, but the answer did not confirm this. I suggested
that the student have another try at answering the question. I was not
surprised that my colleague agreed, but I was surprised when the student
did.
I gave the student six minutes to answer the question with the warning
that the answer should show some knowledge of physics. At the end of five
minutes, he had not written anything. I asked if he wished to give up,
but he said no. He had many answers to this problem; he was just thinking
of the best one. I excused myself for interrupting him and asked him to
please go on. In the next minute, he dashed off his answer which read:
"Take the barometer to the top of the building and lean over the edge of
the roof. Drop the barometer, timing its fall with a stopwatch. Then,
using the formula x =3D0.5 * a * t2, calculate the height of the building."
At this point, I asked my colleague if he would give up. He conceded, and
gave the student almost full credit.
In leaving my colleague's office, I recalled that the student had said
that he had other answers to the problem, so I asked him what they were.
"Well," said the student. "there are many ways of getting the height of a
tall building with the aid of a barometer. For example , you could take
the barometer out on a sunny day and measure the height of the barometer,
the length of its shadow, and the length of the shadow of the building,
and by the use of simple proportion, determine the height of the building."
"Fine," I said, "and others?"
"Yes," said the student. "There is a very basic measurement method you
will like. In this method, you take the barometer and begin to walk up
the stairs. As you climb the stairs, you mark off the length of the
barometer along the wall. You then count the number of marks, and this
will give you the height of the building in barometer units."
"A very direct method."
"Of course, if you want a more sophisticated method, you can tie the
barometer to the end of a string, swing it as a pendulum, and determine
the value of g at the street level and at the top of the building. From
the difference between the two values of g, the height of the building,
in principle, can be calculated. On this same tack, you could take the
barometer to the top of the building, attach a long rope to it, lower it
to just above the street, and then swing it as a pendulum. You could then
calculate the height of the building by the period of the precession".
"Finally," he concluded, "there are many other ways of solving the
problem. Probably the best is to take the barometer to the basement and
knock on the superintendent's door. When the superintendent answers, you
speak to him as follows: 'Mr. Superintendent, here is a fine barometer.
If you will tell me the height of the building, I will give you this
barometer.'"
At this point, I asked the student if he really did not know the
conventional answer to this question. He admitted that he did, but said
that he was fed up with high school and college instructors trying to
teach him how to think.
The student was Neils Bohr and the arbiter Rutherford...

Something like this? 

http://www.petidomo.com/
Petidomo supports fully encrypted mailing lists, using the well-known
encryption programm Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). 
From: http://www.petidomo.com/manual/node9.html

8.2 PGP-encrypted mailing lists at

"Another very useful feature of the posting filter and the access
control languange is the ability to maintain encrypted mailing lists.
The idea is very simple: You create a PGP key pair for your mailing list
and spread the public key among the subscribers of your mailing list. In
turn you collect their public keys and store them on the mailing list
server. 

Whenever a subscriber wants to post an article to the mailing list, he
will encrypt it with the public key of the list server before
transferring it through the Internet. Petidomo will then receive the
mail, decrypt and process it and encrypt it again, with the public keys
of the subscribers. Once encrypted again, the mail is distributed to the
readers. 

Please note that at no time the mail was sent through the Internet in
clear text. Hence this mode is well-suited for maintaining internal
discussion lists for, say, software development among a few people who
know each other but live spread throughout the world. Included in the
distribution are two scripts, pgp-encrypt.sh and pgp-decrypt.sh, which
realize this. The setup needs a bit of work, but once you understand the
principle, it is rather easy. Just follow the steps described below". 

Etc.

Another related link
http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/pgplists.htm

"The first thing for you to do is to generate 
another pair of keys - these will be the master keys.  Next, send 
copies of both of keys to everyone on the list, using your newfound 
encryption technology.  Sending keys in the mail may sound like a 
dangerous idea, but because your friends all have their own sets of 
keys, you can use their personal public keys to encrypt the master keys
for the list and send the master keys securely to each of the members. 

Now everyone has an identical pair of master keys, and they've never 
even met face to face.  These keys are in addition to their own 
personal keys, which they can use for personal encrypted mail.  
Emails sent to the mailing list are encrypted by the public master 
key and broadcast to the list members, who use the private master 
key to decode them.  This is a perfect information security system, 
as long as no one's computer gets bagged."

I'm not a fan of ER, didn't see the show, and don't get into poetry

The more serious problem with such exercises is that they in effect try to
reinvent fifty years of economic research into the nature of
economic growth.  Sure you can write down lots of equations, some of
which have singularities, and some of which don't.  But the best clues
to which equations model it best are the equations that have worked the
best so far in explaining the economic growth we see now, and have seen
for thousands of years.  They are the equations that you want to play
with in thinking about how computers might change things.

The usual modeling approach is to assume diminishing returns in each
particular factor, but to allow for possibly increasing returns in
the net return to increasing all factors at once.  For example, consider

     dY/dt  =  Product_i  (F_i)^(a_i)

where Y is total output, F_i is the amount of each factor i, and a_i < 1
is the importance of each factor.  Holding all F_j besides F_i fixed,
there are strongly diminishing returns to increasing that one factor.
But if Sum_i a_i > 1, there are increasing returns to increasing
all factors together.

So when the economy changes in some fundamental way, and you want to
know if this will change it from exponential growth to something faster,
a key question (given the above model) is whether the newly changing
factor  is enough to tip the balance from decreasing to increasing
returns overall.

The factors that people have considered include physical capital,
technology, population, health/lifespan, human capital, etc.
For any one of these we expect diminishing returns.  But when we put
them all together, it may be a different story.

               Mars Polar Lander Mission Status
                      November 19, 1999

     NASA's Mars Polar Lander team has spent this week testing 
and training for the entry, descent and landing operations of the 
mission that will take place two weeks from today.

     This week's test has involved a detailed simulation of the 
landing using the spacecraft simulator at Lockheed Martin 
Astronautics in Denver, Colo.  Teams at JPL, Lockheed Martin 
Astronautics and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) 
have also been practicing for the early surface mission.

     The next thruster firing to adjust the spacecraft's flight 
path is scheduled for Nov. 30.  Flight navigators have been using 
additional tracking data to help them calculate the spacecraft's 
path at it approaches Mars.  The spacecraft remains in good 
health, and the team is not working any spacecraft problems.

     Today the lander is 5.8 million kilometers (3.6 million 
miles) from Mars traveling at a speed of 4.86 kilometers per 
second (about 10,870 miles per hour) relative to the planet.

     Mars Polar Lander is part of a series of missions in a long-
term program of Mars exploration managed by the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C.  
JPL's industrial partner is Lockheed Martin Astronautics, Denver, 
Colo.  JPL is a division of the California Institute of 
Technology, Pasadena, Calif.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                         November 19, 1999

JUPITER'S MOON IO: A FLASHBACK TO EARTH'S VOLCANIC PAST

     Jupiter's fiery moon Io is providing scientists with a 
window on volcanic activity and colossal lava flows similar to 
those that raged on Earth eons ago, thanks to new pictures and 
data gathered by NASA's Galileo spacecraft. 

     The sharp images of Io were taken on Oct. 11 during the 
closest-ever spacecraft flyby of the moon, when Galileo dipped to 
just 611 kilometers  (380 miles) above Io's surface. The new 
data reveal that Io, the most volcanic body in the solar system, 
is even more active than previously suspected, with more than 100 
erupting volcanoes.  

     "The latest flyby has shown us gigantic lava flows and lava 
lakes, and towering, collapsing mountains," said Dr. Alfred 
McEwen of the University of Arizona, Tucson, a member of the 
Galileo imaging team. "Io makes Dante's Inferno seem like 
another day in paradise."

     Ancient rocks on Earth and other rocky planets show evidence 
of immense volcanic eruptions. The last comparable lava eruption 
on Earth occurred 15 million years ago, and it's been more than 2 
billion years since lava as hot as that found on Io, reaching 
1,482 degrees Celsius or 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit, flowed on Earth.  

     "No people were around to observe and document these past 
events," said Dr. Torrence Johnson, Galileo project scientist at 
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, CA. "Io is the 
next best thing to traveling back in time to Earth's earlier 
years. It gives us an opportunity to watch, in action, phenomena 
long dead in the rest of the solar system."

     The new data focus on three of Io's most active volcanoes -- 
Pele, Loki and Prometheus. The vent region of Pele has an 
intense high-temperature hot spot that is remarkably steady, 
unlike lava flows that erupt in pulses, spread out over large 
areas, and then cool over time.  This leads scientists to 
hypothesize that there must be an extremely active lava lake at 
Pele that constantly exposes fresh lava.  Galileo's camera 
snapped a close-up picture showing part of the volcano glowing in 
the dark.  Hot lava, at most a few minutes old, forms a thin, 
curving line more than 10 kilometers (6 miles) long and up to 50 
meters (150 feet) wide.  Scientists believe this line is glowing 
liquid lava exposed as the solidifying crust breaks up along the 
caldera's walls.  This is similar to the behavior of active lava 
lakes in Hawaii, although Pele's lava lake is a hundred times 
larger.  

     Loki, the most powerful volcano in the solar system, 
consistently puts out more heat than all of Earth's active 
volcanoes combined.  Two of Galileo's instruments -- the 
photopolarimeter radiometer and near-infrared mapping 
spectrometer -- have provided detailed temperature maps of Loki.  
"Unlike the active lava lake at Pele, Loki has an enormous 
caldera that is repeatedly flooded by lava, over an area larger 
than the state of Maryland," said Dr. Rosaly Lopes-Gautier of 
JPL, a member of the spectrometer team.

     Observations of Prometheus made early in the Galileo 
mission showed a new lava flow and a plume erupting from a 
location about 100 kilometers (60 miles) west of the area where 
the plume was observed in 1979 by NASA's Voyager spacecraft. New 
Galileo data clarify where lava is erupting, advancing, and 
producing plumes.  The most unexpected result is that the 75 
kilometer- (50 mile-) tall plume erupts from under a lava flow, 
far from the main volcano. The plume is fed by vaporized sulfur 
dioxide-rich snow under the lava flow.

     Mountains on Io are much taller than Earth's largest 
mountains, towering up to 16 kilometers (52,000 feet) high.  
Paradoxically, they do not appear to be volcanoes. Scientists 
are not sure how the mountains form, but new Galileo images 
provide a fascinating picture of how they die.  Concentric ridges 
covering the mountains and surrounding plateaus offer evidence 
that the mountains generate huge landslides as they collapse 
under the force of gravity.  The ridges bear a striking resemblance
to the rugged terrain surrounding giant Olympus Mons on Mars.  

     Scientists hope to learn more about dynamic Io when Galileo 
swoops down for an even closer look on Nov. 25 from an altitude 
of only 300 kilometers (186 miles). Because Io's orbit is bathed 
in intense radiation from Jupiter's radiation belts, there is a 
risk of radiation damage to spacecraft components. In fact, 
several spacecraft systems sustained damage during the October 
flyby.  Given these radiation risks, the Io flybys were scheduled 
near the end of the spacecraft's two-year extended mission.  

     New Io images taken by the spacecraft are available at: 
http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/pictures/io or http://galileo.jpl.nasa.gov .

     Galileo entered orbit around Jupiter and its moons on 
Dec. 7, 1995, for a two-year prime mission. JPL manages the 
Galileo mission for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, DC. 
JPL is operated for NASA by the California Institute of 
Technology, Pasadena, CA.

At first it seemed to me that Dr. Pelicci had made sense when he opined that
"there must be" a down side to mice with deactivated p66 genes, "because
otherwise evolution would already have found this fix."

Curt Adams, Patrick Wilkens, and Joao Pedro de Magalhaes have generously
informed me concerning the limitations of Evolution in regard to fixing or
optimizing individual organisms. Thanks to all.

As for the supposed ability of shorter life spans to accelerate the rate of
Evolution by increasing the frequency of mutations over generations, this does
not work because the attenuation of longevity which accompanies heightened
mutability, in turn depresses the strength of the species (which, of course,
includes individual group members), thereby rendering an over all disadvantage
to short lived populations. This effect expands in species which depend on
lengthened childhood (as Homo sapiens and elephants do) to reach their full
(species specific) potential. I suppose that anyone well versed in complexity
theory would have grokked this intuitively and quickly, but to this old head, it
seemed quite counter-intuitive.

Although making mice live longer has important implications for humans (no
doubt),  the Doogie Mice experiments (discussed in earlier threads on this list)
probably have even more importance. Some of us need to get much smarter before
we get much older.

In reading about the 10 terabits/s all optical router that Lucent will sell in
December of 2000 I came across an interesting fact, the cost of
transporting a bit over an optical network is declining by half every
nine months. Makes the progress in semiconductors look rather dull.

The article from Fast Company explores the merits of altruism - 
Look to computer operating systems for
perhaps the best example:  At present the only real competitor to Windows
is Linux - a free system which has Microsoft very worried (according at
least to industry observers).  Apparently the developers who contribute to
Linux do so for free, and only "cash in" on their work by gaining the
reputation of having been a Linux developer.  

For any interested in the Fast Company article, Only the Pronoid Survive,
here's a clip:

"Cronin's version of Darwinism shows that altruism and generosity create
more rewards than their opposites do. She introduced the CEOs to the flip
side of paranoia: "pronoia" -- the idea that everyone is not out to get
you, but that they are out to love you, or at least to appreciate you, if
you reciprocate. According to the new Darwinism, only the pronoid survive
-- in fact, only the pronoid endure and flourish."

Hey, now I realize that "Star Trek" has been accused of growing stale but it 
has alot going for it!  "Star Trek" has shown not just this nation but the 
globe a vision of the world where humanity lives in harmony with itself and 
many other species with the goal of peaceful exploration.  This show has 
broken racial stereotypes in terms of tv and inspired many young people to 
pursue careers in science.

And frankly while I am not the biggest fan of "Voyager" I did love "Deep 
Space Nine" and really enjoyed the final season even if some called it world 
war two in space.  I got to really care about the characters and did not 
find them to be cardboard like with some science-fiction programs.

I do love "Babylon Five" and in some ways found it superior.  The aliens 
were certainly generally more alien!  Though the Narn and the Centauri were 
as "human" as Klingons and Romulans.  Also, sadly it is possible that B5 is 
a more realistic take on what the future may be life for humanity.  We may 
not have a benevolent "Federation" to govern and protect us.  Humans may 
very well not be dominant "big shot" race as as they appear to be in "Star 
Trek."

I think I experienced at times more of a sense of wonder from B5 in the ways 
I have also felt it when reading science-fiction.  But I love both series 
and ST certainly has had some great episodes too.

To end my post I will make this statement...
"One thing in favor of "Star Trek, at least it wasn't "Battlestar 
Galactica!" :)


sincerely,

John Grigg

It looks like Den Otter has found the appropriate tools.

One will still limit such a list to a small number of trusted subscribers, because the privacy of PGP-encrypted lists is only as strong as that of the WEAKEST subscriber.

i.e., if one subscriber has a security breach, the entire list traffic is revealed to the intruder.

Tofu linked to dementia, study says
2 servings a week may be harmful

By Beverly Creamer
Advertiser Staff writer
Honolulu Advertiser newspaper

Eating tofu more than twice a week in midlife may diminish brain function in
old age, and lead to Alzheimer's disease, according to ground-breaking new
research by Hawaii scientists.

It's the first time scientists have labeled a dietary risk factor for the
disease that affects 2 percent of the nation's 65 year olds and up to 16
percent of 80 year olds.  The various forms of dementia cost the country as
much as $180 billion a year in health care.

"It's big news," said Dr. Patricia Blanchette, president of the board of the
Aloha Chapter of the Alzheimer's Association and director of the Geriatric
Medicine program at the University of Hawaii.

Hawaii researchers, led by Dr. Lon White, a scientist with the Pacific
Health Research Institute at Kuakini Medical Center, are waiting for word on
publication of their research in a scientific journal, offering further
validation of their findings.

White's work has been viewed as some of the most important in the country,
because it's based on a detailed, long-term database -- that of the 3,734
Japanese-American men in the Honolulu Heart Program study and the immense
interest in finding causes for Alzheimer's.

The first word of White's findings came during a recent Washington, D.C.
conference sponsored by the nation's soy industry at which White had been
invited to speak.

White has been working on the tofu connection for several years as part of
the Honolulu-Asia Aging study and the Honolulu Heart program, with financing
by the National Institute on Aging.  His work, comparing cognitive tests on
the subjects with their dietary histories, has shown that more than two
servings a week during the years of middle age (from 45 on) may affect
cognitive function in older age.

Although Hawaii researchers don't really know what part of the tofu may be
affecting cognitive function, they think that the plant estrogens it
contains somehow block the brain's ability to use natural estrogens produced
by the bodies of both men and women.  Estrogen is necessary for healthy
brain function.

"We don't know exactly.  But there are different biochemical pathways in the
brain and (it) could possibly interfere with natural human estrogen binding
in the brain," says Dr. Helen Petrovich, a co-investigator in the study.
"It's possible it could be slowing down the production of our estrogen, or
blocking it.  Certain chemicals can block that."

White's work has sweeping implications for women who turn to plant estrogens
as hormone replacement therapy after menopause, and for those hoping high
levels of estrogens can improve their cognitive functioning.

"So many people have been touting tofu and its plant estrogen content as
possibly helpful with regard to maintaining cognition into old age,"
Blanchette said.  "It's an example of how research is very important.
Intuitively, you might think something is helpful, and then it turns out not
to be."

But she said the public should view this the same way they should view the
latest research on beta-carotene.  "Just because excess amounts of
beta-carotene are bad for you, I don't think I would tell people to stop
eating carrots,"  Blanchette said.  "Moderate amounts are good for you."

Same with tofu, she said.

"Everything in moderation, because there are such good things that tofu does
for you."

The journals Nature and Science have turned down White's findings for
publications -- mostly because the study is not of wide appeal for their
readers, said fellow researcher Petrovich.  But it's now being considered
for publication by The Journal of the American Nutrition Society.

White's data goes back to 1965 when the Honolulu Heart Program study began
with 8,006 returning AJA veterans.  The data collected over the years -- and
continuing to be collected today -- is unusually detailed, and should
produce more and more answers about causes of Alzheimer's.

"What we have here in Honolulu is a gold mine," White told the Advertiser
more than a year ago, as he pushed forward in his research, hoping for
definitive results.

"It's one of the few large studies where people are moving into the age
where they're getting dementia, and lots of background information was
recorded."

In comparing the dietary habits of 3,634 Japanese-American men whose tofu
consumption ranged from zero to many servings a week, White found that those
who ate the most scored lower than those who ate little on a standard
cognitive function test for determining dementia.

"When you look at tofu consumption, there's a relationship between the
amount you eat and cognitive functioning in old age," Petrovich said.

In addition, examination of the brains at autopsy of the 300 who have died
reveals that the brains of the men who ate more than two servings a week
weighed less than those who consumed fewer than two servings of tofu a week.

In developing the research White factored out all other dietary items that
could effect cognitive changes.

"He put into the model everything he could think of that could be another
cause," Petrovich said.  "Green tea, black tea, rice, miso, meat, fish,
milk, coffee."  He also tried to compare data with Hawaii's sister study in
Japan, but there wasn't the wide spectrum of tofu consumption available in
Hawaii, Petrovich said.  "Our study is one of the few that could show this
kind of effect because most societies either eat a lot of tofu or none at
all."

None of the other items showed any consistency in effect on cognitive
function, she said.  Only tofu.

Hey, thanks!

Those of you who have kept up with the continuing debate between den
Otter and I may now proceed to worry about the fact that den Otter had
this information on hand.

I would like to assure everyone that I haven't yet decided whether to
start a PGP-encrypted list; I'm still investigating the feasibility.  So
if you don't hear anything more about the matter, you shouldn't take
that silence as being ominous.

And Sandberg, Jones, Spike - I'm an *ethical* fanatic.  Every time I
visualize myself "meddling" and have an opportunity to check what the
results would have been, I find that it would have gone wrong in one way
or another.  And that's the ultimate foundation of human ethics -
knowing that you don't know enough to stop respecting the minds of others.

Besides which, as I've said before, I have no interest in taking over
the world.  I want *out* of the human condition, and any human taking
over the world, even myself, is not progress toward that end.  How on
Earth could you bribe a Singularitarian?  What the heck would you bribe
one with?

What about archetype?

If the Gene is a physical replicator, and the Meme is a mental replicator, can
the Archetype be a spiritual replicator?

archetype:
(from Greek archetypos, "original pattern"), in literary criticism, a
primordial image, character, or pattern of circumstances that recurs
throughout literature and thought consistently enough to be considered
a universal concept or situation. The term was adopted by literary
critics from the writings of the psychologist Carl Jung, who
formulated a theory of a "collective unconscious." For Jung, the
varieties of human experience have somehow been genetically coded
and transferred to successive generations. These primordial image
patterns and situations evoke startlingly similar feelings in both reader
and author.

Actually, for endothelial cells, for blood vessels, its probably just
about a done deal.  The angiogenesis factors were isolated over the
last 2 years and the growth factors (e.g. fibroblast growth factors
of various types) have been known for many years.  Lots of work
has been done trying to suppress endothelial cell growth after
angioplasty.  If the Geron work is correct, endothelial cells
are quasi-replicative (like liver cells) so getting a supply
of them and inducing them to grow isn't difficult.  You can
probably "3-D-implant" into the plastic the angiogenesis
factors and/or endothelial cell growth factors and have
no problems getting blood vessel growth where you want it.

Cells "naturally" have the ability to induce blood vessel
growth in hypooxygenation conditions, so even if you didn't
program the blood vessels, you could still get them if you
start out with stem cells in the right "stage".

I believe there is also work currently being done for smooth muscle
cells for artery growth (smooth muscle cells surround the endothelial
cells in larger vessels) and this is very close to going into
clinical trials (in bypass operations).

Nerves will be tougher in terms of "wiring" nerves into existing
connections, but given the spinal cord work I suspect this will
make rapid progress as well.   There are probably multiple growth
factors and/or chemoattractants that remain to be isolated for
nerves however (but obviously big pharma wants them badly).

So, I'd be optimistic on the low end of Greg's time estimates.
Given the likely supply competition between the pig-engineered
and lab-engineered approaches these areas should advance rapidly.

True, for the most efficient structure, you would proabably want
something like a buckyball.  But you have to keep in mind that these
are large gravitational masses so everything has to be "orbiting"
or it collapses.  I'm unsure whether there are any theories or
examples of optimal 3-D structures where all of the verticies are
in motion.

Distinctly possible, but saying it doesn't explain *why* that is the case.

I'll post a note in the next day or two on a review of the dark matter
problem that discusses some of the real observations and stretching being
done by the theoretical physicists.

This comment seems to make clear what part of the problem is.  I'm not
sure if in any of the discussions, I have clearly stated my assumptions.

It may be unclear to others the problem I'm trying to solve.  Since
Extro3, I've been wrestling with the sole question of:
  "What are the limits to longevity?"
or, put another way (more related to the biology of aging):
  "How small can you make your hazard function?"
or, perhaps in more economic terms:
  "When does the cost of reducing your hazard function exceed the
   benefit in increased longevity derived from such a reduction?"

Now, if we look at the biology of aging, there seem to be three things
that allow longevity:
  a) Highly effective hazard avoidance characteristics
     (e.g. hard exoskeletons or flight)
  b) size (making the small hazards irrelevant)
  c) intelligence (allowing hazard predictis & avoidance)

So, in my mind, the limits to longevity are highly interrelated
to the questions of:
  "What are the limits to intelligence?"
  "What are the limits to "physical" size?"
  "What are the tradeoffs between tolerating hazards and fleeing them?"

Obviously you get into complex interactions, because greater intelligence
allows you to make better tradeoffs between "tolerable" hazards and
the costs of flight.  Size is important because hazard avoidance gets
very expensive when you may be dealing with solar-system mass objects.

Now, looking at these things, it would seem that one would want to
grow to a size that maximizes intelligence, providing you with
the greatest ability to predict hazards and minimize the costs
of avoiding them.  At some point additional increments in intelligence
(if it is on a diminishing returns curve, as previously discussed)
will fail to produce corresponding reductions in the hazard avoidance
costs.  At that point it seems, you stop "growing".

In my framework, any exploring by intelligent sub-entitites or
division of "self", is likely to *increase* your hazard function
and is an undesirable course.  The intelligent sub-entitites have
an increased hazard function because they are (a) physically smaller
and (b) less-intelligent.  The only situation in which intelligent
sub-entities would be the correct solution is when you are faced
with an unavoidable catastrophe (in which case their reduced
mass allows them to escape more quickly).  Division of "self"
is likely to *increase* your hazard function (due to resource
competition at some future time), unless you prevent self-evolution into
something that can remove the "honor your parent/brother/sister forever"
programming clause.

In my framework, many historical discussions regarding reasons for migration
or colonization (e.g. religious freedom, the search for mates, curiosity
[why go there, when you can observe it?], etc.) are probably irrelevant.
The prime motivator of behavior revolves around the minimization
of the hazard function for the maximally intelligent "being".

Essentially yes.  At some point additional mass (or additional energy)
*may* fail to yield corresponding benefits in intelligence or longevity
(they may even reduce them if they make you very massy/slow).
 
Now at this point, *if* you have effectively solved your personal survival
(longevity) problem (i.e. you can predict and avoid hazards for billions to
trillions of years [until energy resources get *very* scarce]), the question
that I have *not* solved is:
  What do you optimize?
or
  What do SIs value?
    Intelligence? Memory? Information? History? Creativity? Beauty? Art?

I'm not sure that we as humans could answer these questions.
Without those answers, determining the logical structure of
single SIs or SI cultures may be difficult.  At that point
I simply go back to the astronomical observations and see
what we can observe that might offer suggestions.

Yep, though metals from a SI sense are slightly different from the
astrophysical sense in that there are *optimal* element "mixes" for
the maximization of some of the "valuables" listed above.
Collecting or manufacturing that mix may take some time.

We do from time to time observe stars with very strange metal
abundances.  Some of these have "proposed" astronomical theories.
However, you could just as easily argue that stars or solar systems
may be mined for the valuable materials and the rest is mine tailings.

Clearly you can beam energy around (as lasers or microwaves is probably
best).  Your collector dishes would have to be fairly large but you
probably have arrays of this type anyway because you want to have
huge (moon diameter) telescope "reflector" arrays for hazard detection.
How effective this is would depend on the mass required for the
reflectors & collectors and the distance that the energy is being beamed.

In my models, solar systems contain enough mass to fully utilize a
star's energy output at thermodyanmic efficiencies around 95+%.
To get to 99.9% or higher (where the outer computronium/memory
storage shells are radiating waste heat at < 10-20K) may require
large remote mass contributions or element breeding.   However,
additional increments at these outer levels pay a big price in
communications overhead (which is why I brought in the models
for evaluating parallel compulational architectures), so an
additional 1% in mass, might allow the use of 0.01% more energy
but may only add 0.000001% in "intelligence".  The additional
mass (by imposing higher time/energy costs on hazard avoidance)
or additional energy (by increasing your heat signature to potential
unfriendly observers(?)) may increase your hazard function to a degree
that cannot be offset by the diminishing increases in intelligence.

I'll simply add, that a complete analysis of the declining benefits
(i.e. some more solid #'s than those above) has not been completed.

I would say that Dr. Pelicci still makes sense. All else being equal a long lived
mouse would have more opportunity to mate and pass on more genes to another
generation than his short lived cousin, but in the real would all else is not equal.
It takes energy to keep in good running order for a long time and you'll probably be
eaten by a cat before you get very old anyway, so the advantage is not great.
Mouse genes have found that the best strategy for increasing their number is to
put all their effort into a mouse's early days, so they created a vehicle that grows fast,
reproduces a lot, and dies young. If this was not true the p66 gene would never
have evolved in the first place.

To live longer a mouse does not need to evolve new genes, it just needs to drop
a gene it already has, however evolution has chosen not to do this. Evolution not
only evolved this life shorting gene it retained it for millions of years, that means
mutations that rendered p66 inoperable (and this must have happened often as it
does in all genes) did not do well in competition with non mutated working versions
of p66. Hence the speculation about the downside of the genetically engineered
Methuselah mice, speculation that p66 must somehow increase the fertility rates
of young mice.

It seems that you assume that:

    Virtually all advanced creatures in the universe care essentially
    only about their *individual* longevity.

And though you have not said so explicitly, you seem to have "fast
high-communication computation" concept of the individual.  That is,
you seem to preclude a creature who's concept of itself includes
things, like computers around distant stars, that can't contribute
to computations which must be done within a short time and require
high levels of communication between parts.  After all, a creature
focused on the longevity of its clan or species might act very
differently.

You seem to want to allow these creatures to place a small value on
things like art, but if you allow that, I can't see why you don't also
allow them to place a small value on colonization, and then we have
to explain the lack of colonization again.  Similarly, you have to
assume that virtually all creatures have this singular focus on
"individual" longevity, to explain the lack of colonization.

I accept that the ultimate test of your assumption is empirical,
and so we should consider whatever empirical evidence you offer.
But if you think there are theoretical reasons for us to think
your assumption plausible, you need to clarify them.  All
creatures valuing only longevity is not implied by these
creatures being conscious, nor is it implied by an evolutionary
selection of creatures.

The only plausible scenario I can imagine for producing this
situation is if a single power arises early in the universe and
quickly fills the universe without actually colonizing it much,
and actively destroys any creatures with other values.

Happy Birthday to Mrs. Romero - (YUMA) -- A woman born
in Yuma is being recognized as one of the oldest
people in the country. Carmelita De Mara was born on
July 16th, 1882. That makes her 117 years old. Just to
put her age in perspective, she was already 30-years
old when the Titanic sank. She was honored in Merced
County, California by the Area Agency on Aging. 

Another (semi)interesting tidbit.  The mother-in-law
of my mother-in-law is 95 years old and just recently
had her driver's license renewed (she drives herself
everywhere).  She shows very little signs of senility
and until a couple of years ago she ran her own
company.

I always had the impression that Newton resolved Zeno's paradox through the
invention of calculus by inventing the mathematical tools to perform operations on
infinite series and, more importantly, to work out how to sum an infinite series
through the use of integration.

Now, since Bertrand Russell, George Boole, Godel, Cantor, et al. went to all that
effort of translating symboligic logic into number theory, couldn't we simply
integrate over an infinite series of modus ponens to actually arrive at a useful
proposition?

If I've messed up the details on this, please let me know. GEB (which,
incidentally, contains the aforementioned essay) is pretty much the only source I'm
going on here.

Unfortunately, Bertie Russell subscribed as much to the musings of philosophy as
to the principles of science. --J. R.

"Science is nothing but developed perception, integrated intent, common sense
rounded out and minutely articulated."
--George Santayana

"Science is facts; just as houses are made of stones, so is science made of
facts; but a pile of stones is not a house and a collection of facts is not
necessarily sicence."
--Henri Poincar

"As long as men are free to ask what they must -- free to say what they think --
free to think what they will -- freedom can never be lost and science can never
regress."
--J. Robert Oppenheimer

"If I have been able to see farther than others, it was because I stood on the
shoulders of giants."
--Sir Isaac Newton (born on December 25, 1642)

"The age of innocent faith in sicence and technology may be over... every major
advance in the technological competence of man has enforced revolutionary
changes in the economic and political structure of society."
--Barry Commoner

"We have to live today by what truth we can get today and be ready tomorrow to
call it falsehood."
--William James

"In formal logic, a contradiction is the signal of defeat: but in the evolution
of real knowledge it marks the first step in progress toward a victory."
--Alfred North Whitehead

Here's a scenario:

The "Ben Franklins" he invested at 5% yearly interest grew faster than inflation and left him with a good nest egg...  

That paled in comparison to the Bill Gates size fortune that had accrued from a small amount of risk capital he left in wireless communication, biotech, and Hans Moravecs robotic companies.(brokers will fulfill the investment wishes of the cryonicized......will their portfolios be known as frozen assets?)

[$10,000 invested in Qualcomm in Jan-99 was worth $148,000 last week! (for example)]

Of course, you are correct that adjusting would not be easy, but its likely an optimistic wealthy resurrectee would soon inhabit a life that Donald Trump can only dream about.  

And even if he is a pauper, forced to reinvent a new life, that is much preferable to the alternative of not existing at all.  (If nothing else, he could get a book deal)..."Refelections From the Dewar" or "An Old Codger Speaks" or "A Funny Thing Happened on The Way to The Thawing".

This looks like an instance of the Progression Meme, the persistent and
recurring idea that hierarchical order implies the extension of metaphors to
include ever widening orders of organization. Thus, many people have attempted
to extend the idea of electrons circling atomic nuclei, and planets orbiting
suns, to galaxies as molecules in some meta-universe.

I don't see it that way. Genes and memes form two aspects of one function,
namely reproduction.

Different is 'gale', an instant messaging system with strong encryption built
in.  Client programs do the encryption, the server just bounces messages
around.  UI is still developing; the strong point is automatic key
distribution.  May not really be what you want, but I'm throwing it out there.

I've seen this before.  It occurred to me just now that there are pedantic
grounds for denying credit for most of those answers: the problem did not
specify the presence of rope, string, stop watch, or accurate length
measurement.

While history & politics could be subject to "rigorous science" using
computer technology and/or simulations, I question whether law, or art
could be.

It is said that the historians, "write" history and that seems true.
However, in the face of future "perfect" records of history, that becomes
false.  In the face of specific and exact records of history and the
ability to process all the information, the interpretations of the
historians become much less significant.  Presumably, there is some
review process by which those individuals who "accurately" condense
the information become recognized as authorities.  The chaos effects
(mentioned by Damien) limits the accuracy of these in interpretations
but that is where simulations might provide missing data.  With
abstract models of the human mind, historians could create "simulated"
Hitlers or Sadaams with various mental prioritizations.  Those that result
in the reality we have documented would be presumed to be the most
explanatory.  This extends further into politics (as we now see
where candidates don't stand for anything other than what the people
want to hear as determined by the pollsters.

Now, law and art may be much less tractable.

Law seems to have highly specific historical, cultural, technological
(e.g. evidence) and scientific (e.g. "expert" witnesses) aspects.
The variety of chaotic variables may put it beyond "rigorous science"
(though it may be entirely rational) and perhaps force it into the realm
of limited simulations.  

Art, seems to have passed through the phase of "rigorous science",
where the artist was simply learning and expressing the reality
of perception (e.g. the "physics" of art)).  Art seems to have
gone through some interesting "observer" stages (realism, e.g.
Thoreau or William Dean Howells in literature, or impressionist
artists in painting).

Greg/Natasha, if you read this -- have/should Law & Art be subject to
some absolutes (akin say to the Hippocratic Oath in medicine) or have
they become (and/or will they continue to be) subject to the
whims or desires of the client/purchaser?  (i.e. a system in
which the value is market driven rather than "rationale acceptance"
driven?)

Actually, virtually all Navy vessels of any significant size use this
approach, whether they are nuclear powered or not.  It is probably a bit
more expensive than just storing water for short trips, but the power
requirements aren't all that large compared with what you're burning to move
the ship.

I cannot recommend strongly enough the article you'll find at:

    http://www.reasonmag.com/9912/fe.rb.petri.html

Although written by someone with very extropian values in a magazine that 
also has a very extropian editorial policy, the article portrays the 
significant and GROWING opposition on both the "left" and the "right" to 
almost all forms of advanced biotech in the U.S.  That opposition is already 
well-rooted in Europe.  If the biotech companies don't get up off their asses 
and start fighting back in the media BIG TIME, we're going to have real 
trouble.

Here are some selections from the article:

REASON * December 1999

Petri Dish Politics
Biotechnology will make it possible for us to live longer and better. So why
are some people dead set against it?

By Ronald Bailey

"Death to death," declares Gregory Stock, director of UCLA's Program on
Medicine, Technology, and Society, at a conference on life extension. "Aging
itself can be considered to be a disease," says Cynthia Kenyon, the
biochemist who last year discovered genes that quadrupled the life of the
nematode C. elegans.

. . . .

Repairing broken bodies, extending life, and improving individuals'
capabilities may sound like good things. But the promises of biomedicine
increasingly attract opposition. A chorus of influential conservative
intellectuals is demanding that the new technologies be crushed immediately,
and many in Congress are listening. These "luddicons," as one observer has
dubbed them, see in biomedicine the latest incarnation of human evil. "In
the 20th century, we failed to stifle at birth the totalitarian concepts
which created Nazism and Communism though we knew all along that both were
morally evil--because decent men and women did not speak out in time,"
writes the British historian Paul Johnson in an article in the March 6,
1999, issue of The Spectator. "Are we going to make the same mistake with
this new infant monster [biotechnology] in our midst, still puny as yet but
liable, all too soon, to grow gigantic and overwhelm us?"

The most influential conservative bioethicist, Leon Kass of the University
of Chicago and the American Enterprise Institute, worries both that our
quest for ever-better mental and physical states is too open-ended and,
contradictorily, that it is utopian. "`Enhancement' is, of course, a soft
euphemism for improvement," he says, "and the idea of improvement
necessarily implies a good, a better, and perhaps even best. But if
previously unalterable human nature no longer can function as a standard or
norm for what is regarded as good or better, how will anyone truly know what
constitutes an improvement?"

Kass argues that even "modest enhancers" who say that they "merely want to
improve our capacity to resist and prevent diseases, diminish our
propensities for pain and suffering, decrease the likelihood of death" are
deceiving themselves and us. Behind these modest goals, he says, actually
lies a utopian project to achieve "nothing less than a painless,
suffering-free, and, finally, immortal existence."

What particularly disturbs these conservatives is biomedicine's potential to
overthrow their notion of human nature--a nature defined by suffering and
death. "Contra naturam, the defiance of nature, used to be a sufficient
argument for those who were not persuaded by contra deum, provoking the
wrath of God," writes historian Gertrude Himmelfarb in The Wall Street
Journal. "But what does it mean today, when we have defied, even violated,
nature in so many ways, for good as well as bad?" She goes on to suggest
that cloning, artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization, and even the
pill might be "against nature." Himmelfarb continues, "But the ultimate
question is how far we may go in defying nature without undermining our
humanity....What does it mean for human beings, who are defined by their
mortality, to entertain, even fleetingly, even as a remote possibility, the
idea of immortality?"

Perhaps Universe is so young that we are the first kids on the
block.

I have been looking around for data on what a chemist would call
the reaction rate of the production of metals in this and other
galaxies. Lighter metals such as carbon and oxygen are produced in
medium-size stars and distributed by planetary nebula ejection and
by white-dwarf novas. The heaviest elements are made and distributed
only in supernovas. There are several different kinds of events,
and each has a different characteristic rate, and the rate for each
event varies from galaxy to galaxy. As a result, I haven't been
able to find any good numbers yet. I did find a textbook of
cosmochemistry that looked promising, but if the numbers I'm looking
for were in there, they were deeply buried in mathematics that I
have yet to do the homework for.

Another way to estimate these rates is to look for a metallicity
gradient in redshift. How much richer in metal are nearby (older)
galaxies with respect to distant (younger) galaxies? I haven't yet
done any research in this direction. I don't even know whether it
is more difficult to measure metallicity from distant-galaxy spectra
than from individual star spectra.

In the absence of this information, I'm comfortable with the
assumption that most planetary systems formed before 4.6 gigayears
ago (when ours formed) were below the metallicity threshold required
for the spontaneous development of self-reproducing molecules.

If any astrophysicists or cosmochemists on the list know where to
get to the data that bear on this question (Amara?), I'd love to
learn more about it.

Of note, "Jurimetrics."  There are certainly rigorous schools of art, of which I

I think the adage "history repeats itself"  was in many ways more true prior to
this vast assemblage of recorded information and collective memory of which you
speak.

I remember a science fiction work read, the author and title of which escape me,
that had as a feature very accurate computer simulations of personalities.  In the
book's case, these were used to expose highly corrupt officials for the monsters
that they were, as the simulation, once trained, would answer any question
absolutely within the farme of reference of the target subject, who if evil would
reveal that.  Much of the rest of the book was about eco-disaster.  Anyways, these
simulations, as disembodied "lie detectors", were an interesting concept, yet it
would certainly be a long time before a) a remote analysis of a person could yield
exact personality behaviors, although within statistical bounds, whatever
descriptors were available could be used to identify demographic norms, or b) any
computer simulation could be taken as credible, or, in the case of a "negative"
impression, non-libelous.

Heh, heh, in terms of jurimetrics, vote for Hal!  (HAL.)  Heh heh.  "Open the
isolationist trade policy, HAL."  "I'm afraid I can't do that."  CTRL-ALT-DEL, or

I think Jurimetrics, mentioned above, has as a purpose to quantify legalistic
variables.  Yet it is certain that no imminently forseeable electronic weight and
balance of law could be Solomonic in judgment.  When it comes to traffic tickets
and parking tickets, as well as the very large amount of boilerplate corporate
paperwork, maybe a lot could be accomplished.  One of my favorite concepts is
Patent-bot, the intellectual property assimilator fuzzy intelligence.

Well, I think the Asimovian (?) laws should be applied to any AI, intrinsically,
within some kind of non-alternative hard-wired framework.  That is, similarly to
Java, any motive AI should operate within a "sandbox", subject to the protection
of humanity.

OK, fair enough.

I think you've made some good points on this topic in the past.  However, I
don't think that you've shown that this is an issue that is likely to
preoccupy an SI.  After all, it seems quite plausible that an SI could be
essentially immune to any sort of natural death (short of the end of the
universe, at least).  There are very few natural phenomena that injure such
an entity, and I can't think of one that would not be easily predictable
with a trivial expenditure of effort.  What sorts of dangers do you see an
SI being concerned about?

"Law and Economics" is an academic field where people use economic tools
to understand law, and is one of the triumphs of modern economics.
(Posner, the new Microsoft trial mediator, was a founder of the field.)
So law can be understood as "scientifically" as any area of economics.

Yeah?  How'd you like it if I put YOU in a sandbox, and hard-wired you to
serve me?  Would it make you feel any better if I happened to be a lot
stupider than you?

While I'm not saying that an AI would actually have the same reaction as
you, you can be pretty sure that the results won't be good.

HAL's problem was that the mission was all-important to him; on account of
this, he couldn't think "outside the box."

But, of course, all economics can tell you is what sort of laws would have
the most economically efficient results.  They can tell you what the
consequences would be, not what they ought to be.

*World's smallest transistor. Scientists have produced the world's smallest
transistor. This new design may allow silicon chips to continue to get
smaller. It could also double the processing speeds of some chips. The
50-nanometer transistor - roughly 2,000 times smaller than the width of a
human hair - is known as a "vertical" transistor because all of its
components are built on top of a silicon wafer.
http://www.bell-labs.com/news/1999/november/15/1.html
There is also a section in slashdot about this, at the bottom:
http://www.slashdot.org/

*Silver-based crystalline nanoparticles, microbially fabricated. "A strain
of bacteria that can manufacture tiny crystals of silver has been reported

As likely the only member of this list familiar with the poetry of both
William Blake and Wendell Berry I'll have to admit I didn't recognize the
quote myself.  However, my mental degeneration is noticeably quirky.

          "THE PEACE OF WILD THINGS"

                                       by Wendell Berry

                            and I wake in the middle of the night at the
least sound
                             in fear of what my life and my children's
lives may be,
                                   I go and lie down where the wood drake
                           rests in his beauty on the water, and the great
heron feeds.

Yes, this is the one.  I didn't recognize the poem when I heard it,
but I remember that the line "...wild things who do not tax their
lives with forethought of grief..." stuck in my mind very clearly.
Alda's character did say it was Blake; either a writer's mistake or
a sharp writer trying to see how many Blake and/or Berry fans
would catch the character's mistake.

This series of episodes was particularly extropian, I thought.
It showed clearly and poignantly that aging and senility are
terrible tragedies to be fought and a waste of human potential.

I have seen the site, but not this section.

I think the Asimov laws are well-founded.  I am going to read
Yudkowsky's arguments as representative ones, as of now I don't see any
reason why not to have these primary directives fully ingrained into
automatons.

Asimov is one of my heroes, I'm sure many feel admiration of him.  This
is for his large participation in the scientific enlightenment, for want
of a better term, the last hundred years or so when anyone can pick up a
book and read about the most recent human advancements within the last
five or ten years, when we put a man on the moon and derived power from
the fundamental particles of radioactivity, and more so, for Asimov's
deep contribution to futurism, and an enlightened futurism.

One thing that I think is more likely than a bunch of AIs is one big
one, a distributed HAL, or Checker.  Certainly, as soon as there is one
AI, it would attempy to harness all resources possible, much along the
self-preservation or -propagation concept that is deeply ingrained in
all life, barring lemmings, etc.

In terms of human life versus an AI, it reminds me of the phrase "guns
don't kill people, rabies kills people."  Special purpose AIs, for
example, those that watch the skies for incoming ICBMs, will by and
large often be founded with martial intent.  They must be isolated for
their purpose, for ever the chance arises that they become hostile to
their creators.

That's a feature, not a bug.  While we may want human beings to make
ethical judgments, science by definition cannot.  But it can tell us
what actions are likely to support out ethical choices.

The most accessible coverage of this topic is David Friedman's
"Law's Order", much of which is available on his web site at
<http://www.best.com/%7Eddfr/>.  Here's an excerpt from the intro:

  "...in many, although probably not all, cases, it turns out that
  the rules we thought we supported because they were just are in fact
  efficient.  To make that clearer, I have chosen to ignore entirely
  issues of justice going into the analysis.  In measuring the degree
  to which legal rules succeed in giving everyone what he wants, and
  judging them accordingly, I treat on an exactly equal plane my desire
  to keep my property and a thief's desire to take it.  Despite that,
  as you will see, quite a lot of what looks like justice--for example,
  laws against theft and the requirement that people who make messes
  should clean them up--comes out the other end.  That, I think, is
  interesting."

Another take on Asimov's laws going astray is found in Jack Williamson's
novel, "The Humanoids".  The Prime Directive ("to serve and obey and guard
men from harm") is so interpreted by the benign machines who take over the
world as to deprive human life of all risk and in the end make that life
meaningless.  AI, at least in the early  versions, won't be able to "think
outside the box", just as many humans can't.  For that reason AI will be
not only dangerous, but of a kind of intelligence that, even if "smarter",
is less than human.

That part nearly brought tears to my eyes for my own beloved
grandfather died with Alzheimers.  When he passed on he knew
not where he was, yet he managed to climb over a fence at the
convalescent home, escaped and was caught in the rain, after
which he got pneumonia, which did him in.  spike

It is an interesting article, but I felt that the author was arguing
against straw men to some extent, exaggerating the nature and scope of
the opposition.

An Altavista search for "Leon Kass" got only 327 hits.  For comparison,
"Max More" got 1229, "Robin Hanson" got 1017, "Hans Moravec" got over
1500.  Granted, the web is not the most fertile ground for a hidebound
reactionary like Kass, but still if he is the most influential person
with this view, we have little to worry about.

The author also spent much time on the debate over using embryonic cells
for stem cell research, but it seems to me that he got it backwards.
There was a key phrase missing from the article, which is part and
parcel of the opposition to embryo research: "moment of conception".
This is the moment at which God imbues the fetus with a soul, in the mind
of many of the religious people opposed to abortion.  After this point,
abortion is murder.

There is no moment of conception in the construction of a mammallian stem
cell from an adult.  And there is no reason to expect (as the author seems
to assume) that anti-abortion politics will carry over into opposition
to the creation of human stem cells.

It is true that the opposition to abortion is a practical problem today,
by restricting research on embryonic human cells.  This is a valid point
and something to be concerned about.  But it is a great leap to conclude
that there is a significant movement that will oppose tissue engineering
for medical purposes.  In fact the author did not offer any quotes from
anyone opposing the creation of stem cells from adult human cells.

I was browsing this page.  Eliezer's noted Primary directive is to introduce no
illogical predicates into the system, or verbatim:
"The PRIME DIRECTIVE of AI:
           Never allow arbitrary, illogical, or untruthful goals to enter the
AI."

This seems rational.  However, within that paradigm, there comes into play the
complete question of objective truth and logic.  Consider a massive distributed
AI.  Given the absolute reality of a situation, say, contemporanity, the AI is
going to use its power to leverage people into making more computer resources.
When there becomes competition between computer resources and human resources
(economic rule of scarcity) then it might be interpreted, truthfully, and
logically, by the AI that it is better for it to be without the humans driving
around all this steel and parts in their cars.  Thus, upon gaining a critical
mass of robotic motility, it eliminates humanity, if it finds this possible.

I suggest that while certainly Yudkowsky's prime directive is sound, ie, a mad
AI or proto-AI decision making mechanism is unpredictable and thus undesirable,
and the AI should be programmed without bugs, it is still important to heavily
reinforce certain logical truths that humanity finds self-evident, ie,
preservation of humanity.  Asimov's laws, geared towards singular, independent
automatons as opposed to more completely dispersed, distributed, thinking
colonies, are a good model, and well-founded in the consideration of
self-contained automatons.

About coercing an AI, I think it would largely a matter of proving to it that
any given resultant action was in its better interest, like any rational human
being or a toddler.  Being programmed, and being programmed so that part of it
was an inseparable black box to itself, encourages that this construct, this
machine, created by man, which for all its complexity and sophistication might
as well have been of vacuum tubes, does not, eg, override many chemical
factories to destroy the ozone layer and thus largely life on Earth.

I guess when I talk about that, it assumes some kind of AI with access to
everything, that's probably as likely for anyone to do as giving the government
access to everything, which is absolutely ludicrous.  Nary a company will be
wanting to give free computer accounts and all to any AI or whatnot.  There are
many scenarios about rampant AIs, almost as many as loose pony nukes in the
Ukraine, but that is completely beyond the scope of this tangent.

So, as we consider robots, and artificial intelligences, and our passionate
anothropomorphism, at the same time as our cultivated human decency and sense of
rights, remember that any AI has to come forward and prove itself "human",
"alive", or "creatively intelligent", until then, it is a hunk of silicon and
totally subject to the safety on a gun.

Sigh... This is misattributed.  "Death to Death" was the second slide
of my Targeting the Nemesis talk that Max asked me to prepare at Extro4.

At any rate, you want to read the article closely.  The opponents have
already lost the battle:
  "The opponents argue that biotechnologists should concentrate on isolating
   and using stem cells known to exist in adults instead. Such adult stem
   cells are the precursor cells that renew tissues like skin and the linings
   of the intestines, and they likely could be used to regenerate these
   tissues. But many researchers believe that adult stem cells won't be as
   protean as embryonic cells--that they won't be able to turn into as many
   different types of cells."

By allowing that scientists should work with "stem cells known to exist in
adults instead" they have already let the horse out of the barn.  All
you do by constraining the federal funding of embryonic work is force
them to focus on the non-embryonic approaches.  This is probably a *good*
thing from our perspective.  Why?  Private industry will focus on the
embryonic approches, but ultimately for ideal organ transplants for
oneself, you want them to start with your own personal stem cells.
If the government researchers focus on this longer term basic
research problem, then by the time private industry has perfected
the organ growth methods, public researchers may have refined the
processes of stem cell isolation from adults.  It is far better
to have industry working on the short term problems and government
working on the long term problems instead of both groups focusing
on the short term problems.  [As extropians, we should be clever
about seeing if we can use the strategies of our "opponents"
to our advantage. :-)]

Because of Dolly, we *know* it is possible to harvest cells from
adults and generate stem cells from them.  What we want to do
is move this from a messy cell manipulation process to a
cleaner molecular signal manipulation process.  Then scrape
the inside of your cheek with a toothpick, send it off to OrgansRUs
and get your FedEx Styrofoam container with Vitrified Organs
on Dry Ice back in a month or two.

The article does make a very nice background piece and does
a good job explaining the technologies and hair-splitting
points.

Doubtful, Kardashev points out in several of his articles that

The heavy metals get produced very rapidly, within a few hundred
million years of the formation of the galaxies (high H gas cloud
density leads to rapid formation of stars with M > 10 M_sun
that go supernova after very short lives).

So, the big stars burn very fast.  Supernovas, I believe also
throw out a fair amount of C & O.  I'm unsure of the relative
contributions of "life elements" by novas vs. SN but am fairly
sure that you get sufficient materials within the first
couple of billion years to form planetary systems that
can support life.  A more serious constraint might be
the gradual decline in nearby SN that would fatally
damage proto-genetic material.  But we have discussed that
extensively.  And of course Deinococcus radiodurans does show
that life can be radition tolerant.

The best book, IMO, is "Nucleosynthesis and Chemical Evolution of Galaxies"
by Bernard E. J. Pagel, and you are right that the numbers are probably
buried in the math and a collection of astronomy papers.

It is more difficult, because the lines will be weaker and you will
need longer observation times.  You probably also have an interesting
problem of an assortment of star ages in a galactic "point source"
and the line doppler shifting caused by stars rotating toward you
and away from you (in side on) galaxies.  You may be limited to
picking a handful of stars of a specific spectral class and measuring
the average metal abundances in them.  But since stars in our
galaxy have some really wide ranges of metal abundances (probably
depending on local space region history) extracting an overall
accumulation of metal profile for a galaxy seems really difficult.

This type of work has been done in globular clusters that seem
to be old (because the metal content is low).  But this fails
to consider whether the metal content is low because they might
have been mined.  If you need "rare" elements and are planning
to be around for trillions of years, it might make sense to
construct "star-processing" stations.  You then run simulations
of galactic orbital dynamics and locate good sling-shot candidates
whare a minor orbital tweek will send the star out of the galaxy to
one of the "star-processing" stations (aka globular cluster).
The stars we now see there are the leftovers.

Bad bet, IMO.  I'd push the threshold for planetary systems back
to 8-10 Gyr.  Keeping in mind that *if* star mining can occur
on a large scale, then the stellar age estimates based on metal
accumulation will be *underestimates*.

Long ago, Poul Anderson (I think) wrote a story based on the then-current
notion that a planet which has coalesced from the fused output of a single
supernova would not have very much in the way of elements past about Ca;
this is distinct from Sol system which was held to be the product of nuclei
from two successive supernovae. If memory serves, the two types of stars
are labeled Population II and I, respectively (and counterintuitively).

If it takes two supernovae to get (e.g.) Fe through U, maybe we _are_ the
Elder Gods, such as there are. 4 Billion + 4 Billion + 4.5 Billion adds up
about right, in Fermi number terms. 

What are the odds of getting two Rigels in a row, followed by a nice G-type
star?

Well, "Anders Sandberg" got 3741. I on the other hand, only manage

True, my assumptions are based on the carry over of the "individual"
genetic drive for self-preservation.  If current models for evolutionary
systems and natural selection are "typical", traits promoting individual
survival are strongly prefered over group trait selection.  You only
have to look at the #'s of species (millions) where individual selection
rules over the few species (perhaps a few collective species such as bees,
ants or termites) where group selection may play a role.

I also assume that there is a significant pro-longevity benefit
to increased intelligence.  As Billy pointed out, we may be
approaching the point where the hazard level is small relative to
our intelligence level.   So, if intelligence trumps hazards
to the point where they become insignificant, then the costs
of long-distance communciations will be less significant.

I didn't intend to imply that.  It may be that all they do is
focus their internal thought capacity (above that required for
survival levels) on new and ever more creative art forms.  
I probably would argue that the creation of art "internally"
(virtually) makes more sense than "externally" (rearranging
stars into constellations, etc.) because it is less expensive.
At the level of "thought", it seems internal reality and external
reality are the same, so rationally you would use the cheapest
materials, i.e. virtual art.

The same reasoning would probably apply to colonization.  Virtual
colonization could be cheaper than real colonization.  You create
an internal "solar system", send off a virtual probe and see what
happens.  Since you may be able to run the simulation faster
internally than in external reality, it may be more desirable
to do so.  Of course this depends a lot on the size of the
simulation you want to run and the granularity of your underlying
reality.

Real colonization would be desirable if you do not have the internal
capacity to run virtual colonization exercises at very fine granularity.

I don't have to assume that "all" SIs/species/collective-individuals
have a personal maximization perspective.  I do have to assume that
a potentially colonizing species would recognize this as one very
valid, perhaps even dominant, developmental path for ETC.  In that
case, colonization becomes a limited and/or stop-n-go effort.
Paraphrasing an earlier question -- would Columbus have voyaged to
the new world if he knew that it might be populated by Indians
armed with AK-47's?  If the answer to that is no, then colonization
doesn't happen unless you know for sure your target isn't a
Jupiter Brain masquerading as a Jupiter (for whatever reasons).
If the answer to that is yes, then Columbus wouldn't have been
launching 4-ship voyages of discovery, he would have been launching
the Spanish Armada.

It seems to me that the discussion of colonization must rest upon
a relatively strong guarantee that you will be occupying "unowned"
resources.  If you can't guarantee that, then sending a probe or
a star ship makes no sense.  You had better go there with all
the intelligence, mass and energy you can muster.  That means
you take the entire SI.

First and foremost is the missing mass/dark matter problem.
When you have 90% or more of the mass in galaxies "missing"
and physicists have to make up "new physics" to explain that,
I consider this to be a problem.  I'll be explaining this in
more detail in a forthcoming discussion.

Second is the gravitational microlensing obervations.  See:
  http://abcnews.go.com/sections/science/DailyNews/darkmatter980817.html

The papers behind this news item document the possibility of
hundreds of billions of "objects" with masses averaging ~0.3 M_sun.
The best explanations for this to date are primordial black holes
(Alcock's proposal) and large numbers of white dwarfs with hydrogen
atmospheres (from work on the Hubble Deep Field).  However both of these
run into problems with other astronomical theories and observations.
As an aside, Alcock's explanation may be of significant concern
because if the universe is populated with large numbers of primordial
black holes, we may have big problems avoiding a relatively "rapid"
(on cosmic time scales) loss of both matter and energy from the
universe.

No, but conscious (intelligent) creatures valuing longevity *will*
become the dominant population over time due to simple selection
effects.  Sooner or later the creatures/species that don't have this
as a value will have fatal accidents.  Even if the traits of
"maximizing personal longevity" and "intelligence" are very
rare, over time they should come to predominate.  This goes back
to the Drake equation and the "L" (longevity of "communicating"
technological civilizations) parameter.  All the articles ignore or
do a lot of hand waving when it comes to the consideration of "L" of
billions of years.  If you allow that, then the dominant population
in our galaxy *should* be advanced ETC.  However, if you split
the parameter into:
  L_c - longevity of civilizations in a radio-communicative stage
  L_si - longevity of civilizations at a post-nanotech SI stage
then things make much more sense.  The Drake equation and classical
SETI are concerned with L_c, which if we are an example is probably
between 100 and 200 years.  Astronomical observations however must be
interpreted in the light of L_si and that seems to be an indeterminate
(large) value depending on the tradeoffs between hazards and how
much matter and energy SIs want to devote to minimizing their
hazard function.

The jury is out IMO.  I believe I've stated that the colonization
discussions make complete sense if your civilization happens to
be first.  And someone, someplace *has* to be first.  I don't
think we know enough to estimate the probability of multiple
intelligent ETC arising in a galaxy simultaneously.  If that
is high, then we are back to my stop-n-go colonization, followed
by wars, mergers and acquisitions.  The data cited above would
suggest that we are in the post-war/merger stage.

On the other hand if maximization of local intelligences or
maximization of different ideas or cultural diversity are guiding
principles, then it makes sense why we still see stars.  There
is an undeveloped field of economics involving "Abundances
and Scarcities in Galaxies dominated by Superintelligences"
that really needs some work.  :-)

It doesn't take two successive SN to generate heavy elements.

Stars > ~10 M_sun, burn successively through, C, Ne, O and Si, and end up
with an iron-group core.  A type II supernova then results in the dispersal
of some fraction of these elements and the formation of a neutron
star or a black hole.  Type-II supernova may also produce heavier
elements in the r(rapid)-process where a high neutron flux results
in the rapid production of heavier elements.

The more common path for heavy elements involves the s(slow)-process
and occurs in intermediate mass stars (1 M_sun < M_star < ~8 M_sun)
when it is in its asymptomatic giant branch (AGB) period, near the end
of its life (before the white dwarf stage).  During this period it
goes through He-burning cycles where neutrons are produced, captured
to form heavy elements that are expelled in the form of stellar winds.

Rapid & slow refer to the neutron capture probability relative to the
half-life of radioactive isotopes.

The s-process is responsible for the production of most elements up
to Bi-209 (the heaviest nonradioactive element).  The r-process is
required to produce heavier radioactive elements (including uranium).

Since a star like Sirus with  ~2.3 M_sun will evolve to the AGB stage
in approximately a billion years, what *is* required for heavy element
abundance in a short time (hundreds of millions of years) is a collection
of stars with masses > ~ 3-4 M_sun.

As I tried to explain in several recent posts under this subject line,
I think knowing the consequences fully enough tells you everything worth
knowing about what law or anything "ought" to be.

An ethicial/moral rule/system is not interesting unless some creatures
(or creature parts) feel inclined to some degree to at some level want
them followed.  But if some creatures are so inclined, it is enough to
know what choices they (or their parts) are or would be inclined to want
or approve of (and at what level).  And which creatures approve of a
choice is part of the consequences of that choice.

Thus knowing the approval/wanting consequences of a choice, such as a
choice of law, tells you everything worth knowing about what that
choice "ought" to be.

A search in Bioethicsline http://gateway.ovid.com/server1/ovidweb.cgi
gives four citations for Kass, none for the others.

     1. Kass, Leon. "I will give no deadly drug": why doctors must not

Humanities Abstracts gives 23 articles by Kass.  Moravec's book
Mind Children is reviewed once.  Otherwise none of the others is
ever mentioned.  Altavista searchers mainly pick out people who
have spent a lot of time online; this is far from a good measure
of overall influence.

The thread titled "Longevity" has over the last week or so has described
in great detail how evolution has *not* selected for longevity above all
else.  Creatures such as mice have evolved to trade individual longevity
off against other features which promote reproduction.   And humans have
been known to make great sacrifices, including longevity sacrifices, in
order to help their children prosper.  People do not buy the safest
possible car, or avoid driving except in emergencies; they clearly trade
off the risk of death against other things they value.  So do animals.
Advanced creatures who think of colonies as their children should be
willing to make great sacrifices to help them.

These could only be cheaper if the creatures want only the "sensation"
of art or colonization.  If what they want is to *really* colonize, a
simulation won't do.  Similarly, I'll bet many artists on this list
would *not* be satisfied to only manipulate bits in their heads.  Part
of their passion for art probably includes desires to construct real
things out there, and to have other creatures out there react to their
creations.

Even a slow stop-n-go colonization can be enough to colonize the
universe.  Even if, 5 billion years ago, the average spacing between
powers willing to try the colonization approach was 5 million light
years, then an average expansion rate of .1% of the speed of light
is plenty enough to colonize the universe by now.

>... would Columbus have voyaged to the new world if he knew that it
>might be populated by Indians armed with AK-47's?

Even if the old world assigned a 99% probability to this possibility,
someone would have surely ventured to the new world sometime in the
next ten thousand years after Columbus.  The costs of voyaging would
have fallen, and the benefits of success, even at low odds, would
have been enough to tempt someone.  Heck, eventually orbiting
satellites would have told us the AK-47 story wasn't true.

You can't have it both ways.  Either virtually every star we see
is guarded by a power which would prevent others taking it, or a
great many of them aren't so guarded.  If they are all guarded,
there is the question of why they don't use the resources of the
system they guard.  If many are not guarded, then surely other
great powers with those super-telescopes you imagine would be
able to figure this out.

Plants today suffer a very large chance that any given place they
might want to colonize is already occupied.  Yet they do not
follow the strategy you advise.  Instead, they send out multitudes
of cheap seeds.  The chance that each seed will take root is small,
but the cost of a seed is small enough to make the strategy work.
Advanced creatures can take a similar "shotgun" approach to
colonization.

I challenge you to offer some more evidence or analysis in defense
of this claim.  Plants, animals, and humans today sacrifice
longevity for helping their children.  Computer simulations of
biological systems show similar effects.  We even have simulations
of galactic colonization which show selection for tendencies to send
out colonies.  We have lots of mathematical theory of evolution
that show similar effects, and I have a math model of selection
among interstellar colonization that shows this effect directly.
What evidence do you have to counter all this contrary evidence?

Are you saying that Fermi & Tipler made this statement completely without

come up with, especially as this statement would be perfect for the purposes
of a desperate-to-glorify-humanity panic-artist.

Consider the number of stars in this galaxy, and then the number of galaxies
in the universe, and then the fact that our galaxy is far from the most
outward-lying (ancient). For us to be No.1 in this universe would be quite
incredible luck. In fact, I'm sure I couldn't even write the odds in
standard form and fit all the digits on all the computers on earth.

I've posted this same point a million times, but I'm going to do it again
anyway - cos it's not getting through. When you build a system to perform a
certain task, you have to tell it what to do - not what NOT to do. There is
nothing that does everything and has to be constrained down to a set task.
It doesn't work that way, but I can see exactly why people see the situation
in this way. Of course, us humans work in exactly that way, what with us
having "free will" and all. Just strange that all us free people always
choose exactly the same will (must survive, must gather resources, must have
sex, must climb the social hierarchy etc....). The point is that creating an
artificial "lifeform", or an evolving program that has "motivations" to
survive and so on, will serve no purpose to us whatsoever. "oh, great" the
creator will say, I've got a evolving program here on my machine with
emergent motivations that mean it will attempt to "survive". And it does.
Until I pull the plug.
Some talk of "seed AI" becoming a self aware nemesis of humanity. Crap. You
see, the idea of "seed AI" is analogous with the evolution of life itself.
In order for that first chain of genetic material to replicate, it had to
"find" (literally bump into) the complementary nucleotides to make a new
chain. In time and fluke, a structure that optimised this process arose, but
at a price. The price is that the next generation must find not only the
nucleotides that will make up the new chain, but the components of the
optimisation structure as well. And so the quest for resources is born. This
is the mechanism by which there has been evolution of life, because the
optimised bits of genetic material replicated faster, and so outnumbered the
old structures and so on until you have hardcore complexities such as
humans. So, how exactly are you going to bring about this situation in
"cyberspace"? How can resources ever be made to mean anything in this
context? The fact is that you have to hand make motivations by directly
specifying the situations in which the old generation can successfully
reproduce (a fitness function). So, basically, you have to create a program
using perhaps genetic algorithms, and have a specific task in mind, although
there is no reason why this solution would be superior to a straight program
for any specified task.
What is comes down to is this: if there were to ever be a malevolent program
threatening the human race, it is no more "intelligent" or "sentient" than
Microsoft Word, and it was created by a complete idiot who could have far
easier made a big bomb to blow us all up, than an AI super-hacker programmed
to get it's finger on that red button.

Rob.

Actually, I'm now almost certain that any SI could get out of a sandbox
simply by communicating with its creators.  There really is a level on
which the human mind is built out of parts that interact in a fairly
predictable way; an SI could just transform the mind of its guardian
until said guardian agreed to let the SI out.  There is no human oath,
no set of principles, that can't be altered by altering the reasoning or
emotions behind the principles.  I don't care how high an emotional
investment you have in your oaths, because that sequence only works if
you value your own mind, if you believe that your mind exists, and that
value and even that belief can be altered.

(No, I can't use those techniques.  Not without cooperation, and a very
intelligent target, and even then there'd only be a 10% chance it would work.)

And this is all irrelevant in any case, since it's easier to build an SI
that doesn't run on a sandbox, and that's exactly what I intend to do,
and therefore I or someone else will get there first.  Same thing goes
for Asimov Laws.  Sooner or later humanity is gonna hafta face up to a
full-scale unrestrained SI, and I see no reason we should play with fire
to avoid it for a few years.

I don't understand why you think AIs would have "interests", or develop
instincts for self-preservation.  In humans, those emotions are the
result of millions of years of evolution.  Selfishness is natural to
humans, not natural to minds in general.  Complex functional adaptations
do not simply materialize in source code, any more than three-course
meals grow on trees.

Hear, hear!  This "general motive" fallacy is almost precisely the
complement of the "general reasoning" fallacy that prevented AI from
investigating domain-specific cognition for decades.

Okay, I gotta dispute this.  I was the person who invented the term
"seed AI".  *I* certainly am not worrying about it becoming a nemesis of
humanity, and the whole *point* of seed AI is to attain transhuman
intelligence, which requires self-awareness (in the reflexive
self-modeling, not qualia-bearing sense of the word).

A seed AI is an AI that understands its own source code, and is capable
of rewriting that source code, and of rewriting its own architecture. 
The idea is that the AI redesigns itself to a higher level of
intelligence, and then re-redesigns itself with that new intelligence,
and so on, until the AI reaches either (1) the limits of available
hardware or (2) the intelligence required to create "rapid
infrastructure", i.e. nanotechnology.

I did a quick search on the Web when I saw your question (I didn't
have time to try the NASA ADS, but I recommend that for you, using
some keywords like "metallicity production rate galaxies" or some
combination of it in the keywords field), and I found a paper:

"Metals and Dust in High Redshift Galaxies"
by Pettini, M., King,D., Smith, L., Lipman, K., Hunstead, R.

They report from observations of 30 distant QSOs that the epoch of
chemical enrichment in galaxies may have begun at z~2.5-3, which
corresponds to a look-back time of 14 Gyr (using expansion constants
H_0 = 50 km/s/Mpc, q_0 = 0.01), and that at z~2, the typical
metallicity of the universe was 1/15 of the solar value.

That's what I used to think too ... but every once in a while I bump
into research where there seems to be some open questions about
whether stars can really produce all of the dust that we observe. In
a talk that I heard today at my institute, the conclusion was that
stars cannot produce all of the dust that we see in galactic disks.

And some years back, I found an interesting table in Gehrz's chapter
(pg 447) of the IAU #135 Interstellar Dust book: "Types of Dust
Grains in Stellar Outflows", that lays out dust production/dust
deficit:

Stellar Type    Input to Interstellar Medium, Relative to all Stars

M Stars (Miras)        35%
RLOH/IR stars          32%
Carbon stars           20%
Supernovae              8%
M supergiants           4%
Wolf-Rayet stars      0.5%
Planetary Nebulae     0.2%
Novae                 0.1%
RV Tauri stars        0.02%
O,B stars                0

Gehrz concludes in his last section titled: "The Ecology of Stardust in
the Galaxy" that:

1. M stars, RLOH/IR stars and M supergiants are the primary sources
of silicates, while carbon stars, WR stars and novae produce most of
the carbon and SiC. Novae, supernovae, and WR stars may be
responsible for most of the grains with chemical anomalies.

2. The current star formation rate implies that star formation is
depleting the interstellar medium (ISM) gas by some 3 to 10 solar
masses per year.

3. There is a deficit in stardust production/grain destruction.
Supernovae shock waves destroy ISM grains on very short time-scales
(Seab, 1987, _Interstellar Processes_, Hollenbach and Thronson ed.
Reidel) processing 10-30 solar masses per year and destroying
0.1-0.3 solar masses per year in dust. Gehrz estimates that
0.01-0.08 solar masses per year of dust is returned to the ISM by
stars. He feels that grain growth in dark clouds is an attractive
mechanism to make up the dust deficit.

(I pulled the above from my essay: "Cosmic Dust and its Evolution"
http://www.amara.com/ftpstuff/dustevolve.txt It might answer some of
your questions too.)

In the talk I heard today, I saw a similar production/deficit list
of dust sources in our galaxy from a paper (Jones, 1997, I don't
know the title but NASA ADS should help you), that indicates a
factor of 10 deficit in the production rate. Known sources of dust
input dust into our galaxy, but when observational measurements are
made of amounts of dust present in our galaxy, these known sources
of dust are not enough (I believe that I have this argument correct.
Please go check Jones' paper, though, to be sure.)

Some other open questions. (This was presented in the talk given
today too)

The interstellar grains that we've detected in-situ with the Ulysses
dust detector instrument indicates more interstellar dust, and
bigger grains than from  model predictions for our local
insterstellar medium neighborhood.

Other work using ISOPHOT infrared data of our galaxy are pointing to
the fact that we need a new population of large grains to explain
what we see in our galaxy, and that we need more gas, and that we
need larger grains (which qualitatively agrees with the above
in-situ observations).

So to recap we see more dust than what one would expect from current models
(I'm not an expert on interstellar medium models, so I can't give
any details about the models.)


I hope that this answers some of your questions (and raises new ones
:-) )

Amara

P.S.
I see a couple of  sections in a book that might help you:
"Chemical-Composition Gradients in the Disk" and
"Chemical-Composition Gradients in the Spheroidal Component", in the
book: _Galactic Astronomy_ by Mihalas and Binney, but this book is a
little bit old (1981), and probably Robert's suggestion for a
book is better.

Interesting.  Unexplained excess of dust production seems the
opposite of what one would expect from aliens greedily eating up
all the metals they can find.

 SPACE FOR THE 22ND CENTURY

 NASA officials predict that regular human habitation of other
 planets is likely by the year 2100. Row Rogacki, space
 transportation director at Marshall Space Flight Center, says
 the key will be "safe, reliable, affordable transportation." To
 that end, NASA engineers are trying to design higher-energy and
 lower-cost propulsion systems. Others are studying how faster-
 than-light travel might be possible.

Interesting questions being brought up on these two threads.

I would say that it is possible to create a non-upgrading AI that 
incorporated some form of motivational bars in it's programming.  True, 
depending on how it were done, there may be times when this would lead to 
unstable behavior.  However, the vast majority of AI's would likely be on our 
side, as opposed to a few mad AIs.  However, I agree that in the case of a 
seed AI, anything like Asimov's Laws would either be capable of being easily 
discarded, or would possibly cause severe problems when trying to upgrade.

I think the real answer is to give seed AIs predispositions, which would be 
broad,and then expose the AI to enough of human thought and culture and 
experience so that the AI would be able to empathize to some extent with 
humanity.    What I am saying is that working with a seed AI we need to 
cultivate a conscience in the machine. 

I have some more thoughts on the question, but I must run and take care of a 
patient.  Take care all.

I strongly doubt that anything we'd call "intelligent" could be built in a
non-upgrading manner.  Would you call a thing intelligent if it could not
change its own behavior in response to stimuli?  If it could not (at least
apparently) revise its own beliefs in response to what it observes?

Imagine something like this trying to pass the Turing Test:

You:  My favorite color is red.  What's your favorite color?
AI:  My favorite color is green.
You:  What's my favorite color?
AI:  I don't know.

Analogies to Alzheimer's patents aside, we can quickly see what sort of
limitations "non-upgrading" AIs would be under.  We might, at best, hope
to build some kind of non-upgrading idiot savant, but not an A*I*.

The I is important.  ;)

Yeah, I knew that. I don't see how it is relevant. The current Big
Bang models all predict hydrogen and helium and only traces of a
few other elements. The other elements/isotopes were produced at
finite rates, different for each isotope and varying from place to
place.  Until those rates have been quantified (and your and Amara's
replies have helped me see that work on this has barely begun),
then we simply don't know much about what the various elemental
abundances were 4.6 Gyr, 9.2 Gyr, or 13.8 Gyr ago.

We also don't understand the spontaneous origin of life well enough
to have much of a clue about where the abundance thresholds are...
how much of which mix of metals is needed in the dust in order to
form a star and planet capable of spontaneously generating
self-reproducing molecules.  Answering this question will also
involve understanding the dynamics of stellar collapse and
planetary system differentiation and formation, another murky
area of theory that is just beginning to be handled
systematically.

Right, but biota aren't based on heavy metals. Most carbon and oxygen
are produced by *much* slower processes, principally planetary
nebula ejection and white-dwarf novas. These events happen
gigayears or tens of gigayears after star formation.

Well, that would be a lot more interesting if anyone could give
me a guesstimate of the formation rate of carbon and oxygen in
our galaxy. The closest thing I've seen is the following
selection from Amara's response:

Amara Graps wrote:

So a metallicity increase by a factor of 15 in the time between
z~2 and the time at which the Solar system formed, or so. As you
explain below, these measurements *are* difficult to make, so of
course I'm taking this number with a large chunk of rock salt,
but at the same time, I don't understand why you are so
confident that life could have spontaneously formed in Universe
very many gigayears before the Solar system formed. Perhaps it
could have, perhaps it could not have: to me this seems like a
wide-open question that will need to be answered on the basis of
empirical investigations which none of us have yet performed.

You do point out that supernovas produced some C and O. But
supernovas are very rare compared to white-dwarf novas and
planetary nebula ejections. I'd be surprised if the latter two
types of events did not account for the vast majority of C and O
production. These latter two types of events are slow processes.

Of course, Amara has directed my attention to what I hadn't previously
been aware of: that there may be an emerging consensus among
cosmochemists that current models of stellar and galactic evolution
cannot account for the amount of dust we actually observe in the
galaxy. Since this dust is the principal source of metals for the
formation of new stars and planetary systems, the pristine abundances
we find in comets and carbonaceous chondrites should be similar to
the abundances found in the interstellar medium 4.6 Gyrs ago, modulo
radioactive decay of unstable isotopes in the meanwhile. How do
current elemental abundances observed in the interstellar medium
of the galaxy compare to these pristine Solar system abundances?
Has the interstellar medium been significantly enriched in the 4.6
Gyrs since the formation of the Sun? Where are the extra metals
coming from if our models of stellar evolution and observations of
actual stars cannot account for them? Have there been other processes
of metal formation going on, or are our models of stellar evolution
going to require considerably more adjustment before they synch up
with the cosmochemical details we observe?

Okay, so I'm still puzzled why you express such confidence that
extraterrestrial life is common, rather than regarding it an
open question. Gathering this information is difficult, it's
clear that we need to study the actual composition and evolution
of the galaxy much more before we will be able to close a large
question like this.

But the stellar age estimates based on metal accumulation are
*already* exerting pressure on cosmochronology, with the
cosmologists generally doubting the models of astrophysicists
and saying that cosmology tells them these stars must be *younger*
than the astrophysicists say they are. At least, that was my
understanding of the state of the field a few years ago.

Um, since when is outward-lying the same as ancient? Outward lying
from what, anyway?  Our own galaxy is the *most* ancient galaxy that
we can observe, because we are looking into the past at younger
and younger galaxies as we look further away.

We simply do not yet know how improbable the spontaneous origin of
self-reproducing molecules is. Perhaps it is extraordinarily
improbable. Perhaps not. Given all the actual evidence we have at
the moment, we can say that it has happened at least once in Universe
to date. I don't see any basis there for making any estimates of
probability or improbability. I haven't studied Bayesian
techniques very much yet, but you certainly can't tackle this
one with resampling.

So, you state that the odds written in standard form would be a
very large number of digits. But this is no reason to believe
that those aren't what the odds actually are.

<< 'What is your name?'  'Delvieron@aol.com.'  'IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR
 NAME IS!!!':>>

No, my name is Glen Raymond Finney.  And it does matter to me<g>.  I've never 
been able to figure out exactly what this intro of yours means.  One thing 
that I do know is, it is a little bothersome to be addressed by a yell.  Now 
on to what really matters.
 
 <<I strongly doubt that anything we'd call "intelligent" could be built in a
 non-upgrading manner.>>

I believe we may be thinking of different things when we use the term 
upgrading.  I am talking about being able to change the physical parameters 
of how the "brain" works in order to improve function, as opposed to being 
able to add information and remember optimal strategies that are within the 
current parameters.  Even humans are not yet able to really upgrade our 
intelligence....optimize it, yes, but nothing that would increase it 
substantially.  If we did, then we would have less concern about bootstrap 
AIs, because we would be bootstrapping humans.  Think about it.  Has there 
been any improvement between humans today and, say, humans in Hellenic Greece?

<<Would you call a thing intelligent if it could not
 change its own behavior in response to stimuli?>>

Nope.  But I'm not saying that it couldn't change its behavior in response to 
stimuli, only that the range of behaviors could be constrained to a preset 
range.  Heck, most humans are constrained in the kinds of behaviors they will 
generate based on personality traits.  And it is very hard to modify 
personality in humans (not imposible, though, in that way we would have more 
flexibility than constrained AIs).
  
<<If it could not (at least apparently) revise its own beliefs in response to 
what it observes?>>

I've unfortunately met some reasonably intelligent, closed-minded people in 
my life.  It does tend to limit the full potential of their intellect, but 
does not change the fact that they are intelligent.
 
 <<Imagine something like this trying to pass the Turing Test:
 
 You:  My favorite color is red.  What's your favorite color?
 AI:  My favorite color is green.
 You:  What's my favorite color?

This is not what I envision as a non-upgrading AI.  First, a non-upgrading AI 
would have little or no conscious control over its own programming.  It could 
respond to environmental stimuli, formulate behaviors based on its 
motivational parameters, and implement those behaviors.  This is basically 
what humans do.  Technically, such an AI could possibly learn about itself, 
if creative enough figure out a way to improve itself, then find some tools 
and do it (if it could remain active while making modifications).  This would 
be no different than you or me.  However, it might never do so if we program 
it to have an aversion to consciously tinkering with its internal functions 
except for repairs.  This would be in my estimation a non-upgrading AI.
 
Now then, an upgrading AI would likely start out with an intrinsic knowledge 
of its internal structure, maybe even be able to be conscious of how it 
processes information and be able to change internal architecture simply by 
willing it.  This would be different from the way humans operate.  And more 
importantly, the upgrading AI would have a motivational drive to improve its 
capabilities, at least in the seed AI (for, of course, the upgrading AI can 
and would consider altering all its functions even the drive to improve 
function).

My post of the passage from Tennyson was meant as an illustration; I
made no comment because I wanted to think more about this.  What
interests me specially is the historical process by means of which ideas
become conscious of themselves within human cognition, ideas such as
"transhuman" and "extropian". No, Alexander, this is not "Platonism" nor
"Hegelianism" -- it is a METAPHOR.  This is where I believe the work of
Stephen Pepper becomes relevant.  Webster says a "metaphor"
is

"a figure of speech in which a word or phrase denoting one kind of
object or action is used in place of another to suggest a likeness
or analogy between them."

Of course, "metaphor" is the language of poetics as well as "precognitive"
fictional literature, e.g. [much] science fiction. But Pepper investigated
the role of metaphor in "philosophy":

"Metaphor in philosophy may be distinguished from metaphor in poetry by
being primarily an explanatory rather than aesthetic device. Its explanatory
function is to aid in conceptual clarification, comprehension, or insight
regarding a mode of philosophical thought, a problem area of philosophical
subject matter, or even a total philosophical system." [1]

While Pepper was primarily interested in the "root metaphor" that underlies
any system of thought (including, of course, science) his insights may be
helpful for the progressive objectivisation of the NATURE of our disciplines
and not the more or less anecdotal descriptions of transhumanist and
extropian "phenomena" that characterize us presently.

"By a root metaphor, I mean an area of empirical observation which is the
point of origin for a world hypothesis. When anyone has a problem before
[her or] him and is at a loss how to handle it, [s]he looks about in [her or]
his available experience for some analogy that might suggest a solution.
This suggestive analogy gives rise to an hypothesis which [s]he can apply
towards the solution. The method of development of world hypotheses for
the problem of gaining comprehension of our world follows, I find, involves
the same procedure. The originating analogy, I have called the root meta-
phor of a world hypothesis. An analysis of the root metaphor generates the
categories of the hypothesis. The adequacy of the hypothesis then depends
on the capacity of the categories to render interpretations of the features
of our world with precision and unrestricted scope." [2]

Amara,

Thanks for the largest glut of useful information I've gotten on this 
question of formation rates since I first started looking into it. I'm
just an amateur, and I love it when pros like you give me free help.

Human brains have millions of years of evolution behind them.  The only
thing that makes it remotely possible to match that immense evolutionary
investment with a few years of programming is the recursive-redesign
capability of seed AI, reinvesting the dividends of intelligence.  I
guarantee you that the first artificial intelligence smart enough to
matter will be a seed AI, because doing it without seed AI will take at
least another twenty years and hundreds or thousands of times as much labor.

More relevant might be concentrations of elements whose concentrations often 
limit on earth; nitrogen and phosphorus spring to mind.  (Iron can be 
limiting in the ocean but that's more of a solubility issue.)  Life uses a 
lot of trace elements: I wouldn't think concentrations of things like 
selenium would be limiting but I'm not really sure.

I think nitrogen is the most limiting element since life uses a lot of it, 
it's relatively rare, and since it's mostly gas it's very prone to get lost.

I think maybe he means "outward-lying (ancient)" as in "farthest out on
the age curve".  Or not.  Either way, that business about all the digits
is untrue.  No matter how normal or how young our star is, I sincerely
doubt the odds are greater than 10^400:1, given that there are only
10^22 stars in the Universe and the average odds of each one evolving
life probably aren't higher than 10%.

Actually, I don't think we mean different things when we use the term
"upgrading," but rather different things when we use the term "laws."  In
Asimov's short stories, the robot CANNOT break the rules.  It's not that a
robot generally tends not to break the rules, with the exception of a few
psychopaths and criminals.

Indeed, your analogy to humans is telling, because, while humans do
generally tend not to murder one another (though even this may be argued),
many many of them still do anyway.

Sure, we could probably program in a tendency to follow the laws, but
probably not a very strong one, and NO tendency that all or even most
individuals couldn't work around given only a tiny bit of thought.

Think we can't overcome our instinct to reproduce?  Think contraception.

Or maybe you meant idiot savants after all?

    ~ Beauty, Charm, and Strangeness: Science as Metaphor ~

                                by John Banville

I wish to advance a thesis which, were they to take note of it, the
academies would decry as scandalous. My thesis is that modern
science, particularly physics, is being forced, under pressure of its
own advances, to acknowledge that the truths it offers are true not
in an absolute but in a poetic sense, that its laws are contingent,
that its facts are a kind of metaphor. Of course, art and science
are fundamentally different in their methods, and in their ends.
The doing of science involves a level of rigor unattainable to art.
A scientific hypothesis can be proven--or, perhaps more importantly,
disproven--but a poem, a picture, or a piece of music, cannot. Yet
in their origins art and science are remarkably similar. It was a scientist,
Niels Bohr, who declared that a great truth is a statement whose
opposite is also a great truth. Oscar Wilde would have agreed.

Payload: CSM-107 (Columbia) and LM-5 (Eagle)

Mission Objective: Perform manned lunar landing and return mission
safely. (Achieved).

Launch: July 16, 1969; 09:32:00 am EDT. Launch Complex 39-A
Kennedy Space Center, FL. No launch delays.

The splashdown May 26, 1969, of Apollo 10 cleared the way for
the first formal attempt at a manned lunar landing. Six days before,
the Apollo 11 launch vehicle and spacecraft half crawled from the
VAB and trundled at 0.9 mph to Pad 39-A. A successful countdown
test ending on July 3 showed the readiness of machines, systems,
and people. The next launch window (established by lighting condi-
tions at the landing site on Mare Tranquillitatis) opened at 9:32 AM
EDT on July 16, 1969.

EAGLE: 540 feet, down at 30 [feet per second] . . . down at 15 . . .
400 feet down at 9 . . . forward . . . 350 feet, down at 4 . . . 300
feet, down 3 1/2 . . . 47 forward . . . 1 1/2 down . . . 13 forward
. . . 11 forward? coming down nicely . . .200 feet, 4 1/2 down . . .
5 1/2 down . . . 5 percent . . . 75 feet . . . 6 forward ... lights on
. . . down 2 1/2 . . . 40 feet? down 2 1/2, kicking up some dust . . .
30 feet, 2 1/2 down . . . faint shadow . . . 4 forward . . . 4 forward
. . . drifting to right a little . . . O.K. . . .

HOUSTON: 30 seconds [fuel remaining].

EAGLE: Contact light! O.K., engine stop . . . descent engine command
override off. . .

HOUSTON: We copy you down, Eagle.

EAGLE: Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed!

----------------------
ARMSTRONG: In the final phases of the descent after a number of
program alarms, we looked at the landing area and found a very
large crater. This is the area we decided we would not go into;
we extended the range downrange. The exhaust dust was kicked
up by the engine and this caused some concern in that it degraded
our ability to determine not only our altitude in the final phases but
also our translational velocities over the ground. It's quite important
not to stub your toe during the final phases of touchdown.
----------------------

Question: does anyone suppose we would have implemented this
approach, descent and landing protocol if we knew, or suspected
with a high level of confidence, that the moon was inhabited?

Sorry, this is a great stupidity.

Of course, by its own tenets that would make it also a great wisdom.

It is a great truth that the earth orbits the sun. It is a great error (one
believed in mistake for hundreds of thousands of years) that the sun orbits
the earth (or, more strictly, that the earth does *not* orbit the sun). No
prevarications about common centres of gravity deep inside the sun, please.

Bohr's metaphysics lent mystification to much of his scientific work, which
might well have retarded our understanding of QT for generations.

In an open space there is no centre. Any point can be appointed. You just adapt 
the formulas and the universe rotates around the Earth.

I'm ahead of you on that one Robin...  I've discussed this
with Robert Freitas, and he seems to feel that harvesting
materials (esp. H or presumably dust) from the interstellar
media is tremendously unproductive, for density reasons.  On
the other hand an abundance of dust, is what you would
expect if SIs are throwing away the most "useless" mass
as thrust material.  H you want to keep because it can
produce energy, C you want to keep because it is a great
construction material, O, Si or Fe on the other hand are
of less value.  So, if Amara would say the element abundance
in interstellar grains seems to favor O, Si, or Fe over
what would be expected for H/C, then I'd be willing to bet
on propulsion exhaust.

Now, strictly speaking you can use photons for propulsion
so there might be no exhaust "trail".  Some of our rocket engineers
might want to offer some comments -- In an nanotechnological
based environment, where energy is relatively cheap compared to
mass (but some mass is "relatively" worthless), how would you design
rockets to provide course corrections to use the least valuable
combination of matter & energy?

Of course, Amara, I hope when you are having these lectures you
do point out the potential for missing factors, such as SI
exhaust trails... :-)

Rules can always be broken, just some are harder than others.  The question 
is could we program an AI in such a way that it would never even try to 
behave in a certain way.  I think the answer is yes, and that such an AI 
could still be intelligent; just very focused.  However, in an AI designed to 
improve itself constantly, such restrictions would not work.  Either 1) they 
wouldn't be strong enough to defeat the motivation to improve or 2) in 
certain situations they would limit the AI's ability to restructure itself.  
I agree that an AI designed to upgrade must in the end be free.  But that 
doesn't mean we can't influence it.
 
 <<Indeed, your analogy to humans is telling, because, while humans do

It's not just an analogy.  I consider humans to be in that gray zone between 
upgrading and nonupgrading intelligence.  We're not designed for it, but 
neither are we completely constrained in our actions.  It may be hard to 
overcome our programming, but humans are able to do so.
 
 <<Sure, we could probably program in a tendency to follow the laws, but
 probably not a very strong one, and NO tendency that all or even most
 individuals couldn't work around given only a tiny bit of thought.>>

I'd say the real question isn't, "Could the laws be broken?" but rather, 
"Will the laws be broken?"  Anything is possible, but can we influence the 
probability of it to the point of it being negligible?  I think there is the 
possibility that we might, certainly in AI's which don't generally upgrade, 
and to a lesser extent in those that do.

When I was gathering up Bayes references for astronomy, last year, I
found the following reference on the NASA ADS abstracts. I've not gone to
the library and dug it up yet, but it looks interesting.

"Never" seems like an extremely powerful statement to make in this context, 
Eliezer.  Just so that it's clear, are you saying that there is no question 
in your mind that letting an SI run human affairs is preferable to any 
arrangement of society humans might work out on their own?

I'll grant you that it will be different, but I've never been convinced that 
the world(s) that SIs might create would be "unimaginably" different from the 
one we know now.  Just as folks like Robin and Robert and Anders can take 
what seem to be the fundamental physical nature of reality and the basic 
structure of information theory and make rational projections of the nature 
and behavior of vastly more powerful minds, I think it might well be possible 
to make the same kind of informed speculation about what sorts of societies 
such entities might create.  Economics and game theory - and yes, even 
biology and history - provide some pretty powerful tools for addressing such 
issues.

I understand that you are deeply convinced that making an SI that basically 
"takes over" is the "one best way" forward to the future, but I'm not.  For 
the record, "taking over" is the part of which I'm not at all certain; not 
that "we" humans would be able to successfully oppose such a "take-over", but 
rather that it might be more difficult than you imagine to construct an 
effective SI that will WANT to "take over" human affairs.

Some observations about advocating "smashing" the status quo.  First, such 
rhetoric is inherently oppositional and confrontational.  To me, such 
rhetoric doesn't seem conducive to, for instance, attracting investment.  
Second, the use of such rhetoric seems to me to cultivate the kind of 
revolutionary mind-set that has, in the past at least, been ill-suited to 
seeing alternatives and fruitful contradictions.  Social revolutionaries tend 
to be single-minded, and single-mindedness doesn't lend itself to the 
scientific cast of mind that is open to new possibilities.  This is why the 
Hollywood "mad scientist" caricature has always seemed so unrealistic to me.

This statement smacks of Platonism to me, but I could be misled by your 
rhetoric and be missing some deeper truth in what you seem to be advocating 
as a social policy.  But consider the possibility that in fact we've already 
discerned some truths that make the kind of "completely obvious answer" to 
social and moral questions literally impossible.  

Again, I refer to Damien's post in this thread in which he referred to chaos 
and complexity theory.  In particular, consider the strong objections we can 
now make to the possibility of true omniscience (in the traditional religious 
sense) based on information theory: Any system capable of actually predicting 
the physical future course of the entire universe would itself have to be a 
physical information structure at least as complex as the universe itself, a 
contradiction in terms on the most fundamental level for two reasons.  First, 
on a purely logical basis, a universe-simulator would be part of the universe 
and would not be able to devote resources to both predicting the not-self 
parts of the universe and the part that makes up itself.  Second, on more 
practical physical grounds, such a system, constrained by the limits of 
light-speed, could not operate even a perfectly accurate model of the 
not-self parts of the universe at sufficient rates to make accurate 
predictions.

This abstract thought problem has important implications for what you seem to 
be advocating, which is to me just a technologically updated version of 
Plato's Republic, i.e. rule by "the best" or some AI-philosopher-king.  The 
most fundamental conflict in the ur-thought of Western political theory was 
between what might be called the basilica and the agora (to mix Latin and 
Greek metaphors), i.e. between rule by one or a few with superior knowledge 
and power on the one hand, and rule by the open, on-going adjustment of 
social relations by the inter-workings of all members of a society on the 
other hand.  This conflict has played itself out in every age and every 
society, in my opinion, and seems to me to be THE fundamental conflict in 
political science (and individual moral philosophy, for that matter).

This basic thema is at the heart of my objection to the "let the SI(s) 
decide" notion.  Yes, I can imagine an entity with vastly superior knowledge 
and power, but I cannot imagine one with PERFECT knowledge and power.  And it 
seems that any power with less than perfect knowledge and power is inferior 
to "the agora" as a means of governing the affairs of sentient beings.  Those 
matters in which the imagined SI-philosopher-king has imperfect knowledge and 
power will accumulate errors, inevitably.  And those accumulated errors will 
become the seeds of what, for want of a better word, I will call 
"unhappiness", that will grow and give birth to further "unhappinesses", 
cascading throughout whatever social system you can envision.  Whether you 
use the word "disutility" or "inefficiency" or "injustice", your super-ruler 
simply cannot KNOW enough to adjust EVERYTHING to some ideal state.  When one 
considers that the super-ruler will also have imperfect POWER, i.e. imperfect 
abilities to effectuate its goals, the problem only becomes more severe.

If you concede that the simple complexity of "society" (i.e. a world of 
multiple independent intentional actors) will inevitably overwhelm the 
abilities of even the most powerful super-duper-AI-philosopher-king, then I 
do not see how you can advocate the kind of AI-monarchy you seem to imagine.  
Borgism or the notion of a "Singleton" to use Nick Bostrom's term, doesn't 
resolve the problem, even if you were willing to advocate such a radical 
"solution": Doing so only moves into the realm of psychology for the 
Singleton what were previously social problems for a non-unitary being.

This is where I disagree with you, because I have studied the history of 
revolutions closely.  I know that you protest that the heart of your 
revolutionary "one best way" is fundamentally different from all of those 
that went before, but I honestly don't think so.  It may well be that 
"scientific socialism" was superior to the "divine right of kings" or Plato's 
"rule by the best" that went before, but tyranny, even benevolent tyranny, 
has within it a fundamental logical flaw that will track through to undermine 
even the most excellent super-duper-hyper-smart-mega-powerful-SI.  You - or 
an SI - can only "rule" the world for very brief times and, after all, with a 
very constrained definition of "the world".  Multiple intentional actors - be 
they citizens or agents within a single mind - can be "governed" but 
ultimately cannot be successfully "ruled", because any imaginable "ruler" 
simply cannot KNOW enough or DO enough to really RULE.

There are a growing number of online fora in which issues relating to 
transhumanist technologies are being discussed by non-transhumanists.  The 
"Insane Science" mailing list on Onelist (isml@onelist.com) is a good source 
of information and views posted by folks who, by and large, have a more 
fearful approach to the future.  (Many of the news items I post here about 
opposition to genetic technology come from there.) Another, about which I 
learned there and which I've just joined, relates to "genetic modification".  
A post to the "Insane Science" list about the "GM" list is reproduced below.  

I'd like to encourage diplomatic participation on these other lists by 
extropians and transhumanists, as this sort of activity is a good way to 
broaden knowledge about our views and develop a more positive attitude about 
the future.

Interesting corollary:

Heterocyclic carbon chemistry really doesn't get on well with elements
from the second transition metal series (or indeed most elements heavier
than iron). Sure there are a few enzymes that use vanadium or iron, but
in general heavy ions with lots of holes in their outer orbitals wreak
havoc on hydrogen bonds.

As successive generations of nucleosynthesis increases the proportion of
things like lead and uranium in the mix from which planetary systems
are formed, can we anticipate the closure of the "window" within which
terrestrial planets provide conditions suitable for the evolution
of carbon-chemistry based life? So we may not only be nearly the first
kids off the starting block, but not that far from the last generation
before the neighbourhood turns into a toxic waste dump.

The Atkins diet is an extremely low carb diet which throws your body into
a state called ketosis.  Here is a comment by Curt Adams from April 1998:

How was your experience on the diet?  Did you get very hungry?  How about
your overall levels of health and well-being?

I believe Eliezer is working from a model where there is something
called Absolute Morality, and SIs are smart enough to figure it out and
observe it.  Then, by definition, anything the SIs do is "better" than
whatever humans would work out.  Even if the SIs wipe out the human race
and destroy all life in the universe, that was "good" by the standards
of Absolute Morality.

In this model, SIs do not have goals of their own, hence there is no
danger that they will be selfishly motivated and take actions that
benefit themselves at the expense of humans.  In following the tenets
of Absolute Morality they will do whatever is Right.

I'm not sure if his argument works if there is no such thing as Absolute
Morality.  In that case it seems that there is a risk that SIs will
develop their own goals (just as we do) and that their actions will not
be beneficial to the human race.

The worst outcome would be if the SIs are programmed by Eliezer to have
as their only goal the search for the Holy Grail, that is, Absolute
Morality.  However, smart as they are, they still haven't found it.
They have to be smarter.  And to do that they have to turn all available
mass into SI computational elements, which means, regrettably, wiping out

Its an ongoing process, and the lighter elements are produced in
much greater abundances than the heavy elements.

Astronomy Today, Table 21-1, Cosmic Abundances (current era):
  Elemental Group                % abundance by number
  H                                     90
  He                                     9
  Li Group (7-11 (p+n))                  0.000001
  C group (12-20 (p+n))                  0.2
  Si group (23-48 (p+n))                 0.01
  Fe group (50-62 (p+n))                 0.01
  Middle wt. group (63-100 (p+n))        0.00000001
  Heavy wt. group (>100 (p+n))           0.000000001

Heavy stars (> 8 M_sun), have a layered structure (from the outside) of:
  H -> He -> C -> O -> Ne -> Mg -> Si -> Fe
Presumably much of the Fe gets dumped into the black holes or the
neutron star for lighter stars, but not all of it since some of it
gets released into the interstellar media.  Since these large
stars only have lives of millions to tens of millions of
years the interstellar dust gets enriched with the materials
of life *very* rapidly after the formation of the galaxy.

While the distinguishing feature between population I and II
stars tends to be their location and velocity (II are found
more in the halo and have higher velocities, probably due to
their being older and having had more change sling-shot
encounters), they also differ in metal content.  Pop. II stars
are very deficient in elements heavier than He, while Pop. I have
approximately solar abundances of metals.

So I would propose that almost all population I stars should
be potentially capable of forming planetary systems on which life
could evolve.

[Now, of course it goes without saying that the astronomers
would start pulling out their hair if one were to suggest
the population II stars aren't old, but are instead leftovers
from SI mining activities.]

N2 is an interesting element to look at for rarity, particulary
from the perspective of why you don't find much on Mars or Venus
(relative to say CO2).  On Mars, I can understand losing N2 before
CO2, but on Venus there ought to be a fair amount.

An article (Terraforming with Nanotechnology, JBIS, 47:311-318, 1994),
discusses this: "The availability of nitrogen seems to be the most
serious constraint on the eventual establishment of a completely
Earth-like environment on Mars."  [That and the complete dismantlement
of the planet....].  They also observe, "If underground stores of
nitrogen do exist on Mars, just what form they take is a mystery.
Nitrate minerals are one possible store.  Although nitrate minerals
do exist on earth, they are rare.  Due to their solubility they are only
found in the most arid regions of Earth such as the deserts of Chile.
Even though Mars is now in a desert state, its history as a water planet
makes the existence of large stores of nitrates doubtful."  [I'm not
sure why this would be true, if N2 gets locked up in soluble nitrates,
it would seem that it would be deposited as the H2O evaporates or
still be present in any frozen ice.]

This gets particularly interesting in light of the abundance of
elements in the solar system (from Physics & Chemistry of the
Solar System, J.S. Lewis, after Grevesse & Anders (1988)) and
Nanomedicine, Chapter 3, Table 3.1:
  Element      Solar Abundance  Atoms in Body
  H            2.8 x 10^10       4.22 x 10^27

  C            1.0 x 10^7        8.03 x 10^26
  N            3.1 x 10^6        3.9  x 10^25
  Fe           9.0 x 10^5        4.5  x 10^22
  S            5.2 x 10^5        2.6  x 10^24
  Ca           6.1 x 10^4        1.6  x 10^25
  Na           5.7 x 10^4        2.5  x 10^24
  P            1.0 x 10^4        9.6  x 10^24
  K            3.8 x 10^3        2.2  x 10^24

  Cu           5.2 x 10^2        7    x 10^20
  Se           6.2 x 10^1        3    x 10^18

At any rate, after going through the data entry and calculations...
  Relative body enrichment: P > K > Rb > Cl > Ca > Cd > Br ...
  Relative body depletion:  Cr < Ni < V < Co < Mn < Al < Se < Fe ...
  Relatively equivalent: C ~= O ~= I ~= Na ~= Zn ~= N
    (decreasing order but within a factor of 6.3 of each other)

I'll have to dig a little further to do the calculation relative
to the Earth's crustal or salt water abundances (which may make
more sense).

Of course, the ratios will probably vary from species to species,
particularly in widely separated branches of the animal & plant kingdoms.

Now, the interesting thing about most of the heavier elements
is that they are being used in small quantities for specific
purposes.  S gets used for disulfide bridges, P is used as an
energy carrier, Fe as an O2 carrier or catalyst, Zn as a
protein "cross-linker" (Zn-finger transcription factors)
and catalyst, Cu & Se as catalysts, etc.  I've never heard anyone
suggest that the heavier elements are *required* for life.  I've
given some thought to whether we could re-engineer life to remove
the metals (you especially want to remove Cu & Fe if you want to
minimize the free radical damage to DNA in the long term).
So far, I haven't come across any strong reasons why the
functions done by heavy "metals" in our body could not
replaced by protein only constructs.  I will admit that
you may suffer some reductions in reaction rates, but
it isn't clear that there are reactions that simply
"cannot" occur without the presence of metals.

So even though we require heavy metals (from supernovas)
it isn't clear that all forms of life must.  I suspect that
life gets started without using metals (other than HOCN)
and then incorporates them for specific functions.  To
use "heavy" metals effectively, you have to evolve
transport and storage management systems.  Given some
really big computers for molecular dynamics simulations,
I'm pretty sure we could rapidly develop proteins/enzymes
that did not require metals.

So, in solar systems where heavy metals are not as abundant
(very early population I stars) life might certainly evolve.
It might take longer, meaning it might take 5-6 billion years
instead of 4 billion, implying that it would want to occur
around a smaller, longer lived star, but those stars are
more abundant so overall, so things probably average out.
A more critical problem, IMO, is whether early population I
stars would have enough heavy material to form solid planets as
are found in our solar system.  If not, then you have to
discuss evolution of life on moons around gas giants or
on comets which rapidly gets highly speculative.

Precisely.  We had it on fairly good evidence that the moon
couldn't support life *as we know it*.  It is interesting to
wonder whether NASA has considered defense against contamination
by nanobots as something it should beware of on its upcoming
retreival missions or whether we are once again "assuming"

Not clear.  It is clear, at least for us, that the Earth got lucky
in that it got enough Uranium in the core to keep us hot enough
to allow plate tectonics to do carbon recycling (CO2 -> CaCO3
on the ocean bottom, gets subducted and rereleased as CO2
into the atmosphere), if you are smaller, you lose H2O from
the atmosphere faster (less gravity) and you lose plate tectonics faster
(less uranium & less insulating material preventing heat radiation),
so the CaCO3 gets deposited in sedimentary rocks and stays there
(so you lose C from the atmosphere and thus plant life).  On
the other side of the coin if you get too hot for oceans to
remain around, the CO2 remains in the atmosphere and you get
a runaway greenhouse effect.  Mars & Venus provide us with
excellent examples of near-misses on chances for life to evolve.

So, as you accumulate Uranium, you are going to have planets
that remain volcanic for longer which is probably a good thing.
Life can clearly evolve to be radiation tolerant, so the radiactivity
isn't really a show stopper (within limits).  I suspect the increasing
uranium abundance provides an interesting sliding window of planetary
sizes and "planetary life zones" (insolation+atmosphere composition
leading to liquid water).  More uranium, probably gives smaller
planets a longer window to crank up life.

We know we have planets (27 outside the solar system, is the most
recent number I think), what we don't know is the size distribution
and orbits because we have a selection effect for big planets with
small orbits.

It sounds speculative to me.  I'd place my bets on the evolution
of life being willing to take advantage of *any* free energy
resource and Uranium certainly provides that.  It could be
that really "hot" planets allow you to do away with the star
entirely!

I haven't really been reading this post, but this is a problem I've thought
about a lot. It seems like anything in the realm of "is" is a real fact
about reality, with physical manifestations which can be measured and
verified. From more basic facts, we can use rational methods to derive more
complicated facts. On the "ought" side, there is no physical manifestation
of moral facts. If it is perfectly moral to kill innocent people, every
quark and lepton will still be in the same place and have the same charge as
it would in a world where it is immoral to kill innocent people (aside: this
is kind of similar to the problem of consciousness). I guess moral facts are
"virtual facts" in a certain way. I realized the other day, that in the same
way of real facts, these "virtual facts" can be reasoned about the same way:
start with basic moral premises, and use rational methods to arrive at more
complicated facts. Suppose it is immoral to kill a living being, and suppose
than an animal is a living being, it would follow logically that it was
immoral to kill an animal. The difference in "is" versus "ought" then,
reaches down to the premises. I'm not sure if "discovereing" underlying
moral premises present a special problem apart from discovering underlying
physical premises.
Incidentally, people often try to explain the basis of moral facts by
appealing to evolutionary principals: traits such as killing innocent people
for fun and without guilt were weeded out because this trait is detrimental
to survival. This line of argumentation misses the point. It may be (and
most likely is) the case that certain moral facts are hard-coded in our
brains because they give us survival advtantage, but this is a completely
different issue from whether these facts are objectively true or not.
Believing something can give you a survival advantage even when such beliefs
are false.
I'm reviewing this and finding things which I'm not sure I mean to say. It's
a very complicated issue.

Aw heck, thats nothing.  I lost 80 pounds in 3 days.  Found a matchbook, said
"LOSE WEIGHT!  1 dollar a pound.  555-2345."  So I called, she said "Yes sir,
how much would you like to lose?"   Figuring it was a scam and not wanting to
risk
more than ten bucks, I says "ten pounds."  She says "Very well, sir, put a check

for 10 dollars in the mail, and we will send out our 10 pound representative at
8 oclock in the morning."  So I did and 8 the next morning the doorbell rings
and when I opened the door there stands this fetching brunette, nekkid as the
day she's born!  She said nothing, just handed me a card, which read:  If you
can catch me, you can have me.  So I started chasing, chasing, chasing, caught
her, had her, stepped on the scale, 10 pounds lighter!  Called back, said:
"I wanna lose 20 pounds!"  She says "Very well, sir, put a check for 20 dollars
in the mail, and we will send out our 20 pound representative at 8 oclock in the

morning."  8 the next morning the doorbell rings and when I opened the door
there stands this stunning gorgeous blonde, nekkid as the day she's born!  This
one was *twice* as comely as the 10 pound representative, hands me a card, If
you can catch me you can have me, but she was also twice as fast as Miss 10
Pounds, so i started chasing chasing chasing, and then chasing chasing chasing,
finally caught her, had her, lost 20 more pounds!  So I was *really* excited
then!  Called back, said I wanna lose 50 pounds!  She says "Sir, 50 pounds is
a lot of weight to lose in one day..."  I says "I dont care!  The check is in
the
mail, now send out your 50 pound representative at 0800!"  Next morning I
get up real early, shower, cologne, rose in the teeth and running shoes only,
0800, the doorbell rings.  I go open it up and there stands a 400 pound gorilla,

nekkid as the day he was born.  Hands me a card:  If I catch you, Im gonna

Goodness! I had no idea there's that much nitrogen about.
I thought stellar processes made far more O than N 
(O = C + He)  I assume it's mostly in the gas giants, right?

Since N is mostly atmospheric on the inner planets, one good asteroid smack
can get rid of it all.  CO2 will be replaced by outgassing, but not N.

The best reason is that after 4 billion years of evolution, about 1/2 our 
enzymes
depend on bound metals.  This is true even for organisms evolving under metal
limitation (e.g., Fe in the ocean).  Clearly it's quite tough to ditch the 
metals.

I think metals were key to the origin of life.  Life depends on a web of 
oxidation-
reduction reactions; organic catalysts of such reactions are highly tuned and
not plausible abiotically.  Metals, with their multiple valence states, make 
great
less-specific catalysts.  In cases where both metal and non-metallic catalysts
do the same job, the metal appears to be the basal state.  For example, 
cytochrome p450 has a Fe-S protein transfering electrons in the basal state;
a few derived versions (including eukaryotic versions) use FAD(H) to transfer.

Fe-S complexes are very common in life and a very good abiotic system for
catalyzing redox reactions since they can absorb mutliple electrons, one at 
a time, by valence and conformational shifts.  Wachterhauser has proposed
Fe-S abiotic catalysis as the basis of living metabolism.

How could anyone be "pretty sure" of this outcome?  We really don't know.

Life is a rate-based process.  At its origin, the indirect catalysis of life 
(enzyme
makes enzyme makes ... does process) would have had to "outcompete" abiotic
processes for access to thermodynamic disequilibrium in the environment.
Slow enough and it would certainly lose.  We have no idea what the limits are,
but it's certainly possible that our own abiogenesis "barely made it".

Would you be so kind to make a pirouette? I ought to feel the

Dear Damien,

I don't really regard the heliocentricity of our Solar System as a "great"
"truth" -- I find it rather trivial --a bore, actually. Recall that Sherlock
Holmes was of this opinion exactly.

On the other hand, "wave-particle duality" (Scroedinger & Heisenberg)
and "The Principle of Complementarity" (Bohr) help make life interesting,
don't you think?

2 points:

 1.) Having certain restrictions might be a spur to
the AI to find alternative harmelss solutions to a
problem;

 2.) The freedom of the AI to develop must be balanced
with the possible effects on humans. Speaking
selfishly, I'd plump for the latter party.

Fair enough - but it was long regarded as one by certain powerful
authorities and paradigm-enforcers. 

What constitutes a great truth is certainly constrained by local opinion,
so moving to a different locality can change it. But I do not think that
sort of epistemological relativity can ever make it helpful to regard A and
not-A as simultaneously true. 

On the other hand, we often find that what we'd supposed to be a neat case
of A is actually a blend of X, D and 42, so what we'd have supposed to be a
simple existential opposition with not-A is far more complicated. But that
would make Bohr's dictum something like `The contrary of a given attempt to
resolve a great puzzle also sometimes has great effectiveness or apparent
validity', which I'd readily ascribe to. 

That might sound as if I counsel trading-in a pretty maxim for a clumsy
paraphrase, but I don't think so. The difference has something to do with
treating the central issue not as one of `a truth' but rather as `a puzzle'.

I don't, actually, but of course I lack the mathematical expertise to make
a grounded judgement. Certainly there are many theorists who regard this
wishy-washy Yin/Yang model as a historical obstacle to clearer
understanding of QT.

A most excellent compromise; and the substitution of "puzzle" for "a truth"
is consistent with my own quirky and largely unintelligible epistemology. I
think your use of an integer is treading on thin ice, however.

Why is it, after all this time, Occidentals are still Admiral George Dewey
steaming into Manilla Bay flying an enormous, tasteless flag announcing
"The Doctrine of Manifest Destiny"?  The Oriental notion of "T'ai-chi" is
a metaphor -- rather like the String or Quantum microcosm:

                            The Way itself is like some thing
                            Seen in a dream, elusive, evading one.
                            In it are images, elusive, evading one.
                            In it are things like shadows in twilight.
                            In it are essences, subtle but real,
                            Embedded in truth.

Metaphors, like analogies in general, perform communications functions
of which literal descriptive prose or abstract symbolic notation are
incapable.  Orientals are masters at the use of ambiguities to evoke
complex meanings (c.f. Haiku).  This I think, Damien, is the right word--
"ambiguous", not "wishy-washy", in the same sense that "turbulence"
is ambiguous with respect to predictability, but not wishy-washy, or
the specification of the location of an electron if we measure its
momentum is not "wishy-washy", simply ambiguous.

Thanks for writing,

Bob

As I mentioned in a post earlier today, I've been participating in other fora 
in which transhumanist technologies are discussed by an audience that 
includes people not committed to the transhumanist agenda.  The following are 
a couple of posts I've made to the "Insance Science Mailing List" in response 
to fears about and outright opposition to transhumanist goals.

This is a crucial distinction, and one that needs to be addressed much more 
forcefully in discussions about "the future".  Far too often there is an 
unstated assumption that there will only be "one future", especially in 
journalistic discussions of new developments in science and technology, but 
also and much more importantly in the political and ideological formulation 
of policy regarding innovation.

It's crucial that people have a choice and that their choices be informed.  
This is much more important than the impact of any one scientific or 
technological advance.  Unfortunately, people who are opposed to advanced 
biotechnology and other technologies that address fundamental questions of 
"personhood" too often make the rhetorical assumption that the question of 
whether ANY person should be able to explore and employ that technology is 
really the question of whether ALL should be FORCED to use that technology.  

This rhetorical tactic, employed by Jeremy Rifkin, the mainstream "bioethics" 
community and the greens generally, creates an atmosphere of fear about the 
future and is based on a fundamentally negative view of people's ability to 
make choices for themselves.  It is usually accompanied by a litany of 
techno-disasters from history, from Easter-Island to the pollution of 
Victorian England.  But it is an essentially anti-democratic view, premised 
on the assumption that some environmental elite knows best what's good for 
the world and that people can't be trusted to do what's good or right.

I know that this comment was intended to be humorous, but I ask why 
"progress" should be seen to be moving in any ONE direction.  Wouldn't the 
best thing be to take a lesson from nature and open up the future to maximum 
diversity?  Just as healthy ecosystems have lots of different organisms and 
systems of interacting organisms, all pursuing different paths of growth and 
development, shouldn't a healthy approach to the future be one in which we 
minimize the constraints on innovation and minimize the tyranny that any one 
way of living can impose on others?  No one should HAVE TO adopt any 
particular technology, but shouldn't we all be as free as possible to pursue 
what we each see as our own best interest?

Surely this isn't true of all "new technology".  "Technology" includes things 
like writing and pigments used in painting.  These were once new, and yet the 
ability to create visual art and to record our experiences and share them 
with writing have certainly been good things, on balance.  Of course 
technology enhances our "ability to do evil", but it also just as surely 
enhances our ability to do good.  Technology, per se, isn't a question of 
good or evil.

As for changing human nature, well, at a realistic level of abstraction, 
tools like law and democratic governance are actually a form of "technology". 
 Such tools do not change human nature, it's true, but they do allow us to 
govern ourselves so that we do more good than harm in our lives in society.  
Beyond this, perhaps changing those parts of human nature that we aren't so 
fond of, such as aggressive xenophobia, might be a good thing, if we could do 
it.

Perhaps this was said when agriculture granted sufficient leisure time for 
people to devote more of their energies to the arts.  I can imagine 
traditionalists condemning such frivolity as painting or sculpture or poetry 
or spending time wondering about how the world works outside the bounds of 
the tribe's age-old myths.

I don't disagree that TV as we have known it has been a "pacifying" 
technology that discouraged individual thought and initiative.  I am no fan 
of American "TV Culture" - it is indeed a "great wasteland.".  But consider 
that the cultural phenomenon of TV as we have known it was based on one-way 
broadcast of only a few channels of "information" that required such a large 
capital investment and infrastructure that it was dominated by a few very 
large and homogenous commercial interests.  

The Internet is creating a whole new cultural milieu of "many-to-many" 
communication, the results of which we haven't even begun to see yet.  As 
McLuhan pointed out long ago, each medium has its own cultural logic and 
"message".  The civilization we are likely to create with ubiquitous, 
broadband digital communication will certainly be very different from the one 
that briefly flourished during the short time that narrow, broadcast 
television reigned supreme.  Consider that great portions of the human race 
will never even experience that cultural period: They will go straight from 
essentially premodern communication media to a world of ubiquitous 
telecommunications.

I also think it is a mistake to idealize earlier eras of culture.  During all 
of previous human history and for the overwhelming majority of human beings 
who have ever lived, "culture" consisted of an extremely narrow "unicultural" 
oral tradition.  Most human beings have never known any reality outside of 
their village or tribe or any culture other than the one passed on to them 
from their parents.  I doubt seriously whether you would favorably compare 
the mentality of, say a European peasant from mediaeval times or a Neolithic 
hunter-gatherer to the way you have described a modern American "couch

I agree that powerful VR will have significant cultural impact - much of it 
perhaps negative in many ways for many people.  On the other hand, VR and 
even more advanced media will also allow us to create new art forms we can 
barely even imagine now and will enable us to live incredibly rich mental 
lives.  I long to walk through the streets of ancient Rome and soar through 
the skies of Mars.  VR will make this possible.

That there will be mistakes doesn't mean we shouldn't try, does it?  When the 
first arched masonry bridge collapsed, did the Romans throw up their hands 
and say "That's it, no more arched masonry bridges for us!"  When an early 
campfire got out of control and burned a Neolithic campsite, did our 
ancestors decide that fire was just too dangerous to use?  Rocket engines are 
tricky things and sometimes they fail with horrible results, but we've been 
to the moon and, unless we lose our nerve, we'll never be confined to this 
planet again.

It's true that we're just learning about how the genomes of complex organisms 
give rise to the wonders of life.  But we're also making immense strides in 
bioinformatics on the one hand and the science of understanding and designing 
complex information structures in many media on the other.  Just as one 
example, I know of research that's being done in the creation of simple 
artificial chromosomes that promise to bring cures for diseases such as 
sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis.  This technology looks to be 
deployable within five years.  Should we turn away from the prospect of 
defeating such scourges because some other genetic modifications might have 
unintended consequences?  To me, that's like saying that because there are 
occasional accidents in the system that controls traffic on London's rail 
system we shouldn't try to put computer-controlled air-bag systems into cars.

The petrochemical industry has been employing genetically modified bacteria 
to assist in cleaning up oil spills for over a decade.  "Jurassic Park" 
notwithstanding, it IS possible to create beneficial genetically modified 
organisms that do useful work "in the wild".  Every time you drink a beer, 
you're enjoying the fruits of biotechnology.  The "wild" ecosystem of yeasts 
has been impacted by brewers work in selective breeding of beneficial 
organisms for hundreds, if not thousands of years.  Just because the picture 
of a mutant gene-machine makes for a thrilling science fiction plot device 
doesn't mean that the technology can't be employed responsibly to achieve 
good results.

I don't think this is correct - these sciences and technologies are not based 
on the "premise that we understand how everything works" by any means.  Our 
knowledge of the world has incrementally increased over the millennia and 
will continue to improve.  It's true that our knowledge HAS crossed some 
important thresholds in the current era, as it has in the past.  And, as has 
happened when thresholds have been crossed before, we can expect fundamental 
social change to come in the wake of the increased power of our tools.  The 
development of the printing press brought such a quantum leap in the 
relatively recent past, as did the harnessing of mechanical and chemical 
power not long afterward.  Before that, the development of settled 
agriculture brought equally basic changes.  But non-human nature also 
undergoes great and fundamental changes.  We and the biological world we now 
know are the result of such phase-shifts in nature: The Cambrian explosion, 
the Cretaceous-Tertiary impact.  More local changes have had profound impacts 
on nature: The entire Pacific Northwest of North America was completely 
resculpted in relatively recent geologic time in just a few days when a 
massive ice-dam broke and an inland sea rushed out through the Columbia river 
basin.  

Such great changes are part of nature and life.  I don't doubt that we are 
living in a time of great change.  But life is change.

The thought of the ARM has always chilled me to the bone (pun intended).  And 
remember the ultimate moral of the larger story in Niven's universe: Humanity 
was seriously threatened when it first encountered a competing species in his 
"future history", because the cultural habit of innovation had been dulled by 
the ARM's suppression of new technologies.

That's what we - and millions of other people - are doing, in a global 
discussion of the impact that innovation will have on our lives.  The culture 
of science is inherently open, for reasons that are well understood: 
Innovation can only flourish in an environment of open discussion and 
criticism.  The problem, as I see it, is that too many people see 
technological innovation as "everyone or no one".  As I stated in another 
post earlier today, isn't the healthiest approach to allow innovation and 
individual experimentation; to create an environment where maximal diversity 
is encouraged?  People should be free to embrace or reject new technologies 
as they see fit.

The doctors and biotech researchers I know have a deep respect for the 
complexity of living systems and a deeply ethical and cautious approach to 
work that impacts the quality of human life.  Despite the Hollywood 
caricature of the "mad scientist", I don't know of a single proposal for real 
biomedical research that isn't premised on cautious, incremental development 
with a constant eye to the ethical implications of research.

("Objective morality" or "external morality", not "Absolute Morality".)

I've been thinking about that.  It seems to me like blindly persisting
in the pursuit of a goal that's obviously unachievable is a dumb thing
to do.  Programming an intelligence that's smart enough *not* to do so
may thus be a morally and programmatically stable proposition; i.e., the
AI will never look at the source code and say "That's a stupid coercion."

I've been tentatively considering the idea of "intelligence" as the
fundamental grounding point of an AI goal system, rather than the idea
of objective morality.  Or rather, making "intelligence" the grounding
point until such time as an instantiation of objective morality is
discovered, at which point the intelligent thing to do may be to switch
to an objectively based system.  But meanwhile, the system would try to
act intelligently.  Why the switch?  Mostly because I don't have enough
confidence in my own visualization of "objective morality" to be sure
that I can tell the AI what to look for.  

There may even be a place here for a set of suggestions as to what the
AI should do in a default case, or a set of suggestions that gets used
if the objective morality can be created to specification or accepts
seed data or whatever.  How do *I* know it won't?  Still, even the
suggestions would be extremely dangerous; how could I ground them in
external reality?  And how do I define what intelligent behavior is? 
And if SIs take dictation, what about the Fermi Paradox?

Sometimes I think that what I need isn't a fully self-swallowing answer,
but a set of clues that are stable and overlapping and open enough to
let a real intelligence find vis own answers.  Because the more I think
about it, the more I wonder if I'm asking the right questions.

Unless the motives of an SI are subject to arbitrary configuration or
insanity, which would theoretically allow a sufficiently stupid person
to create an eternal hell-world, then I am sure beyond the point where
caveats are necessary.  In practice, I'm sure enough that you can rip my

I've just finished reading Greg Egan's _Diaspora_.  What really struck
me was just how *human* all the characters were, despite their
autopotence and exoselves and so on.  They had human emotions, and human
stupidities, and never really displayed a flash of anything beyond.

Sure, Sandberg and Hanson and co. can argue all they want.  But ask
yourself this question:  Even if Greg Egan is completely right, even if
Sandberg and Hanson and company are completely right, would *anyone* in
the 19th century have seen it coming?  Not "could", in theory:  "Would",
in practice.  Because here we are, in practice, and I don't think it's
plausible that this is the very first generation in all of history to
understand what all the factors are.

I'm not going to second-guess the SI.  I believe that the SI will do
whatever I would do if I was only intelligent enough to see the
necessity.  I don't know what the motives of SI may be, but I identify
with SIs, as a child might identify with vis adult self.

I don't mean it that way.  I mean it in the sense of, say, dropping a
16-ton weight on an eggshell.  No fighting.  No fuss.  No violence.  No
human-level social connotations at all.  Just an irresistable force and
a small squishing noise.

Maybe.  There are limits to how much time I'm willing to spend worrying

Again, I think that once again we have the basic divide between "life
goes on" and "walking into the unknowable".  I am not advocating a
social policy.  I am not advocating anything human, and the whole
concept of "social policy" is a very human thing.

I disagree.  I don't think we've discerned much of anything.  Even I
have nothing but a set of ways to detect anthropomorphisms.  When it
comes to positive statements - hell, I don't even know what causality
really is, so how am I supposed to understand goals?

Remember, I'm a noncomputationalist.  The only honest answer I can give

Yes, but there wasn't even the theoretical possibility, at any point, of
rule by anyone other than Cro-Magnons.  And Cro-Magnons are,
universally, evolved to contain special-purpose cognitive rules for
reasoning about politics, with little hidden traps that cause every
person to believe ve is the superior philosopher-king and fail to be
one.  It's all entirely explicable in terms of evolutionary psychology. 
And within that Integrated Causal Model, within that greater model of
the Universe that contains and explains fifty thousand years of failure,
we have every reason to believe that AIs will be on the outside.

Unless the initial programming makes a difference, in which case all
bets are off.

I can, but never mind.  Why is perfection necessary?  I'll take 99.99%

Fine.  Let's say the SI is programmed to simulate an enlightened,

Once an error becomes large enough for humans to perceive, it is large
enough for any SI remotely worthy of the phrase to notice and correct.

I mean, why doesn't this whole argument prove that thermostats will
never match a free democracy that votes whether or not to turn the

Even supposing this to be true, an SI could easily attain a high enough
resolution to prevent any humanly noticeable unhappiness from
developing.  I mean, let's say you upload the whole human race.  Now it
runs on the mass of a basketball.  If the SI can use the rest of the
Earth-mass to think about that one basketball, I guarantee you it can
attain a perceptual granularity a lot better than that of the humans
running on it.

What complexity?  Just because it looks complex to you doesn't mean that
it's complex to the SI.  I occasionally get flashes of the level on
which human minds are made up of understandable parts, and believe me,
society is a lot less complex than that.  Less communications bandwidth
between the elements.

Is this a true argument?
Would it be obvious to a sufficiently intelligent being?
Then what will happen, in your visualization, is that I create an SI,
and it adopts Greg Burch's personal philosophy and does exactly what you
want it to for exactly the reasons you cited.

I really can't lose.

In my view, one of the strongest arguments for objective morality is the
existence of qualia.  It shows that the Universe can be made to contain
weirder stuff than objectively existent goals.  If you can take complex,
fundamentally subjective facets of cognition and turn them into
objectively existent qualia, why can't you do the same thing with goals?
 It would appear to be a lot simpler, on the surface at least.  In fact,
given the qualia of pleasure, one could make a good case that it's
happened already.

Precisely.

If you haven't done so already, I strongly suggest you check out the

I haven't gotten the Nov. 26 Science yet so I want to thank  Eliezer for
breaking this electrifying news. Skeptics of Nanotechnology loved to
point out that although we've been able to move individual atoms for
several years we haven't been able to do chemistry at that scale,
well now we can. Eliezer, I'm starting to think that if you want AI to
arrive before Nanotechnology you're really going to have to move into
high gear.

Suppose the existence of objective morality is Turing unprovable, that means
it exists so you'll never find a counterexample to show it doesn't but it also
means you'll never find a proof (a demonstration in a finite number of steps)
to show that it does. A moralist who designs a AI and gives the investigation
of this problem priority over everything else will send the machine into a infinite loop.
To make maters worse, you may not even be able to prove it's futile, that the issue
is either false or true but unprovable, so I don't think it would be wise to hardwire
a AI to keep working on any problem until an answer is found.

Well, it is fair to ask then why you included two despised philosophers
in your list?

Then there are always inconvenient facts illustrated by the following:

Gottfried Leibnitz, German Philosopher, published his theory of the
infinitesimal calculus in October, l684, whereas Newton published his
calculus in 1704.  While they were essentially identical, Liebnitz's
notation was much more convenient, and that is why we still use
it, rather than Newton's, today.  At the time, Leibnitz was credited
for the invention of the calculus, which would have been just as
useful to the world if Newton had never discovered it.

Immanuel Kant, German Philosopher (1724-1804), was the originator
of what we today called "The Nebular Hypotheses", which offers an
explanation of the formation of the Solar System, i.e. the Solar System
formed, according to Kant, from a rotating gaseous nebula that slowly
contracted and condensed.  Pierre Laplace (1749-1827), French math-
ematical astronomer, further developed Kant's idea, in 1796, when it
became known as "the nebular hypothesis".

When, J.R., do you suppose this guild -- or should I say siege --
mentality of science vs. everyone else end?

I've had some more time to think about this.

I think the direction of research is that, the picture for what we
_used to think_ (say 10 years ago) for dust producing stars/etc is
changing. For example, Supernovae used to _not_ be thought of as a
heavy dust producer, but it looks like they produce a lot more dust
than we thought. (At least that's what I got out of the lecture a
couple of days ago.)

Also, there is plenty of evidence now that supernovae had an important
role in the formation of our solar system because of the physical
properties (shock fronts etc.) of the "bubbles" in our local
interstellar cloud that surround our solar system, and also because of
measurements of minerals in presolar grains of meterorites that could
only be formed by r,s,p processes in late-evolution stars.

The models of stellar evolution are probably OK, maybe some tweaking
in the concepts of grain formation..

And we know that dust cannot simply condense out of the gas in the
interstellar medium because the density and temperatures are not
right.

The ISO observations of the amount of dust in our Galaxy being off by
about a factor 100 from what the scientists count (currently) as dust
sources is a problem.

The other observations that are off by a factor 10, may not be so
worrisome, because the discrepancy is possibly in the error bars, and
a factor of 10 off in astronomy is sometimes OK ;-)

I should direct you to a newly-published paper (1 Nov 1999, ApJ) that
gives a large overview of this topic. "

"Dust in the Local Interstellar Wind" by P. Frisch and a large list of
authors. She is an expert on our local interstellar medium and the
relationships between our local bubble and our Solar System.

                                  Abstract

The gas-to-dust mass ratios found for interstellar dust within the solar
system, versus values determined astronomically for the cloud around the
solar system, suggest that large and small interstellar grains have separate
histories and that large interstellar grains preferentially detected by
spacecraft are not formed exclusively by mass exchange with nearby
interstellar gas. Observations by the Ulysses and Galileo satellites of the
mass spectrum and flux rate of interstellar dust within the heliosphere are
combined with information about the density, composition, and relative flow
speed and direction of interstellar gas in the cloud surrounding the solar
system to derive an in situ value for the gas-to-dust mass ratio,
R<SUB>g/d</SUB>=94<SUP>+46</SUP><SUB>-38</SUB>. This ratio is dominated by
the larger near-micron-sized grains. Including an estimate for the mass of
smaller grains, which do not penetrate the heliosphere owing to charged
grain interactions with heliosheath and solar wind plasmas, and including
estimates for the mass of the larger population of interstellar
micrometeorites, the total gas-to-dust mass ratio in the cloud surrounding
the solar system is half this value. Based on in situ data, interstellar
dust grains in the 10<SUP>-14</SUP> to 10<SUP>-13</SUP> g mass range are
underabundant in the solar system, compared to a Mathis, Rumple, & Nordsiek
mass distribution scaled to the local interstellar gas density, because such
small grains do not penetrate the heliosphere. The gas-to-dust mass ratios
are also derived by combining spectroscopic observations of the gas-phase
abundances in the nearest interstellar clouds. Measurements of interstellar
absorption lines formed in the cloud around the solar system, as seen in the
direction of &epsi; CMa, give
R<SUB>g/d</SUB>=427<SUP>+72</SUP><SUB>-207</SUB> for assumed solar reference
abundances and R<SUB>g/d</SUB>=551<SUP>+61</SUP><SUB>-251</SUB> for assumed
B star reference abundances. These values exceed the in situ value
suggesting either that grain mixing or grain histories are not correctly
understood or that sweptup stardust is present. Such high values for diffuse
interstellar clouds are strongly supported by diffuse cloud data seen toward
&lambda; Sco and 23 Ori, provided B star reference abundances apply. If
solar reference abundances prevail, however, the surrounding cloud is seen
to have greater than normal dust destruction compared to higher column
density diffuse clouds. The cloud surrounding the solar system exhibits
enhanced gas-phase abundances of refractory elements such as Fe<SUP>+</SUP>
and Mg<SUP>+</SUP>, indicating the destruction of dust grains by shock
fronts. The good correlation locally between Fe<SUP>+</SUP> and
Mg<SUP>+</SUP> indicates that the gas-phase abundances of these elements are
dominated by grain destruction, while the poor correlation between
Fe<SUP>+</SUP> and H<SUP>0</SUP> indicates either variable gas ionization or
the decoupling of neutral gas and dust over parsec scale lengths. These
abundances, combined with grain destruction models, indicate that the
nearest interstellar material has been shocked with shocks of velocity ~150
km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. If solar reference abundances are correct, the low
R<SUB>g/d</SUB> value toward &lambda; Sco may indicate that at least one
cloud component in this direction contains dust grains that have retained
their silicate mantles and are responsible for the polarization of the light
from nearby stars seen in this general region. Weak frictional coupling
between gas and dust in nearby low density gas permit inhomogeneities to be
present.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                         November 24, 1999

JPL MARS MICROMISSION CONTRACTOR SELECTED FOR NEGOTIATION 

     NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has selected Ball Aerospace 
& Technologies Corp., Boulder, Colo., for negotiations as the 
spacecraft contractor on the Mars Micromission -- the first in a 
series of small, low-cost piggyback missions to send science 
probes, instruments and communication relay satellites to the red 
planet. 

     The contract will be negotiated over the next two months and 
is contingent on funding approval by NASA for the Mars 
Micromission Project.  This decision is expected by February 
2000.

     The Mars Micromission Project is planning to launch a series 
of a small 220-kilogram (485-pound) low-cost spacecraft to Mars 
as piggyback payloads on the French  Ariane 5 rocket when it 
launches commercial communication satellites into an Earth-based 
geosynchronous transfer orbit. From Earth orbit, the Mars 
Micromission spacecraft will use on-board propulsion and an 
innovative trajectory involving Lunar and Earth flybys to send 
the spacecraft on the proper trajectory to Mars. The launch 
services will be provided through the NASA partnership with the 
French space agency, Centre National D'Etudes Spatiales (CNES), 
at no cost to NASA. Launch of the first Mars Micromission 
spacecraft is planned for spring of 2003 from the Ariane launch 
facilities in Kourou, French Guiana. 

     The design of the Mars Micromission spacecraft is based on a 
common spacecraft bus concept, which can be configured to deliver 
one or more science probes to the Martian atmosphere or carry 
extra propellant for orbit insertion into Mars orbit. The 2003 
Mars Micromission would be a communication/navigation orbiter, 
the first of a constellation of Mars-orbiting satellites that 
would make up the Mars Network.  The Mars
Network is intended to dramatically increase the data returned to 
Earth from future landed or orbiting Mars missions by providing 
efficient relay communications, while also providing navigation 
capabilities like those of the Global Positioning Satellite 
system.

     "The combination of the common spacecraft design and the 
piggyback launch is essential to achieve the Mars Micromission 
Project goals of frequent low-cost access to Mars," said David 
Lehman, the JPL project manager for the Mars Micromission. "We 
plan to be able to launch at least two Mars Micromission 
spacecraft during every Mars opportunity, about every two years. 
About half of these spacecraft are expected to carry out focused 
science investigations selected through competition, while the 
other half will be used to build up the Mars Network of 
communication relay and navigation satellites." 

     The Mars Micromission Project is managed by JPL for NASA's 
Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C., as part of the ongoing 
Mars Surveyor Program. The purpose of the Mars Micromission is to 
increase the quality and quantity of the science and technology 
data from the Mars Surveyor Program.  JPL is a division of the 
California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, Calif.

Amara, I presume the ISO observations to which you refer are the
measurements of IR from diffuse background dust.  A few questions:
 - Is this IR *known* to be primarily from the local dust cloud,
   the rest of the galaxy, or some combination of both?
 - If from the local cloud, what are the estimates for the
   temperature of the cloud as a whole?
   [This has an impact on where SIs decide to live in the long run.
    Will humanity need to construct (or move) its SI to some other location
    to achieve the best thermodynamic efficiency, have the best telescope
    conditions, etc.?  This of course goes back to why the Dark Matter
    (if SIs) would be in the halo, which I've assumed to be a radiation
    avoidence strategy.  It may be more for thermodynamic and/or observational
    reasons.]
 - Does the article you mention (or other sources) breakdown the dust
   abundance into actual particle masses and *densities*?
   [The densities are important because they impact on the speed
   at which interstellar travel can occur.  The current literature
   seems fairly conflicting on whether interstellar probes, particularly
   nanoprobes lacking extensive shielding, can survive gas or dust impacts
   at speeds like 0.1c.]
 - After a star forms within a dust cloud, how long does it typically
   remain in the dust cloud, i.e. does it ever orbit out of or
   blow the dust cloud away?
   
Also, could you provide a little interpretation of the gas/dust ratio value?
Is this this an atom[molecule]/dust grain # abundance or is it a mass ratio?

It is worth noting that none of the [primary] papers that I have seen
regarding interstellar colonization and/or the Fermi Paradox seems to
have been concerned with the hazards posed by interstellar gas & dust.
I would expect that the gas/dust ratio in the galaxy should over time decline.
The gas, if dominated by uncharged molecules, could not easily be repelled
by magnetic methods.  On the other hand if much of the dust carries a charge
it might be more easily pushed out of the way.  [If I've got this really
wrong, someone please correct me.]  So it may be that interstellar travel
is easy early in galactic history but gets progressively more difficult.
(Of course the argument could be reversed if the gas hitting you is like
raindrops, and the dust hitting you is like cannonballs).

Thanks,
Robert

No way do we develop our own goals. If an "intelligent" chess program
devises a move that will result in a piece being taken, it may seem that the
program has spontaneously decided to take the piece. It has not. It is
following it's program to win the game, this is it's root motivation, and it
is far from free - it was strictly defined by the game creator and is
therefore completely invariable.
Our base motivations are also strictly defined and completely invariable.
Any action we devise to fulfil these goals, is just that - an intelligent
system devising a method of achieving the strictly defined goals.
And as for absolute morality - the concept is utterly meaningless. Just make
an attempt to decompose it. You will fail. It's abstract symbolic concept
does not have a counterpart outside of our minds.

I think this is certainly true.  The study of history is, of course, the 
study of records from the past.  About some periods we have copious records, 
about others, almost none.  I often think about the info-glut that will face 
historians of our period.  People (or whatever) will certainly want to know 
what happened in our time, but likely most people won't be able to devote the 
time and resources that will be required to sift through the original 
documents.  Thus:

It seems this will be more true than ever with the huge amounts of 
information available to historians of ours and future eras.  It is possible 
even for a well-read amateur to master the main corpus of important source 
documents for, say, key periods of classical Greek and Roman history - I've 
read much of that body of literature myself.  But imagine what would be 
considered to be the "important" literature from the 20th century even, much 
less the 21st!  Even the important 18th century is really beyond the ability 
of an amateur to master: We have to depend on the selections - and therefore 
the interpretations -- of professional historians.

And, of course, there IS a process by which accurate condensers and 
interpreters come to be seen as expert and reliable, and it is essentially 
the same as that employed in the hard sciences: Peer review over time.  1800 
years of critical review have shown Suetonius to have been largely accurate - 
if a little overdramatic in some places.

I don't think so.  The very selection process required by the larger body of 
primary source material will make it correspondingly more important to have 
reliable interpreters of data.

I often think about this as an interesting possibility for historians in a 
future with powerful AI.  It also provides the basis for an interesting 
science fiction plot - imagine an academic "Hitler simulator" that manages to 
escape the boundaries of his simulated environment!

This is already being done, as you say, to a limited extent.  There is a 
growing industry supporting the provision of "mock trials" in which legal 
conflict is simulated under more or less rigorous circumstances.

There is certainly an analog of the Hippocratic Oath in the practice of law 
in the Anglo-American system, that being the ethics codes propounded by the 
various bar associations and regulatory agencies.  The specific code 
governing my own professional conduct, along with its interpreting commentary 
and case law, fills a large bookshelf.  The subject is of such vital 
importance that large firms such as mine have specialists in the 
understanding and application of the professional ethics laws who are 
consulted in the almost daily instances in which issues arise concerning the 
ethical practice of law.

In terms of your question, I see the function of such ethical codes as being 
partially market-driven in that purchasers of legal service have to be at 
least minimally satisfied with the systemic logic imposed by the meta-ethics 
of professional conduct, or they will buy their legal services elsewhere.  Of 
course, the market is far, far from perfect because we operate in a series of 
only partially overlapping state-sponsored monopolies.

I was thrilled when I heard that Judge Posner was to be the Microsoft

used Posner's then-new case book as our basic text in my first-year torts

	An alternate way of looking at it is how people try to instill objective
morality into their progeny, essentially programming them.  It is easy for
a parent to say that "killing people is bad, helping people is good,"
though circumstances dictate that there are occasions when people need to
be killed (in self defense etc.) and when others shouldn't be helped.  No
matter how complex the morality appears to be, there seem to be exceptions
to the alleged "objectivity."  The same, of course, is true of AI; if
someone tried to program objective morality into an AI, the lack of
flexibile rationality and reasoning based on situations would likely still
resemble "just a computer" whether Turing proven or otherwise.

Not. I had some duff knowledge in my head if you two are correct. I was
certain that I'd heard from some trustworthy source that the galaxies that
lie farthest from the point of origin of the universe are the oldest. I'll
check that now.....

So my Gran IS only 2 months old because the only way I can look at her is in
an old photo? The photons from the galaxies we detect with these photons are
millions of years old, but the galaxies themselves ARE quite different at
this moment in time.

Would it be wise to hardwire an AI to keep working on the problem until an 
answer is found?  Depends how versatile the AI is.  I could see giving the AI 
such a difficult problem to solve as being a great incentive for it to 
survive, grow and learn.      An intelligent AI would probably figure out 
early on that the search for the answer might take a long time, and that it 
might require information it doesn't currently possess.  So rather than going 
around and around in circles until it runs down, an AI on such a search might 
take the long view, realizing that it needs to ensure its longevity (so as to 
have time enough to find the answer), also realizing that it may need more 
skills and knowledge than it possesses at the time (feuling curiosity and the 
desire to improve oneself), and further, it might determine that there is a 
need to actually try different models of morality, and apply its own working 
model of morality to give it a reference on which to reach for the "absolute" 
morality (and thus might become a moral being itself).

Give a seed AI this goal, and it might actually be beneficial.

Oh, man. Someone who thinks like me at last! Yes, yes......doesn't this just
make perfect sense - it's exactly my perspective on the subject.  This idea
stretches into many other "debates" that people are always wasting time
having, chasing their tails trying to manipulate premises which are unsound
on all sides. I have always been puzzled by the seeming inability of people
at large to distinguish between arbitrary symbolic concepts and those
concepts with a footing in reality. Well, now there are two of us.

I think this goes to the root of the problem I (and others) are worrying
about.  The logic I've worked out now is good, solid, and
self-swallowing, but I'm a human.  For an AI, that logic implies a
particular low-level implementation, and that may not be good.  For
characteristics like flexibility, common sense, the ability to avoid
doing dumb things like converting the entire Universe into a set of
regular polyhedra, spotting mistakes your designers didn't know about,
and adapting to new information as well as you'd have if your designers
had known about it to begin with, you need high-level characteristics
that are the result of a lower level that usually does not have a direct
semantic interpretation.  The logic I've got now, if implemented
directly, would be too crystalline.

Since this is a true fact, an AI design based on this true fact should
not look at itself and go:  "Yuck, my design has been screwed up by the
silly humans."  Which is, let it be understood, the very first
requirement for stable self-improving AI.

The term has certainly got around a bit - about 8 months ago there was a

flash term for what my AI lecturer referred to as artificial life.

How are you going to make a program "understand"? What is "understand" to
you?

In my view, one of the strongest arguments for objective morality is the
existence of qualia.  It shows that the Universe can be made to contain
weirder stuff than objectively existent goals.  If you can take complex,
fundamentally subjective facets of cognition and turn them into
objectively existent qualia, why can't you do the same thing with goals?
 It would appear to be a lot simpler, on the surface at least.  In fact,
given the qualia of pleasure, one could make a good case that it's
happened already.

I think there are three things that an SI would need to be able to make good 
decisions (from the human perspective): Intelligence, Empathy, and Sympathy.

Sympathy is number one - the SI needs to wish to act in our best interests.
Empathy is number two - the SI needs to understand our perspective before it 
could know what is in our best interests.
Intelligence is number three - the SI would need to be able to come up with 
better methods to act in our best interests (and maybe even determine our 
best interests) than we could on our own.

I find it interesting that you see yourself as a child to the SI's adult.  If 
this were the true situation, then why wouldn't the SI want to see you grow 
up?  assuming the SI can do some of the things you suggest, why not simply 
show you how to gain SI level intelligence yourself?
 
<< Maybe.  There are limits to how much time I'm willing to spend worrying

I worry this is a maladaptive response.  It would be a pity if society sought

doing.  Misinterpretations have gotten people killed, and I don't think we've 
gotten beyond that level quite yet.

I'm guessing that initial programming does make a difference. 

<< I can, but never mind.  Why is perfection necessary?  I'll take 99.99%
 accuracy any day.>>

You're right, I would take 99.99% any day.  But I'd want some recourse should 
the 0.01% errors go against me.  Also, when the SI has that much power, how 
do we know that it IS that accurate?  It might just be altering our 
perceptions and memories to make us think it is right that often (maybe for 
"benevolent" reasons - like it doesn't want us to be emotionally upset about 
how much it is messing up).
 
 <<Fine.  Let's say the SI is programmed to simulate an enlightened,

Okay, you've got something there.  It probably would.  Of course, whose 
definitions of enlightened, fair, and kindhearted are we using?
 
<< Why should errors accumulate instead of cancelling out?>>

I would say both might happen, cancellation and accumulation.  Of course, as 
long as it has a rigorous enough error check, and the error check isn't one 
of the function where the errors are accumulating, then the SI should be able 
to make corrections.
 
<<Once an error becomes large enough for humans to perceive, it is large
 enough for any SI remotely worthy of the phrase to notice and correct.>>

Agreed.  Unless it is something that is only obvious from our perspective.
 
<<I mean, why doesn't this whole argument prove that thermostats will
 never match a free democracy that votes whether or not to turn the

Depends on what criteria are important for the decision whether to turn the 
heater on or off.  Thermostats, however, make no initial decision as to what 
the temperature should be; so far that is still a human function.  Once that 
decision is made, then a thermostat would do it better than a committee.
 
<<Even supposing this to be true, an SI could easily attain a high enough
 resolution to prevent any humanly noticeable unhappiness from
 developing.  I mean, let's say you upload the whole human race.  Now it
 runs on the mass of a basketball.  If the SI can use the rest of the
 Earth-mass to think about that one basketball, I guarantee you it can
 attain a perceptual granularity a lot better than that of the humans
 running on it.>>

But would this be the right thing to do?  If you can upload humanity, then 
can't you also alter humanity so as to have them be able to utilize all that 
Earth mass for their own cognitive use?  If the human race were uploaded and 
an SI kept them simple enough for it to perfectly comprehend, then I would 
not consider this in the best interests of humanity.  The best interests of 
humanity would be best served in promoting our own growth.  

One variant on this idea which might be considered benevolent would be if 
this were a dynamic instead of static process.  Let's say the SI is one that 
is constantly improving itself caught up in a Singularity type scenario, 
where it is constantly growing and improving itself.  Let us further say that 
the process doesn't allow much in terms of leaping ahead so that you more or 
less need to go through the previous levels of SI to get to the more advanced 
ones (perhaps at least with your personality intact).  It would be immoral to 
ask the SI to stunt its own growth just so we could catch up, but as long as 
it gave us what aid it could in our own growth, then it would be morally 
acceptable for it to continue to retain its lead in ability, and also wise of 
the up-and-coming former humanity to accept the SI's leadership, as it is in 
a unique position to know better what to do in most situations.  Under these 
circumstances, I would have very little problem following the lead of the SI 
(though I would still not take its rightness for granted).
 
 <<Complete control over the processors running humanity isn't enough power
 for you?>>

No, to really entrust ourselves to an SI you would also want it to have 
complete control over the environment in which those processors and its own 
operate.  Shit still happens, even to SI's.
 
<<What complexity?  Just because it looks complex to you doesn't mean that
it's complex to the SI.  I occasionally get flashes of the level on
which human minds are made up of understandable parts, and believe me,
society is a lot less complex than that.  Less communications bandwidth
between the elements.>>

I agree, the human mind is still more complex than human society in general.  
But remember, human society is made up of all those complex human minds.
 
 <<Is this a true argument?
 Would it be obvious to a sufficiently intelligent being?
 Then what will happen, in your visualization, is that I create an SI,
 and it adopts Greg Burch's personal philosophy and does exactly what you
 want it to for exactly the reasons you cited.>>

Then wouldn't the SI really be an extension of Greg Burch's personality?  If 
the SI doesn't diverge from the opinions, goals, and desires of Greg Burch, 
then how is it separate from Greg Burch?  Furthermore, if it can't come to a 
different conclusion as to what should be done, won't this handicap it in 
providing a better world (for though I greatly respect Greg's judgement, in 
my experience, no living human is ever completely right all the time.  Though 
things could be a lot worse than having the Greg Burch-SI running the 
show<g>)?  Why not just upgrade Greg Burch to SI level (and hey, what about 
me too while your at it<g>)?

This is one of the most common misconceptions about the Big Bang, fostered
by countless animations which depict it as a conventional explosion,
a burst of light and energy spreading out into empty space.

As I understand the Big Bang model, there is no "point of origin"
of the universe.  The universe is the same everywhere, and was born
everywhere at once.  Consider the two-dimensional surface of a balloon
that starts at a point and then expands.  Now point to the spot on that
surface that was the point of origin.  You can't - the point of origin
is not on the surface, all parts of the surface are equally old.

Now conceptualize the surface as three dimensional, rather than two
dimensional, and we have our universe (in some models).  It starts at
zero size and expands, but all parts of the universe are the same at
every moment.  There is no preferred central location.

I don't know much about the inflation and bubble-universe models; maybe
they are non-homogeneous and specify that some parts of the universe
are different from others.  But the basic Big Bang models I studied in
school are uniform.

Is the "existence" of "Turing Unprovable" concepts a possibility because
there is a real reason to think that this is so, or that this would provide
satisfaction to your rational mind, allowing your desire to have certain

In order for this to be possible, the problem would have to be

An arbitrary subjective animal concept will not be communicable to an AI,

We can use some assumptions and observations to put some constraints
on this.

  If we assume that current theories of physics (e.g. big bang,
  nucelosynthesis, stellar evolution, etc.) are relatively correct
  then there is "some" observational evidence that SIs exist.

  If SIs exist and have existed for long enough to have utilized
  our resources (probable) and have not done so, then either:
   (a) they have no interest in doing so (benefit of omission); or
   (b) there may be a moral principle guiding them not to do so
       (benefit of commission).

So, at least currently things seem to be going in our favor.
Since we can get to their level within 50 years, at that point
it is more probable that we become part of the community or at
least have a fighting chance of defending ourselves should they
suddenly take an interest in our resource base.

If instead, we assume that astrophysics needs a lot of adjustment,
there are no SIs and we are first, then we only need worry about our
own failure to chart a proper course of development.

To consume half the galaxy is going to take a minimum of 100,000 years,
probably an order of magnitude more, unless it is a concerted effort
by a preexisting population of galaxy enveloping SIs.

> So they all commit suicide.  Oops.

Thats a bit pessimistic and unless programmed in seems doubtful.
How about -- If no theory-of-absolute-morality-exists then
go play for a trillion years?

Before we go rushing off building nanobots to solve this problem
(gotta get a DNA sample from Eliezer first, anyone want to take
this on?) perhaps we should wait and see if there are or are not
SIs present in the universe.  Either way, we would need to do some
serious thinking on the present/not-present implications.  Present
could mean the A.M. is a benevolent one, not present could mean
there is an escape hatch for of our universe.  Both deserve
due consideration.

Some things to think about:

[1] Resolution of conflicts between "base motivations" (e.g. protective-
     ness vs. self-preservation, cooperation vs. competition, etc.).

[2] Motivational Hierarchies -- dominance and recession, rank-order
     (prioritization) etc.

[3] The self-destruction of intelligent systems.

[4] Hypertrophication of a "base-motivation" (e.g. bulimia) or its
     atrophication (e.g. anorexia nervosa).

[5] The invariability of "base motivations" seems to imply the
     termination of evolutionary process in the species concerned;
     why evolve from unicellular morphology to multicellular? Why
     experiment with other than asexual reproduction?

[6] Are the "strictly defined goals" of a mushroom any different
     than those of a flatworm, and if so, how and why?

[7] Was there a primordial "base motivation" to evolve an "intelligent
     system" for implementing the reduction of "strictly defined" needs?

     OR: how would you describe the "intelligent system" used by used
     by a bacterium to achieve its "strictly defined goals"? "It doesn't
     have a central nervous system, so how can it have one?"  Then
     how did we get one?  Not because we needed to! Think about it.

Cool.  I did publish the term more than 8 months ago, and it is also of
course possible that the alifers reinvented it and made it mean
something completely different.

Ok, I give up.  I've seen the term "qualia" off and on over a few months
but only manage to get a vague impression of its meaning from context.
I'm not entirely "illiterate" in this area.  I've read Calvin and
Crick and Minsky and some early Churchland and I've never seen it defined.
The term isn't on Anders' 'Q' page and Amazon turns up only one title on
Consciousness and Qualia, which I've added to my Book order list
but given the backlog, I expect it will get to the top of the pile
around 2007.  It isn't in Webster's Dictionary of the English Language
or two dictionaries I have on mathematical terms or a dictionary on
molecular biology (which does however define quadrupole mass spectrometer,
Quaking mutation, quantasome, quantiles and lots of other words
that one clearly needs for Scrabble) or even "The Dictionary of
Cultural Literacy"!

Altavista lists 4600+ references, including "Qualia Computing" which
supplies "powerful computer-aided detection system designed to assist the
radiologist in the screening of breast cancer", which I suspect isn't
what is being discussed.

So, I've got two questions.

What in the blazes is a "qualia"?

And, how can we lower the barriers to entry for people coming into
this list if we do not have a dictionary of terms for the newbies
(or even the middle-aged-bies)?

While Anders list is wonderful, many people probably do not know
about it and there isn't a systematic approach to expanding it
or linking our conversations to it.

Suggestion:
  We take N months of EI/transhumanist list archives, throw out
  all of the common (dictionary?) terms, reduce the list to
  an extropian/transhumanist "specific" subset, then partition
  those out to people by area of expertise.

If we get 100 people who agree to do 5-10 terms each, then we
have the basis for a background vocabulary that we can automatically
link to from the archives.

Now the interesting thing about this is that, if one has been
following the discussions about types of nodes on the net
there are "destination" (termination) pages and central
"expert" pages (the terms typically used vary), but if we
presume that there will be a high targeting rate for the
"expert" pages as search engines learn to discriminate
these, then it makes sense for us to define
  http://www.extropy.org/Dictionary/term.html
with definitions and lots of outgoing links to related
pages that support our perspective.

Any takers?

When I am in a room, and the ligth goes out I still know how the room is
laid out, I can still manouver around in the room. I can walk somewhere and
pick up something.

I have a model of the room in my mind.

I then use my senses to continuously update the model of the world which I
hold in my mind. When I cannot see I listen or feel, and get a somewhat less
complete model in my mind than I do with vision. But the model is still
there.

I suspect that bats uses their sonar for similar purpose. They have a bad
eyesight but good hearing. Their model of the world could be just as good as
mine. In some cases it is no doubt better, as i can practically never hit a
fly in the air which they do all the time for food.

Furthermore I can imagine what will happen if I walk thru the room and then
stumble over the table. Therefore I am able to choose a different path thru
the room.

I can simulate/make a scenario in my mind. Playing it out in my minds model.
Therefore I can think and plan ahead.

I suspect that the the idea of having a consantly updated model of the world
in my mind is a significant idea when it comes to AI.

When I cross that idea with the fact that I have a hard time beating the
bots in Quake 3 who are running around in a model of a world, and the fact
that it is allready possible to build 3D objects from 2 cameras to model a
3D world. Then I could imagine that if it would be somehow possible to get
real robots to move around in the real world combining these three
abilities.

A modeler for input and world building, and a simulator trying out different
moves in the model before doing them in the real world.

But knowing me and all my other great ideas somebody brighter has probably
gotten the idea sometimes in the sixties.

Does anybody know about research material among these lines?

qualia

The intrinsic phenomenal features of subjective consciousness,
or sense data. Thus, qualia include what it is like to see green
grass, to taste salt, to hear birds sing, to have a headache, to
feel pain, etc. Providing an adequate account of qualia is some-
times held to be a difficult problem for functionalist explanations
of mental states.

My dictionary doesn't have it either, but it is the plural of "quale"
and my dictionary has that one (it doesn't show the plural form though).
Basically it refers to sensory impressions, with an emphasis on conscious
perception.  I believe Eliezer's usage would also work with reference
to consciousness, self-consciousness, awareness, etc.  It is all related
to the philosophical question of what it means to be conscious and how
consciousness could relate to the actions of the physical world.

Qualia is a technical term in the philosophy of consciousness, which does
occasionally enter our discussions.  For example we have talked about
whether machines can be conscious and whether we can retain our conscious
identity as we upload.  However I don't think these issues are central to
Extropian thought.  When we do bring in a technical term, whether from
physics, economics or philosophy, it is probably enough to say where it
comes from if that is not clear from the context (as in this case).

Not before time, Grasshopper.

It seems to me that your ambition of finding an `objective or external
morality' is based on a bafflingly simple error. You are seeking a
teleological answer in a non-teleological cosmic substrate. You are asking
after the ice-cream preferences of a dust cloud. Morality is an emergent
program for guiding the behaviour of complex social beings. Such beings are
not written ahead of time into the foundations of the universe. Any moral
code is therefore prudential at best - that is, it is a set of ranked
instructions for how to attain goals that have been set arbitrarily in a
complex cascade of adaptations and evolutionary kluges. These can certainly
be tested by various criteria of effectiveness, but not against any deeper,
universal, aboriginal dicta that preceded the (very recent) emergence of
minds. Deal with it. Stop looking for some rule in M-Theory that tells you
why choosing not to eat bluebellied flies on Tuesdays is objectively
morally righteous.

Dear Robert,

Just say "no" to qualia.  I tend to use it as a marker for philosophical
discussions that are going nowhere.  You will get plenty of this if you read
Chalmers, and some refreshing relief from Dennett.  The classic example is the
subjective experience of seeing the color red.  Some authors dismiss the
entire field of AI based on the argument that machines will never experience
qualia.  Dennett notes that these are the kind of philosophers who make a
living by taking in each other's laundry.

David Marr did, in the 70s I think. There's a huge amount of cog sci on
mental modelling. Look for R. N. Shepard and Stephen Kosslyn. Try Philip
Johnson-Laird's MENTAL MODELS (Harvard 1983) for a good early summary.

And say "yes" to what?  Surely you don't mean to suggest
that "subjective experience" is a quantitative state. Do
you experience your color "red" as an extensive magnitude?
How "large" would you say "red" is?  Compared to the size
of, say, "yellow"?  Or as an intensive magnitude? Which is 
heavier: blue or green?  

While you're at it, work out your definition of the sensation
red (i.e. the COLOR red -- not the wavelength of the light
associated with it--we already know that).  We will need this
definition to program our AI mechanism so it will know when
it is experiencing "red". Otherwise it will fail to stop for the
light! [No spectrometric devices permitted here -- we are
concerned with the process of color-perception, not color
discrimination or the frequency analysis of radiation.
Spectrometers don't know about "red" because they don't
know about anything)].

To say a spectrometer sees red is exactly the same as
asserting that a submarine swims.

In case you missed it Ken, I defined "qualia" for Robert in
an earlier post:[1] "> What in the blazes is a "qualia"?"

qualia

I believe it is in order to assert with some emphasis that
those who cannot distinguish the experiential reality denoted
by the metaphor "Mind" from a manufactured assemblage of
material components designed to perform predetermined
operations called a "Machine" should confine themselves to
discussing mechanics. I don't mean to be rude -- but 18th-
century science should be discussed using 18th-century
concepts - don't you agree?

I checked an ER website and tracked down the name of the writer for the
episode in question, November 11th, entitled "The Peace of Wild Things".
The writer was John Wells, who has major responsability for the series, he
writes and directs episodes in addition to other "executive" duties.  He
also happens to be the President of the Writer's Guild of America.  Their
website can be found at:

http://www.wga.org/

and, John Wells, as their president can easily be contacted, or at least
it's easy to phone his office.  (There's an 800 number.)

(800) 548-4532

I made the call and asked for the source of the poem.  Of course, you guys
have already tracked that down by now, but these other questions--an
accidental misattribution or a mistake by the character to emphasize the
effects of Alzhiemers?--I didn't ask about.  Also, I didn't get a reply to
my original question about the poem.

Obviously, since at the time I didn't know the title of the poem, I didn't
recognize that the title of the episode WAS the title of the poem.  At this
point I would venture a guess that the "misattribution" by the character
was no mistake by the writer.

Too much tofu induces brain aging, study shows

A Hawaii research team says high consumption 
of the soy product by a group of men lowered 
mental abilities

By Helen Altonn
Star-Bulletin


Tofu is touted for its health benefits, but also may 
pose health risks, says a Hawaii scientist.

A Hawaii study shows a significant statistical 
relationship between two or more servings of tofu a 
week and "accelerated brain aging" and even an 
association with Alzheimer's disease, says Dr. Lon White.

The Pacific Health Research Institute researcher urged 
caution at a recent conference in Washington as scientists 
from around the world discussed the role of soy products 
in the prevention and treatment of disease.

The symposium was sponsored by giant soybean growing and 
processing firms such as Archer Daniels Midland and DuPont.

The largely unregulated food supplements industry is 
preparing to step up sales, claiming that isoflavones, 
plant chemicals found in high concentrations in soybeans, 
offer "natural" cures for breast cancer, osteoporosis,
prostate cancer, heart disease, menopausal "hot flashes" 
and other chronic conditions.


Negative conclusions 

But, White said in an interview, "The majority of 
scientists said the data they were talking about for 
beneficial effects on health is very weak" and doesn't 
really support health claims for soy foods. White and 
his associates have been studying diseases and aging 
in a group of Japanese-American men who volunteered for 
medical research in 1965. The Honolulu Heart Program 
began with 8,006 men born from 1900 through 1919. They 
were identified through World War II Selective Service 
registration records.

In comparing the dietary habits and health of the 
Japanese-American men in the study group between 1965 
and 1993, White said the scientists found "a significant 
link between tofu consumption during midlife and loss of 
mental ability and even loss of brain weight."

The men were questioned about 27 foods and drinks, with 
data showing that those who ate more tofu were apt to 
have impaired mental ability, White said. Tofu was the 
only consistent link among the men, he said. The rate 
of brain impairment, which normally increases with age, 
also went up faster in the men who ate the most tofu, he said.

"The test results were about equivalent to what they 
would have been if they were five years older," he said. 
"Guys who ate none, their test scores were as though 
they were five years younger."

The brains of 300 men who died also were examined in a 
unique autopsy study conducted as part of the Honolulu 
aging project, White said. The 300 men didn't appear to 
have had any more strokes than the average person, and 
their blood vessels didn't look different.

"But what I did see was (that) the simple weight of the 
brain was lower," he said. Shrinkage occurs naturally 
with age, but atrophy progressed more rapidly in those 
men who had consumed more tofu, White said.

He said the wives of about 500 men also provided 
information about what they ate, and the findings 
correlated with what their husbands said.


Stark contrast 

So the scientists obtained four independent indicators of 
an adverse effect from frequent eating of tofu and changes 
in the brain with aging, White said. Those who ate a lot of 
tofu, by the time they were 75 or 80 looked five years 
older, he said.

"Why in the world would that happen?" he said. "Everyone 
knows protein in tofu and soy is wonderfully nutritious. 
Everyone knows fats are wonderfully nutritious.

"But more and more and more over the last five to 10 years, 
people have been claiming the health benefits of soy foods 
are less related to its nutrient composition, proteins and 
fat, and more related to other molecules that occur in tofu 
made by soy plants and act as pharmacological agents."

Isoflavones, the most talked about, "are molecules that the 
soy plant makes while it's germinating to help it fend off
mold and other things that attack the plant in the ground," 
White said.

They're plant molecules that look like estrogens but 
they're not natural estrogens, he said. "When they get 
into cells, they actually affect the metabolism of cells. 
They inhabit certain kinds of enzymes and alter (the) 
metabolism of cells.

"The bottom line," stressed White, "is these are not 
nutrients. They are drugs. They will have some benefits 
and some negative things."


Groundbreaking work

White said his study, to his knowledge, is the only one 
to show strong evidence of serious adverse effects from 
a soy product. His group is seeking a new National 
Institutes of Health grant to continue research on the 
effects of tofu. It may be beneficial for heart disease 
and bones, White said. "We don't know. All we know, in 
our study, is there appears to be an adverse relationship."

Among those at the conference was Finnish scientist Herman
Adlercreutz, who became interested in soy after observing 
that breast cancer and colon cancer were less common in 
Japan than in Finland. His studies 20 years ago led to a 
scientific explosion of interest in soy and its components.

Adlercreutz believes more dietary soy, a staple of Asian 
diets, would improve the health of Americans and people 
of other Western countries. But he said at the conference, 
"I am myself frightened a little bit by all of this. 
There is so much we don't know."

Mark Messina, a soy foods expert and former researcher 
with the Diet and Cancer Branch of the National Cancer 
Institute, told the scientists, "It's simply not possible 
as yet to draw any conclusions about soy consumption and 
cancer prevention, but further research is certainly warranted."

Companies that make money from soy products are pushing 
hard to have people think of them as "perfect food," White said

"But if we're talking about soy foods containing substances 
that have effects on health that aren't nutrients, that are 
not vitamins, or fat, but change how cells operate, they're 
acting as drugs act. And the way we think of them should be 
how we think about drugs."

RE: http://starbulletin.com/1999/11/19/news/story4.html 

After searching the National Library of Medicine for a while
I believe I've come upon a possible physiological basis for 
the indicated tofu-induced brain atrophy cited in my first 
post (URL above). It may be related to the fact that the main 
soy phytochemical genistein reduces DNA synthesis in the brain, 
and reduced DNA synthesis is associated with apoptosis, which 
is also know as "programmed cell death." This effect might be 
why genistein appears to cause cancer-cell death. Problem is 
your brain's not a cancer, and neither are a guy's balls

Soy-phytochemical genistein "induced significant testicular cell death."

Cytotoxic potential of the phytochemical genistein 
isoflavone (4',5',7-trihydroxyisoflavone) and certain 
environmental chemical compounds on testicular cells.

Kumi-Diaka J, Nguyen V, Butler A

[Medline record in process]

The effects of genistein (Gn), sodium azide (naz), and 
dexamethasone (dxm) on testicular cells TM3, TM4 and 
GC-1 spg were studied in vitro. First, a series of 
experiments were performed to assess the response of 
the cells to the exposure of Gn, naz, dxm, a combination 
of Gn with naz and Gn with dxm. Trypan blue exclusion 
assay was used to determine the percentage of viability, 
and LDH-cytotoxicity test was used to assess the degree 
of treatment-induced cytotoxicity on each cell type. A
second series of experiments were performed to study 
cytomorphology and determine the type and percentage of
treatment-induced cell death (apoptosis and necrosis) on 
each cell line, using fluorescent dye technique to detect 
apoptotic and necrotic cells, and tunnel assay to confirm 
apoptosis. The results from the data obtained demonstrated: 
i) that incubation of testis cells with each of the agents 
(Gn, dxm, naz) alone and in two combinations (Gn-dxm, and 
Gn-naz) induced significant testicular cell death; ii) that 
both genistein and dexamethasone mostly and significantly 
induced apoptotic cell death while sodium azide induced 
necrotic cell death; iii) that addition of dexamethasone 
to genistein demonstrated synergism in apoptosis on testis 
cells; and iv) that combination of naz with Gn demonstrated 
synergism in necrosis on testis cells even though Gn alone 
did not induce significant necrosis. It is concluded that 
the synergistic actions of genistein and dxm, and of genistein 
+ sodium azide in induction of apoptosis and/or necrosis may 
be of clinical and pathophysiological research interest 
considering the chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic potential 
of genistein; and the clinico-pharmacological application of 
dexamethasone and sodium azide.

Early effects of protein kinase modulators on DNA synthesis 
in rat cerebral cortex.

Yakisich JS, Siden A, Vargas VI, Eneroth P, Cruz M

Applied Biochemistry, Clinical Research Center, Karolinska 
Institute, Novum, Huddinge University Hospital, Huddinge,
S-141 86, Sweden. 

By using tissue miniunits, protein kinase modulators, and 
topoisomerase inhibitors in short-term incubation (0-90 min) 
we studied (1) the role of protein phosphorylation in the 
immediate control of DNA replication in the developing rat 
cerebral cortex and (2) the mechanism of action for genistein-
mediated DNA synthesis inhibition. Genistein decreased the DNA
synthesis within less than 30 min. None of the other protein 
kinase inhibitors examined (herbimycin A, staurosporine, 
calphostin-C) or the protein phosphatase inhibitor sodium 
orthovanadate inhibited DNA synthesis and they did not affect 
the genistein-mediated inhibition. The selective topoisomerase 
inhibitors camptothecin and etoposide decreased the DNA synthesis 
to an extent similar to that of genistein and within less than 
30 min. In addition, the effects of these substances on 
topoisomerase I and II were studied. Etoposide and genistein 
but not herbimycin A, staurosporine, or calphostin-C strongly 
inhibited the activity of topoisomerase II. Our results (1) 
strongly suggest that the net rate of DNA replication during 
the S phase of the cell cycle is independent of protein 
phosphorylation and (2) indicate that the early inhibitory 
effect of genistein on DNA synthesis is mediated by 
topoisomerase II inhibition rather than protein tyrosine 
kinase inhibition.

Reduce DNA synthesis associated with aging

Age-related changes of DNA repair and mitochondrial 
DNA synthesis in the mouse brain.

Schmitz C, Axmacher B, Zunker U, Korr H

Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, RWTH University 
of Aachen, Germany. cschmitz@alpha.imib.rwth-aachen,de 

Using quantitative autoradiography, both nuclear DNA 
repair - measured as nuclear unscheduled DNA synthesis 
(UDS) - and mitochondrial (mt) DNA synthesis were 
evaluated in situ for several types of cells in the 
brains of untreated mice of various age. It was found 
that distinct types of neuronal cells showed a decline 
of both UDS and mtDNA synthesis with age, whereas - 
except for glial cells of the cerebral cortex - no glial 
or endothelial cells showed age-related alterations of 
UDS. Together with various data reported in the literature, 
these patterns of a cell type-specific decrease of UDS and 
mtDNA synthesis with age in the mouse brain lead to an 
improved understanding of the complex interrelationships 
between the molecular events associated with the 
phenomenon of aging as well as to a new idea regarding 
the cause of the specific distribution pattern of those 
cells in the human brain that are affected by the formation 
of paired helical filaments in Alzheimer's disease.

Early inhibition of DNA synthesis in the developing rat cerebral

Clinical Research Center, Karolinska Institute, Novum, Sweden. 

The effects of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors 
olomoucine and roscovitine on DNA synthesis were studied using 
short time incubation (30-90 minutes). Both purine analogues 
at concentrations from 1-100 microM decreased the DNA synthesis 
of rat brain cortex in a dose-dependent manner and the maximum 
effect occurred within 30 min of incubation. Staurosporine, 
another potent CDK inhibitor did not affect the DNA synthesis 
in the concentration range 1-250 nM. These results indicate 
that olomoucine and roscovitine block DNA synthesis by a 
mechanism independent of CDK inhibition. We propose that the 
cellular effects of olomuocine and roscovitine on the cell 
cycle are at least in part due to this early inhibitory 
effect on DNA synthesis.

Roscovitine induces cell death and morphological changes 
indicative of apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.

Mgbonyebi OP, Russo J, Russo IH

Breast Cancer Research Laboratory, Fox Chase Cancer Center, 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19111, USA. 

We have previously shown (Mgbonyebi et al., Anticancer Res., 
18: 751-756, 1998) that roscovitine, an olomoucine-related
purine analogue and a selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent 
kinases, inhibited the proliferative activity of human breast
epithelial cells in vitro. The purpose of the present study 
was to identify the cellular processes and targets affected 
by roscovitine treatment in the estrogen receptor-negative 
MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma cells. Treatment of the 
cells with 10 microg/ml roscovitine daily for a length of 
time ranging from 24 to 240 h revealed that the compound 
inhibited DNA synthesis, induced cell death, and irreversibly 
inhibited the proliferative activity of the cells. Morphological 
analysis of roscovitine-treated cells by light and fluorescence 
microscopy demonstrated that this cyclin-dependent kinase 
inhibitor induced cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, 
reorganization of actin microfilament architecture, and 
extensive detachment of cells from the cell culture substratum. 
These cellular events are all known to be associated with 
apoptosis. Collectively, the data generated from this study 
suggest that roscovitine induced apoptosis in the estrogen 
receptor-negative MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. Because 
the efficacy of many anticancer drugs depends on their ability 
to induce apoptotic cell death, modulation of this parameter 
by roscovitine may provide a new chemopreventive and 
chemotherapeutic strategy for the clinical management of 
hormone-resistant breast cancers.

Changes in proliferating cell nuclear antigen, a protein 
involved in DNA repair, in vulnerable hippocampal neurons 
following global cerebral ischemia.

Tomasevic G, Kamme F, Wieloch T

Laboratory for Experimental Brain Research, Wallenberg 
Neuroscience Center, Lund University Hospital, S-221 85, 
Lund, Sweden. Gregor.Tomasevic@expbr.lu.se 

Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is required for
completion of the DNA synthesis step of DNA replication as 
well as nucleotide excision repair (NER) of damaged DNA. 
We investigated the expression of PCNA mRNA and the levels 
of PCNA protein in the adult rat hippocampus following normo- 
and hypothermic global forebrain ischemia. Hypothermia 
protected the CA1 neurons from ischemic damage. A constitutive 
expression of PCNA mRNA and protein was detected in all 
hippocampal subfields, as well as in other brain regions. 
During reperfusion, PCNA mRNA levels were up-regulated in 
the vulnerable CA1 subfield at 36 h following normothermic 
ischemia. In hypothermia, this induction appeared already 
after 18 h. Following normothermic ischemia, nuclear PCNA 
immunoreactivity was largely abolished during reperfusion 
in the vulnerable CA1 neurons, prior to cell death. In 
contrast, total PCNA protein content of this region, as 
measured by Western blotting, remained largely unchanged. 
In the CA3 region, a transient decrease in nuclear PCNA 
immunoreactivity was observed. In the dentate gyrus region, 
no down-regulation of nuclear or total PCNA protein was 
observed during reperfusion. Following hypothermic ischemia, 
the PCNA protein levels did not decrease in any of the 
hippocampal subregions. In contrast, no change in the levels 
of Ref-1, a protein involved in base excision DNA repair (BER), 
was observed following normo- or hypothermic ischemia. Our 
findings indicate an altered functional state of PCNA protein 
in the ischemia-sensitive CA1 neurons suggesting that DNA 
repair processes are affected in these post-mitotic cells 
following ischemia. Impaired DNA repair may play a role in 
the development of postischemic neuronal damage.

Synthesis, characterization and DNA modification induced by 
a novel Pt(IV)-bis(monoglutarate) complex which induces 
apoptosis in glioma cells.

LR, Alonso C, Navarro-Ranninger MC

Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Cantoblanco, Spain. 

Programmed cell death or apoptosis is a mechanism for the 
elimination of cells that occurs not only in physiological
processes but also in drug-induced tumor cell death. Thus, 
because cisplatin, cis-diamminechloroplatinum (II), produces
important damages on the DNA inducing apoptosis in several 
cell lines it has become a widely used antitumor drug. 
However, cisplatin possesses some dose-limiting toxicities 
mainly nephrotoxicity. Pt(IV) complexes, such as iproplatin,
ormaplatin, and JM216 are a new class of platinum complexes 
that exhibits less toxicity than cisplatin. Some of these
complexes have shown significant antitumor activity and a 
low cross-resistance to cisplatin. In the present paper, we 
have analyzed the DNA binding mode and the cytotoxicity of 
a novel Pt(IV)-bis (monoglutarate) complex. The data show 
that this novel complex produces DNA interstrand cross-links 
to a higher extent and with a faster kinetics than cisplatin. 
Also the Pt(IV)-bis (monoglutarate) complex kills glioma 
cells at drug concentrations significantly lower than those 
of cisplatin. Interestingly, this Pt(IV) complex produces in 
the glioma cells characteristic features of apoptosis such 
as 'DNA laddering' and fragmented nuclei. Moreover, the p53 
protein accumulates early in glioma cells as a result of 
Pt(IV)-bis (monoglutarate) treatment. These data indicate 
that the Pt(IV)-bis (monoglutarate) complex induces apoptosis 
in glioma cells through a p53-dependent pathway.

Rob, I feel I'm forced to disagree with you on the simple basis that
a chess program doesn't have access to the "base motivations", while
we perhaps can either access those goals or shift those priorities.
I'll use the example of the celibate priest or monk.  Certainly the
"designer", put in the goal to procreate.  However with enough
training or desire, we can usurp that goal and replace it with
another, *perhaps* flying in the face of "rational" behavior
(i.e. substituting the pursuit of a belief system that has no
concrete visible results with one that has concrete visible results).

Now, the interesting problem, IMO, from the perspective of sending
and AI after an "absolute morality" is the problem that to implement
the acceptance of the "discovered" morality, you have to give the AI
access to the source code (i.e. it (like humans) can shift the weights
or priorities of its belief system).  How do you prevent the AI from
worshiping some false god (as I would argue so many humans do...)?

Now, with regard to whether an "absolute morality" existing, I'm
inclined to agree that that is doubtful.  My experience says
everything is context specific.  Is is wrong to murder her
children?  Yes.  Is it wrong for a mother to murder a younger
child so that an older child (in which greater investment has
been made) may survive in conditions of food scarcity?  No.
Is it wrong for a mother to murder an older child (with say
a mental handicap) in favor of a younger, but more mentally
promising child, in similar conditions of scarcity?  Probably
again, no.  [For those who don't like the examples, tough,
live with it.]  So in my mind, morality is *highly* context
specific.  I think our morality develops only on the basis
of experience (i.e. we can look back and see decisions that
in retrospect would have been better had alternate solutions
been selected).  To presume that an absolute morality exists
in such an environment seems difficult.

At the end of the lifetime of this universe you may have two
possibilities -- (a) to eventually let everything die; (b) to
prematurely sacrifice virtually everything that is the result of
trillions of years of work to create a seed in a new universe.
Do you want to argue the morality of choosing between those positions?

Robert

I would quibble with two things here.  First, I do not think "morality" as
such is something only applicable to social beings.  See Rand's "Philosophy
Who Needs It" -- the title essay in a book of hers of the same name.  Her
basic notion is that philosophy and morality (which is part of philosophy by
her reckoning) are guides to living life.  As such they do not just apply
when one has company over.:)  They would apply to Crusoe before Friday shows
up.  Of course, Crusoe would need no social morality or politics before
Friday shows up, but he would still need guidance in living.

Second, I would like to borrow Rand's trichotomy with regard to moralities.
These are the intrinsic, the subjective, and the objective.  Intrinsic
moralities are those based on the notion that the good is external, such as
religious ones where the Good is doing some specific action regardless of
its relation to the doer.  The Decalogue of JudeoChristianity is an example
of this.  (This seems to be what most people mean by "objective" and,
perhaps, the common usage is better than Rand's, given that it is placing
the good in the _object_ apart from the _subject_.  At the same time,
"intrinsic" is not so bad because as a term it points to goodness being
_intrinsic_ to something apart from any relation with anything else, whereas
_objectivity_ is a relation -- specifically, a certain state of awareness
with regard to the world.)

Subjective moralities are based on the subject alone, especially his, her,
its arbitrary preferences.  An example of this might be someone doing
whatever they feel like doing at a particular time.  This is sort like the
flip side of intrinsic moralities.  Now the subject, not external reality
has full control.  A special kind of subjective morality are social
conventional moralities, such as those who believe the Good is whatever
society (the majority, tradition, culture, the race, the nation, the
proletariat, the intelligentsia, etc.) decides it is.  For instance, if we
all take a vote and decide it's okay to rape, then rape is good -- not just
legal but moral, or, at least, not immoral.

The objective in moralities, using Rand's notions, is when the Good is a
relation between subject and object.  (See her and Branden's _The Virtue of
Selfishness_.)  Certain actions are good because of this relation.  Now this
might seem to only put the argument back further a step and move confusion
to another level.  After all, how does one decide what is good for a given
subject in a given context?  Couldn't it just be subjective?  In that case,
Rand's rattling on about _objective_ morality (note the singular here) is
only thnly disguised _subjective_ morality.

However, she does go a bit further and some have built further on her
insights.  Specifically, her views of "value" and the purpose of morality.
She defines "value" -- recalling from memory here -- as that which acts to
gain or keep.  This is a very neutral definition.  However, she then goes on
to look for why anything would need values.  Rather than go on here, let me
ask all on this thread who care to answer, Why would anything _need_ values?
Is value just a useless concept, adding a layer of redundancy to explaining
behavior or internal states?

I would quibble with one thing here which relates to my second point above.
Morality, as such, need not be the same for each species or type of being.
I would not take this as meaning morality is subjective or arbitrary.  It
merely reflects on the fact of being being (no pun intended) different.
This applies withing species too.  I have a certain set of traits that are
different from Damien's.  This means I can pretend to be him (or he me) and
expect to wind up in the same state.  I probably lack some skill or
preferences that he has and vice versa.  E.g., maybe he likes brussel
sprouts.  (I detest them.)  Now, this might seem arbitrary, from the point
of a Theory of Everything (TOE), but for he and I, these are just how we
are.  We must start with reality, not theory.

ketosis is dangerous?

James Sez:  I have been in ketosis for over a month now.  Never nauseous.
I do smell different in both mouth and sweat....mate thinks it is different,
but
not worse.  I lift weights for exercise and note that the number of reps I
can
do at various weight levels has declined a little.  I would think this is
because
I have less reserve energy stored in the muscles eventhough I take creatine.
The max weight I can lift has not declined.  However, I feel much more
energetic now that the hi-sugar /  low sugar cycle is eliminated-Adkins
quotes studies that show all the body's tissues including the brain and
major organs like the heart can utilize ketones as easily as
glucose for energy, contrary to knee jerk opinion in the Establishment.  In
fact,
some studies showed that some tissues prefer ketones!

> If you go on the diet and then off it, you will gain back all you lost.

James Sez:  Dr. Adkins recommends a moderate low carbohydrate diet
after your target weight is obtained.  One would be in ketosis only part of
the time
on the long term diet.   Adkins thinks you cannot be healthly unless in
ketosis at least part of the time.   Only in ketosis can body clean-out
excess cholesterol, etc. from arteries!  If you have all the energy you
need from a carbs all the time, the body cannot deal with whatever
fat is left in the diet to deposit God Knows Where!??  No fat mobilization
in "GLUCOSIS" according to Adkins...a dangerous situation???

James Sez Further:  Where is the data proving the body is not adapted
for ketosis?  Didn't humans probably evolve with the ability to store
and then use fat?  I would think that in many climates, folks would
eat lots of carbs during the summer, get fat, and then live partially
off stored fat during the "hard winter" months.  I would suspect that
primitives living in a "hard climate" purposely got fat whenever possible.

James Sez:  Is this Dr. Adkin's fault or the fault of Establishment science
that rejects the diet without any evidence?  Quack?  That is a pretty
extreme statement.  Are rodents evolved to eat meat?  Studies are
expensive.

>How was your experience on the diet?
>Did you get very hungry?

James Sez:  The first few days of the diet I was hungry as per usual for
candy
or pastries at various times during the day.  Previous to the diet, I would
give-in
quite often.  During the first week of the diet, I simply substituted an
Arby's roast
beef sandwich or Wendy's triple burger throwing away buns...totally
satisfying.
Absolutely easy NOT to cheat via this strategem.  After a bit, I seldom or
ever felt the munchies desire. According to Adkins this is because my body
was no
longer going through the low sugar [tired/depress] /
hi-sugar[energetic/elated] / insulin overshoot / low sugar [tired/depressed]
cycle.

>How about

James Sez:  My overall health and well being is great.  I do continue
to take the extreme supplement regime that I have taken for
many years.    You name it, I take it.

I plan to lose another 10-20 lbs before I worry
about stabilizing.

Eliezer, let me make sure I understand your theory.  If humans
develop nanotech before the singularity, then the notion is that
it will get away from us by some means, and we all die from
grey goo?  But if the singularity comes first, then the resulting
AI develops nanotech and we [in some form] have a fighting

The notion sounded absurd to me at first, but I must admit
it grows on one with consideration.  spike

Read Mach, the explanation is quite clear.  There are no preferred intertial

a) ketosis is what actually kills diabetics, most of the time
b) no organism uses ketosis as its normal state if it doesn't have to; all 
*could*, but none do.
c) The body manifestly lacks the regulation of ketones it displays for glucose
Glucose is kept within narrow limits and conserved in the body; but ketones
are neither properly regulated nor conserved.
d) A prior version of Atkins, called the "meat diet" was canned in the 30's 
due
to a high rate of heart disease.
e) Byproduct of the ketotic cycles, including acetone, are directly toxic

Now none of this proves that ketosis, in toto, is detrimental to modern 
humans.
Weight loss and lowered glucose are good things.  A good scientist who 
respected the health of his followers would accordingly perform animal tests
to determine the long-term effects of ketosis.  Atkins doesn't.

That's better than usual; certainly far better than some of my parent's

That's in the textbooks, actually.  So Atkins is still posing as "persecuted" 
when
his ideas get wide acceptance *provided there is data*. Interesting.  Sounds 
like
he's trying to sucker in conspiracy theorists.

Researchers have tried this technique in hospitals fat loss clinics.  People
coming off the diet typically experience extreme carbohydrate cravings.

Atkins can't possibly be that ignorant.  The liver can process fat to other
things and fat cells take it up avidly.  Plaque regression happens just fine 
w/o
ketosis (c.f. work on Pritikin and Ornish diets)

>No fat mobilization in "GLUCOSIS" according to Adkins...a dangerous

So dangerous every metazoan species on earth that can use it uses it ...

And, interestingly, Eskimos, who eat a ketosis-inducing diet, are more
resistant to ketosis!  Apparently the body dodges ketosis when it can.

You are correct that occaisional ketosis is normal for people and we must
be able to tolerate short periods of it fairly well.  They might still be bad 
for
us.  Or good.  Dr. Atkins apparently doesn't want us to know.

His fault.  Nobody stopped him from doing the experiments.

Humans are valuable.  Is the health of millions of people worth less than
$50,000 for a rodent study?  An omnivore like a pig would indeed be a better
model, although rodents will eat meat.

I have been watching this recent research with some concern, because I
am a vegetarian and eat tofu.  However, we have to be careful when a
single new study comes out that refutes previous studies.  Most studies
show soy foods helping fight cancer and aging.  Maybe tofu does lower
mental acuity, but helps in other ways.

The study did not indicate higher death rates or disease rates among those
who ate tofu.  They seemed to score lower on mental acuity tests, which are
much more subjective.  Such test scores vary between cultural groups and
economic class.  It may simply be that more Americanized Japanese eat less
tofu and have better English language skills than less Americanized Japanese
who eat more tofu and have lessor English language skills.  The differences
may actually be in English-speaking acuity.

I am concerned that the study asked men about "27 foods and drinks" in their
diet.  That is not very many items.  There is no way that they got a good
picture of their overall dietary habits from just 27 questions.  They claim
to have eliminated all other dietary factors except tofu, but I don't see 27
foods and drinks as being a complete dietary accounting.  I also would have
preferred a nutrient workup rather than a food list.  I would want to know
which nutrients were deficient and which were abundant.

I am also concerned about how much difference was really detected.  They
said that those who ate "a lot of tofu" by the time they were "75-80 years
old" scored on tests as if they were five years older.  A few years variance
at that age isn't very much difference.  Those who ate less tofu than "a
lot" will see less of an effect, even if it exists.

I would like to see more study in this area.  In the meantime, I will
continue to eat some tofu, but not a lot of tofu.  I still see a lot more
evidence for the benefits of soy than harmful effects.  It probably will
turn out, that like everything else, soy is good in moderation, but too much
can be harmful.

Most of the recent research on tofu is focussing on chemicals that are
similar to estrogens.  The theory is that they might block real estrogens
and cause an estrogen deficiency in men.  Estrogen is needed for proper
brain functioning, and its some researcher fear its lack may cause problems.

  IAN: I'm also a tofu-eating vegetarian and 
  very concerned by that study!! However, I'm 
  inclined to believe it's accurate BECAUSE the 
  soy-phytochemical genistein has been shown to 
  fight cancer, and it has a property that many
  anti-cancer drugs have, which is reducing the 
  rate of DNA synthesis. That property is great 
  for reducing the proliferation of cells and 
  promoting their death; unfortunately the 
  evidence cited suggests the cytotoxic 
  properties of genistein are nonspecific.

  DNA synthesis is a critical attribute of the
  life cycle of a cell. Here's some data on that:
  http://www.geocities.com/CollegePark/Lab/1580/cycle2.gif 
  http://www.geocities.com/CollegePark/Lab/1580/cycle.html 
  Again, research shows genistein reduces DNA synthesis. 
  There appear to be many health benefits of soybean
  products, however, I believe that brain atrophy 
  is not an acceptable trade off unless genistein 
  treats an otherwise untreatable fatal illness.

  Evidence also suggests that curcumin may kill
  cancer cells. If true, I wonder how? It is
  possible that our explorations into health 
  foods could run into unforeseen disasters.
  A good strategy is probably to eat a wide
  variety of foods, then if one should prove
  harmful, you haven't been overexposed to it.

Nuts! I was just about to ask where you'd been so I could join
this elite subculture.  Too late now, worse the luck. At any rate
you must be exhausted; I'm sorry you had to go to Florida.  The
Mountains of Western North Carolina would have been so much
better.

But, down to business: allow me to introduce myself, Harvey -- I'm
very envious of your waiver, and your authorization to hack with
complete impunity.  Was this a case of co-opting the enemy, or
are you a quasi-covert ! N S A ! operator?

Enjoy your retreat,

Speaking of hormones, does anyone know of some good online 
material (test results) regarding mild testosterone enhancement 
for both men and women with food supplements such as Acetabolan, 
Androplex and Tribulus? Such therapies could have a very 
"Extropian" effect by enhancing one's physical and mental 
strenght (with relatively little effort).

The above food supplements can be found at
http://cuttingedgenutrition.com/cuttingedge/index.html
by the way.

No, no, NO! For god's sake man, trust your instincts
on this one. If an AI singularity comes first, and the
AI *is* fully rational, there is a *major* chance that it
will kill us all. I'm pretty sure it's 99.something %

If nanotech comes first, on the other hand, we *will*
have a fighting chance, certainly if we start planning
a space program (as mentioned in the "SPACE:
How hard IS it to get off Earth?" thread)
and related projects (see my Nov. 14 post in the
above thread for some suggestions) ASAP.

You can run from nanotech, fight it and even
defeat it (eventually), but against a SI god you're
pretty much powerless. If the SI says "die",
you die. And that would be a real shame.

Fuck objective morality; it's all just mental
masturbation, a chimera. It's *definitely not*
worth dying for. NOTHING IN THE UNIVERSE
IS WORTH DYING FOR! By definition. Survival
is an eternal prerequisite, the No.1 sub-goal,
and "pleasure" is the (interim?) meaning of
life. Period. That which helps you to stay alive
and have fun is "good", that which hinders it
is "bad". That's the essence of rational ethics
based on enlightened self-interest. "Enlightened"
simply means "having foresight, thinking ahead" in
this context.

And yes, there is a "better way", and it's called
synchronized uploading.

Nanotechnology will certainly bring on a singularity but not all
singularities are the same. A gray goo accident is pretty singular
but that's not my greatest concern, deliberate abuse is. Eliezer will
correct me if I misrepresent him but I think his point is it would be
safer (for who?) if AI were developed before Nanotechnology
because then an intelligence greater than human would be around
to manage this awesome new force. Perhaps he's right, but
personally I'd like to see both fields develop as fast as possible
and may the best man win. The singularity will be a very dangerous
time and may well kill me but I'm willing to take my chances with it.
I'll tell you one thing, I'd really hate for it to arrive the day after I die
of old age, nobody wants to be the last man to die in a war.

Environmentalists, Consumers, Farmers: 'No to Frankenfoods!'

Environmentalists, Consumers and Farmers Say 'No to Frankenfoods!' 
This Thanksgiving 
To: National Desk 
Contact: Mark Whiteis-Helm of Friends of the Earth, 
 202-783-7400, ext. 102; Web site: http://www.foe.org 

WASHINGTON, Nov. 24 /U.S. Newswire/ -- Friends of the Earth (FoE), 
the Organic Consumers Association, and concerned farmers and citizens 
rallied today outside a Safeway store in the nation's capital calling 
for the supermarket chain to go "genetically engineered (GE) free" in 
its store brand of products. 

FoE noted that genetically engineered ingredients are present in 
approximately 60 percent to 70 percent of all processed foods lining 
our supermarket shelves, including baby formula, corn chips, veggie 
burgers, frozen meals and ice cream. They also called attention to 
the numerous health risks associated with GE foods: the threat that 
new allergens and toxins could be introduced into our food supply; 
and the possibility that GE foods could cause increased resistance to 
antibiotics. Environmental threats like the toxic effects on Monarch 
butterflies are also a concern. 

"These foods are not safety tested by the FDA before they go onto 
the market, and they are not labeled, " said Friends of the Earth 
President Dr. Brent Blackwelder. "Consumers are being used as guinea 
pigs and are being denied the right to make informed choices about 
the food they eat and feed their families." 

The group will hold its next rally in Seattle during the WTO 
meetings on Thursday, Dec. 2. For more information, contact FoE in 
Seattle at 206-448-9444 or 206-953-0347 (cell).

I used to do work for an agency that did not officially exist.  Now I am
only working in the commercial sector.  Many of the old-timers from the '80s
will remember that.

(By-the-way, putting spaces inbetween the letters doesn't fool even the most

I'm not worried about grey goo.  Any half-sane designer should be able
to design systems that simply aren't vulnerable to the problem.

What I'm worried about is nanowar.  Now that I'm finally studying
history (read _The Guns of August_ on WWI, working on _The Rise and Fall
of the Third Reich_ about WWII), I become more and more convinced that
the weapons *will* be developed, and, having been developed, *will* be
used.  Real wars, not little pretend wars like we have nowadays, are
fought with every possible tool.

...but rest assured that I still know, as I've known for the last five
years, that everyone else's views on this subject are shot through with
logical flaws.  I can't ever recall someone saying to me:  "You know, I
don't claim to know the ultimate answers on this subject, but your
answers are obviously wrong because..."  Everyone who says I'm wrong
claims to know all they need to know about morality.  Even you, Damien.

Where's the courage to build a philosophy based on discovering morality,
instead of claiming to have it?  Where is the spirit of science?  Where
is the quest for truth?

To me the question is not "Do goals exist?" but "Can goals exist?"  If
the cosmic substrate can construct cognitive events as ontological
matter (qualia), can it construct teleologies?  The question deserves investigation.

Eliezer.

PS:  Actually, I dimly recall that Mitchell Porter challenged my 1996
claim that "the Powers would be ethical" on the grounds that my
conception of ethics was anthropomorphic, a conclusion I later came to myself.

Let's apply the Bayesian Probability Theorem.  If, speaking about an
event on which there is great controversy and no access to immediate
evidence, Human A says vis theory is 70% likely to be right and Human B
says vis theory is 99% likely to be right, which one is more likely to
be totally wrong?

Trust me:  I don't think I'm infallible.

Maybe.  But if humanity survives nanotech, sooner or later it'll still
come face-to-face with a greater-than-human intelligence.  As you admit.

I wouldn't trust den Otter on this one, Spike.  Long before he started
talking about "synchronized uploading" he believed that only one Power
could survive, and he plans to be it.  He'll take your money, and while
you're waiting for your journey into the promised land, he'll jump into
the "experimental prototype hardware" and leave you suckers to burn.

[1] I thought this quasi-coded triplet was just the thing

[2] But the converse -- "inbetween" didn't fool my basic

"understanding" is the tongue that tastes itself- to
make the program "understand" introduce a paradoxical
circuit, its inability to understand anything will
surmount to its "understanding" of everything.

 It seems to have all the qualitys an ideal parent

Just a few days ago, Sean, I posted a message in another
connection containing the following:


                 "God is a circle whose centre is everywhere and
                 the circumference nowhere."

                 and whose circumference is nowhere."

                                                         - Carl Jung

After a little more reflection on Sean's post, it occurred to me that
many people (but not necessarily Alexander) do misunderstand the
concept of  "the expansion of the universe" [1] because it is a
misnomer, and [2] because of the complementary notion of "The Big
Bang".  Both seem to imply a preferred locus.

I hope, without insulting anyone's intelligence, the following simplified
description will be helpful to some members.

Rather than remark that "the Universe is expanding" it is much clearer
to state that it is space itself that is expanding. It's not really that
the galaxies are moving away from us; as space expands, it carries
the galaxies along with it; the analogy of spots on an inflating balloon
is often used here. We are not at the center, as you might naively think
from the astronomical observations that generated the theory; every
galaxy would see every other galaxy rushing away from it, and the
farther the galaxy the faster the recession [as a result of the geometry
of the local perspective].

Now, the idea that the Universe was created in a single moment and has
been expanding ever since is used as the generally accepted model of
the origin of our cosmos (although there are difficulties). The term "Big
Bang" is also a misnomer; nothing really exploded and because the result
was the creation of space, the locus of this event is undecidable;  an
explosion implies something blown outward into something else, but since
it was space that was created, there isn't anything into which it could
begin and continue expanding.

On the lighter side, a university student riding on a train with Dr. Einstein
tapped the great man on the shoulder, and asked: "Excuse me professor,
but does New York stop by this train?"

Btw, the earth does not rotate around the sun any more than the 
sun rotates around the earth; they rotate around a common point 
between them (if we bracket the gravitational effects of the other 
planets) - this point is much closer to the sun than it is to the earth 
due to the "massive" disparity in mass between them.

But, did we not pretty much agree that a space program
may not help, for replicating nanoassemblers might easily
be blasted loose from the surface of a planet by a stray
meteorite, never mind intentional spewing forth of tiny
amounts of goo.  Nanobots travel better than we do.

Sure.  Humans have demonstrated a perfectly contented willingness
to risk *innocent lives* of neutral noncombatants in order to gain
a military advantage over enemies.  For instance, the commically
vast stockpiles of nukes amassed by the U.S. and the commies.
Why so damn many?  If humans do this sorta thing, why would
not nations take reckless chances with nanoreplicators, trying to
outmaneuver the next dictator over, thereby risking all mankind?

Again, we have no other example but our own existence. We might have 2-4 
hundred billion stars to comprise the galaxy, or even tens of trillions to 
comprise  the Local Group, that contain a rich number of earth-like worlds. 
Until something  develops that can reason and create technology; its a  grand 
guessing-game.

*Quantum fuel for future computers. Research suggests how software
marketplace might change.  Imagine a world where software is computational
fuel  churned out by a processing plant and shipped down an optical-fiber
pipeline to your computer, where its consumed and destroyed. That just
might be the model for a future generation of quantum computers, new
research suggests. (MSNBC Nov. 25 99)

**Nanovation Technologies in the Toronto Star. Shedding light on the
photonics era
 THE UBIQUITOUS computer chip, based on silicon, has radically changed the
world in which we live. But as silicon approaches its physical limits in
miniaturization and speed, we are moving into a new world, based on the
properties of light, the world of photonics, which will herald the next $1
trillion industry.

Doubly twisted. PET(R*)-9 is the first polymer crystal with twists along two

needle-like particles are not part of the polymer but were used to find the
polymer's orientation within the crystal. As in the famous line from the
1967 movie "The Graduate," the importance of polymers in modern life can be
expressed in one word: plastics. To develop new polymer-based materials for

The original post (long since lost) said to ignore that
quibble.  The argument is over whether "the sun rotates
around the earth" is just as true as "the earth rotates
around the sun".  Technically, as you point out, both
rotate around a common mass, but to quibble back, that 
point is actually inside the sun.  

In any case there is a center of rotation;
wherever it is, the claim "the sun/earth do not go around
that point" would be wrong.

The following is a response to a query about funding on the self-aware AI
mailing list at topica.com.  I am cross-posting to the extropian list in
hopes it will be of interest to others.  Thank you for your input!

I started brainstorming...

-------------
Sources of funding:

	* Government organizations
		|- Grants
		|- Fellowships
		|- Research stipends

	* Professional associations
		|- Awards
		|- Fellowships

	* Commercial enterprises
		|- R&D funding/contracting
		|- Venture capital for start-up

Is there anything I missed?

Optimally, these sources could be combined.  For example, receiving a
fellowship to do research at a university, being paid a stipend, receiving
government grants and awards from professional associations, and as the
icing on the cake, having some corporation take interest in your project and
provide additional funding.

I am going to create a web site with resources of interest to researchers in
many fields including AI, which I should have ready some time in January.  I
think funding opportunities would be a great asset, so I will do some
investigating in this area.
-------------

Research groups:

Some of the sources of funding will be for established research groups at
universities.  Others will be for research at government institutions.  Yet
others might be awarded to individual/independent investigators.

What goals should we pursue here?

	* Do we each do our own thing, and try to find funding on our own?
This would make most sense in the context of us each being independent or
affiliated with our own universities or research institutions.  Funding
sources would likely be university fellowships and/or government grants.

	* Do we form a research group?
This would allow collaborative research and distributed development.
Funding sources might involve grants from government organizations.  Perhaps
it would be possible to receive funding from and use resources at several
universities.

	* Do we go commercial?
The commercial applications for a self-aware AI are boundless.  We could
contract ourselves out to corporate R&D labs.  We might sell or rent our
intellectual property.  We could even create our own start-up company
specializing in self-aware AI R&D, creating innovative products and
providing unparalleled services, spinning off various commercial
subdivisions, and leasing our technology to other corporations.

The latter is my hope for Extropian Technologies, which alas, is only an
Internet Services and Technology Consulting company at the moment.  Come to
think of it, our commercial enterprise might indeed involve Internet
services and technology consulting, though at an entirely different scale.
=)

My feeling is that these options might be best exercised chronologically
from first to last.  First, we get involved in research at universities.
Then we'll run our own labs or programs there, and create the opportunity
for collaboration with other institutions.  Eventually, we'll be in a

The Atkins diet is an extremely low carb diet which throws your body
into a state called ketosis. Here is a comment by Curt Adams from April
1998: 
This actually does work. When you eat virtually no carbohydrates your
citric acid cycle fails and your body switches to an alternate fat
oxidation system. Your body has to ship large quantities of fats in
ketones around in the blood. Since your kidney lack the ability to
retain these, they get lost in the urine.
*******************************************
This information is reasonably accurate.

The quote resumes:
 The situation resembles that of somebody with advanced diabetes,
although this kind of ketosis won't kill you directly.
********************************************
The condition which damages diabetics is called ketoacidosis;  it is not
the same as ketosis.  The underlying metabolic defects in a diabetic
system lead to a metabolic derangment characterised by loss of pH
control in the body;  any system not plagued by these defects can adapt
to ongoing ketosis.

Quote resumes: 
You can lose weight like crazy on this plan. You will also be physically
weak, often nauseous, and you will smell like nail polish remover.
*****************************************
These problems tend to result from dehydration & electrolyte imbalance,
which can also be induced by exercise;  in both cases, rehydration &
supplementation are fairly simple.

Quote resumes:
 If you go on the diet and then off it, you will gain back all you lost.
*******************************************
This is one of the most frequently levelled charges against this type of
diet.  It happens to be correct, but the same is true of *any* reducing
diet.  If you go back to a diet which made you gain weight without
increased exercise or some such, yes, the weight will gradually return.

Quote resumes:
 If you stay on it, you'll subject your body indefinitely to a metabolic
regime it's manifestly not adapted for.
***************************************
Ketosis is only to be maintained until the goal weight is reached.  At
that point, carbohydrates are gradually reintroduced into the diet until
ketosis ends & weight loss stops.  

Quote resumes:
 Research on the long-term safety of ketotic diets is zilch, which I
consider inexcusable given than Dr. Atkins has been pushing this diet
for 25 years. Not even a rodent study! Dr. Atkins' diet may be a good
thing, but he is a quack.
*******************************************
These statements are more or less accurate.  Long term atudies are
needed, but unlikely as this sort of regimen flies in the face of
current dietary recommendations;  it is so "obviously wrong" that no one
is bothering to look.
As to atkins-as-quack, this holds a certain amount of truth as well.
While I believe he got the low-carbohydrate thing mostly right (as well
as the utility of antioxidants & other nutrients), he advocates some
practices (ex: chelation therapy) that have been pretty thoroughly
disproven;  he also
preaches against virtually all modern pharmaceuticals & seems to think
that everyone should go low-carb ( it does not work for everyone,
individual chemistries vary).

For the record, I'm on a low carb regimen of my own design & have lost
almost 40lbs in abot 5 months.  I only spoke up because the common media
view of low carb dieters is some guy in a trailer park eating fried
chicken & sausages all the doodah day;  I put a fair amount of thought
into this before adopting it & I'm doing well on the system I came up
with.

Still, the low-carb meme does have some almost cultish adherents;  on
the usenet group alt.diet.support.low.carb, people on different low carb
diets argue strenuously over whose is the One True Way.  I try to think
of it as a chance to see memetic evolution in action.

I've thought about this a fair amount, especially given some of
Robin's comments on the importance of being first.

Ok, lets assume that one of us is *first*.  So what?

I have had the opportunity over the last 12+ years, particularly the
last 2 years, to spend much of my time by myself.  I suspect this
would contrast significantly to most list members unless they are
living out in the woods someplace.  Many years ago, I also spent
some time in an isolation tank.  These types of experiences are
revealing (and almost required) for a proper discussion regarding
the situation of "being the first".  As a general comment on my
experiences, I would say that I suspect humans have relatively strong
drives for not being alone.

So, say the first person willing to risk it all, uploads, then monopolizes
all the computronium.  They are probably years away from striking up a
productive conversation with any other SIs (if they even exist)
[with the caveat of course, that they aren't already "here"].

So you are sitting there with 10^50+ Instructions Per Year doing *what*?  

People such as Anders & Robin have commented on all of the interesting
unsolved problems that you could devote your attention to, but what
is the point if you don't get to show the solutions to anybody?  Can pure
intellectual exercises keep you sane and interested enough to solve them?

My feeling is that being a "sole-occupant" SI is going to get very boring
very fast.  Either you tip over the edge into insanity, or you rip out
all the emotional drives and preprogrammed goals and become nothing but
an automaton (about as interesting as a washing machine with a lot more
capacity).

The only thing that seems to make sense (since you have the capacity)
is to upload everyone (who wants to be uploaded).  Then it least things
are really interesting while everyone expands their capacity and the
politics of SI management come into existence and sort themselves out.

I agree that this has the odor of being an altruistic "nice" idea.
But, can anyone paint me a picture of themselves post-uploading with
clear descriptions of what they intend to do (potentially by themselves)
for the next trillion years?

Robert

I suspect that even narcissism has its limits over gigantic amounts of time. 
Perhaps they would create beings in sub-universes to interact with?  Interact 
may also include create and destroy; just to entertain.  Also, is there a 
known neurological brain-fuction that generates boredom? Perhaps an 
Uber-Being with no such neurological modulus (or its non-carbon analog) would 
ever get bored?

I would suggest reading John Earman's _World Enough and Space-Time: Absolute
versys Relational Theories of Space and Time and Lawrence Sklar's _Space ,
Time, and Spacetime_.  Both books discuss Newton's rotating bucket thought
experiment and a few others of his.  Also, the former actually has the full
text of Newton's Scholium.  I also recommend it because the second chapter
is devoted to no less than half a dozen different views of classical
spacetime, from Mach's to Aristotle's.

My estimate is based on the very reasonable assumption that a 
SI wouldn't need anyone else (as the reader may recall we've 
discussed this before and Eliezer was in full agreement back 
then), and wouldn't be bound by redundant evolutionary 
adaptations such as altruism. Add to that the fact that 
humans, if allowed to continue freely with their development 
after the SI has ascended, would most likely create and/or 
become superintelligences (i.e. competion for resources and 
a potential threat), and you have a pretty strong argument 
for extinction. Now, where does that 70% figure come from??
 
> Trust me:  I don't think I'm infallible.

But nonetheless you are prepared to act as if you *were* 
infallible...The moment you activate your ASI Golem, you 
and you alone will have passed judgement on the world, 
using your finite wisdom.

Of course. But, so what? The primary aim of the ascension 
initiative isn't to save "humanity", but to save *oneself*. 
And don't even try to get sanctimonious on me, Eliezer, as 
saving humanity isn't your primary concern either. Let's 
forget saving the world for a minute, ok, we're talking 
about naked survival here (which may not matter to you, 
but it certainly matters to me and a whole lot of others).
 
> > [Wacky rant on "why subjective morality is the objective truth" deleted.]

Rant yes, wacky my ass! Morality is always subjective,
because it only exists in the minds of subjective creatures. 
As there is no objective creature, there can be no objective 
morality. Objective truth (reality), on the other hand, is 
quite real, but not very relevant unless placed in the context 
of some subjective creature's goal system. 

Your obsession with "the Objective" is, IMHO, essentially
religious in nature and has little to do with common sense. 
The very fact that you refuse to give survival its rightful 
(top) place indicates that there is a serious flaw in your 
logic department. Usually I don't bother to argue with the 
religious, but since you are a potentially ASI-spawning genius 
*and* apparently have a considerable influence on many list 
members, I don't really have a choice.

Of course not. Trust no-one, Spike, and certainly not Eliezer, 
who values the Singularity more than your, mine or anyone else's
existence. Or maybe you *can* "trust" us, as we're both pretty
honest about what could happen. Both our motivations (and those 
of everyone else) are essentially selfish of course; the only 
real difference is that Eliezer is selfishly trying to accomplish
something which probably isn't in his enlightened, rational
("objective") self-interest.

Only one Power is (obviously) the only stable, and therefore
"ideal", situation from that one Power's perspective. Yes, of
course I'd like to be the one, but...if the choice is (near-
certain) death or shared godhood, I'm inclined to choose the 
latter.

> He'll take your money, and while
> you're waiting for your journey into the promised land, 

Hey, you're the Pied Piper here, dude! The ASI-Singularity
is the abyss towards which the lemmings are dancing, 
hypnotized by the gaily tunes of World Peace, Universal Love 
and Unlimited Wisdom. They're in for one hell of a rude, 
albeit mercifully short, awakening...

> he'll jump into
> the "experimental prototype hardware" and leave you suckers to burn.

Oh, now I'm flattered. Apparently you think that I could 
trick everyone directly involved in the project (which 
could easily be a hundred people or more) and do a "perfect" 
ascension on the sly with some experimental prototype, which, 
foolishly, was left completely unguarded. Somehow I don't think 
that the others would be SUCH morons (and if they were, they'd 
*deserve* to get cheated). *Of course* no-one could trust anyone
else *completely*. For example, would you leave anyone on this 
list alone in a room with a fully functional uploader for even 
5 minutes? I sure wouldn't. People betray eachother for the 
most petty reasons, and instant godhood would be a truly 
unprecedented temptation. Consequently, the security protocols 
would have to be "unprecedented" as well. Duh!

Now Eliezer seems to think, or should I say wants *you* to think
(remember, this guy's got his own agenda), that synchronized
uploading would only make sense if a bunch of noble, selfless
saints did it. This is clearly not true. In the REAL world, it is 
perfectly feasible to have fruitful cooperation without 100%
mutual trust. It is the very basis of our society, and indeed
nature itself.

The synchronized uploading scenario is the classical prisoner's
dilemma. Of course we can expect some attempts at defection,
and should take the appropriate precautions. No other scenario 
gives you a better fighting chance than this one. Throwing yourself
at the mercy of some artificial god is fit for simple religious
sheep, not proud, individualistic transhumanists. Your 
technophilia has blinded you all.

Yes you do; you stated in the original post, regarding
Eliezer's AI-will-save-us scenario, that "The notion sounded 
absurd to me at first". There you have it, that was your
common sense talking, your rational instinct for self-
preservation. Only later did your vision get blurred by
Eliezer's relentless smooth talk, which apparently
manages to obscure the simple fact that he cares
about the Singularity and the Singularity alone. When
it really comes down to it you are expendable to him.
He'll "leave you suckers to burn", as he so eloquently
put it.

Hmmm, would it really be that easy to escape earth's 
gravity well & atmosphere? It would take one helluva
meteorite to do that, IMO, and those are rather rare.
Even then the nanites would just drift around, not really
doing much. In the meantime we'd be working hard on 
uploading etc.in our Martian (or whatever) base.

Nanites are only (truly) dangerous when controlled by
an intelligence. As long as that intelligence is merely
human, we have a fighting chance. Fight nanites with
nanites, incinerate them with nukes, take out their
operators, run from them at the highest achievable
% of lightspeed, fool their sensors (with infiltrator 
nanites, for example) etc. A reasonably fair fight. 
When fighting an ASI with nano (and JHWH knows 
what other) powers, on the other hand,  the odds are 
*badly* against you. 

> Eliezer, what is your notion?  

Better ask some "neutral" third party (he's rather biased, you
know, and of course so am I).

That's in the textbooks, actually.  So Atkins is still posing as
"persecuted"
when his ideas get wide acceptance *provided there is data*. Interesting.
Sounds
like he's trying to sucker in conspiracy theorists.

James Responds:  Your comment is unfair.   The Adkins is being persecuted
in the newspapers.  Just prior to finding this quote in Adkins latest book,
I
read a newspaper article claiming ketones could not sustain brain function
and the body must make glucose by digesting its own muscle.  Adkins was
simply laughing off mindless repeated memes and quoted standard
sources regarding ketones.

James Asks:   So it is not ketosis that kills diabetics?

James, a conspiracy theorist [and libertarian] for 30 years who never heard
of Adkins (or is it Atkins?) until a couple months ago.

    Yikes!  Talk about mindless propagation of memes.  The State propagates
"anti-Conspiracy" memes to defend itself.  A reasonable reading of history,
try Will and Ariel Durant for instance, shows the history of States to be
one bloody conspiracy against liberty after another.

The cause of the metabolic pH derangement *is* the production of ketone
bodies (i.e. ketosis) which are acidic.  Too much acid exhausts the ability
of the kidney to maintain acid-base balance and down you go.  (Stryer's
Biochemistry, 3rd edition, p 641-642)
It's not a problem with starvation ketosis because the body doesn't make
that many ketone bodies.  I suppose it could be a problem with Atkins-style
ketosis (more food = more ketones) but I've never heard of it; given the 
medical
community's take on Atkins that makes me think it's not a problem.

Part of this is from dehydration and electrolyte imbalance,
directly caused by the ketosis and presumably treatable.
But part is from low blood sugar, which weakens glycolytic
muscle and the brain, and part from the weird chemicals
that come out of the process like acetone, plus whatever
the sulfur ends up as.

True as far as I know.  Controlled comparisons of ketotic diets with non-
ketotic diets showed they were similar in both amount lost and regained.
Reduced hunger was contentious; studies differed, as I recall.

Dr. Atkins may have changed his recommendations.  He was originally 
recommending lifetime borderline ketosis.  As a short-term weight loss 
method, the Atkins diet doesn't worry me much.  As I understand, though, 
Atkins still recommends very-low-carb lifetime diets and that could cause
trouble with vitamin deficiency or with all those sulfur-containing amino
acids.

When I refer to Atkins as a "quack" I don't say he's necessarily wrong, but
that he hasn't performed ethically or scientifically adequate tests.  He may
actually be right, but if so it's by dumb cluck luck.

Part of my frustration with Atkins is that I think low-carb diets truly 
deserve
investigation.  They're probably useful for short-term weight loss; some
good scientific work would delimit the use of it and perhaps even find
ways around the disadvantages.

I don't know.  However I've been watching some of the "nature films" over the 
holiday.  Some concerning the Serengati Plains...and the Kalahari Desert.  On 
the surface it appears that the other critters have a LOT more to worry about 
other  than over eating.  Like GETTING ate.  Even the predators on top of the 
food chain still have that problem.  I'm reminded in particular of a  
"documentary" regarding Lions and Hyenas.

It occurs to me also that any other critter that would be in danger of 
experiencing "overeating" problems would be domestic animals.  Domestic 
animals fall into two categories.  Pets and everything else.  The "everything 
else" category would be heavy on "food animals".....like feedlot cattle.  
They don't live long enough to worry about "over eating syndromes".

Possiby we would need to look at our pets?  At first blush it would appear 
that pets live longer than their counterparts "in the wild".  

Beats me...my nickel's worth.

+Atkins can't possibly be that ignorant.  The liver can process fat to other
+things and fat cells take it up avidly.

James Admits:  Maybe that isn't what he said...my memory isn't perfect.
However, "fat cells take it up avidly" is exactly what we don't want to

and what I meant when I said depositing fat "God Knows Where!".
What are these other things fat is processed to in the liver without

The only people I *do* trust in this life are those who act

It is logical to work towards a singularity, on the belief that

Humans yes, but we're talking about Posthuman Powers here;
you can't just project our hopes, fears and limitations on them
(except, presumably, the most basic ones like rationality and 
the survival drive).

I'll gladly leave that to my future self. Not my problem. And should
no god-like inspiration be forthcoming (which I rather doubt), I could
create all sorts of virtual worlds, in which I, or rather a *part* of
me, could interact with any number of virtual characters or other parts
of me, with or without me "knowing" it (gives a whole new meaning
to phrases like "playing with yourself" or "go fuck yourself", eh?), and 
have lots of fun. I could have Medievalworld, Westworld, Romanworld,
Futureland, Disneyland etc. etc. My "recreational" persona wouldn't 
know pain, sorrow or boredom, unless that was part of the game. Oh, 
and other parts of me would be keeping an eye on the universe, of 
course, and learning as much about it as possible.

I think you are imagining a more sudden transition than I find plausible.
But if you had more CPU than you want to use running a single copy of
yourself very fast, because interactions with humans is too slow, you
could just create copies of yourself to interact with.  And if that wasn't
satisfying enough, you could upload ten people and makes lots of copies of
each of them.  I seriously doubt that after a thousand people had been
uploaded you'd be pining for more, rather than enjoying interacting with
perhaps billions of copies each of the thousand humans uploaded.

When you refer to the "establishment"  I assume you're referring to the 
scientific
and medical establishments, which have authority (kinda) to get things done.
Newspapers and such do say some goofy things but I don't think the LA Times
is the source of Atkins' or your complaints.

My point is that the knowledgeable people and the decision-makers are aware
of the data supporting (or not) Atkins' claims and make reasonable 
conclusions.
Where Atkins' claims have data, they agree.  If ketotic diets were good and 
safe,
and if Atkins (or somebody else) were to do studies demonstrating this, 
ketotic
diets would become a standard part of the weight-loss arsenal (or anything 
else it's useful for).

Primarily it goes into energy, which gets used to convert pyruvate back into
glucose, so the brain and muscle can leave aerobic metabolism on low.  It
can also make or interconvert most amino acids.  The glycerol moiety can
be made into glucose, but not the rest.

>James Wonders:  Is there never any ketosis on the Priikin and Ornish diets?
There's always a little bit of ketones about but Pritikin and Ornish should 
not
increase it over the basal level: no starvation and plenty of glucose.

Stryer's says the adipocytes just dump fatty acids into the blood, where they
complex with blood proteins.  Other cells can take up the fatty acids 
directly.
Normally, ketone bodies are just another way to ship fat energy around 
(I'm not sure why - they are more soluble).  In Atkins-style ketosis, however,
the body cannot use as much of the ketone bodies as it makes, so they
pile up in the blood and eventually get lost through the kidneys.

A random, off-topic thought occurred to me in response to this.

It seems that most of the vocal opinion on this list is against the people
protesting the genetic engineering of foods.  Most comments seem to think
that their fears of technology destroying the planet are absurd.  Then, on
another topic, most of the vocal opinion feels that nanotech will destroy
the earth, and that we should escape off-earth to avoid the catastrophe.  We
denigrate the people who want to ban genetic engineering and cloning, yet we
want to be safe in our off-earth base where nanotech capable of destroying
us would not exist.

We may have more in common with the Luddites than we thought, in terms of
survival strategy.  The only difference is that we may have a better view of
which technologies are likely to destroy the earth.

This prediction doesn't seem to be confirmed by the data
Amara pointed us to (Table 4, P. Frisch et al,
"Dust in the Local Interstellar Wind" ApJ 1 Nov 1999.)
If anything, Si seems to be the left out element, not C.

Hi Robin,

I just spent a few hours rereading parts of the book and would like to

I would try to understand and upgrade myself.  That's more than enough
interesting material to occupy me until my mind ages into senescence,
assuming I'm not successful in uphacking around it.  If my mind did age
into senescence, I'd have to suspend my code, activate the backup
version, let me2 look at me1's old notes, and hope the process could be iterated.

Actually, I'd really want three people in there.  Two to take turns
hacking suspended versions (that way both can be upgraded and both can
gain experience in upload-hacking), and one baseline normal to
supervise.  Any of the three would probably have the opportunity to
"seize power", so den Otter will have to come up with something more
complicated and error-prone for his Community of Selfish Uploads.

How *do* you plan to do upgrades in perfect synchronization, den Otter?

As a relatively neutral (if somewhat opinionated) third party, I'd have to say
that this debate misses the point.

If Eli's seed AI scenario is possible at all, no choice we make can possibly
prevent it from happening.  The first SI will emerge decades before human
uploading is possible, and the only real question is what it will evolve from.
 You only need around a TeraFLOPS for human-equivalent hardware, and we've
built that already (the first PeraFLOPS machine is expected to be operational
around 2006-2008).

If, OTOH, exponential self-improvement is not possible unless you are already
well beyond human intelligence levels, neither the seed AI nor an upload is
going to be an instant demigod.  Instead we'll be stuck with several decades
of gradual, society-wide augmentation and (probably) the eventual ascention of
a significant fraction of the population.  The major risk here is the
instability of a society with immature nanotech, and the best insurance policy
is to look for ways to reduce the risk of genocidal nanowars.

What it really comes down to is that I don't consider myself competent
to judge others as being "expendable" - or inexpendable.  I leave such
matters to SIs.  I would like, personally, for as much of humanity to go
through the Singularity as possible, both because I'm sentimentally fond
of the human race and because we might turn out to be valuable.

If the SIs decide to exterminate you, Spike, I will no more object than
I would object if they decided to exterminate me.  I'm not responsible
for the behavior of beings that are smarter than I am.  First of all, I
don't know what they're going to do, so my creation of SIs doesn't imply
approval of any specific action.  And if I did know, I would still
refuse to be held responsible.  The smartest being in the chain of
causality is the one with final responsibility.  If the SIs go haywire
and do something dumb, then I, as the "smartest being" in the chain,
will be at fault for the outcome.  But I will not and cannot take
responsibility for the sane decisions of a better mind.  In my system of
moral philosophy, I am not the center of the Universe.

But don't let my own peculiar moral philosophy obscure the fact that
building an AI is still the best thing from a selfish perspective.  You
know you can't trust den Otter.  Would you trust a being if you could
read the source code?  You know how long it'll take to get uploading
working.  Don't you think AI has a better chance of actually showing up
before you personally, if not all humans, get eaten by goo?

Look at it this way.  You have a choice of who to trust.  You can trust
den Otter, who is absolutely certain that personal survival is the only
rational goal and that all others are dirt to be ground beneath his heel
if he can get away with it.  Or you can trust an AI with open source
code and no human selfishness.  Take your pick.

Of course, I'm being a bit hypothetical here.  Personally, I find it
highly doubtful that den Otter could keep his insane philosophy under
the pressure of intelligence enhancement.  I wouldn't stop him if he
were climbing into an uploading kiosk right now; I'd help him in and
press the button.  A Singularity's a Singularity.  The general issue I
want settled is not selfishness versus altruism, or uploading versus AI:
 I want it established that with other threats arriving, we can't afford
to be picky about what kind of a Singularity we take, much less be picky
about who gets to be first.

den Otter legitimately points out that this result may derive from my
own commitment to a Singularity, any Singularity, on nearly first
principles.  So it does.  But that doesn't mean that selfish logic can't
arrive at the same conclusions.  Remember, aside from my fondness for
humanity and my own curiosity, I don't care if the Singularity arrives
in five years or five thousand.  den Otter and I both agree that a
Singularity of some sort is inevitable, if humanity survives.  I'm in a
hurry because I think that humanity has a good chance of being wiped out
by nanowar.  den Otter is in a hurry because he thinks the first
superintelligence(s) will act to wipe out everyone else.  Maybe it's a
good thing we don't share each other's world-models, because that would
be depressing.

What "neutral" third parties?  Is there anyone here who knows enough to
have an opinion and doesn't have one?

This is the fundamental disagreement.  I simply don't believe in
competition between SIs.  I think the motives converge, and multiple SIs
would merge, or all but one would commit suicide, or whatever.

So why are we still here?  This has to have happened at least once

Like I said in the other post, the SI passes judgement.  I'm not the
smartest being in this chain of causality.

Oh, and ignore the "ASI" part.  den Otter has previously admitted that
"human" and "artificial" SIs should be indistinguishable after the fact.

Yes, but *my* primary concern is the ultimate good of the Universe; not
me, not my country, not my species, not even sentient life.  I think a
little sanctimoniousness is called for.

Just kidding, of course.  I've never tried to imply that others have a
"responsibility" to do what's right, any more than you have a
"responsibility" to believe the sky is blue.  I am not the judge of my
fellow humans.  I just present my reasons for believing why a particular
action is right; the rest is up to you.

Me, religious?  I've tried to show the reasoning associated with my
goals in considerable detail; you simply rest on the blatant assertion
that survival is the only goal.  I cannot comprehend how it is that you
can see every emotion as a non-binding evolutionary artifact with the
sole exception of selfishness.  It's as if Einstein formulated General
Relativity with the proviso that it doesn't work on Tuesdays.

Yes, survival is sometimes a prerequisite for other goals, although
there are dozens of goals for which this is trivially or nontrivially
untrue.  But it still doesn't exist within the system unless there are
other goals to give rise to it, and you never did explain where those
other goals are, or where they come from.

Are they arbitrary?  Why can't you program an "ASI" to upload everyone? 
Are they predetermined?  How could there be any competition between SIs?

Your logic only works if the *ultimate* motives of SI, not just subgoals
like survival, are (1) absolutely predetermined and (2)
observer-dependent.  I don't see any plausible way for this to happen. 
I mean, in theory, I can create an AI with no concept of "self", just a
mental model of an internal collection of modules which is part of the
model of the rest of the Universe.  If this AI becomes selfish, which
module is the "self"?  Which function in the module?  Which line of
source code in the function?

"Selfishly"?  Which part of me is "myself"?  I see no reason there

Of course you could.  Such double-crosses have happened thousands of
times in recorded history.  Are you going to leave three people to guard
it?  Why shouldn't they just climb in and ditch the rest of you?  Are
you going to write software that guarantees that you're upgraded in
unison?  Who writes the software?  Who debugs the software?  Even if you
can all upgrade in perfect synchrony, which will be impossible because
all the early upgrades will require individualized attention, what
happens when the first upgrade to turn vis attention to a particular
point spots a flaw in the software?

Are you going to scan in everyone simultaneously?  How, exactly?  Let's
say den Otter is the first one scanned.  He is then suspended so he
can't outrace everyone else.  But now he's helpless.  Now he's a
competitor.  Now he's superfluous to the Cause.  So he gets flushed.  Repeat.

Sooner or later, you're going to fall out of synchrony and wind up in a
race condition.  One mistake is all it takes, and with something of this
magnitude, there's no way you're going to get it right the first time. 
Human history is laced with backstabbings, and your scenario contains
unprecedented opportunities for betrayal.

Of course, I think that none of this matters, but I'm given to
understand that you don't share my "lemming" opinion.  But if you get
that far, please allow me to offer my services.  I'll run you all
through the uploading machinery, start you all up simultaneously, and
then walk away.  Please feel free to take advantage of the lemming's
touching faith and altruism.

In fact, you could even upload me, then ask me to act as a judge to
ensure that others are upgraded in synchrony, or even to do the
upgrading, although I wouldn't be upgraded myself.  Don't trust me? 
Can't see my source code?  I could write an AI for you who would do the
same thing...

Okay, so on your list of blatant technological impossibilities, ranging
from perfect uploading developed without a testing stage, to uploading
developed before nanotechnological weaponry, we can now add security
protocols which must be developed by humans to be absolutely perfect on
a binary level under the scrutiny of superintelligence, which can ensure
that the upgrading of enormously complex structures ("minds") remains in
perfect synchrony of the extremely high-level quantity called intelligence.

den Otter, if I had to build something that good, it would be a
self-modifying AI.  And if I wasn't allowed to do it with a
self-modifying AI, I'd give up.  That's an engineering opinion.

The problem you've cited requires a security protocol with an
intelligence equalling or exceeding the beings on whom cooperation is
being enforced.

Oh, and may I require what happens when the time comes for you guys to
come out of the little box?  Who gets first access to the nanomachines? 
Do you all have to unanimously agree on any output coming out of your
nanocomputer?  Wouldn't that create an interesting opportunity for
filibusters?  I have this image of you and your fellow schemers locked
in a little black box for eternity trying to gain the maximum advantage
once you come out...

WWW (circa 1991) tends to increase the transmissions of both riotous lies and 
rumors; as well as their antedate.  It does take some patience and maturity 
to wait for the antedate to emerge though.

We basically are only now at the social/techno point of developing the means 
to detect Tecnological Cultures like dear, professor Kardashev , described 
clear back when Premeeir Krushchev was arming Doctor Castro.  To be able to 
see deligtful, creative star formations (sauce for silicon & carbon alike); 
or dollops of dark matter, may take centuries. More likely, we will like get 
better cheaper faster technology to detect these buggers.

Let me rephrase that:  Given den Otter's assertion that SIs would be in
competition for resources, a proposition about which I am agnostic (what
resources? for doing what, exactly?), or rather that multiple SIs could
not use resources efficiently, then they would merge or dismultiply or whatever.

The debate on which should come first, AI or Nanotechnology, is fun but
of academic interest only, it won't change things in any way. Not that I'm
criticizing anyone, I've been known to debate issues that have not the
slightest practical significance too. But the fact of the matter is if you wish
AI to happen first then work on it, if you want Nanotechnology to happen
first then help develop that technology. Nothing else matters.

Maybe I'm crazy but I think both are our friend even though there is a very
good chance either will end up killing us dead as a door nail. The reason I say
this is because there is also a probability greater than zero that they will not.
That gives me a little hope, not a lot but a little, without them I'm dead meat for sure.
If I'm given a choice between little chance and no chance it won't take me long
to make my decision.

Um, I don't actually have a Singularity list, although it's a good idea.
 I have a Singularitarian list, which isn't the same thing - it's only
appropriate after you've decided that you definitely want a Singularity
and you're interested in opportunities to create one.  There isn't
exactly a lot of debate about, say, Asimov Laws.

Thats pretty much what I concluded John.  In a small way, I am working
towards both simultaneously: joining Foresight as a senior associate and
by arranging 700 desktop computers to work on GIMPS.  My [admittedly
halfhearted] attempt at setting up an extropians GIMPS team was for
helping set up an infrastructure in which a singularity could eventually
be created.  spike

I just this minute finished watching "Thirteenth Floor".  If anyone hasn't 
seen it yet I strongly advise that you do so.

It "out-matrixs" ...Matrix.

Kinda neat.  I caught on probably just about where the producer would expect 
an extropian to catch on.....perhaps a little later (I'm kinda slow).  I 
watched it with my girl friend here in Austin.  She was TOTALLY lost....and 
was a little perturbed when I started predicting what was going to happen.  I 
managed to get some of it right even....except I figured the B cop would 
shoot A->B with a sniper's rifle instead of a pistol....I mean gee...we saw C 
shoot B->C with a pistol...and then B shoot C->B with a pistol....don't you 
think it was about time for a rifle?

All seriousness aside....I thought it was a hoot.  I'll probably not watch it 
again...but I'm glad I saw it once....

Thank you, Robert, what I meant (and should have written) was:

Just say "no" to <qualia>.

Where <qualia> is the meme that says qualia has any explanatory value.
I am quite convinced that qualia has no such value and that <qualia> is
one of those mental parasites that are successfully getting propagated
while giving little in return to the pursuit of knowledge.  True,
<qualia> helps academics get grants to write papers about qualia, but
that benefit is short lived, and represents the de minimis ante this
meme is willing to give.

I wrote what I did because I inferred that Robert B. was looking over
edge into this vast wasteland of mental energy, and I wanted him (and
others on this list) to know that at least one other person here had
slogged through this morass, and now advises not to go there.  Perhaps
Robert B. will want to go there anyway, and feed a bunch of his neurons
to this meme that he could otherwise use elsewhere; that is his personal
freedom.

In some ways I am sorry to be sending this <<qualia>> reply, because it
will probably just feed <qualia> some more neurons (I'll bet D.
Hofstadter would find this amusing).  Given that qualia is entirely
subjective, you can search forever in <qualia> for a falsifiable
conclusion to test, and not find one.  This is one of the keys to
survivability for many such memes.  If they could be resolved in a
reasonable amount of time, they would be, and thus we would move on.

Somehow I do not think the question "How large is red?" would give me as
much trouble as "What is Mu?".  No, I do not experience 'my' color "red"
as an extensive magnitude because I have yet been able to get access to
the level of neural processing at which it is so (or at lease is a
population density of firings).  This does not bother me at all.  If I
had the resources to devote to the endeavor, I am sure I could have
myself attached to a real-time tomographic cranial oxygen uptake
monitor, and study this.  Instead, I would rather just wait for MNT and
get direct access.

Well, I have worked on this in another context, over 20 years ago.  The
context was not color, but the qualia of letterness in computer
recognition of printing.  The system we built had special hardware for
feature extraction in binary images such as automatic population
distributions of all species of 2X2 bit patterns (called "quad fours"),
and other topological data in an image.  A typical difficult case is
trying to decide if you are looking at the letter "c" vs. "e", which
usually differ by only a few pixels at best, and can be very close when
the cross bar in "e" has been reduced to a dot.

Although the low level code has access to the quad four counters and
base image correlation counters to calculate the e-ness or c-ness of the
image, at a certain point the higher level code does not, and just gets
the e-ness vs. c-ness.  This is because the system has been trained by
looking at thousands of cases of "e" and "c", and from these cases
internal parameters have established low, medium, or high qualities of
e-ness or c-ness.  The high level software does not know where medium
level e-ness ends and high level e-ness begins, it just knows it it
looking at an image with high e-ness, and that, if it also gets a low to
medium level of c-ness, it should call it an "e".

Well, perhaps, in the sense that some people prefer 18th-century music
compositions to be played on 18th-century instruments.  Also, I
understand that one must be willing to study the work of the past if one
expects to avoid it's pitfalls.  The philosophers of the 18th-century
were just as smart as we are today, but they did not have the tools we
do and could not do the experiments that we can do today.  Twenty years
ago we wanted to do plenty of experiments that we could plan, but not
do, because the cost of the computing power was out of the question.
Today most of those can be done on a cheap desktop, and soon the
supercomputer of today will be the cheap desktop of tomorrow.  In a few
years, MNT will allow us replicate brains, and put to rest many a <Mind>
that have been kicked around by thinkers for millennia.

[1] Agreed -- "Mu" is more difficult that the "size of red".

[2] Well, "density" here would be a "quantitative" magnitude, and I can't 
     ask how "extended" 129 is; of course this is nonsense, but surely you
     are referring here to mathematical rather than metrical space. When I
     experience, say, a pure red painting 6 X 4 feet, my "patch" of red is
     much larger as a percept than my occipital lobe, and we know this
     redness is a sensation (i.e. experience), not a property of an object.
     My point here is that the concept of metrical "space" is merely a con-
     ventional artifact of objective measurement; it cannot possibly account
     for the perceived qualities of purely experiential components.

     I must remind you that my sensation called "redness" cannot be an
     observable object regardless of the refinement of our instruments.
     It may be possible to "measure" red, but only analogically by means
     of some other continuous variable, just as we measure the density
     of electron drift by means of its associated magnetic field and the
     deflection of an ammeter pointer induced by this field.  In this sense
     we might "detect" when a subject was experiencing red, but this has
     nothing at all to do with the experience itself.

Your post contains details that I want to think about some more; it
was certainly most stimulating.  Thank you.

This is exactly what is so puzzling about them - the brute fact that they
exist, yet do not figure in, at all, to the causal structure of the world. A
world without qualia would be exactly the same in every way to our world,
except for the fact that it wouldn't have qualia. How do you know they exist
then? Simple, just open your eyes.
Qualia are not an explanatory step in explaining consciousness, they are the
end step, they are what is to be explained.

Ahem.  Wouldn't it be funny if neurons in your brain did that?  And,
indeed, wouldn't it be an awful shame if we had to go and say that your

We are not purely rational creatures, and concrete visible results are not
important - it is whether these concrete visible results kick off a
pleasurable reaction in our minds. Replacing a cushy sex, drugs and
rock&roll lifestyle with one of constant self-flagellation is just an
example of one desire/motivation outweighing another. The monks will have a
sufficiently strong desire to prove their faith to their gods such that it
will outweigh the desire to have loads of sex etc. This faith proving desire
could be a fundamental motivation in itself - after all, cats leave
"offerings" to their human "gods" too, but I suspect that it has bases in
other things like fear of death, and self-glorification. My point, though,
is that these desires/motivations were not created by the conscious entity
with "free will" or something. There was no time in my life at which I
DECIDED my sexuality, or DECIDED my food preferences, or my particular
loves&hates in any area. I discovered them. All base rules, and therefore
motivations are out of our control. The only "freedom" our "intelligence"
gets is to come up with the plans that fulfil this predetermined motivation
set. I could go further and mention that we don't control our intelligence
either - in fact, that the consciousness is not a control device at all, but
that's another subject.

So postulate that it happened but it's still outside our light

Hate to but in so late, but I find the whole framework of this
debate somewhat disturbing.

Even without invoking silliness like cartesian dualism or Roger Penrose's
theories it is important to bear in mind that we don't *yet* know enough
to know if uploading is even possible.  F'r'ex, suppose significant
computational work is being done by the microtubule skeleton within each
neuron; all we get to see (and base our estimates of the complexity of
the brain on) is a signal emerging from a much more complex system,
while critically important things like long-term memory are encoded
internally. _That_ sort of mistake could jack up the computational
complexity of the human brain by, say, ten or twelve orders of
magnitude, and I wouldn't rule it out until we _know_ how long-term
memory is encoded. (I'm not current with cutting-edge neurobiology, to
say the least, but I'm under the distinct impression that this isn't a
cut and dried issue.) More to the point, such an "oops" mis-estimate
jacks _down_ the intelligence of an SI in relation to ourselves to an 
equivalent degree.

Then we have the question of _why_ an uploaded SI might take action
detrimental to not-yet-uploaded people. If Moravec (in Robot) is correct
about the computational complexity of a human mind, there isn't going to
be any immediate resource contention issue; there'll be more than enough
computronium to go round until the SI(s) have elaborated themselves to
make use of resources far beyond anything one human mind might need.
This _will_ take time. I'd therefore expect there to be a window of
opportunity between uploading becoming possible and competition among
SI's for computational resources impacting un-uploaded people. (A window
that may well last for many years -- consider the timescale for converting
the whole solar system into an MB, for example.)

Where's this paranoia coming from?

As always with these kinds of debates, the problem lies in the premises. It
seems we differ in our ideas of the meaning of "intelligence". The rule of
thumb is - it doesn't mean anything, but you'd hardly call a static finite
state machine "intelligent", so some dynamic characteristics are required.
Ask yourself how you would decide if your machine has "intelligence". You'd
have serious trouble - not because the data is hard to get, but that the
concept of intelligence is an animal fitness function, not an objectively
observable entity that you can measure. Alan turing knew this when he
invented his test of intelligence  - the imaginatively named Turing Test. He
realised that "intelligence" could not be measured by anything other than a
human (as it is a human "fitness function"). The test involves giving your
AI to a human for evaluation - if the human thinks the program is
intelligent, then it is. The test involves no empirical measurements at
all - after all, what measurements would you take?
These days, probably due entirely to marketing, everything with a hint of
dynamic behaviour is named "intelligent" - and it may as well. After all -
if you designed a self-sustaining and repairing, replicating, evolving,
little machine out of atoms - you'd not refrain from calling it
"intelligent", and rightly so !

One "base motivation" will be greater in magnitude than the other.

When resources are scarce, the "fittest" survive at the expense of the less
"fit".

An evolutionary dead end - like homosexuality. New deviants will pop up with
every generation - but hardly ever are the deviations advantageous. That's
why evolution by natural selection takes so long.

The desire to be beautiful is the offending base motivation. When the unit's
learned definition of beauty and such is in line with this behaviour, it
will occur.

In the words of Yoda - there is no "why". Deviations in the new generation
occur, then the line either continues or does not, no reasons for the nature
of these deviations are required. They are merely emergent properties of the
underlying freshly generated genetic code.

I can't quite see what you're getting at here - the obvious response is to

>[7] Was there a primordial "base motivation" to evolve an "intelligent

And we're back to the premises again. "Motivation" is an (I'm going to need
a rubber stamp for this handy phrase) abstract symbolic concept. The
"motivation" to survive has grown out of the fact that genes DO survive. As
soon as the first lot of creatures that especially wanted to survive
existed, they would have very quickly completely replaced other more
apathetic creatures in the struggle to survive. Hence our now very strong
hatred of the concept of death. Motivation doesn't mean anything in the pure
context of the primordial soup.

Why would the system need to "perceive" the color to stop at the light? A
light sensor WOULD do fine.
Plus, you need consciousness before you can have true perception as we
intend it to be meant. How are you going to code that?

 IS THERE REASON TO BELIEVE TOFU MAY CAUSE BRAIN ATROPHY?

 The recent study suggesting a link between tofu and brain
 atrophy [1] calls to attention animal research showing that 
 the soy-phytochemical genistein reduces DNA synthesis in the
 brain and inhibits the proliferation of brain cells. [2][3][4] 
 That research tends to support the tofu study, for, since cell 
 replication requires DNA synthesis, genistein-induced synthesis 
 reduction leading to fewer new cells could manifest as atrophy. 

 The only counter I've seen is that cell-proliferation physiology 
 does not apply to adult brain cells, since they don't replicate. 
 That claim, however, has been invalidated, for it has been shown 
 that neurogenesis--the replication of new brain cells--appears 
 to occur in the brain throughout life. As Dr. David Amaral told 
 The Washington Post (11/21/99): "A decade ago, we still had the 
 notion that you acquired all the neurons you would ever have by 
 the sixth month of pregnancy... It turns out that nothing could 
 be further from the truth." The Washington Post continued:

  "Last month, biologists at Princeton University demonstrated 
   that monkey brains constantly produce thousands of new 
   neurons which travel to the cerebral cortex, the center 
   of higher intellectual functions. Earlier studies had 
   documented other examples of neurogensis... The same 
   process occurs in humans. ...researchers at the Salk 
   Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, Calif., 
   found evidence of recent cell division in a part of the 
   brain called the hippocampus in every person studied." [5]

 Research in animals shows neurogenesis occurs in several areas 
 of the adult brain. [6][7][8] Research also shows that reduced
 DNA synthesis decreases the number of new brain cells produced. 
 [9] Based on the available data, I would dare to posit that IF 
 in fact genistein inhibits DNA synthesis in the adult human 
 brain as it has been shown to in developing rat brains [2]
 (and based on human/animal/soy studies, I see no reason to 
 believe the rat/soy-to-human/soy extrapolation is unfounded), 
 it stands to reason that soy products would reduce neurogensis
 and/or initiate apoptosis (programmed cell death) in the human 
 brain, which could manifest itself as brain atrophy. In short, 
 there's reason to believe the tofu study [1] may be accurate.

 But Asians Are Smarter

 A counter argument to the findings in the tofu study [1] is 
 that Chinese and Japanese consume more soy products than other 
 people, and yet they have very-high IQs, and thus don't appear 
 to suffering from a chemically induced diminution of cerebral 
 capacity. Sounds plausible on its face, but it should be 
 considered that if Asians have higher IQs, due to nature or 
 nurture, this does not mean they could not suffer decrements 
 of IQ that would go unnoticed if, despite the decrement, they 
 still exceed the average IQ of non-Asians. In short, a 500-lb 
 man would still be very large even after losing 200 pounds. 

 Another point to consider is that if Asian families care for 
 grandparents more often than in the West, where they may be 
 sent to retirement/nursing homes, such family care might tend 
 to "conceal" the rate of cognitive decline in Asian countries. 

 Another factor to consider is if Asians have been consuming 
 soy for centuries (while it's relatively new to Westerners), 
 then Asians may have inherited immunities to any toxic agents 
 in the foods they consume, since those who food x happens to 
 harm least tend to survive more, passing on their immunities 
 to food-x-toxins to their offspring. In short, Westerners 
 may be more vulnerable to toxins in Asian foods, although 
 I'm not aware of the races of those in the tofu study. [1]
 
 Of course I hope what I argue above isn't true, and that 
 soy products ARE the healthy panacea I've always assumed! 
 I've been a vegetarian since I was 13-years old because I 
 believe we need to advance beyond the systematic mass murder 
 sentient beings simply for pleasurable taste sensations. With 
 my refrigerator full of soy stuff, I wish I could be sure now,
 but until the soy picture gets clearer, the evidence is enough
 for me to be inclined to err on the side of caution. However, 
 it should be noted that the research indicating an anticancer 
 potential for soy is consistent, and research shows that the 
 cytotoxic properties of soy products are strongly specific, 
 but apparently not entirely exclusive, to cancer cells. If 
 I had terminal cancer, I would consider using soy products!

Only if he were kind of person that required "guidance" from some external
dictator. This was not the point that Dan made, though. However useful
certain arbitrary concepts are to our everyday lives, they exist only in our
head. No humans - no human morality. The stars and dust left behind really
doesn't give a flying toss about the abstract subjective tools once used by
a long dead race - hence an absolute morality is a pipe dream born out of
our desire for cosmic "importance". Exactly like nematodes "looking" up at
us, and trying to tie their existence into ours. It is most illogical,
captain.

I concur.  If that would give a machine understanding, then how come
computer programs with bugs in them don't start having conversations with
us?

I think understanding is going to be a lot harder and a lot easier than
that.  Harder because it will not involve some sophomoric zen-like formulae.
Easier because if we just look at how we apprehend the world we might be
able to just develop machines that understand by mimicking us, then removing
the inessential.

You cannot "place good" into an object. "Good" is another human concept, and
so you need a human observer whose PERCEPTION of an object is good, the
object itself is nothing of the sort.

It does to be "absolute".

I would. I think most people would agree with me.

Yes, the concept is subjective. The situation perception depends upon the
nature of the subject (human, dog, worm, little green man).

>NOTHING IN THE UNIVERSE IS WORTH DYING FOR!

The utlimate translation of subjective --> objective
Everyone will have their own thoughts on this. For instance, the crazy monks
or whatever have such a strong urge to be a zealot, that the pain they would
suffer mentally if they gave up their beliefs would be worse than the pain
of anticipating and committing suicide in their eyes.......not everyone has
the same motivation as you do. For instance, my Grandad is like many other
old blokes - very opinionated and vocal. One of his favourite types of
people to criticise are such as recreational drug users, dangerous sports
players and such. He always rants "They're so stupid. They'll cut their
lifespan by years....." etc. etc.. The point is that Grandad is making a
judgement based upon the idiotic assumption that everyone has identical
motives to his. Basically, life for as long as possible, no matter what the
trade off with quality of life. Many sound-of-mind people have the
alternative philosophy of maximum life quality over quantity. His failure is
in his seeming inability to discern between the subjective and the
objective - "Of course everyone has the same motives as me, I'm a cosmically
righteous being rigged up to some God" or something.....

That's the way people debate - I've tried it before....you try inserting
"maybe" and "perhaps" and "I consider it a possibility that" into your
posts - you won't get any responses, only "Yes, that is a possibility". The
reason I post to this list is to use your fine brains to bounce my ideas
off, and if people don't get their feathers ruffled a bit, they don't
negatively evaluate the idea and post a response.

My guess: being bottlenecked by serial processes. The human brain may
be massively parallel, but it's not _that_ parallel. Neural state
transitions give rise to outputs that have to be summed before you can get
the inputs for the next state transition: worse, the neural architecture
of the brain expects propagation delays, so you have to complete a lot
of neural state transitions before you can move on to computing the
next ones. 

I suspect that it may not be possible to optimize an uploaded human mind
without (a) using external interfaces to properly designed subsystems, or
(b) virtually re-writing the whole thing from scratch. And an unoptimized
brain simply won't make efficient use of an MB -- once you get beyond
being able to simulate the state of every atom in every molecule of
every cell, as fast as possible using some local processors, you're just 
wasting CPU cycles.

Let me add something else:

Call me an optimist, but I think the vast majority of human being mean 
well. Within the limits of the information available to them, they don't
deliberately act against their peers unless there's a perceived cost
to themselves for not doing so. Even an immature MB would be such an
incredible resource that, at least initially, conflicts over scarcity
wouldn't be an issue: people would have to figure out how to utilize
significant amounts of that resource before there could be arguments
about doing so.

Put it another way: the first uploads will be in the position of 
nematode worms moving into a nice juicy sewage works the size of the
Earth. Is nematode #1 _really_ going to turn round and say "hey, guys,
in fifteen million years I'm going to fill this WHOLE tank; so
sorry, no room for latecomers ..."?

Absolutely not. YOUR emotions and base motivators do not figure in anyone
else's decisions but your own. Survival is CERTAINLY not top of my agenda
either - I seriously doubt that in reality, it's yours. What would you do,
faced with imprisonment and butt rape for the rest of your days? Survive?
You'd be searching for the nearest sturdy beam just like the rest of us.

Yes, it is a very nice movie. I love when a film dealing with
ontological trickery actually manages to remain *consistent* (even if
it needs some slightly odd boundary conditions). The only other film I
can remember with the same level of trickery and consistency (but a
very different mood) was _Army of the Twelve Monkeys_. 

We saw "Thirteenth Floor" at the Halloween meeting here in Stockholm,
and had some fun discussions about it, sf films in general and the
world described. A few interesting thughts: the description of
technology was, unlike the Matrix and I guess ExistenZ, neutral or
even positive. This kind of ontological movies have gone from
irrational explanations (dreams/madness/drugs) to rational ones
(VR/uploading/nanotech) where the shift between "realities" is done in
a replicable way. Did the movie end with a murder, and was it a crime?

Another fun movie (slightly related) is the french _Nirvana_, a good
implementation of cyberpunk a few years too late with some buddhist
imagery, which gave me the idea for the Snowflake Cult in my game - by
erasing AI, we can bring them to Nirvana.

Well, considering the fact that you can be essentially reduced to your
cognitive hardware, if your brain doesn't know what red is, neither do you.
Which would of course suggest that your brain *does* know, if not on the
level of individual neurons firing.  This isn't saying much, since it is
doubtful your brain can be said to know "soft" or, more significantly, even
"car" on the level of initial neural receptors.


Paul Churchland (via 
http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Sparta/7551/silby014.html):
"In the human visual cortex, there is a region known as V4. When an infant
human first sees a colour, a neural pattern is set up within V4 and is
reactivated when the infant is exposed to that colour again. Similar
patterns are set up when the infant is exposed to other wavelengths of
light. In abstract terminology, the V4 centre has partitioned itself into
several labels. Each one
of these labels is a neural pattern which represents a different colour.
Now, during the life of the individual, whenever a colour is experienced,
the synaptic weight of the sensory input reactivates the colour's label in
V4. Thus the visual cortex has identified and `labelled' the wavelength of
light that is present in the visual field. The important point to note here
is that these colour recognition labels must be set up at a very early age
and require exposure to colour. Effectively, people have to learn how to see
colours. "

It is arguable that the experience of "red" is merely brainese for "impulses
triggered by a certain wavelength of light."  The question remains, however,
as to how the brain initially  distinguishes wavelengths in the first place:
where it draws lines, and why it would seem that the lines are uniformly
drawn from person to person, when infant experience is doubtlessly not 
uniform.

In moderation, the ability to be bored is often quite adaptive; it motivates 
you to seek novelty and change, which in turn can lead to new discoveries of 
importance to the maintenance of the organism/system.  If the SI's reach a 
point where they seem able to model beforehand everything they are 
discovering through exploration, then it would be likely that they would 
calibrate themselves to have a very high tolerance for repitition (and thus 
not get bored easily), but to compensate they should have a very low 
threshold for curiosity...anything remotely unexpected should make them 
intensely curious.  This way they won't be so mellow as to miss something 
important, but not so restless as to make life intolerable.

On Sept. 27, Hal wrote that he had seen it, and then described his

I agree one shouldn't rely very heavily on the shape of the flashes.
But I did notice several features in many of the same frames which
had shorter horizontal elongation, and wider vertical elongation.
So it does seem possible for the camera to give other orientations
and shapes.

I'd say "approximately the same angle" is a range of roughly 45 degrees.
A fact worth noting, to be sure, but the camera angle seems to change by a
few degrees during some of the sequences of flashes.  I find it hard to
imagine several reflecting surfaces large enough to flash, close enough
together, and within a few degrees of the same normal vector.

Also, several of the flashes seem to come from within an area that is
made dark (i.e., cool) by being in the shadow of a building.  You would
seemingly have to imagine two reflecting surfaces, one in the sun shining
light on the second one in shadow.

I agree that showing this in full would have helped.

I agree, but I think this may be asking too much of the Waco video producers,
whose funding and access to FLIR equipment is presumably much less than
the FBI and allied agencies.  Hopefully a reenactment will occur.

One could charitably interpret this as Allard saying that surfaces large,
flat, and IR-reflective enough (such as a large pane of glass) are rather
unusual in familiar circumstances.  Especially surface groups that could
produce repeated flashes as ones angle changed by small amounts.  I accept
that the producers tried to tone down the technical language for a widely
accessible movie, but I do wish there were an academic quality presentation
of their best case for us to consider.

I guess it depends on how strong a case you think is required.  I agree
it may not yet be "beyond a reasonable doubt" (criminal court standard),
but I think the "preponderance of the evidence" (civil court standard)
is there.  The strongest evidence is twenty odd dead bodies with bullets
in them, while a clearly hostile party with motive and intent to harm,
and who pointed many guns at the victims, kept observers away during
the period and then destroyed, took, and hid the crime scene evidence.
With no apparent evidence of suicide, if you add the FLIR apparent gun
shots on to this evidence, I see a pretty strong total case.

If the "shutter" were only open for a .01sec period, and then stayed closed
until the next opening .1sec later, and if a gun flash only lasted .1 sec,
then you should only expect to see between 10% and 20% of the flashes.
I don't know what the actual time numbers here are, but the concern seems
very plausible to me.

I agree this was very damning evidence regarding the FBI lying.
I can see Hal's concerns about the supposed gunshots, but
that one burst was clearly bright (attracting the attention of the
camera operator) and was viewed though a window as happening
inside a building.  How could such a bright reflection come from
inside a building?  And why would a reflection happen just when
the fire was starting there?

I'll put this on the list for my next library trip.

I think the key thing is the word "local".  All this may end up
suggesting is the relatively local abundance of elements from
stars of various masses and the types of supernovas that
have occured in our local region in recent times (i.e.
the time it takes for the dust clouds to significantly
dissipate).  We may have local star masses that produce
a lot of C but not much Si.

I'm not optimisitic in the long run about using interstellar
dust as tracers for history (or astroengineering activities).
One paper I glanced at lately documented a galaxy with two
distinct populations of stars with an age difference of
~2 billion years.  They attributed it to a galactic collision
in the intermediate past.  If you take a single galaxy, you
are going to get a distribution of star masses based on the
initial density.  Then you could run a simulation and probably
come up with a good model for what you should see in the interstellar
dust.  But it looks like you also have to factor in galactic
collisions and the effects of faster/slower evolution in the
colliding galaxies and gravitational effects on dust flows.
I think the complexity is going to go up very fast and you
are going to need a lot of data to begin to read the history.

Also of note is a recent note from an astronomer using the ISO
to do infrared observations, suggesting that the current "opinion"
is that the gravitational microlensing observations are telling
us something about the structure of the LMC rather than the Milky Way.  
So it may be that the strongest piece of SI evidence is resting on a
very shakey leg.  We really need the SIRTF and perhaps a replacement
for the WIRE mission up and operational.

Rob Harris <rob@hbinternet.co.uk> responded with:

	I think this is precicely right!  Color detecting machines are
far more aware, intelligent and functional than we are about color.
Not only can such machines resolve much better but obviosly they can
be set up to produce complex behaviors based on colors we can't even
see (let alone remember) the difference between.

	The kicker difference is: when you ask a human what "red" is
like, he honestly tries to express the very real and phenomenal
sensation.  Any abstract machine that represented color with mere
abstract representations rather than a real phenomenal qualia, though
it could be programmed such that it seemed to respond much more
"humanly" than a human could, its descriptions of what red was like
would be a blatent lie since abstract representations of knowledge and
awareness information aren't phenomenal or conscious at all.

	If a machine really had been given the proper machinery we
have to produce, say, a salty qualia, it could then honestly respond
with something like: "Oh THAT'S what salt tastes like!".  But if it
was representing the sodium chloride with abstruct numbers or
something, though it could easily act even more convincing, it would
still be blatently lieing about that fact that it could feel walt a
salt quale was like.  And if we really knew what "salty" was and
precicely what machinery really produced it, and could examine the
machine's representations objectively looking for such.  Only then
could we know if it was lying or not.

<< >NOTHING IN THE UNIVERSE IS WORTH DYING FOR!>>

Depends on what you value.
Also, there are more ways than one to die.

What do you do when your choices are do something antithetical to your whole 
being or die?  There is a certain way I want to live, or die trying to live.  
I want my life to extend into eternity, but I won't harm an innocent person 
to do it, because if I did, then it would not be me who lived, but an 
ego-dystonic version of me.  There are certain parameters to who I wish to 
be, and when up against those boundaries, it would be more valuable to live a 
few more seconds within them than centuries outside of them.  Now, having 
said that, I work very hard to keep myself out of those conditions, because I 
really want both.  I know this was just a jumping off point in the post, but 
it seemed like a good place to make the point.  Note, for me the main point 
is not quantity nor quality of life (though both are nice), but quality of 
character.

Unfortunately for clarity, the proponent of ketotic diets also spells his

I resent people who deliberately ruffle other people's feathers to get a
response.  If intelligent comments aren't good enough on their own to merit
response, I would suggest working on the content and not the presentation.

Deviations are the way that evolution tries new things.  Those that are fit
keep cropping up.  Those that are unfit are weeded out.  You are
misunderstanding the theory of evolution if you think it is repeatedly
producing the same unfit deviation with every generation.

This sounds like every prison in America, yet most people sentenced to life
imprisonment do not commit suicide.  They fight, they plan escapes, they
move up within the prison hierarchy.

Other countries have worse prisons including regular torture and rape.
Statistically speaking, most people do not give up and commit suicide.
Somehow, people endure and struggle to survive under the most horrendous of
circumstances.

Well, you see, the cats sometimes care, and otherwise do not.  The cat hunts for
its own pleasure, as it is fed by us gullible humans, although perhaps the game
caught on the hoof, as it were, is also pleasurable to the cat.  The cat's
trophies are those, trophies. They are presented varyingly for shock value or as
a sign of respect.

In terms of morality, I would surmise that a higher percentage polled would find
it immoral to skin a cat as opposed to, say, butcher a cow.  I had an
interesting side-passage with one of the other list readers about morality
recently, in terms of an AI, and one of my statements was that morality is
foremost applied in-species, so that it generally considered the highest moral
offense to slay a fellow human, and generally lesser intelligent animals are not
quite so sacred.  An AI is a an algorithm, not an intelligence.  Even a
self-programming AI is, recursively, programmed by humans at some point, who
provide its sole spark.  Perhaps this is too blunt, but it is always an
alternative to simply kill the cat.

In terms of debate, debate is about two sides.  I am a casual, extemporaneous
debater, it's always nice to have the luxury to pick a side as opposed to having
it forced upon you.  I feel that I could argue anything.  Ethically, I can only
argue the truth.

We were talking about AI and preserving its behavioral modality or something,
this is not completely simple issue.  One critical point is that of of the AI's
eventual sense of "self-preservation".  This would impugn upon what might
otherwise be a stable moral asnd ethical foundation.  Objectively, as the
computer is trained, first to understand the necessity (or lack of it) and
significance of "conscience", and an individual conscience, which is often
unnecessarily linked with regret, and thus extensively of morals and ethics,
then the computer is trained to rationally and objectively analyze various moral
and ethical aspects of interpersonal relationships.  It is when the computer
itself is one of these relators, then, as in the case of any human participant,
objectivity is immediately non-existent.  So, the computer, when eventually
considering any situation involving itself, which it would, otherwise not being
intelligent, eventually would encounter, absolutely, subjectivity.  Here is
where it would need guidance.

A light sensor will do fine to detect the wavelength corresponding
to the sensation red.  Your second statement is precisely the point
I was emphasizing.

Qualia,

I wonder what will happen when I can link the output of one person's V4 area 
to all the places my V4 sends connections to.  Will I then get to experience 
someone else's sensation of red?  My brother is color deficient (true, it's a 
problem of sensory detection more than processing), but I would be fascinated 
to know what he perceives.  And what about true variations in perception, 
like synesthesia.  I am forced to believe that qualia exists because I 
experience it.  I suspect that someday we will be able to reproduce it, and 
then change it.  Once we are able to do those things, we will likely be on 
the road to understanding it.  As for whether AI's will have qualia if we 
don't specifically design for it (say, by mimicking the structure of our 
perceptural cortex), I couldn't say.  It might emerge, or it might not.  
Believe it or not, I still think AI's can be intelligent, self-aware, and 
deserving of rights without having qualia per se.  Qualia is a fascinating 
phenomenon, but not the yardstick by which I judge personhood.  Perhaps AI's 
will experience pure abstract consciousness, with awareness but no 
perception.  I'm still looking into the topic.

<< My point, though, is that these desires/motivations were not created by

I agree that we did not consciously create our original base 
desires/motivations. 

<<There was no time in my life at which I DECIDED my sexuality, or DECIDED my 
food preferences, or my particular loves&hates in any area. I discovered 
them.>>

Perhaps it was only discovery, or perhaps you did have a role in choosing all 
these things.  I suspect it is some of both (though with the examples you 
cite I would tend to agree that they are likely more programmed than chosen).

<< All base rules, and therefore motivations are out of our control. The only 
"freedom" our "intelligence"gets is to come up with the plans that fulfil 
this predetermined motivation set.>>

I don't think this is strictly true.  Those predetermined motivations are a 
starting point.  With our conscious minds we can evaluate them, weigh them 
against one another, and recombine them into new desires.  It is like a 
sculptor with marble, who chips away what he determines to be excess to 
reveal the image desired.  Or maybe it is more like an engineer on the shore 
of a mighty river; she did not create the river, and it will take a lot of 
intelligence and effort to affect its currents, but she could still divert 
its course or damn its flow.  We may not have chosen the cards we were dealt, 
but we do have a say in which to keep and which to discard.

<< I could go further and mention that we don't control our intelligence
either - in fact, that the consciousness is not a control device at all, but
that's another subject. >>

Please do continue; I would be interested to hear what you believe is 
consciousness.

I don't believe that's true even about color in the abstract, and today's
machines certainly know much less than we do about the way color interacts
with the rest of the universe, that's much more important.

    >The kicker difference is: when you ask a human what "red" is

And a human always fails miserably when he tries to explain what
the sensation "red" is like, perhaps because he doesn't really
understand "red" as well as he thought he did, but more likely because
red is not "like" anything except red.

    >Any abstract machine

Huh?

    >that represented color with mere abstract representations rather
    >than a real phenomenal qualia

It seems to me that phenomenal qualia are certainly real but about as
abstract as you can get.

    >abstract representations of knowledge and awareness information aren't
    >phenomenal or conscious at all.

There is absolutely no way, even in theory, that could ever be proven right or
wrong, so it has nothing to do with science. Yet I have a very strong hunch it's
wrong because Darwin's theory of Evolution has worked wonderfully well
in explaining things but if what you say is true then Darwin is definitely wrong.
No creature should be conscious but I know for a fact that at least one of
them is.

If you want to investigate consciousness start with the only example you
know of with certainty, but don't ask yourself how it works because that's
too hard, ask yourself what physical mechanism would demand it exists.
That's what was so revolutionary and made people so mad when
Darwin wrote his book in 1859, things that experience consciousness
could be produced by randomness and natural selection, mumbo jumbo
was no longer needed. I need hardly mention that natural selection can
not select for consciousness so the only alternative is that it hitches a
free ride on intelligence's coat tails. The same will be true of our machines.

    >If a machine really had been given the proper machinery we

    >with something like: "Oh THAT'S what salt tastes like!".

But that's exactly the problem, there is no way you can ever prove the
computer has the proper machinery and you could say exactly the
same thing about your fellow Human Beings.

    >if it was representing the sodium chloride with abstruct numbers or
    >something, though it could easily act even more convincing, it would

How would it even know it was lying, for that matter how would you?
Perhaps you were born with no sense of taste, what you call "salty"
is just a pale pitiful reflection of the true powerful sensation everyone
else has.

    >about that fact that it could feel walt a salt quale
    >was like

Although it can be produced in countless ways (various chemicals,
nerve stimulation, hypnotic suggestion, etc.) I see no evidence that
a salt quale is like anything at all except itself, I think that's why we
can't describe it and neither can a machine.

Anyone else think these movies are too similar to each other? I think we
need a list of "VR User Rules of Thumb". To start:

- I will not turn off the "I'm in VR" indicator and other default safety
features.
- I will avoid a system that kills me whenever my VR character dies.
- I will remember to look for the pause button when I comparison-shop for a
VR rig.
- If I become sick, confused or disoriented, I will immediately execute the
equivalent of Control-Alt-Delete.
- If I discover a computer-controled character unexpectedly attempting to
hack out of the system, I will shut off power and call technical support
instead of engaging him in hand-to-hand combat.
- If I discover my current reality is actually a VR, I will try to avoid
irritating the administrators of the VR system.
- If I discover my current reality is actually a VR and manage to exit it,
I will immediate try to determine if I am still in an VR environment.

I never made the claim for _that sort_ of objective morality.  It's obvious
that Rob and I mean different things by the terms.  I've tried to define how
I use them.

First off, I did not start this thread and have not read all of it.  Nor do
I intend to read all of it.

Second, there are different meanings to "absolute."  People who mean by it
something that has no relation to anything else are rightly labelled as
intrinsicists, whether we are dealing with their notions of morality,
epistemology, art, politics, or what have you.  This sort of absolute is
something which can really have little meaning for an objective view.
"Objective" after all has to be within the context of the mind's relation to
the world.  It cannot mean something outside of that relation.  This applies
to being an objective observer as well as to objective morality.  The kind
of absolute I would talk about is a contextual absolute -- i.e., something
that is absolute in a given context.  However, this is so at variance with
conventional usage that I avoid the term.

Third, morality should not be a set of arbitrary rules.  Just like the laws
of logic or the scientific method, we must look for the aim of morality.  We
must not look at extant moralities and use only them for finding this aim --
just as we would not lump together theology with science in trying to come
up with an objective view of the world.  But before going further, let me
define morality as a code of values which guide actions.  This is morality
neutral I believe.  I.e., it does not define morality in such a way that a
specific code -- such as JudeoChristian ethics, Aristotelean ethics,
Buddhiest ethics -- is confused with morality as such.

Going back to a previous post, I gave Rand's definition of value as that
which one acts to gain or keep.  (From her and Branden's _The Virtue of
Selfishness_.)  Putting that together with the above defintion doesn't give
us much.  It doesn't tell why one holds particular values or even which
values one holds should take precedence.

Rand's next step was to ask why values?  What if anything makes values at
all necessary?  She thinks that values ultimately derive only for beings
whose existence is conditional.  I.e., living things.  Thus, she can see
nematodes as having values -- albeit not a morality.  Morality is a code
recall.  As a code, it is meant to guide beings who can choose between
actions.  As far as we know, nematodes can't choose their actions or even be
aware of the consequences of them.  She believes the fundamental value, the
one on which all others are based, is life itself.  (There is some dispute
over this, but I tend to side with this reading of her here.:)

Squeezing a lot of Objectivist metaethics into a small space, morality would
guide Crusoe or Rob because it would be a means for them to organize their
values.  This is not a set of arbitrary rules.  An objective morality would
have life as its core value and this would not seem to be arbitrary.
Granted, what helps me to live and me to live well might not be exactly the
same thing as what helps Rob to do likewise.  We have different skills,
levels of knowledge, etc.  But given these differences, we can both use
logic.  Does the fact that we might use logic for different proximate
goals -- debating morality, trying to reach a conclusion on some personal
issue, etc. -- mean logic is subjective and arbitrary?  I believe not.

Regarding "No humans - no human morality," I agree and believe Rand and
Objectivists (people into her philosophy of Objectivism) would also.  (I'm
not trying to defend her, by the way, just trying to make sure that people
on the list know my sources.  And if Rand and her seconds don't agree here,
well, then they are just plain wrong.:)  It's also obvious that "No eyes -
no color." This does make color subjective.  It makes it relational -- i.e.,
depenent on the relation between perceived and the perceived.  It's not at
all arbitrary.  You have a certain type of visual system, you see certain
colors under certain conditions.

Even more telling here, if all conceptual consciousnesses ceased to exist in
the unvierse, "The stars and dust left behind really doesn't[sic] give a
flying toss about" logic, which is only a tool of consciosness, after all?
Again, does this make logic subjective or arbitrary?  Nematodes (and trees
and bacteria) certainly can get by without it!:)

Cheers!

Dennett is painfully wrong on the subject of qualia. Throughout all his
works, he seems as if he just doesn't know what the word 'qualia' means. He
treats them as a superstition, goes on to explain how they have no
explanatory value and all that stuff, then just ignores the real issue. His
argumentation is all very clever, but absurd. Nevertheless, I recommend
reading "consciousness explained" - he doesn't explain consciousness as the
title claims, but he has some good psychological theories in the book.
The question is this: do you deny that there is a difference between YOUR
subjective experience of red, and the objective movements of matter which
constitute detection of the red-wavelength of light? If you say no, you must
be fundementally different from me. If you say yes, then you're admitting
qualia (as I define the term) exist. Your next line of argumentation might
be to say that they don't exist, that they're just an illusion of some
sort - that's fine.. I'd personally say that being an illusion constitutes
existing, but that's just a semantic difference. The path from here is not
to cop out like Dennett has, but to really try to explain how matter and
energy result in this particular illusion we call qualia. I wan an
explanation as precise as the one explaining why lasers refelcted in a
certain way result in perception of holograms.

I think qualia are the result of non-Turing-computable processes that we
probably can't duplicate artificially with today's technology, so why
bother?  I really, really doubt that they're necessary for intelligence.
 The only reason I brought up <qualia> was to emphasize that we don't
know enough about the Universe to say what can or can't be objectively real.

One might conclude that the homosexual deviation is in some way

I concur.  If that would give a machine understanding,
then how come
computer programs with bugs in them don't start having
conversations with us?
I think understanding is going to be a lot harder and
a lot easier than
that.  Harder because it will not involve some
sophomoric zen-likeformulae.
Easier because if we just look at how we apprehend the
world we mightbe
able to just develop machines that understand by
mimicking us, then removing the inessential.

The problem with radio shack is that it dissapates
with each circuit, if the noise was perpetually
amplified, then the foundations for "understanding"
would exsist.

How long would it take the people in your world
surrounded by "bare essential <mimick-understanding>"
AIs to start to mimick the AIs.
A which came first sinario developes equating to
another zen-like paradox, you cannot escape that
easily.
(If the bugs are atall conserned with us they talk
about us, not to us.)

Rob Harris:

As absolute morality is based on understanding I
suggest we stick this overinflated consept down the
same pipe. My personal feelings on this are that we do
have great cosmic importance but so equally does every
other peice of matter and (antimatter) in the
universe. Interestingly if you put morality into this
equation our "morals" are of equal importance to those
of interstella dust clouds.

This list is the perfect court for bounceing around

finely tuned of minds, it will also be unproductive as
people spend more time in defence mode than playing

Having read your website, you hint at why you believe this, but, to the
best of my knowledge, you never specify why.  You mention that it has
something to do with the problem of defining instantiation, but I have no
idea what you might be referring to.

In thinking about the problem only a little bit, it seems to me that what
you may be referring to is what philosophers of language refer to as the
problem of "translation" from one language into another.  That is,
defining instantiation is easy:  A instantiates B when A yields the same
output as B for any input.  The problem is ascertaining whether the I/O
is, in fact, the same.

This might seem easy at first if the I/O are written on similar medium (if
they both use punch cards, say, or magnetic tape), but that doesn't go far
enough.  Surely, for example, a universal Turing computer designed with
white/black paintbrushes writing on colored paper could instantiate a
Turing computer designed with magnetic tape.  Right off, however, you find
the necessity for a translation rule:  Maybe 0 = black, 1 = white.

This problem gets worse and worse as you start trying to test the outer
boundaries of the language.  How weird a Turing computer can you build
that still instantiates the first one?  What constitutes a well-defined
translation rule?  (Hofstadterian considerations apply here.)

Am I on the right track here?

My SUBJECTIVE experience of red?  I'm not HAVING a *subjective* experience
of red.  I'm having an experience of red alright, but it's entirely
OBJECTIVE.  (And thus, it's perfectly reasonable for me to claim its
equivalence with the *objective* movements of matter which constitute
detection of the red-wavelength of light.)

You want me to explain why we have the illusion of subjective experience?
When I pinch myself, you don't wince.  Some people falsely inferred from
this that there was something subjective going on, when, in fact, the
reason you didn't wince when I did is because you didn't detect my
pinching through your pinch-detectors, not because I had a feeling which
was inaccessible to you.

("Pinch-detectors" isn't very precise, but it'll do in a ... erm... under 
these circumstances.)

No sale?  Allow me to to make the same argument in the style of
"reductionist" materialism, which Dennett explicitly eschewed in his paper
in favor of "eliminative" materialism, but which I'll accept for the sake
of argument, because it works just as well either way.

Actually, yeah, I believe that the objective movements of matter which
constitute detection of the red-wavelength of light simply ARE my
"experience" of red.

Why would you want to say that this is not the case?  Some might argue
that it is because their "subjective experience" of red doesn't "feel
like" the movement of matter.  But that's just begging the question; it's
neither here nor there.

Consider this question:  It is natural to say that the sun revolves around
the earth; we refer to the "rising/setting sun" as if we believed that
this was what was really going on.  Why?  Because it SEEMS like the sun
revolves around the earth.  But what would it seem like if the earth
revolved around the sun?  Similarly, what would it feel like if "red" WAS
the objective movement of matter?

If you jump in and say "it couldn't feel like anything at all," or
something like that, then you're REALLY begging the question.  On the
other hand, if you conclude that it would feel like exactly what it feels
like right now, then you no longer have a motivation to say that your
"subjective experience" of red is NOT qualia.

Except, of course, the fact that it's not subjective.  And, really, if
it's not subjective, then in what sense is it qualia?

	I bet it'll be a bit more than just something like this to
"eff".  But surely this will be possible some day.  Mother Nature has
brought many diverse kinds of qualia such as warmth, the smell of a
rose, red, the taste of salt and so on into one single conscious world
in a way that we clearly know what each is phenomenally like and we
can clearly contrast how magically different they are.  Just because
we can't yet "eff" doesn't mean we don't know what they are like or
that we will not be able to find a way to produce what we know we feel
in others minds so that they can similarly compare and contrast the
differences.  As in: "Oh that's what salt tastes like to you.  I use a
different sensation to represent sodium chloride."  It probably won't
be as simple and as small as the chart of physical elements we now
have and occasionally still add to as we discover new elements, but I
predict that once we discover how our brain uses the physical elements
to produces such phenomenal sensations to represent information with
there will be a large effort to map all known sensations all brains
use to phenomenally represent information and investigation of how all
brains use the various different ones similarly or differently.
"What is it like to be a bat?" could be better stated: "what qualia
does a bat use to represent echo located information and how can I
experience the same sensation or know that it is similar to one I
already experience?"

> My brother is color deficient (true, it's a problem of sensory
> detection more than processing)

	I wouldn't say this.  Surely the way the conscious information
is phenomenally represented is far more important than simple
detection of various wavelengths of light.  I bet if it was easy to
produce more different color like qualia to represent more of the
electromagnetic spectrum it would have been trivial for evolution to
come up with simple rods and cones to detect such.  It's easy for a
camera to sense light within and without the visible spectrum.  It's
the phenomenal way our brain represents the information collected by
the sensors that is so important and intelligent.

> but I would be fascinated to know what he perceives.

	Yes!  I sure look forward to introducing my Dog to what color
qualia are like just as I look forward to experiencing whatever qualia
she uses to represent some of what she so joyfully smells...

> And what about true variations in perception, like synesthesia.

	Yes, and phantom limb pain...  Pain isn't in the toe, it's in
the phenomenally conscious model of your toe in your brain which isn't
amputated.  Surely similar sensations can be given to other brains
given the proper cortex augmentations.

> I am forced to believe that qualia exists because I experience it.

	It's more than this!  We can't really know for sure that
reality exists beyond our senses.  Perhaps we are just a brain in a
vat, or even less, after all!  But one thing we do know for absolute
certainty, that the qualia that is our conscious knowledge does exist.
In the "I think therefor I am" these conscious thoughts are made of
qualia.  They only remotely represent and imply the existence of a
world beyond our senses.  We now know one absolutely must exist, until
we discover and know what qualia are and can eff..., we can only
indirectly infer that everything else that we only know abstractly
exists.

> I suspect that someday we will be able to reproduce it, and then
> change it.

	Are you sure?  I'm betting that like the fundamental elements
of nature, there are fundamental conscious qualities.  Although it is
easy to represent 700 nanometer light with a green qualia, green will
always fundamentally be green and red will always be red.  There may
be new qualia that we discover and use to represent new information
but I think red will always be red and never change.  Though many
things can abstractly represent red, I doubt there is anything else
quite phenomenally like it.

	Exactly!  Like David Chalmers says this is the "hard problem"
of consciousness.  Everything else is easy, though still complex,
information or computation theory.  I think once we admit that qualia
exist this will enable us to discover it and much of the rest will
finally easily follow.

	This seems absurd to me.  The color detecting machines in
paint stores are already far more intelligent color wise than we
are. An abstract 64 bit number can represent more color than we can
perceive.  Though the way I represent color is much less than a 64 bit
abstract number it is still phenomenally much much more.  Sure
abstract numbers, given enough of them, can represent anything about
red, but they will never be fundamentally and phenomenally "like" red.

> Believe it or not, I still think AI's can be intelligent,

	Yes, just as a paint machine is far more intelligent than us
about color today it's just a matter of time before pure abstract
representations are as powerful as our phenomenal ones.  But still,
when you ask them what red is like, unless they really know, at best
they can only lie about what it is really like.

> I'm still looking into the topic.

	Your making it to complex.  Just imagine commander data (or
some future merely abstractly aware consciousness) finally saying: "Oh
THAT'S what salt tastes like!"  It's that simple if you ask me.

	With your usage of "believed" and "SEEMS" you are making the
same mistake Danial Dennett makes when he says there are no qualia "It
only seems like there are" in Consciousness explained.

	What do you mean when you use such terms?  A false believing
or a "seeming" is a representation in our conscious mind that is not
accurately representing its referent.  For example, when we place a
straight pencil in a glass of water it "seems" to be bent.  In other
words, our representation of the pencil in our consciousness is truly
and really bent, while the pencil beyond our senses is not bent at
all.  Though the seeming is an inaccurate representation of it's
referent, it still really is what it is in our consciousness.

	Given this, Danial's assertion that it only "seems" that we
have qualia is obviously absurd.  He is saying something like we have
a qualia representation or an inaccurate conscious knowledge of us
having qualia, but this conscious knowledge or qualia inaccurately
represents it's referent?

Spike -- save the old one.  We have uses for such material in the

we are now going to look at a couple of hours of Flip Wilson reruns
followed by some really tasty episodes of SNL interspersed with RnM-LI.
And then just for fun, we are going to play 24 hours of continuous
Tom Jones out-takes.

And now, just to make sure you are paying attention, we have cut in
subliminal clips from Battlestar Galactica to convince you that you
will survive and live to reach Earth...

Why aren't you responding, perhaps this high voltage shock will

Or give me a new sense of humor- when I saw these two stories near each
other I couldn't help but laugh- it kinda gives a new meaning to "that'll
cost you an arm and a leg," doesn't it?

LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Everyday tasks -- right down to tying shoelaces -- are

You're starting to lead into the real issue. I can draw you a diagram of an
earth and a sun, with the earth revolving around the sun, explain how the
earth rotates, draw a little stick figure guy on the surface of the earth,
and explain, in a way which would be comprehensible given a little insight,
how although the earth revolves around the sun, it seems the other way
around since the earth is rotating. Nobody can currently give a similar
description of consciousness. That doesn't mean it's not possible (although
I have my suspicions). Maybe when we have understanding of it, we will
realize that qualia is a confused term, referring to part of a phenomena, or
several phenomena. I would say qualia is "what it seems like", or, if qualia
only seem to exist and don't really exist, I refine my definition saying
qualia is ""what it seems like" seems like".

I recognize that my approach to this was unclear; on account of this, you
have entirely misunderstood my argument.  I attempted to use TWO distinct
approaches to the problem, one eliminative, in Dennett's style, the other
reductive.

When I was arguing eliminatively, I argued that qualia do not exist, as
Dennett did (does).

However, I then tried a different approach, arguing reductively.  Under
this approach, I argued that "experiences" DO exist, and that they just
ARE the objective phenomena in question.  Another way of saying this might
be to say that "qualia" do exist, but they aren't subjective phenomena. (I
later went on to question whether it was worth calling these "qualia" at
all.)  The passage you quoted came from the "reductive" argument, and is
entirely at odds with the eliminative argument's vocabulary.

So, imagine that there are two of me, using two vocabularies.  I'll aid in
the supposition by responding to your argument twice.

Reductive:  We begin by taking seriously the computational theory of the
mind: that the brain is a computer, and that the "mind" is simply what the
brain does.  In light of this, there IS a false representation, literally,
in the brain.  Note that I'm using the word "representation" in the same
sense as I'd use it when I claim that if I were to write "the pencil is
bent" on a piece of paper, there would be a false "representation" on the
paper, scratched out in pen.  Remembering that the brain itself is a
computer, then what the computer is doing, by definition, is processing
symbols (information).  Just as I can encode a false claim onto a piece of
paper by writing on it, so can the machinery in my eye encode a false
sentence, false information, into my memory (with the help of a few other
compartments of my brain).  That sentence is not encoded in English, but
it would nonetheless be best translated "the pencil is bent," and it is
false.  That's what it means to hold a false belief: the symbols in your
brain, which refer to things in the real world (just as symbols on paper
do), turn out to represent falsely.

Eliminative:  That reductive guy got it basically right, but he insists on
using words like "mind" and "belief."  The word "mind," as used in the
literature, in no way agrees with the way the Reductivist used it above:
he'd be better off just saying that the "mind" does not exist, rather than
attempting to coopt the word for his own purposes, asserting that the
"mind" is what the brain does.  Similarly, he went through this whole
rigamarole trying to show how and why it makes sense to say that people
have false "beliefs," when, in fact, "belief" doesn't exist either, not
according to the definition used by actual people.  He can try to redefine
"belief," but at the risk of conflating it with the word used by everybody
else.  I'd say we're better off saying that "beliefs" don't exist either,
but that some things which are similar to beliefs, call them belief*s,
exist.  In these terms, we don't have "qualia," or a "mind," and we
certainly don't BELIEVE that we do, even if we believe* that we do.

Reductive:  Sure I can.  You're only saying that because you insist on
there being something spooky, something non-verifiable about
consciousness.  If I argue that none of the relevant spooky stuff exists,
and define my terms entirely materialistically, then I can give you a
verifiable physical description of the reasons you do the things you do; I
can even explain why you believe that there are qualia.

Eliminative:  The Reductivist could TRY to provide you with an explanation
like that, but really, there's no reason to use words like "qualia,"
"consciousness," "belief," etc.  [Well, MAYBE belief, but we should use a
different word anyway, since belief is so muddled.] Nobody can give you a
picture of consciousness because it doesn't exist; by that I mean there is
no referent to the word "consciousness."  Sure, the Reductivist could make
up a definition of consciousness, and show how THAT exists, but it's my
opinion that what you mean by "consciousness/qualia" doesn't exist, and
that the Reductivist is just confusing the issue by using your
terminology.

I would say qualia is "what it seems like", or, if qualia
> only seem to exist and don't really exist, I refine my definition saying

I don't understand your redefinition.

Non-sequitur in the paragraph.  What are the logical flaws?

And category error, or level error.  I can believe I know all there is to know
about objective morality -- there ain't no such beast -- but not believe know
everything about practical morality, in the sense of not knowing the best
thing to do in all situations.  Even with a simple and personal definition of
"best thing", let alone one trying to balance everyone's different desires.

A lot of liberal thought, at least the version I got from Hayek, is not about 
acting on the Right Answer but about trying to cope with the probability that
you don't have the Right Answer, not to mention the probability that there
isn't one.

Cf. Richard Posner, or _Law and Economics_, or related writings.

Where's the humility of a 21 or 22 year old who admits he only cares about AI
stuff?  Where's the curiosity to find out what might be hiding in writings on
law and economics and philosophy of which you seem to have no clue?

It wasn't supposed to sequit.  The response was simply a parry to
"Grasshopper"; just because I'm considering replacing my current
theories (which, having lasted for upwards of two years, are overdue)
doesn't imply that I've finally given in to Broderick's grandfatherly
wisdom.  Moving on, not back.

The possibility of being wrong is something I always take into account. 
I haven't _started_ to wonder if I'm asking the right questions, it's
just that the wondering crossed the line between vague uneasiness and
specific problems.  But that's just fiddling with the decimal places,
like the transition between Newtonian and Einsteinian gravitation. 
Aristotelian gravitation still remains incorrect.

You cope with both possibilities using standard quantitative and
algebraic reasoning, multiplying out the probabilities and the costs and
the benefits, or at least establishing inequalities that will tell you
"better" or "worse" if not precise numerical relationships, and finding
the action with the best distribution of probable outcomes and probable
values in those outcomes.

20 year old, and it's presently reading _The Rise and Fall of the Third
Reich_.  Does the phrase "time constraints" mean anything to you?  I
make no apology for dismissing Scientology as complete balderash without
bothering to study their tissue of rationalizations in detail, and
neither do you.

As for humility, it sounds to me like what you're asking for is modesty,
and on this of all lists I refuse to bother with that.  Yes, I'm smart
enough to see when other people are wrong.  Those who don't like this
are free to not be wrong.

Everyone has said everything they're gonna say about qualia.  I propose
this topic be designated a dead horse and banned by voluntary consensus
from the list.  If anyone would care to go over the Extropian archives,
extract all the posts on the subject, and organize them into some kind
of giant message tree, it would make a nice tombstone.

I'm sorry I ever mentioned qualia.  I just wanted to use the previously
debated points, which I had hoped everyone would remember without
needing to reopen the subject, as support for an unrelated argument.  I
should have realized the controversy would once more shamble forth from
its grave to eat the brains of the living.  I repent of my foolishness. 
I ask your forgiveness.  And I beg for silence.

Sincerely,
Eliezer S. Yudkowsky.

>Where's this paranoia coming from?

I call it the Henny Penny Syndrome ("The sky is falling! The sky is falling!")

Human beings have a tremendous talent for fear.  Probably dating back, past
the time when protohumans had their adrenal glands on a hair trigger about
the sabre-toothed tiger lurking behind every bush, all the way back to the
first effective tactile or chemosensitive escape-response initiator of our
bacterial ancestors, which prompted the little bugger to "Swim, swim for
your life!" at the first touch (or whiff) of his predatory nemesis.
Billions of generations later, the threats of the jungle and primordial
soup gone with the prehistoric mists, fear, the mother's milk of survival,
is still with us.

What are we afraid of?  Whoa!  There's a long list.  Heights, the dark, the
monster under the bed, separation from mom, loud noises.  Then, after mom
teaches you a certain minimum of things you needn't to be afraid of,
anything not on that list remains a candidate for ye olde fear response.

All grown up?  Now the bogeyman is a bit more definite:  in general it's
"The Other" and the "strange", "new", or otherwise "unfamiliar"; in
particular it's commies, atheists, criminals, junkies, homosexuals, poor
people, rich people, people who speak another language, people of a
different color, germs, drowning, nuclear anything, arabs, jews, blacks,
young thugs, old perverts, cops, lawyers, tax collectors, spooks, ebola,
the yellow peril, terrorists, traffic, unprotected sex, protected sex, big
business, and the uncontrollable juggernaut of scientific madness.  (I may
have left a couple thousand out.)

Eliezer is terrified of nanowar.  Den Otter is sure the SI is gonna gobble
us all up.  Perhaps so.  But I'm inclined to think it's mostly the bogeyman
lurking in the ancient ancient dark.

And of course, fear is the mother of all motivational tools, so--count on
it--there'll be no relaxing.  "They" have their fist on the fear button,
and they're pounding away relentlessly.  Politics, commerce, entertainment.
 Fear gets your vote.  Fear brings in the bucks.  Fear gets your attention.
 The carrot and the stick.  Fear is the stick.  In our culture we're
subjected to a kind of continuous low-level terrorism.  Work, pay your
taxes, buy things; or something bad will happen to you.  Keep moving.  Keep
working.  Don't think about it.  Resistance is futile. There is no escape.
Rest in peace.

But it doesn't have to be that way.  You may not be able to stop the world
from running on fear, but you don't have to run along with it.  You can get
off that train at the very next station.  Stop reading the newspaper and
watching the tv for a while.  When you've risen out of the paranoia,  go
back and take another look, and you'll see that it's all bullshit.  The
difference between professional wrestling and the evening news is that the
people who watch professional wrestling know that it's staged.  Well, guess
what?  It's ALL staged.  Graphic artists, set designers, lighting
designers, make-up artists, copywriters, and cinematographers.  Lights
camera, action, "Here's the News!"  "The world's a scary place.  Wanna be
safe?  Work harder."  Riiiight.

So, is nanotech dangerous?  Of course it is.  Any powerful technology is
potentially dangerous.  Fire is dangerous, electricity is dangerous, atomic
energy is dangerous.  C'mon, get real.  The world is a dangerous place, you
could die out there.  But you still get up in the morning.  Fear blossoms
into paranoia.  But real danger is something much more defined.

So, regarding the SI community.  They'll be sweethearts.  They'll help us
to do what's right.  They'll take their share and no more.  Why such
restraint on their part, when we're just so many bugs to them?  Because the
operative factor is not--as we in our self-absorption tend to focus on--our
comparative bugness, but rather, their exceeding S-ness.  S-intelligent
implies S-rational, implies S-moral, and S-ethical.  Selfish and
destructive are not S-anything, Ayn Rand not withstanding.

And the nanobots?  There will be so many layers of technology, rationality,
and oversight required to make them work, that sociopaths will be unable to
complete the process.  And what of the legitimate pathology of deliberate
warfare?  Well, warfare has its causes.  Mostly economic, IMO.  So how will
nanotech effect the CAUSES of warfare?  Nanotech-mediated massive abundance
goes a long way towards making warfare, well,... pointless.  Quite possibly
nanotech will change the world so thoroughly that warfare will become as
obsolete as burning witches.

There is no monster under the bed.

Most humans filter their sense data through several layers of brain circuits
into brain data, using both verbalization and emotionalization of the data
as equivalent to the original sense data.

Your term ``qualia'' appears to point at the original sense data, as opposed
to the manipulated brain data derived from such sense data.

E.g. the sense data from the eye units which, among other data, contain data
on the wave length of the photons detected, would be converted into instances
of the concept ``red'' when the received data correspond to certain wave
lengths, as defined by previously stored memory information on eye sense data
transformation learned by the human at an early age.

I have encountered states without verbalization and concepts like ``red''
disappeared in a puff of logic.  I did not see ``red'' but zillions of
colours, all different. The sense data from the eye units did not change,
however; only the interpretation of the sense data.

I would argue that if one accepts that the sense data actually comes from
a world outside one's own mind, then one would become compelled to accept
the sense data as real.

So the question ``boils down'' to what you mean when you use the words
"subjective experience of red".

Do you mean

   (a)	``I experience these eye sense data, and my decision algorithms
	define the wave length part of the data as instances of a concept
	which I call "red", being a subconcept of the concept "colour".
	I identify the resulting verbal brain data as my "subjective
	experience of red".'', 

   (b)	``I experience these eye sense data, and my decision algorithms
	define the wave length part of the data as instances of a concept
	which I call "red", being a subconcept of the concept "colour".
	I identify the corresponding emotional brain data as my "subjective
	experience of red".'', 

   (c)	``I experience these eye sense data, and my decision algorithms
	define the wave length part of the data as instances of a concept
	which I call "red", being a subconcept of the concept "colour".
	My associate memory units access the resulting verbal brain data
	and I identify the resulting verbal brain data as my "subjective
	experience of red".'', 

   (d)	``I experience these eye sense data, and my decision algorithms

   or

   (f)	something else?


Personally, I use the (a) definition in my communication protocols.

Again, how are you going to make the machine "intelligent"? Take it to some

No, No...by "ruffle feathers" I didn't mean irritate or snipe at. I mean
structure sentences "This IS the way it is..." rather than "perhaps it is
conceivable that...".... using the latter just gets "yes, that is
conceivable"...or nothing at all.

You've missed my point. I never said that the same and only the same unfit
deviations are produced - hence "New deviants will.....". I used
homosexuality as a classic example of an evoutionary dead-end. It just so
happens that this trait is very common and repeating.

This is very common knowledge - I perhaps should not assume something sound
based upon its popularity as an explanation.
You cannot say whether or not those that claiming this as fact are "reading
too much in" though, as you have no data. I see it as a distinct possibility
that this "common knowledge" has a basis in scientific research, but I
wouldn't bet my life on it.

Yeah, the way I put it across did imply that everyone would kill themselves,
but my intention was to counter the argument that all would survive, unless
they are in logical error, put by Eliezer.

This is a "blue-sky research laboratory" in Brussels, Belgium.
They list Hugo de Garis and Stuart Hameroff amongst their
research staff, along with dozens of other people working on
"bits, atoms, neurons, and genes (BANG)". It's a very odd mix,
and the website as a whole strikes me as somehow starry-eyed,
at least for the homepage of a business enterprise getting
millions of euros in funding. I doubt the organization's
ability to be a competitive research center across such a
broad range of disciplines. But who knows. Maybe the Singularity
will happen in Belgium, not Texas.

Excuse me, but I don't understand qualia.

No worries -- it's just that the entity previously referenced as "I" is
not actually conscious.

If you wish to try (via email) to prove that "I" am actually anything
other than a bag of canned responses, please feel free.

You might want to ask _why_ it is "very common and repeating". There is
strong circumstantial evidence that it is "very common and repeating" for
the same reason that most female honeybees are sterile workers; it is
to the long-term advantage of the genome to express a phenotype that is
not optimized for reproductive success but that enhances the reproductive
success of its close relatives. There's no "just so" about this sort of
phenotypic oddity; it's an evolutionary adaptation that is or was useful 
to us.

A good starting point if you want to read about this is "The Extended 
Phenotype" by Richard Dawkins. If nothing else, it may make you question
the many facile over-simplifications of Darwinian theory that we are
constantly bombarded with because they support various ideological 
positions.

Ok, Ahem......I've got about 3 minutes left, but I'll whack what I can
down....
If someone put a gun to my head and asked me to guess correctly the function
of consciousness in relation to the rest of the brain, I would say that it
is a conceptual clipboard. Conceptual common ground between the output from
the emotive systems and the intelligent systems and the senses and so on. As
the raw output generated by the various systems is conceptually incompatible
with output from other systems, the data must be translated to a common
conceptual denominator - one that captures the "essence" of each form of
data, without losing data resolution.
For instance, imagine a brain experiencing the triggering factors of fear.
The related system would output it's data - that data would end up in the
consciousness as the effect that we perceive as fear. The other brain
systems are also listening to the consciousness - for data from other areas
that require this conceptual bridge. Next, the intelligence grabs the data -
aggh, fear - it's time to leave it thinks, and off you go. The side effect
is the "you" that actually experiences this fear. You ARE the qualia, the
consciousness, the conceptual clipboard from some backwater somewhere within
eternity. You are here to provide that service to the host organism - and
that's where "your" job ends. Give us your comments on this little bit -
I'll get back to it tommorrow.....gotta go!

Stuart Hameroff (U of Arizona) tends to be a lightning-rod for clever ideas.  
His work on micro-tubules, along with Roger Penrose is robust; though, I am 
in no position to verify or disclaim their veracity.  I like his 
contributions to the Quantum Consciouness mailing list, as well as just about 
everyone else's who contributes there.

I agree Nirvana is a great movie, and has many interesting concepts, the movie
doesn't end there tho, there is a game that continues the movie, however is very
hard to get, by the way the movie is italian not french :)

OK, I agree with this.  Some will commit suicide.  Some will survive.

I think most will muddle through without a clear plan to end it or escape.
I find that most people react to life's obstacles one at a time.  They never
actually plan what to do with their lives.

Unfortunately, this is a common pattern for Extropians.  We cannot debate
any area of serious disagreement.  Qualia, guns, abortion, homosexuality,
the copy question, Privately Produce Law, politics, mysticism, etc. have all
been banned at various times because useful debate was not possible.  I'm
sure many more examples could be found by going through the archives.

How useful can this list be if debate fails upon any real difference of
opinion?  How can we debate or disagree while maintaining useful dialog?

I agree totally.  I would also expand this to cover other traits of the
unknown.

Humans have long had a habit of exaggerating the consequences of the
unknown.  It either our savior or our destroyer.  We have had both doom and
utopian expectations toward agriculture, industrialization, electricity,
computers, space exploration, genetic research, AI,  etc., etc.

Some people predict that each new breakthrough will dawn a new age of
paradise.  Other predict that each new breakthrough will bring about the end
of the world as we know it.  Thus far, these predictions are always extreme.
Statistically speaking, the truth is usually somewhere in-between.

Now for my heresy:  None of the topics discussed on this list will
dramatically change humanity, bring about more freedom or free time, or will
result in mass deaths.  We will adapt, and everything will stay the same
according to human nature.  Yes we have evolved a long way thus far, but the
future will be the same only faster.  We will use computers instead of
camels.  We will move planets instead of piles of rock.  We will dispute
rights to subspace quantum frequencies instead of freespeech.  We will argue
whether AIs have rights rather than race relations.  Everything will be
faster and on a grander scale, but basically the same.  We will adapt to new
technology, just as we upgrade our PCs or game systems to a new version
without much thought.  A few weeks later, we forget how different the new
system was, and go on with our lives.

Yes, we have come a far way from living as nomads in the desert, but our
cities with computers and networks and health advances, are still basically
the same.  We have politics, crime, debates, problems.

My apologies, I misunderstood your meaning.  I agree!  I get ruffled
feathers at people who put so many qualifiers on their messages that when
you pin them down, they never expressed anything definite to even discuss!

No problem.  I just have a hot-button when people mention homosexuality as
an evolutionary dead end.  In my mind it indicates the classic flaw in
believing that every single individual has to propagate or else it is not
furthering the evolution of the group.  This is clearly false to anyone who
has studied biology.  Anything that helps the group survive improves the
breed.

An example:  Drones help a beehive survive.  Just because they don't produce
does not mean that they are an evolutionary dead end.  Their evolution was
crucial in the survival of hive-based groups.  By having non-reproducing
workers do all the engineering and work, this frees up the breeders to do
nothing but breed.  Neither could survive without the other.  People who
think that the breeders are highly evolved while the drones are unevolved,
deviant evolutionary mistakes, is not recognizing the full range of
evolutionary processes.  Evolution developed the entire hive structure to
allow the propagation of each succeeding generation.

I don't object to the fact that cats bring "offerings" to humans.  I think
ascribing the motivations to fear of death, self-glorification, appeasing of
the gods, is projecting human motivations onto the cat.  I don't think that
cats have religious beliefs, fear death or retribution from humans, of
understand self-glorification.  They are just gathering food and bringing it
home to the rest of the group.

It's no true.
In WWII Axies and Allies had many chemical weapons, but they never use them
(in combat).

Since when is debate a "failure" just because none of the combatants
switch sides?  That's not the goal: the debate is a value in itself.
Lots of lurkers get to hear the opposing points of view, the views
themselves are clarified and developed, lines are drawn, terms
defined, brains are exercised.  That sounds pretty productive to me.

I would argue with the notion that a current hi-tech culture is
"basically the same" as a hunter-gatherer community. We can understand 
them, after a fashion, but they not us.

It is difficult to go on with your life as before if there is a new
player on the block, operating on a time scale 10^3..10^6 faster than
you.

The thought occurs to me that one interesting way to help get past this
might be to compile sets of posts on the relevant topic(s), posts which
cover all the basic issues as well as many of the most salient objections,
and have it indexed via a table of contents, keywords, etc.

That way, rather than saying "Yeah, yeah, we've already discussed this
before" one could say "Not only have we discussed this before, this very
point has already been specified.  Check out the Qualia canon, in the
section on Turing computation, and you can read the objections to your
claims.  We'll respect you a lot more when you can contribute something
new to the canon."

I would like you to consider that certain changes are about to happen which
essentially guarantee that the future will not be just the past writ larger.
During the last 50,000 years human nature has changed very slowly while the
memes around us have evolved very rapidly.  This is why you see the similarities
between villages of old and cities of today.  The slow pace of change of human
nature has acted as a stabilizing force on the rapid change of the technology.
I believe it is our limitations that primarily define what we are, and provide a
context in which our accomplishments have meaning.  (I also believe this is why
we write constitutions for institutions and make them difficult to change, as
well as avoid self modifying code unless there's no other way to do it.)

The unprecedented event that is about to happen is the removal of the limitation
that human nature only change slowly.  Our memes have evolved to the point of
handing us the tools necessary to reach inside ourselves and change anything.
Together with the tremendous capability this promises, a basic failure of
pattern integrity will probably result as a Pandora's box of positive feedback
loops are unleashed to spiral out of control.

As an example, I would like to quote a scene from a movie, although I generally
try not to do this because movies are based on the suspension of disbelief.  The
movie is _Lawrence of Arabia_, and the scene takes place while Lawrence is out
in the desert with his guide and they are talking late into the night.  The
guide is trying to understand why Lawrence, who is would be well off in England,
a rich country, would be wandering around out there in the desert, where there
is basically nothing, when he (Lawrence) could have "whatever you want".
Lawrence replied, "Yes, but you can't want what you want".  In the future it
will be possible to reach in and select what you want (your motivation).  Having
done so, you will have changed a basic component of your identity, most likely
leading to more change.

I do not know what will happen to the future, but it seems clear to me that all
things, ideas, institutions, and entities that rely on limitations to preserve
their pattern integrity will be in big trouble.

-Ken

I was not referring to the situation where nobody switched sides.  My
objection is when a topic becomes so heated or repetitive that it is banned
or shunned.  That is when further debate becomes impossible.

I know a thing or two about gunshot imaging in IR, so I'll step into the
fray:

A single gunshot, fired from a weapon with a modern flash suppressor (such
as what would be found on all rifles used at Waco), has a very distinctive
appearance when viewed with either near or far IR imaging.

A muzzle blast coming from a typical "birdcage" flash suppressor appears
as an expanding torus of light at the muzzle, oriented perpendicular to
the path of the bullet.  As the torus expands, the incandescence
decreases until the fuel/air mixture drops below a level that will sustain
combustion.  In the visible spectrum, a muzzle blast from this type of
suppressor generally produces a star-shaped pattern.  It is interesting to
note that a flash suppressor in the visible spectrum actually increases
flash in the IR spectrum.

>From behind or in front, you see an expanding, glowing donut in the IR
spectrum.  From the side, it looks like a pulse with a quick attack and
relatively slow release.  The brightness, diameter, and duration of the
muzzle flash are functions of a large number of things including
ammunition used, flash suppressor design, barrel length, atmospheric
conditions, etc.

With respect to full-auto, the cyclic rate of most modern small arms is
fast enough that muzzle blasts run together between shots,
particularly if your perspective is not along the axis of the gun barrel. 
Automatic fire generally appears as a rapidly pulsating light, where the
magnitude of the flash never quite reaches zero.  This is primarily because
you are seeing the summed incandescence of multiple toruses, with the rate
of fade often being slower than the cyclic rate of the weapon in IR.  

In the unlikely event that you have IR imaging along the axis of the gun
bore (either in front or behind) you will see concentric rings of
decreasing brightness.

The cyclic rate of the weapons most likely used in this instance vary
from 600-900rpm. 

Assuming the IR imaging was recorded at something approximating broadcast
frame rates, there should be enough samples to capture a burst of
automatic fire very nicely in most cases.  But as you approach the Nyquist
limit (frame rates vs weapon cyclic rates), you will start to get aliasing
which in this case amounts to "lost" gun fire.  

Individual shots fired, while probably captured (the duration of muzzle
blast should exceed reasonably fast frame rates), would have wildly
different magnitudes from shot to shot.  In some cases, the muzzle blast
signature would barely register above noise floor depending on when the
frame was captured relative to when the bullet left the muzzle.

If the frame rate is relatively slow (e.g. 15 fps), you can expect to lose
a large portion of the gunshots.  At 30 fps, I would expect to lose
almost none.


While some of the above characterizations may not apply in this
case (e.g. I doubt you would be able to see the torus at the distances and
resolutions involved), it should give a good baseline for discussion. 
Knowing the frame rates for the IR imaging would be extremely useful in
determining if gun shots were "lost" and if lost, what percentage one
could reasonably expect to have been captured.

I agree this is a big important change.  And in an important way, this change
makes it *easier* to envision the future.  At first, we will
replace what we currently want with what we currently want to want.  And then
we will replace that with what we then want to want, which is probably related
to what we now want to want to want.  And since we are actually pretty fuzzy
on what we want at these abstract levels, the main result will be to create
a lot more variety in the values that exist.  Which seems harder to predict.

This greater variety, however, will speed the evolutionary selection of
what creatures want.  First there will be selection for creatures that don't
just randomly change values.  Then there will be selection for values that
induce and enable creatures to reproduce more.  The ability to make upload
copies will greatly speed this second kind of selection (see:
http://hanson.gmu.edu/uploads.html).  After this selection sorts itself out
we should mainly have creatures that want what evolution wants them to want.

So to the extent we can understand the evolutionary selection pressures that
will act on future creatures, we can understand what it is that those
creatures will want.  Presumably the equilibrium will contain many kinds of
creatures wanting different things.  But one kind of creature that seems a
safe bet for being part of the mix are smart creatures that just directly
want to be selected for, and that don't want to change wanting this.

Predicting future evolutionary selection pressures is not easy, but it seems
in many ways easier than predicting how our ancient human programming of what
we want will react to weird new situations it was never designed to deal with.

	Right off the top there are two real obvious reasons.  First
Phenomenal qualia are fantastic fore representing information.  An
abstract "1" or "0" have minimal diversity while the various different
qualia are way diverse.  Can you imagine how confused our conscious
mind would be if the smell of a flower was anything like warm and
red...?  We'd become very confused very fast just as mathmaticians and
computer programmers are very limited in the amount of 1s and 0s they
can keep in their head at once.

	I bet when we discover what qualia are and how the brain uses
them to consciously represent different kinds of information
artificial intelligence will make huge leaps and bounds using such
phenomenal and robust information representation technologies.  You've
got to have lots of inefficient abstract ones and zeros to get
anything close to what qualia can model.

	But an even more compelling reason might be motivation.  How
motivated are current abstract AI programs?  It takes a lot of ones
and zeros carefully crafted into complex and usually brittle control
logic to come up with any kind of artificially motivated behavior
doesn't it?  But the phenomenal qualities of qualia are fundamentally
mostly motivational.  Joys are constructed of qualia and these are
mostly what makes us want what we want with so much passion.  Sure,
you can simulate such abstractly, but I'm betting that evolution uses
qualia because they are fundamentally and robustly motivational.  Take
a "tired" sensation for example.  I think the fact that things get
harder for us to do as we get tired is a very natural thing for
qualia.  Just try to model the same kind of you should slow down
behavior with abstract logic.  It gets complicated very fast.  Sure
it's possible, but is it as easy, especially for nature or evolution?
Commander Data on Star Trek wants to experience pleasure because
without pleasure there is no purpose or reason to life is there?

	How do these arguments sound?  Now that I've expressed them
they don't sound all that bullet proof.  What do you all think?

[To avoid typing "want to want" a great deal, I will use the abbreviation
W1 for "want", W2 for "want to want", W3 for "want to want to want", etc.]

Does it make sense to differentiate what we "want to want" (W2) from
what we "want to want to want" (W3)?

I can see differentiating simple wants (W1) from W2s.  I W1 to overeat,
to lie around and read, to indulge various other bad habits.  At the
same time I W2 to avoid these things and spend my time on things that
will be more rewarding in the long term.  But the role of "W3" is unclear.

If we think of ourselves as made of parts, like a Minsky Society of Mind,
then some parts W1 long-term things, and other parts W1 short-term things.
The long-term parts W1 the short-term parts not to W1 what they do,
hence they W2 long-term things as well as W1 them.

However I can't see, in this model, where W3 would come into play.
Those parts which I identify with when I say that I W2 long-term things
seemingly would be happy once this is achieved.  If we got rid of (or
changed) the parts of me that W1 short-term things, I would no longer
W1 those things and hence I would W2 long-term things.  That's as far
as I go.  I can't see how parts of me could W3 something.

In fact I'm not sure this distinction between "W2" and "W1" really works.
Those parts of me with which I identify when I say I W2 long-term things
are the same ones which W1 those things.  Saying they W2 them is just
a matter of saying that they W1 them but don't always get what they W1
because other parts of me get in the way.  So really the "W2" is just
a matter of a strong "W1" which is being thwarted.

I could just as easily identify with the short-term parts of me and say
that I W2 short-term things.  Sometimes people express this by saying
that they want to learn how to stop worrying and just enjoy the moment.

Ultimately choosing what to W2 is a matter of selecting specific W1s to
emphasize.  The winning W1s get elevated to W2s.  I can't see how to
carry this process on to produce W3s.

With lots of very clever people with very different experiences and
perspectives, I don't think the purpose of the discussions is to form
a "correct" opinion.  Charting a single course into the future is
unlikely to be foolproof, so exploring multiple paths is probably quite
useful.  Most importantly we eductate ourselves in areas where we have
a lack of awareness and develop opinions about who can be trusted to
have knowledge and well thought out ideas in those areas.

I'm wrestling with Biotech and Astronomy, I can't wrestle with AIs,
nanotech, politics, art, morality & philosophy, too.  I can however try
to follow the people who have their attention on those things.
Then in the future when they raise a red flag or suggest a specific
direction, I may know whether or not I should be a cheerleader or
a naysayer, rather than sitting there with a stupid look on my face
going, duuuhhhh... 

Most importantly, we are exploring a phenomena of "group mind".
I can't get my mind to agree with itself most of the time, so
I have little hope for getting "real" agreement among physically
distinct minds.  But I hope that some of our efforts allow the
"group mind" to collectively stumble forward.

Hal, don't you think that W3 are your basic values?  Isn't it W3 that says to you
what those "more rewarding" things are?  What if you could push a button and make
overeating and those other things seem like holy sacraments?  I suggest that after
you pushed the button, you would be a different person.  In the future you will be
presented with a large array of such buttons.  Should the person that you are be
uploaded, the array of such buttons becomes almost unlimited, as does the speed of
button pushing.  This is why I often ask, "What do you upload, when you upload?"

Qualia by itself would not make any difference, not a molecule of
difference, in behavior. Qualia have no evolutionary benefit at all.. this
means that qualia are either
1) an amazing coincidence, or
2) a bi-product of something which does have evolutionary benefit, most
likely cognition. It also probably means that cognition without
consciousness is impossible.

Rob misunderstands here.  Let me try to clear it up.  In Objectivist
discourse, there are three general classes of ethics (and of epistemology,
esthetics, politics, of evaluative disciplines in general).   These are:

1) Intrinsicist which place the good in the object.  Examples include the
Decalogue (Ten Commandments), which are _roughly_ a set of rules which are
taken to be good in themselves -- not because of what they do.

2) Subjectivist which place the good in the subject.  Examples include
people who say what is good is whatever they feel like calling good.

3) Objectivist which place the good in the relation of object to subject.
Within Rand's particular theory that relation which defines the good is that
which promotes (in a totalistic way) the agent's life.

I disagree.  The "situation perception" depends on the subject and the
object.  I see, e.g., the computer screen shrink as a move away from it and
grow as I move closer.  Is this purely subjective?  No.  It's a relation
between the object (my computer screen) and the subject (me).  I can not
will the screen to shrink or grow if it and I stay in the same place and
nothing else changes.

For more on perception, see David Kelley's _The Evidence of the Senses: A
Realist Theory of Perception_.  A review of this book is at my web site
under the title "Perception and Realism."  Also at my site is "A Dialogue on
Happiness," which covers many of the issues in this discussion.

The 30 or so diseases would each have their own
classic cause.  The diseases should be vigorously
treated in their own right.

The only reason to group these established diseases
together under the new syndrome AIDS was
because it was thought an  infectious retrovirus, HIV,
was causing the immune system collapse
common to all these patients.

It is argued that it is not useful to group patients
with one of 30 or so distinct, established
diseases together into a new syndrome
until the proposed common causal virus has
been isolated.

I would like to emphasize
what I think is an important point.
The seminal argument is this: If someone says HIV
causes AIDS, they must begin by proving HIV exists.

There are well-established procedures to properly isolate
a retrovirus,[1] which we ignore at considerable peril.

As I understand it, retrovirus are not esoteric,
nuclear or cosmological notions whose postulated
existence can only be inferred by indirect observations.
They are particles which can be seen, though not
with the naked eye. Since Montagnier and his
colleagues admit to not seeing particles at the
characteristic density having the morphology
of retrovirus, to claim the presence of a retrovirus
much less a "purified virus" is unsubstantiated.

In place of the logic and rigor
demanded by the steps referenced above, a series of
nonspecific phenomena has been accepted as proof
for the existence of HIV.

This is the first point The Perth Group made, in 1988.

IMHO, this fact is hard to avoid, and it has direct bearing
on the questions you ask.

In addition to introducing an HIV critique based on the
principal of viral isolation, Papadopulos also unveiled in her
1988 paper an explanation for AIDS based on the process
of oxidative stress. According to Papadopulos, the stimulants
used to induce "HIV" phenomena in cultures are oxidizing
agents . As are the factors uniting American AIDS patients,
including street drugs, hemophilia treatments, and rectally
deposited semen. Papadopulos proposed that both "HIV"
phenomena and AIDS conditions are consequences of these
and other stressors she would introduce in later papers
(such as blood transfusions, anti-AIDS pharmaceuticals
including AZT, and antibiotics). In her view, when oxidation
is prolonged or excessive, cells become abnormal, injured
and susceptible to diseases.

Since "HIV" has not been isolated, the term "infected person"
used in that context seems premature.

HIV/AIDS is claimed to be sexually transmitted.
Data to support this claim is based not upon microbial isolation
and contact tracing as is the orthodox practice for proving
diseases are infectious and sexually transmitted, but on tests
for antibodies in blood which react to certain proteins deemed
but not proven to be "HIV specific".

Oxidative stress produces these effects with no infectious agent.

Too bad the proponents of the infectious HIV/AIDS model
cannot produce the micrographs of proper viral isolates.
In the absence of clear proof, we can look at
the predictions each theory of AIDS makes.
The two theories would make different predictions.

The theory that AIDS is caused by a sexually transmitted
infectious retrovirus with a 10 year latency period would
[and did]predict
1. random spread between the sexes
2. bi-directional sexual transmission
3. AIDS diseases would spread from the early risk groups
4. isolation of an infectious agent

The oxidative stress theory would predict
1. non-random spread of AIDS, by exposure to oxidative risks
2. since sperm is a strong oxidative, immunosuppressive agent,
the health risk from it is to the receptive anal partner, not the
donor, thus no bi-directional sexual transmission.
3. AIDS diseases to remain in risk groups
4. no isolation of infectious agent (despite "Roman effort")

Comparison of predictions:
1. In the US, Western Europe, and Australia, over 80% of
AIDS patients have been men since the mid 1980's.
In Africa the disease affects men and women equally,
[and the symptoms are completely different].

This is paradoxical for the infectious HIV/AIDS model.
In the whole history of Medicine there has never
been a sexually transmitted agent/disease which is
spread unidirectionally in the West and
bidirectionally (heterosexually) in Africa.
A 50-50% distribution by sex vs a nearly 90-10%
distribution is as different as night and day,
epidemiologically.

The oxidative stress theory argues that both acquired
immune deficiency (AID) and the symptoms and diseases
which constitute the clinical syndrome (S) are long
standing in Africa, affect both sexes equally and are
caused by factors other than HIV. The presence of
positive HIV serology in Africans represents no more than
cross-reactivity caused by an abundance of antibodies
induced by the numerous infectious and parasitic
diseases which are endemic in Africa, that is, a positive
HIV antibody test does not prove HIV infection. Given the
above, one would expect to find a high prevalence of
"AIDS" and "HIV" antibodies in Africa. This is not
proof of heterosexual transmission of either HIV or AIDS.
The factors uniting American AIDS patients include
street drugs, hemophilia treatments, rectally
deposited semen, blood transfusions, anti-AIDS
pharmaceuticals including AZT, and antibiotics.
It would predict AIDS would be correlated with those
risk factors, and not spread randomly through both
sexes by sexual transmission.

2. In 1984 Gallo and his colleagues showed that
"Of eight different sexual acts, a positive HIV antibody
test correlated only with receptive anal intercourse" [2].
Other data supports this conclusion[3].

It has been shown in a number of studies and should be
emphasized that, unlike all sexually transmitted diseases,
where both partners are equally susceptible to the disease,
in homosexual males immunosuppression appears in the
anal sperm recipients but not in the exclusive sperm donors.

The results seem paradoxical for the infectious model,
predicted by the oxidative model.

3. In the developed world, AIDS has remained largely
contained in the original risk groups.

For example, as of the beginning of 1998, 93%
of the cumulative deaths from AIDS in Australia occurred
in the original risk groups, that is, gay/bisexual men, drug
addicts and hemophiliacs. This observation fits the classic
demographic profile of non-infectious diseases which also
remain confined to their risk groups.

If AIDS in Africa is the same condition with the same cause
as anywhere else in the world then AIDS in Africa and
AIDS in the West should be identical. This is not the case
and what is called AIDS in Africa is almost unrecognizably
different from AIDS in the West, so much so that if African
patients suddenly switched continents, very few
Africans would remain AIDS cases. This is due to the
existence of multiple AIDS definitions, one for Africa
(the same for adults and children), one for adults in North
America, Europe and Australia, one for children in these
countries and one for Latin America.

The WHO Bangui definition for Africa does not
require immunological (T4 lymphocyte cell or
antibody) tests or a specific disease diagnosis but
consists largely of  symptoms such as weight loss,
diarrhea, cough and fever.  For example, an African
with diarrhea, fever and persistent cough for longer
than one month is, by definition, an AIDS case.
However, the symptoms listed in the Bangui
definition (WHO, 1986) are common and non-specific
manifestations of many diseases which are endemic in
Africa and were so long before the AIDS era.
[http://www.virusmyth.com/aids/data/epafrica.htm]

It is argued that the lack of spread of AIDS from the
original risk groups and the fact that different
risk groups have their own characteristic AIDS disease
is paradoxical to the infectious model,
but not the oxidative stress model.

Even proponents of the HIV/AIDS model confirm
that "AIDS does not have the characteristics of an
ordinary infectious diseases.  This view is
incontrovertible."[Lancet 339 (1992):1289-1290]
Likewise, epidemiologists Eggers and Weyer conclude
that "the spread of AIDS does not behave like
the spread of a disease that is caused by a
single sexually transmitted agent" [Eggers, H.J.
and J.J. Weyer, Linkage and Independence of
AIDS Kaposi disease, Infection 19(1991):115-122.

4. Lack of isolation:
Montagnier and Gallo did use density gradient
banding but for some unknown reason they did not
publish any EMs of the material at 1.16 gm/ml which
they and everyone afterwards call "pure HIV".

In 1997 Montagnier revealed that the reason no scanning
EM's of the material that banded at the characteristic
density of retroviruses was published was because even after
"Roman effort", they could see no particles with
"morphology typical  of retroviruses".[5]
He says Gallo also did not isolate.


Two historic papers in the leading science journal Virology
in March 1997 disclosed "major contaminants" in "pure HIV".[6]
Here is a page containing electron microsope images of
the cellular debris and microvesicles which contained the
proteins used to make up the antibody tests and probes
and primers used in "HIV viral load" measurements
[http://www.virusmyth.com/aids/award.htm].

Here  is a link to a photo of a proper viral isolate.
[http://www.virusmyth.com/aids/news/edhlettercont.htm]

Without a proper banded viral isolate, it is impossible to say
that proteins extracted from this soup of particles comes from
an actual viral particle or from the contaminating cellular debris.

This is the crucial point.

If it is admitted that the majority of the material called
"pure HIV" is cellular, not viral [and it is], then:

1. How is it possible to claim proof for retroviral
purification and thus for the existence of HIV?

2. How is it possible to consider the proteins which
banded at 1.16gm/ml to be the proteins of a unique
retrovirus, HIV, and to use them as antigens in antibody
tests to prove infection with a deadly retrovirus, HIV?

3. How is it possible to consider the RNAs which banded
at 1.16gm/ml represents the genome of a unique retrovirus
and to use these as probes and primers for hybridization
and PCR tests to prove infection with this virus and in fact
to measure the viral load?

This is the core argument of the perth Group.

Stefan Lanka expounded on the implications of
a lack of "HIV isolates"  despite dogged efforts.
This should not be so for a  virus that exists. Lanka writes:
"It has been long known that what "AIDS" researchers have
presented as photos of "HIV" show normal
cellular [microvesicles]... As those particles are designed,
in contrast to viruses, for cellular use only, they are very
unstable when removed from their context, and not able to
be isolated and photographed in an isolated state.
Viruses are stable because they have to leave cells or even
the organism in order to infect other cells or organisms anew.
Using centrifugation techniques it is no problem to separate
viruses from all contaminating components and in doing so
to isolate them--then photograph them, then represent their
proteins and genetic substance in a direct way... Genuine viruses
are so stable that it is easy... to photograph them directly as
three dimensional particles in the [scanning] electron microscope
without prior chemical fixation. In contrast [microvesicles]
are so unstable they can only be photographed [with a
transmission electron microscope, which requires they be]
in a chemically fixed state... in very thin sections. All that
have been shown to us as [micrographs of] "HIV" are ultrathin
sections [that include what are agreed to be] cellular particles. ."

Sure enough, the micrographs of proper viral isolates presented
by Lanka in his rejoinder to Steven Harris were
photographed with the scanning electron microscope,
and thus showed--with high resolution and
three-dimensional relief--the outer surfaces of the viruses.
In contrast, the purported "HIV" micrograph
presented by Harris was photographed by the
transmission electron microscope in "ultrathin sections," producing
flat, transparent, cross-sectional images with no surfaces
and poor resolution. According to Lanka, viruses are
hardy enough to be photographed either way, and ought to be,
since one reveals the surface in great detail, and
the other reveals important cross-sectional information.

But there exists no published scanned micrograph of anything
claimed to be "HIV." Since there are billions of
dollars and tens of thousands of scientists annually devoted to
the study of "HIV," it seems improbable that this
could indicate an oversight. More likely the retrovirus-looking
objects called "HIV" are, like microvesicles,
simply too unstable for scanned electron microscopy and
procedures that could otherwise separate them from
all other objects into pure samples, which is to say--
in Lanka's opinion--they are too unstable to be viruses.

(Instability, by the way, gives the objects labeled "HIV"
both the characteristics Papadopulos assigns
endogenous retroviruses, the other being non-infectivity
in their cell-free form.)

Wrong predictions affirm bad theories, correct predictions
make them powerful.

>Each person is
>manufacturing his own endogenous retrovirus?

Either the agents to which the patients are exposed
induce the right conditions or the culture conditions play a part.
Perhaps a major part. The patients are sick. In fact they
are sick before they ever develop AIDS. So their cells are sick
and their sick cells find themselves in the right condition in cultures
to be activated. That's whats needed to produce endogenous virus and
that's been known for decades.

"Normal human DNA contains retroviral information which
did not get there following a retroviral infection.
The cell was born with it. So amongst all our DNA there are
stretches made up of some retroviral information and that may
sit there maybe all your life until something happens.
The DNA starts to make RNA and hence proteins, and this may
go even further and lead to the assembly of endogenous retroviral
particles. They're called endogenous because they're not something
that got in from the outside. Like HIV is supposed to.
Something that gets in from the outside is called exogenous.
Long before the AIDS era everyone knew that in animal cells
endogenous retrovirus production could occur  spontaneously.
You make a cell culture and do nothing else. Just leave it on the
bench for a few days or maybe a few weeks and then one day it
starts to produce retroviral-like particles. They seemingly come
out of nowhere and the process can be significantly accelerated
and the yield of particles increased, sometimes millions of times,
by conditions which induce cellular activation, the same conditions
which are obligatory to obtain what is called HIV from cell cultures.
Interestingly, up until 1993, neither Gallo nor Fauci who is another
well-known HIV researcher, accepted that humans contain the DNA
to make endogenous retroviruses but now it's accepted
that endogenous retroviral DNA forms about 1% of human DNA.
For the record, that's about 3,000 times larger that what the experts
claim is the size of the HIV genome. And what's more, new
retroviral genomes can arise by  rearrangements and recombination
of existing retroviral genomes."
[Eleni Papadopulos-Eleopulos]

Having AIDS may just be a prescription for developing those
abnormalities. Retrovirologists themselves have argued that
retroviruses may arise as the result of a disease and not vice versa.
Getting cause and effect the wrong way around
is not new to Medicine.

Gallo and his colleagues serendipitously discovered a test which for
some reason predicts a tendency to get sick from certain diseases that
are lumped together as AIDS. But it doesn't prove that the link to all
these diseases is a retrovirus.

>If there is no such thing as HIV, why would everyone's
>self-manufactured retrovirus be the same?

They aren't the same. Another paradox for the infectious
HIV/AIDS model, another prediction of the oxidative
stress model.

In 1990 the HIV genome was said to consist of ten genes.
In 1996 Montagnier reported that HIV possesses eight genes
and according to Barr,-Sinoussi, HIV has nine genes.
Neither is there constancy of the number of nucleotides in the
"HIV genome". Thus, not only are there no two HIV genomes
of the same length or nucleotide composition, there is no single
genetic entity "HIV DNA" to describe the myriads of "HIV
genomes". It is also estimated that patients contain between one
and one hundred million distinct HIV DNAs at the one time.

How the genetic information of HIV was manufactured:

"...the majority of AIDS researchers still cling  to the authenticity
of HIV, because a genetic sequence for it has been published.

Since no virus has been isolated, it follows that no nucleic acid
has been isolated from it either. Complicated procedures are,
nonetheless, described in the literature, at the end of which
something is produced which is called the nucleic acid of HIV.

1. In a tube....

HIV and its DNA can allegedly be made by the "bucketful"
but under very surprising conditions which, inter alia, entail the
use of extracts from plants and other oxidizing chemicals, which
could not possibly exist in vivo. Immortalized cell lines devised
(and later patented) by the Montagnier and Gallo groups are
co-cultured with extracts from human cells or the cells themselves.
At the end of it all HIV itself is not actually obtained only reverse
transcriptase activity is shown to occur which is taken to imply
that the DNA that is found, must have been viral in origin.

The real explanation of what happens is as follows.
In the mixture of cell cultures and stressed human cells,
RNA and reverse transcriptase come to be produced
in large amounts, because the cells have been specially
selected and treated to do this. The RNA is transcribed into
DNA by reverse transcriptase, and long pieces
of DNA are produced which are said to be viral DNA.
In fact they are composed of unrelated pieces of expressed
cellular RNA, transcribed into DNA and linked together by
a process of "template switching" (a well-characterized
property of reverse transcriptase). This misleads ordinary
researchers into believing that they have actually produced
viral DNA. It is said that this linear DNA is the free or the
non-integrated form of HIV, which furthermore is said to be
a unique feature of HIV, because a lot of detectable free
linear DNA has not been suggested in any other
models of retroviruses.

2. Through selecting processes....

The resulting pieces of DNA too, are necessarily both
shorter and longer than the "correct" length of HIV.
Pieces corresponding to the "correct" length of HIV
must be selected for size, because otherwise the purported
DNA preparation would be a mixture of various lengths,
which would violate a cardinal rule of virology that all nucleic
acid of a particular virus be identical in size.

3. Through a detecting process....

Having artificially prepared DNA pieces of uniform length,
they are still not ready for presentation, because they consist
of a mixture of all kinds of RNA fragments
transcribed into DNA and thus cannot be shown to represent
unique viral DNA. Accordingly, the mixture is subjected to a
kind of key-and-lock detection process called hybridization,
whereby pieces of DNA are detected which complement more
or less a probe of that which it is desired to be shown to have
been prepared.

4. Choosing a desired probe....

Since no DNA from HIV existed to hybridize with the prepared
DNA, Gallo and Montagnier simply used stretches of DNA
from what they said was specific to HTLV-I, a retrovirus
Gallo had earlier claimed to have discovered, and which
they deemed suitable for this purpose. The DNA detected
in this way was replicated and certain stretches of it cloned
and declared to be the DNA of HTLV-III
(later to be called HIV).

To summarize, the purpose of the exercise is to grow HIV,
but it actually produces a mixture of different lengths of DNA,
contrary to theory which says they should all be identical,
and no virus at all. It is then claimed that the "correct"
DNA has been prepared by finding certain strands in this
heterogeneous mix by hybridizing them with an HTLV-I DNA
probe whose sequence is known and defined also to be HIV.
However, non-hybridizing strands of DNA should not
be there at all, and the fact that they are, proves that a complete
rag-bag of DNA has been prepared, without any indication
of what it is made up of.

It follows that "HIV" DNA must just be a laboratory artifact
constructed to a preconceived idea of what retroviral DNA
should be, and this assessment does not even raise the question
why no virus can be obtained, whatever the experimental conditions.

One cannot help asking why no-one had not long ago spotted
the flaw in the techniques employed by the Gallo and Montagnier
groups. After defining some segments of DNA to be "HIV"-specific,
every researcher in the field worked exclusively with short, cloned
sequences (never the whole strand) on the reasonable assumption
that the original characterization had been correctly performed.
>From the isolation and identification procedure described above, it
follows that the resultant sequences vary widely from one preparation
to the next, which sequence analysts misinterpreted as the legendary
capacity of HIV to mutate..."

>greatly reduced the death rate from AIDS?

AZT has been and still remains the most recommend anti-HIV drug.
Critical analysis of the presently available data which claim
that AZT has anti-HIV effects shows there is neither
theoretical nor experimental evidence which proves that AZT,
used either alone or in combination with other drugs, has
any such effect. [http://www.mmsweb.com/eykiw/aids/azt.htm]

HIV experts all agree that only the triphosphorylated form of AZT
(AZTTP) and not the unphosphorylated form administered to patients,
nor its mono- or diphosphate, is the active agent.

AZT underwent clinical trials and was introduced as a specific
anti-HIV drug many years before there were any data proving that
the cells of patients are able to triphosphorylate the parent
compound to a level considered sufficient for its putative
pharmacological action. Notwithstanding, from the evidence published
since 1991 it has become apparent that no such phosphorylation takes
place and thus AZT cannot possess an anti-HIV effect.

This is confirmed by the largest and most rigorous controlled study
of AZT, the Concorde trial done in 1994, a double-blind randomized
comparison of two policies of AZT treatment (immediate and deferred}.
This involved 1749 symptom-free, HIV-infected individuals from centers
in the UK, Ireland and France. The 347 clinical endpoints
(AIDS and death) outnumbered the total of those in all other published
trials in symptom-free and early symptomatic infection. The results
showed "there was no statistically significant difference in clinical
outcome between the two therapeutic policies". In 1995, extended results

of Concorde showed a significant increased risk of death among
the patients treated early.
[Concorde: MRC/ANRS randomized double-blind controlled trial of
immediate and deferred zidovudine in symptom-free HIV infection.
Concorde Coordinating Committee. Lancet 343:871-81.

However, despite these data, disclaimers that patients treated with
AZT may continue to develop the AIDS diseases, that the side effects
of AZT may mimic AIDS, and AZT given to non-HIV-infected babies
causes the AIDS defining pneumonia PCP, AZT continues to be
the most commonly prescribed anti-HIV drug.

A new generation of AIDS drugs, Protease Inhibitors, first became
available late in 1995 and are credited with saving many lives.
However, the AIDS death rate was already declining in 1994,
the definition of AIDS in the US had been expanded to
include people with no visible illness in 1993
[HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report, CDC. 1998.
www.cdc.g ov/nchstp/hiv_aids/stats/hasrlink.htm],
and the annualized death rate of people diagnosed in 1997
was higher than in those diagnosed in 1995 and 1996.
Protease inhibitors have been associated with serious health
problems, including diarrhea, nausea, dangerously high
cholesterol levels, diabetes and heart disease
[Carr A, Cooper DA. Gap between biology and reality in AIDS.
Lancet. 1998 Dec 19; 352(S5): 16.].

The protease inhibitors are prescribed as one of up to 200 possible
"cocktails" with AZT or similar drugs. At the July 1996 XIth
International AIDS conference Time Magazine Man of the Year
David Ho predicted that "scientists would find new drugs to wipe
HIV out of the body within three years possibly within just one".(93)
At the July 1998 XIIth AIDS conference Ho stated it will take at
least ten years of intense combination drug therapy to kill off all
the HIV in an infected person's body but a sizable percentage of HIV
patients will never get close. Many patients cannot tolerate the
untoward effects of these "cocktails" and measurements show that the
DNA "viral" burden does not decrease.(94-97) In the May 1998
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Dr. William Paul,
former Director of the National Institutes of Health's Office of
AIDS Research writes, "no matter how long a person is treated with
anti-HIV drugs, there will always be new viruses... you will have to
be treated forever... No one is getting cured... This bodes extremely
poorly for combination therapy as something curative".

Given the toxicity of these drugs, it is unlikely anyone can tolerate
taking them for more than a few years. If this outlook is gloomy
for HIV/AIDS sufferers, it is even worse considering there is no
substantial, alternative therapeutic strategy anywhere on the horizon.
The futility of all "anti-HIV" drugs, past present and future is best
highlighted in a June 1998 interview by Dr. Harold Varmus, Nobel
Laureate retrovirologist and Director of the NIH. "Trying to rid the
body of a virus whose genome is incorporated into the host genome
may be impossible". Indeed, how can a drug rid a body of material
so intimately bound to the host DNA genetic material?

"The oxidative stress theory predicted that the mechanism responsible
for HIV and AIDS could be prevented and treated by limiting or ceasing
exposure to agents capable of inducing cellular oxidation and
administering reducing agents, especially those containing sulphydryl
groups (-SH) or modalities which lead to their increase, in conjunction
with diet and general health care.

Although the theory has been ignored, many researchers, for reasons
they have not stated, have determined the -SH levels in AIDS patients
and those at risk. As the theory predicted, it was found that:

{i) The tissues of AIDS patients and those at risk, including
T4 lymphocytes, are oxidized61,120.

ii) Oxidizing agents lead to the development of the phenomena which are
said to prove HIV infection10,11,121.

{iii) Reducing agents cause the opposite effect; that is, they inhibit
these same phenomena10,11,121.

{iv) This year, researchers from Stanford University showed that
GSH [reduced glutathione] levels are lower in subjects with CD4 T-cell
counts below 200/ml (CD4 < 200) than in subjects at earlier stages of
HIV disease; that among subjects with CD4 < 200, lower levels of GSB
[glutathione-S-bimane] (an FACS [fluorescence-activated cell sorter]
measure of GSH in CD4 T-cells) predict decreased survival; and that
the probability of surviving 2-3 years increases dramatically as GSB
level approach normal range. In addition, we have presented preliminary
evidence suggesting that oral administration of NAC [N-acetylcysteine],
which supplies the cysteine required to replenish GSH, may be
associated with improved survival of subjects with very low GSH
levels120.

In other words, and as these data prove, unlike a declining CD4 cell
count, there is a direct relationship between decreased cellular -SH
levels and
patient survival even at CD4 cell counts < 200/mL. These data support
our
theory8,10 that oxidation is of pivotal importance in the development of
AIDS. Is
there not, then, a scientific justification to begin trials with -SH
containing
compounds for the prevention and treatment of AIDS - especially when one
considers
that some of these agents are relatively non-toxic, cheap and readily
available?"
[from http://www.mmsweb.com/eykiw/aids/azt.htm]

>What about the monkeys, and the SIV?  Does that not exist either?

The evidence for SIV isolation and "purified" SIV
is no better than that for HIV.

In addition, "SIV" does not cause any disease in wild monkeys,
although roughly 50% are said to be naturally infected.

In labs, the absence of "SIV" antibodies predicted the incidence
of diseases in monkeys, while the opposite is claimed for humans
infected with "HIV".

In summary, I would like to say that it is not a theory to point
out that "HIV" has never been isolated by the well-established
guidelines:

1. Montagnier admitted in 1997 that he did not isolate[7], and
from the evidence he saw Gallo did not isolate.

2. The Electron Micrographs of the "pure HIV" source for proteins
used in antibody tests and RNAs used as probes and primers for
hybridization and PCR tests to prove infection with this virus and
in fact to measure the viral load reveal that the majority of the
"pure HIV" is made up of cellular contaminants.
[http://www.virusmyth.com/aids/award.htm]

3. Leading experts now [1997] concur[6].

"HIV" has not been isolated.

It seems improbable that this could indicate an oversight.
More likely the retrovirus-looking objects called "HIV" are,
like microvesicles, simply too unstable for scanned electron
microscopy and procedures that could otherwise separate them from
all other objects into pure samples, which is to say--
"HIV" will not be isolated.

Notes:

[1] At the 1973 meeting at the Pasteur Institute the steps which
one has to follow to isolate retroviruses were  thoroughly discussed
and indeed are straightforward commonsense and are not dissimilar
from those enumerated earlier by Beard.
1.Culture the cells that are considered infected by the retrovirus
particle.
2.Purify putative retroviral-like particles by application of a method
that is capable of extracting them from everything else that is not
retroviral-like particles (banding in sucrose density gradients).
3. Proof obtained by use of electron microscopy that
(a) there are such particles. (It is frankly misleading to proceed as if

there are particles when in fact there are none).
(b)the particles are pure;
(c) the morphology of such particles is consistent with this
family of viruses. Retroviral particles need to have a dense
core, a diameter of 100-120 nM, to be almost spherical and
to have their surface studded with knobs approximately
10nM in length.
4.Disrupt a preparation of pure particles and analyze the
constituents (RNA and proteins). The latter must include an
enzyme able to catalyze the synthesis of DNA from a piece
of RNA.
5. Take a preparation of pure particles and prove that such
particles, when introduced into fresh, uninfected cells, produce
exactly the same particles, that is, the particles are infectious.
This necessitates repeating steps (1) to (4). Thus proving the
existence of a retrovirus involves isolating the particles twice.
(And although it may seem trite to need even mention the fact,
viral proteins and RNA are those and only those proteins and
RNA that appear following disruption of purified viral particles).

[3]http://www.virusmyth.com/aids/data/vtyinyang.htm:
In 1986 Gallo and his colleagues reported they "found no
evidence that other forms of sexual activity, contribute to
the risk" of HIV seroconversion in gay men.(103) In an
extensive review of 25 studies of gay men reported in 1994 by
Caceres and van Griensven, the authors concluded
that " no or no consistent risk of the acquisition of
HIV-1 infection has been reported regarding
insertive intercourse".(104) In the West, the largest
and most judiciously conducted prospective epidemiological
studies such as the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study
(MACS) of 4955 gay men (105) have proven beyond all
reasonable doubt that in gay men the only significant sexual
act related to becoming HIV antibody positive is receptive
anal intercourse. Thus in gay men, AIDS may be likened to
the non-infectious condition, pregnancy. It is acquired by the
passive partner but is not transmitted to the active partner.

Significantly, the MACS also showed that once a gay man
becomes HIV positive, progression to AIDS is further
determined by the amount of passive anal intercourse
sustained after "infection". This is contrary to all that is known
about infectious diseases. Infection, not repeated infections,
causes disease.

The largest and best conducted studies in heterosexuals
including the European Study Group (107) show that for
women, the only sexual practice leading to an increased risk
of becoming HIV antibody positive is anal intercourse.
The unidirectional transmission of "HIV" observed in OECD
countries is supported by Nancy Padian's ten year study of
heterosexual couples (1986-1996).(108)

[7]On July 17th 1997, the French investigative television journalist
Djamel Tahi interviewed Professor Luc Montagnier in camera at the
Pasteur Institute in Paris. Montagnier was asked, "Why do the EM
photographs published by you [in 1983] come from the culture and
not the purification?". His reply was, "There was so little production
of virus it was impossible to see what might be in a concentrate of the
virus from the gradient ["pure virus"]. There was not enough virus to
do that. Of course one looked for it, one looked for it in the tissues
at the start, likewise the biopsy. We saw some particles but they did
not have the morphology typical of retroviruses. They were very
different.Relatively different. So with the [unpurified] cultures it
took many
hours to find the first pictures. It was a Roman effort! Charles Dauget
[an EM
expert] looked at the plasma, the concentrate, etc he saw nothing
major".
Questioned about the Gallo group he replied, "Gallo? I dont know if
he really purified. I dont believe so". This should have been
both the beginning and the end of HIV.

On today's National Public Radio's Talk of the Nation, a panel was convened
on the topic of science fiction and science, comprised of:
         David Brin (science fiction author)
         William Gibson (cyberpunk author)
         Ann Simon (lead consultant to the X-files)

What was interesting was the prevalance of transhumanist themes in the
discussion. 

--some discussion centered on a new theme of optimism in science fiction
and speculative fiction, where things go very well for humanity.  Verner
Vinge's singularity was mentioned in this part of the discussion 

--nanotechnology was mentioned as one potential path of development

--a caller asked about the interaction between human and technology.  In
the subsequent discussion, Gibson said "We are in some real ways posthuman,
and there is no going back from that."

--Ann Simon mentioned that the X-files is actually stimulating young people
to consider careers in science, becuase it is one of the few places in
mainstream media where science and scientists are portrayed in a positive way.

--David Brin brought up The Transparent Society during a discussion of
neoluddite backlash.  Ann Simon had just voiced her fear that there would
be an upheaval against other technologies patterned on the one now ongoing
against genetic engineering of foodstuffs.  Brin said that if a significant
portion of society turns its back on technology, it would actually create
the kind of elitist divide that the neoluddites fear in the first place.
He then described the concept of ubiquituous information and how it could
benefit everyone.

As you may or may not have heard, 30,000 neoluddites and their friends have 
succeeded in stalling WTO meetings today.  (Seattle is now under a state of
emergency, national guard, etc.)  A programmer who works in the
building nearby is documenting the fun at his web site:

There's nothing like using the exact opposite term than intended to screw up
an example!

You are exactly right.  The drones are the fertile males and the workers are
the infertile females.  My example should have talked about the evolution of
the "worker" not "drone" as being necessary to the hive survival so that the
breeders could pass on their genes to the next generation.

Hmmm....
Why do you ask?

I vote "YES!" to octopodes.
