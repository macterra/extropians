I don't know why they won't survive, either, but that's because I happen to

This is why I used asterisks when I said "long term". If we become a
cultural monocrop in the next century, I don't expect that we'll get well
past that condition until after the diaspora reaches its interstellar
stages. Geographic (well, cosmographic) separation leads to clading.
There's been talk of cosmic wormholes and "empires", but if a wormhole can
be created, it can be destroyed. Emigrants can close the doors behind them.
Hence, in the *long* term, we'll see clading and differentiation again,
sooner or later. Colonies will carry culture with them, but after a century
or two, the culture in the colonies of the Coal Sack region is not going to
look much like the culture in the colonies of the Ursa Major group.

And it's entirely possible that means of differentiation will be found that
can be used even within the narrow confines of the Solar System. Once you
take your stuff out of the ecliptic plane, it's pretty darn inaccessible
(or at least expensive to get to), thanks to the delta-vees.

IAN: I can speak for myself, not for others. Others have different 
goals. If I want to make my goals the goal of "the whole human race," 
then I will have to resort to skillful persuasion or coercion. 
Libertarianism simply stipulates that the only ethical course 
of action is persuasion. In fact, nonaggression is also the 
course that leads to maximal social benefit. 

Focus on the individual does not contradict a focus on the whole,
for, as you keenly observe:

  > As I see it, none of us truly has an individual "self" -- 
  > the self is a social/cultural construct.  We are all, in 
  > the end, made up of EACH OTHER. 

IAN: As there is no "individual" -- that is, no unit that is what it 
is free from external relations -- there is only a unified holistic 
identity composed of many faces, each creating the other, thus it 
follows that: 

1) Focus on the whole is focus on the individual: when I say 
X is good for everybody, so DO IT ! ( ;^) ) I focus on my 
individual valuation/measurements over that of all others.
(Notice that most megalomaniacs -- hyper egoists aggressors -- 
speak in terms of 'the whole human race,' and its conquest.)

2) Focus on the individual is focus on the whole: The whole
is composed of the individual many times over. You can 
only "reach" the whole if you can reach each individual.

So the "focus on the individual" is not a contradiction of the 
unified relational identity that contains each individual.
In fact, advocating decentralized economic planning is
advocating the liberation of the collective identity
expressed as "the invisible hand." Central economic
planning is the advocation of control of the whole
human race by a few individual planners.


But I agree that addressing the collective identity that each 
person is, is a necessary feature of any winning meme. In fact, 
those memes that speak to the collective identity have proven 
to be most successful in their spread.

The majority of people who know of libertarianism but reject
it, do so, in my experiential observation, because they feel
that it does not speak to the collective identity and offer 
it, of which I am a part, economic guarantees. The point is
that central planning does offer the guarantee of bankruptcy,
while free markets guarantee improving standards of living,
innovation and consistently lower prices on average.


Law of Identity: A is A, relative to not-A. A = (A + ~A)

Law of Nonidentity: If there is 100% A, there is 0% A. A = ~A

I presume we agree that murder isn't part of a long term plan, since
there's some risk that the potential victims will eventually organize
and stop you, and there is little corresponding benefit.

We evolved in circumstances where this is true, so our emotions are
biased to feel this way.

So I think the wrongness of murder is subjective, but that doesn't
make it an arbitrary stupid premise; our subjectivity approximately
obeys laws because we got where we are now by evolution.  Murder feels
wrong because it is impractical and it was impractical for all of our
ancestors.

Hofstadter had to assume that perfectly rational beings should all
make the same choices in the same circumstances.  This is a premise
that leaps the is/ought boundary.  I don't see where he acknowledges
that his premise is arbitrary, and I actually do not believe the
premise.  In any case, since I'm not a perfectly rational being, I
don't see any way to reliably use the premise, since it involves
predicting the behavior of beings more complex than myself.  

I'll have a look at the Gautier reference.

Thanks!

>Intrinsic goal: get some honey. Why? Because you just happen to want some
>honey.

But that's just hiding things under the rug.  Let's play a little harder:

Intrinsic goal: get some honey. Why? Because I just happen to want
some honey.  Why?  Because ...  er ..., gee, I have this mental state
that says I desire honey.  Why?  Well, either the mental state is a
stupid mistake arising from general mental flakeyness (and the desire
for honey is therefore a stupid goal), or the mental state has some
valid cause outside of itself, such as evolution plus a need for
calories or nutritional completeness or some such.  Why?  Well, I need
calories or nutritional completeness so I can stay alive and healthy.
So now the goal has become either extrinsic or stupid, right?

If we call it extrinsic, we should take the trouble to remember the
original thing that made us want to call it intrinsic -- the emotion
with which it was held.  It's the emotion that makes satisfying the
goal non-drudgery; I don't think it is important that the emotion is
the ultimate justification of the action.  Emotions are quite
flexible, so it is very risky to use them as an ultimate
justification.

Quite often people think a goal is somehow "true" if you don't know
where it came from.  This is quite analogous with Christians who think
that Faith is good simply because there is no rational reason to do
it.  Yuck.  I prefer extrinsic goals, since IMO the allegedly
intrinsic ones are either stupid goals or are really extrinsic goals
that are not well-understood.  Calling them intrinsic stops the
understanding.  Among non-philosophers, intrinsic goals are called
"fun".  These are the frivolous goals Lyle was talking about.

Having fun is okay, but don't use it to justify your actions.

Some seem to think that The Prometheus Project is not needed and
that  the conventional methods of freezing a brain we use now
are all that is needed because Nanotechnology can always make
any repairs that are required. I don't think  that is a valid
reason for not supporting this project. We don't know how much 
damage the current methods of freezing cause to the brain,
personally I think Nanotechnology probably has a good chance of
repairing that damage, but I don't know that for a fact, and
nobody knows how long it will take to develop Nanotechnology,
and anyway "probably" is just not good enough. Think how
embarrassing it will be if years from now we find that there was
a simple way to preserve brains without damage and that method
was within the means of late 20'th century technology, but we
didn't find it because we didn't bother to look. A million
dollars a year for 10 years may seem like a lot of money to us
when we're begging for dollars, but it's peanuts compared to
money spent on far less important health research projects. In
spite of this it would be far, far, more money than was ever spent 
on brain preservation, the low hanging fruit has not been picked yet.

Most people, myself included, thought that Nanotechnology or
advanced genetic engineering would be needed to repair a spinal
cord that had been severed, but now according to a recent report
by Cheng, Olson, and Cao (July   26, 1996 Science) a simple
surgical procedure may solve the problem, at least  it works in
rats. In the same way, it's possible that Prometheus might find 
something much simpler than Nanotechnology that would get the
job done, and  even if does not it will certainly find new
knowledge for mankind that could  help us all. This is virgin
intellectual territory, almost everything seen  will be new.

Subject: Prometheus Project Description



The Prometheus Project

     Convincingly demonstrated, scientifically proven and published,
     fully reversible long-term brain cryopreservation within 10 years

     As of July 31, 1996, after about six weeks of promotion, first in
CryoCare Forum, and then on the Internet through the CryoNet list and the
sci.cryonics news-group, pledges of $212,200.00 per year, or a total of
$2,122,000.00 payable over a 10 year period have been solicited for the
Prometheus Project. These pledges, ranging in yearly value from $1,000 to
$25,000, have been made by 38 individuals and 2 organizations.

     The research project which has been greeted so enthusiastically and
supported so strongly is one which several of us have been talking about for
many months now since we realized that two of the most critical factors which
have kept cryonics small, insecure and unscientific, have become
substantially improved. Those two factors are:

1)   that current cryobiological methods to reversibly preserve large organs
     which are now nearing perfection should be applicable to the human brain
     after suitable modifications, and

2)   that the population and the wealth of the cryonics community has reached
     a size which should enable it to support mainstream cryobiological
     research to perfect and convincingly demonstrate fully reversible
     mammalian brain cryopreservation, if cryonicists could only be convinced
     to do so.
     
     Because of its audacity and life-providing purpose we have named this
project: The Prometheus Project. If our pledge campaign is successful the
project research will be conducted by a for-profit corporation to be formed
for this immediate purpose and for the longer-range purpose of producing
fully reversible whole-body suspended animation. At this time only solid
pledges of $1,000 or more per year for 10 years beginning in 1998 are being
requested. When a total of over $1,000,000 per year has been pledged, a
company will be formed, an investment prospectus will be issued, share
purchase contracts will be signed by all consenting pledgers, the first
year's payments will be collected, shares will be issued, and the project
will begin. In accordance with SEC regulations, I must state that this
writing is not a solicitation for the purpose of purchasing shares in any
existing corporation.

     Needless to say, it is my strong belief, and one I sincerely hope that
you will share with me after due consideration of this Project, that the most
rewarding aspect of the successful completion of the Prometheus Project will
be the almost certain opportunity for each of us to live vastly extended,
healthy lives.


The Purpose of The Prometheus Project

     The purpose of the Prometheus Project is to demonstrate by methods which
will be convincing to the public and will be published in a peer reviewed
scientific journal, the restoration to normal physiological and mental
functioning of a mammalian brain which has been preserved and stored at a
temperature below -140xC for at least 6 months or which could be so stored
for hundreds of years if necessary without additional damage.


Logical Necessity of The Prometheus Project for Those Who Wish to Stay Alive

The Problem:

1.   Unless major scientific anti-aging advances are made, every one of us
     faces the virtually certain inability of our body to sustain its life
     within a period of 125 years minus our present age. If you are over 75
     years old, the chance of major anti-aging and rejuvenating scientific
     advances being made soon enough to allow you to live a vastly extended
     healthy lifetime is virtually zero. If you are over 50 years old, the
     chance of this is still extremely small. Even if you are only 25 years
     old, the chance is marginal at best.
2.   In order to continue to live, each of us needs a "time machine" to
     transport him or her, at least mentally intact, into the future. At
     present there is no method with the proven ability to do this. Even the
     best current methods of chemical or cryogenic preservation result in
     massive damage to the body and brain from which any future recovery is
     at best very uncertain.
3.   Furthermore, it has not been proven, and may not even be true that the
     brain structures which determine our memories, our personality and all
     of our other precious individual mental attributes are being well
     preserved through current agonal and cryopreservation processes.
4.   The idea of cryonics has been around for 30 years now and the number of
     people actually signed up has only grown to between 600 and 700.
5.   Because of the length of time that it has been around, the publicity
     which such a radical idea has received, and the plot/entertainment value
     of such a sensational theme, the cryonics idea is now very widely known.
6.   Yet cryonics as currently practiced, remains small and possibly unstable
     over the long term. Therefore, even if our mental attributes are being
     preserved through the current agonal and cryopreservation processes, and
     *can* be fully restored, most people have little confidence that anyone
     cryopreserved today will reach, still preserved, that possibly far
     future time when advanced technology *will* be able to effect the
     necessary restoration.
7.   In spite of the multitude of traditional beliefs about death in our
     society (I'll have had enough; over-crowding of the planet; make a place
     for the young ones; I'll live on in my children; necessary to insure
     creativity; it's natural; want to be reincarnated; want to go to heaven;
     etc. etc. etc.), there are still 100's of thousands if not 10's of
     millions of people in North America who truly love life and would very
     much like to have a lot more of it, so long as they could remain
     mentally and physically healthy.
8.   The vast majority of even those who do not accept any of these beliefs
     about death will never sign-up for, nor support cryonics while they
     remain relatively healthy, because, being small and unproven it has so
     little chance of saving them. Instead, they prefer to put any "extra"
     money into anti-aging methods and research aimed at extending their
     first "life cycle", giving little thought to the possibility of a
     *second* "life cycle".

The Solution:

1.   There does exist a method which has been shown to allow the preservation
     of a complex organ with no freezing injury at all. With this method
     viable rabbit kidneys have been recovered from temperatures as low as
     -40xC, with recovery from much colder temperatures expected soon. This
     method is called vitrification. It involves turning the organ to be
     preserved into a glassy substance, cooling it to cryogenic temperatures,
     and keeping it stored at those temperatures until such time as we wish
     to recover it for use. Just as glass is fluid at high temperatures and
     becomes solid as it is cooled to lower temperatures without any
     crystallization occurring, so too biological tissue, by having its
     internal water largely replaced with a special solution, can be made to
     behave like glass and incur no disruptive crystalline formation when it
     is cooled, even to the temperature of -140xC. (This temperature will be
     used because it is almost universally agreed by the cryobiological
     science community that it is sufficiently low to allow storage for
     several hundred years if necessary with negligible deterioration.) The
     trick is, however, to use a solution and a method of water removal which
     does not in itself irreversibly damage the biological tissue.

2.   Because this vitrification protocol is organ specific, the exact
     protocol for kidneys will not work for many other organs. Therefore, if
     we are ever to achieve suspended animation of the whole human body, we
     must proceed to make it work for other organs. The most important human
     organ, and the logical starting point for this purpose is the brain.

3.   The scientist who has developed this method of preservation for rabbit
     kidneys has stated that he does not see any technical reason why this
     method, with suitable modifications should not be applicable to any
     mammalian organ including the brain. Furthermore, he has estimated that
     for any particular organ, the necessary modifications should be able to
     be discovered and perfected within a time-span of under 10 years and
     with a project budget of under a million dollars per year.

4.   Neuroscience developments and techniques for assessing brain function
     directly should allow us to convincingly demonstrate the mental
     attributes of an isolated mammalian brain. It is also believed that it
     should be possible to do in-situ cryopreservation of a mammalian brain
     and cooling, perhaps to -70xC, with full recovery of the intact animal.

5.   If we can produce a method by which first a mammalian, next a primate,
     and finally a human brain can be placed in long-term biological stasis
     and recovered with its functionality including all mental attributes
     unquestionably alive and complete, we will have the proof that death can
     be defeated - that in principal, a life can be extended indefinitely.
     Once convincingly demonstrable, fully reversible, long-term preservation
     of the brain has been achieved, the mainstream medical and scientific
     community will accept the scientific validity of the cryonics idea.
     Major public and private money will be spent to develop methods of
     providing a body for a restored brain, and to perfect whole-body long-
     term suspended animation, if possible. The practice of preserving the
     brain, and later the whole-body, if possible, will become an optional
     standard medical procedure for the terminally ill and the laws will be
     changed to accommodate this new paradigm.


The Logic of The Prometheus Project Funding Method

1.   Those persons who have a great desire for vastly extended life *will*
     sincerely pledge major amounts of money to a convincingly demonstrable
     fully reversible brain cryopreservation project if they are convinced
     that it is necessary in order to achieve such extended life, that it has
     sound planning which will enable it to succeed if it is funded, and if
     their pledges are not due until it *does* have sound planning and *is*
     fully funded.

2.   Most of those with incomes over $50K per year (and certainly all of
     those with incomes over $100K per year) should be able to afford to
     forgo the present spending of $5-10K per year (at least if tax
     deductible) without degrading their life-style in any way detrimental to
     their health and longevity.

3.   Within the cryonics and life-extension community, there are well over
     200 people who fit this category. Hence, there are a more than
     sufficient number of people to fund a project which will scientifically
     demonstrate that long-term reversible brain preservation will work, and
     therefore, that will be virtually certain to enormously increase the
     chance of their lives having the potential of immortality.

4.   The Prometheus Project defined here is an attainable and fundable goal.
     The results obtained from the 22 cryonicists on CryoCare Forum (over
     $100K per year was pledged) strongly suggest that it is realistic to
     expect to obtain between 100 and 200 pledges of amounts between $5,000
     per year and $10,000 per year each for 10 years.


Organization of the Collection of the Pledges

     As founder of the Prometheus Project, Paul Wakfer, one of the $10,000
per year pledgers, will be the person who accepts the pledges and will be the
founder and the interim president of the corporation which is formed once the
necessary total of $1M per year for 10 years is reached until the Prometheus
Project officially begins.

     If the Prometheus Project pledge campaign succeeds in reaching its
target of over $1M per year pledged for 10 years, the pledgers will be able
to purchase shares in a for-profit corporation which will be formed to
conduct the scientific research of the project. These shares will be
purchased over a 10 year period at a fixed price of $100.00 per share with
the requirement that an equal amount must be purchased for each of the 10
years. Pledges will not be due and no money will be collected until pledgers
who approve the scientific and business plans have signed legally binding
share purchase agreements totaling over $1M per year. Any pledger who does
not approve of these plans may withdraw his pledge before the Prometheus
Project begins. The signing of legally binding share purchase agreements is
necessary to insure that the required funding will be forthcoming each year
after the project begins.

     Pledgers who wish to have a tax deduction for the amount of their
contribution are encouraged to make arrangements with one of the cryonics
organizations or life extension societies which have the ability to issue tax
deductible receipts for charitable donations. After the Prometheus Project
has begun, those organizations will then use the donated moneys to purchase
shares under the same terms as other individual or corporate purchasers.
Cryonics organizations which have this capability (or will soon) are:

                    Alcor Life Extension Foundation
                    American Cryonics Society
                    CryoCare Foundation
                    The Immortalist Society

All cryonics organizations have been contacted and have been asked for their
help in promoting the Prometheus Project through mailings to their membership
and advertisements in their periodicals. They have also been asked to accept
donation pledges, to turn these into share purchases if the pledge campaign
is successful, and, furthermore, to proxy the shareholder voting power of the
shares which a donor's money has purchased to that same donor. By this
method, individual contributing cryonicists and life extensionists will
control the Project instead of the competitive and sometimes antagonistic
cryonics organizations. It should be very clear that the success of the
Prometheus Project will be extremely beneficial for the cryonics
organizations, their members and their patients. In addition, the Life
Extension Foundation has agreed to accept donation pledges, and later to
accept donations, to issue tax deductible receipts, and to make share
purchases under the contractual terms necessary for funding the Prometheus
Project.

     The Prometheus Project will be delighted to accept any pledge of $1000
or more per year, but for administrative and share purchase purposes requires
that all pledges be made in units of $100 per year. Again it should be noted
that all pledges must be for the same amount per year for all 10 years,
although up-front, lump-sum pledges with delivery of shares yearly are also
acceptable. A pledge for $8,000 as a lump-sum up-front payment is being
accepted as equivalent to a pledge of $1,000 per year for 10 years.

     Any individual or organization who pledges, and later purchases shares
will receive "technology credits" of a dollar value equal to twice that paid
for their shares. If the corporation should develop technology which it then
sells for the purpose of human cryopreservation, by returning shares to the
corporation, these technology credits may be used for purchasing this
technology. In this way, if the corporation should develop technology which
allows less damaging human cryopreservation, every purchaser of shares who is
also a cryonicist or cryonics organization is guaranteed to obtain a return
of at least double their investment. If the corporation succeeds in patenting
highly marketable discoveries, inventions and procedures, of course, the
return from the rise in share price may be far greater.

     While pledges are being received and are building to the total of $1M
per year required, the scientific plan of The Prometheus Project and the
business plan of the corporation which will conduct it, will be developed and
prepared. Any help that can be contributed to this part of the project (or
any other part) is very much welcomed. These plans will be published even in
unfinished form as they are developed and prepared. This project is very much
a "boot-strap" process. For many reasons, I believe that is the *best* way to
accomplish it. I look forward to your questions and suggestions and you can
be sure that if the ideas are worthy, they *will* be incorporated into the
developing project plans.

     At this time, the Prometheus Project is essentially a pledge campaign
asking a strictly hypothetical question:

1) *If* $1M/yr in pledges for 10 years is collected, and
2) *if* satisfactory scientific and business plans are developed, and
3) *if* the researchers and their projects are satisfactory to you, and
4) *if* a corporation is formed to employ these scientists to execute these
    projects which issues a prospectus and share offering for that purpose,
4) *then* how much would you be willing to contribute, beginning in 1998, to
    share purchases of equal amounts for up to 10 years, in that corporation.

No money is being requested and no investments are being solicited. If this
campaign is not successful no corporation to execute the project will ever be
formed.

     The reason why I believe that the Prometheus Project pledge campaign
will be successful is that you are *not* being asked, "how much are you
willing to invest in a high-risk, bio-tech R&D startup", even though any
corporation which executes the Prometheus Project plan will be all of that.
No, you are being asked, "how much of your present life are you willing to
commit towards a very good chance at an enormously lengthened future life",
and *that* is a significantly different question.

      Before ending, I wish to leave you with some thoughts.

     For several weeks now, I have been putting a lot of thought toward what
I am now calling the "Prometheus Project" and I very strongly believe that
each of us who really wants to live should begin pushing this project
constantly and continuously with all the time, money and life-force which he
or she can afford without degrading his or her current life below a certain
minimum acceptable quality. I have become convinced that if any of us are to
survive long-term, one way or the other, this project *must* be accomplished.
I believe that the Prometheus Project should be nonpartisan and strongly
supported by all organizations because it is much too big for any one
cryonics organization. We need all the ideas and help we can get from any
source whatever and *I* pledge to promote it and discuss it with absolutely
no negativity, innuendo or bias with regard to any particular organization or
individual. I expect each organization and each cryonicist to understand why
it will be beneficial for them to strongly support the project. We must speak
about this project in all our communications and continue to speak of it non-
stop, and relentlessly until we have achieved the funding goal. I ask every
one of you to include it with every thing you write, hammering away at the
idea incessantly, never letting up for a moment until we have done it.

     The Prometheus Project is not a *charity* for which I am begging you to
give up part of your life for some purpose exterior to you which *I* happen
to think is important. No! What I am asking is that you honor *yourself*,
that exquisite individual consciousness which is yours alone.

>Is there a web-based archive for the compleat former extropy list?

I'm pretty sure none will be publicly available.  The former list was
private, and you always needed to get permission from the person who
posted to forward their post to someone else.  Putting up a public web
site with the archive, if the archive exists, would involve either
getting permission from a ton of people or getting blame from a ton of
people because you didn't get permission.  Neither is attractive.  As
a consequence, anything of value that happened on that list is
essentially lost.

I once asked why this was done, and at least one person who knew
refused to tell me.  I am aware of two advantages of the old scheme:

1. It allowed people to speak their views with some confidence that
they wouldn't get back to their employer.  This is still possible with
the present scheme; all you have to do is set up an anonymous remailer
account and subscribe it to the list.  Doing it with the anonymous
remailer is more secure than trusting that all the subscribers will
respect the privacy of the list.

2. In some people's minds it allowed sending copyrighted material to
the list.  Since the list was "private", this was not "publishing".
This seemed dubious to me.

I do not think either of these advantages was the cause of the
decision.  The brief refusal to explain the history of the decision
mentioned AMIX (AMerican Information eXchange, now defunct), which
leads me to guess that there was an earlier time when the list was not
"private" and that someone tried to sell the archives of the list on
AMIX at that time.

History tends to repeat itself with more vigor when it is kept secret.
If my guess is right, then the current way of running the list is such
a repetition.  Is anyone who knows the history willing to speak up
now?

>Is there at least one for the current one? Where can I find it?

The advanced technology I had in mind wasn't weapons; I agree that you
can hire out self-defense.  The technology I had in mind was various
ways to enhance productivity of a given set of natural resources.  As
you state above, making copies is one example.  Changing how
motivation works is another example that might defeat the pleasure
seeker more directly by making the pleasure seeker seek something
else.

If your personal productivity lags far enough behind the productivity
of the intruders, then the costs of self-defense might go up faster
than you can afford.  Of course, the technology for self-defense would
be advancing too, which might push it down.  I do not know the
ultimate outcome.  

It is said that life expands to fill the available niches.  If the
pleasure seeker is far enough behind, then in comparison with the
competition he will start to look like a niche rather than like life.
Technology might indefinitely forestall the natural outcome, or it
might exacerbate it.  I do not know.

Discredited??? Not by a LONG shot! Darwin published his wonderful book in 
1859 and I know of no theory in the Sciences, physical or biological, that has  
held up from that day to this better than Darwin's Theory of Evolution. It's 
true that there has been some sniping between Richard Dawkins, a hard line  
Darwin supporter, and Steven Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge, but even if their 
"Punctuated Evolution" turns out to be true they have admitted it would just 
be a minor alteration to Darwin's magnificent edifice. Gould has also stated 
that in his opinion Darwin was the greatest scientist who ever lived, and 
although not strictly relevant, a remarkably likable fellow as well. 
Personally I would rank Darwin a close second behind Newton, but Newton  
although a great genius, was also a very unpleasant man.

Ordinary roads, ports, and train tracks can be destroyed as well, but
they nevertheless did speed communication and so contribute to
monoculture pressures.

I was sitting in traffic the other day, my mind wandering because my body 
couldn't, when an image popped into my head which I thought I'd share:

Picture a t-shirt.  On the front is a picture of Max More (which was 
tough to imagine, since I have never met him and have only seen the 
picture on his Web site...).  Beneath the picture are the words "I have a 
meme..."  On the back of the shirt is the Extropian symbol with 8 arrows 
and the acronym BEST DO IT SO.

I suppose that the picture need not be of Max, and that the symbol need 
not be an Extropian one, but I think that we could get some mileage and 
inspire some questions from curious bystanders with the slogan.

Enjoy.

If you've saved enough, and are rich enough, then your personal
productivity is irrelevant.  If you are frugal, your wealth will grow
with the total wealth of the economy, which should be more than enough
to keep up with defense costs.

(This time I'll just pick up where the last post left off.  I apologize for
the use of bandwidth.)

...technology is neither placed on a pedestal nor staked through the heart .
. . .

[I take it that the reviewer means to say that Dery treats technology
even-handedly -- not that those wacky Extropians do.  To wit:]

He saves his strongest language for the "techno-transcendentalists"--those
whose "visions of a cyber-rapture are a fatal seduction, distracting us from
the devastation of nature, the unraveling of the social fabric, and the
widening chasm between the technocratic elite and the minimum-wage masses."

[I guess we've never discussed those topics in our various fora, eh?]

    Belief in the cyber-Rapture constitutes, for Dery, evangelism of "a
theology of the ejector seat."  For the believers in the techno-millennium,
technological acceleration has proceeded to such a point that humanity is
about to be launched into a great unknown. 

* * *

    Poppycock.  Or as Dery more eloquently puts it: "The misguided hope that
we will be born again as bionic angels,' to quote Mondo 2000, is a deadly
misreading of the myth of learus.  It pins our future to wings of wax and
feathers."

* * *

Dery reserves special scorn for the true believers in cyber-salvation: "Thus,
we are drawn to the inescapable conclusion that much of what passes for
post-humanism is in fact egoism leavened with a dash of technocratic elitism,
whether it is Mondo 2000's dictatorship of the neurotariat--the shrapies,
mutants and superbrights in whom we must place our 'faith' and 'power' or the
Extropian triumph of the overman."

    Nicely said, but Dery is perhaps too kind to the Mondoids and Extropians.
 Are they worth the attention?  As with malfunctioning computer programs, one
wonders if they even merit debugging.

[Such vitriol!  The reviewer certainly does not address the substance of
Extropianism's arguments.  Does Dery?]

* * *

The posthumanists are a weak straw person to counterpoint Dery's frequent
allusions to the greater societal problems being submerged by the digital
deluge.  Dery would have done better to load more fully into his sights the
real target--Wired-style techno-positivity.  It isn't as sexy, and it long
ago lost its subcultural cachet, but as far as social reality is concerned,
Wired's aestheticizing of techno-politics is the real "Mechagodzilla."

[I jibe,  "A spectre is haunting this book reviewer:  The spectre of dynamic
optimism."  Seriously, though, if you find this hack's review dismaying you
should keep in mind that the market place for ideas can work slowly.
 Consider that the Communist Manifesto originally issued in 1848 -- long,
long before its tenets had real impact.]

I'm quoting this exactly as written; it appears that Mr. Nicholas hasn't 
heard about putting periods at the end of sentences.  It also appears that 
we have been invaded by creationists.  

Nick, in a scientific/philosopical forum such as this one, it is customary 
to give reasons for one's assertions.  So  if you have something to say, 
say it.  Otherwise go back to Sunday School where you belong.  (The 
etiquette of the list prevents me, for the moment at least, from using the 
more colorful language that first came to mind when I read this nonsense.)

The issue here is not evolution, which is, like anything else, debatable.  
Darwin certainly didn't say the last word on the subject, and neither did 
Dawkins.  Stuart Kauffman has introduced a whole new way of looking 
at evolution.  But any statement of the form 

> X has been discredited, do your reading 

is bullshit.  It would still be bullshit if someone said

About the book ESCAPE VELOCITY

I am quite familiar with it, as I just taught a course at Rutgers
University for which it was one of the "textbooks."  The course
was called FURUT  oops,  FUTURE COMPUTING TECHNOLOGY, and along
with EV we used a book called Frontiers of Complixity, which 
covers Alife, AIU ... oops, AUI oops, AI (must get a new editor
) and so forth.

Esc. Vel. is a very well thought out and well researched book,
and the writing is good.  THere is a big focus on artsy stuff --
survival research labs, techno & industrial music, Stelarc &
other postmodern techno-savvy artists.  but there is a lot of
intelligent discussion of the role of the body in futuristic
technology ... "downloading" ... the way that the same pel
peo0ple promoting this technology are "nerds" who maybe 
uncomfortable with their own bodies, etc.

Generally, Dery (the author) is skeptical of the "antisocial"
aspects of transhumanism, and he mentions Extropians in this
light.  His attitude is much like mine, though he is less
enthused about such things as downloading the mind than I am
.  He interviews Moravec, and asks him what downloading of the
mind m eans for the downtrodden billions who don't even have
computers.  Moravec says, basically, "tough luck for them;
humans are becoming obsolete, so a few billion more or less
doesn't make much difference."  Dery finds this unconsciounable.

I think Dery finds Extropianism somewhat scary in its alignment
of future tech with libertarian, hyper-individualist politics.
He would like to see future tech with a social conscience.

This book was, incidentally, where I heard about Extropians,

 This is so clever, SOMEBODY PLEASE FOLLOW UP!  I WILL buy a bumper sticker
(and I have *never* had a bumper sticker on my car) and a t-shirt.

(BTW, I think the bumper sticker should have the "I have a meme ..." slogan
in large letters and then just the word "Extropy" below it in smaller type.)

IAN: Yes, but only if we conclude that anti-govt types are guilty. Then,
not only will the media broad brush us, but powerful new laws will make 
any anti-govt group suspect to FBI surveillance and wire tapping and
more without court oversight. Are "anti-govt" types guilty ?

Consider the testimony of former Grand Juror Hoppy Heidelberg, in charge 
of evidence in the Oklahoma City bombing case, who told the press that, 
"No one who saw McVeigh with other suspects, [ such as John Doe #2 ] 
was ever allowed to testify before the Federal Grand Jury."

Mr. Heildelburg was eventually thrown off the jury after he refused 
to stop asking questions about John Doe #2. His review of the best 
available evidence lead him to conclude: 

        "I think they [ the govt ] know who John Doe #2 is, 
        and they are protecting him. This is because John 
        Doe #2 is either a government agent or informant 
        and they can't afford for that to get out."

The best article on the Oklahoma Bombing was published in the 
Haight Ashbury Free Press, and can be found at:

        http://www.webcom.com/haight/Oklahoma/Okc.1.html


Also the report by Brigadier General Benton K. Partin (USAF, Air Force 
Armament Technology Laboratory. Ret.), presents overwhelming physical 
evidence that the Ryder truck bomb in the front could not have done 
the damage the Murrah building sustained. 

Ammonium nitrate exerts its strongest explosive force along a vertical, 
not a horizontal, axis. An ammonium nitrate / fuel bomb of the size used, 
or even much larger, could not exert enough pounds of pressure per square 
inch (from blast's epicenter to building) to cut the heavy steel re-bar 
reinforced columns, even deep inside the building, as was seen. 

        " Blast through air is a terribly inefficient coupling 
        mechanism against heavy reinforced concrete beams and 
        columns; blast impulse and its potential for damage - 
        drops dramatically when traveling through air, initially 
        falling off more rapidly than an inverse function of the 
        distance cubed. Even though the Oklahoma City truck bomb 
        made an enormous impulse wave, it is wrong, Partin says, 
        to be overly impressed and to attribute a force to that 
        explosion which it clearly did not have. " (*)

The Gen. Partin concludes, based on overwhelming evidence, that supplemental 
demolition charges, or 'cutter charges,' were placed directly on columns. 
Remember that they found 4 unexploded bombs * inside * the building on 
the day of the blast, then this fact is forgotten. These may have

It is possible that terrorist events could be used as modern day Reichstag

A generalization of the idea of a mantra 

A mantra is a sound that is repeated over and over, until it changes 
one's consciousness.  When I was a little boy, I discovered that if I said 
a word, any word, over and over, it would lose its meaning.  Try saying 
the word "tomorrow," for example.  After awhile it will become a 
resonant sound in your mind, and it will no longer be a just a token for 
the day after today.  Then when tomorrow comes, and you stop and 
remember this moment, and connect with it -- the result is not quite the 
same as deja vu, but similar.  (This was one of the first ways I found to 
get "stoned.")   

Yogis have been experimenting with Sanskrit mantras for many 
centuries.   

In the West, we have traditionally changed our consciousness with more 
complex patterns of thought.  In the renaissance, for example, there was 
an elaborate art of memory, in which the student would imagine a 
cathedral in great detail, and associate an idea with each point of the 
space in the cathedral.  He would imagine starting at a certain point, and 
going from there to the next point, and so on through an elaborate train 
of thought.  This is where the expression "in the first place" comes 
from.  When explaining something, a professor would start at the first 
place, then go on to the second place -- almost literally.  The students 
were expected to "follow," in the same almost-literal sense, as the 
professor led them from point to point in the cathedral.  

Today, we have lost the rich metaphor of the building.  But we still try 
to guide ourselves though a train of thought -- that's what a university 
curriculum is for.  To get a degree in medicine, you go to a series of 
lectures and lab meetings where your attention is directed toward 
certain topics in a certain order, and you emerge with a mind that thinks 
like a doctor's mind.  Each profession has its own vocabulary and its 
own habits of thought, and each professional person goes through a 
long training program to learn those habits of thought.  

Everybody, professional or not, learns certain habitual thought patterns. 
The idea of a mantra can be generalized to include all habits of thought 
that are repeated for a long time and result in a certain form of 
consciousness.  

Some people don't just do this in their professional training.  They try 
to guide themselves through a train of thought designed to change their 
consciousness, not just when performing practical tasks, but also when 
contemplating the universe.  When thinking about physics, for example, 
such a person -- who, we are assuming, is not a professional physicist -- 
would study the argument in a certain chapter of a certain book, and go 
over it in his mind, over and over, connecting words to images, putting 
the images together into a whole, until he "saw" the principle of 
relativity, i.e. he saw, as an immediate gestalt, how the constancy of the 
speed of light is the central axiom which makes the rest of 
electromagnetism coherent.  He would see this vision as clearly as the 
renaissance student saw his cathedral.  

This results in a change of consciousness every bit as intense as LSD, 
and much more productive.  

The same phenomenon occurs in other areas besides science.  Jimmie 
Connors repeated the tennis mantra with such force that he could see, as 
the ball left his opponent's racquet, which way it was spinning.  To him, 
when he was at his peak of concentration, a tennis ball looked as big as 
a basketball, and seemed to be moving in slow motion.  

Video games can also be effective mantras, especially the ones which 
take you through a series of screens, each one similar to the earlier ones, 
but faster and more difficult.  If you play one of these games hundreds 
of times, until you can routinely reach the 15th screen, you find yourself 
in a new state of consciousness, in which a lot of things seem to move 
in slow motion.  

Most people don't make this effort.  They let their environment guide 
their thoughts.  Most people go through a daily mantra of muzak and tv, 
created for them by the entertainment industry, which is more than 
happy to perform this service.  

So, there are conscious mantras, patterns of thought chosen by us, 
and default mantras, given to us -- sometimes forced on us, to some 
extent -- by society.  We always have a choice, either to create 
a mantra for ourselves, or to drift along on one of the many mantras  
that are provided for us.  

Now, suppose someone decides to take control of his own mind, and 
choose his own mantra, day by day.  He is going to let his thoughts be 
guided, not by his environment, but by his quest to see the origins of 
things.  Suppose he studies causality in many contexts:  he reads 
Cairns-Smith and Kauffman on the origin of life, Rene Thom on 
embryology and morphogenetic forms, Ophiel on creative visualization, 
Aristotle on the four kinds of causality, Leibniz and Heidegger on the 
Principle of Sufficient Reason, and so forth.  Suppose he forms the 
habit of seeing things not as they present themselves, but as part of a 
causal chain.  For example, a towel came from a store, before that from 
a factory, before that from a cotton mill, before that from a farm;  and 
meanwhile, on another causal track, it began as an idea in somebody's 
mind.  The student who follows this mantra for years, until it becomes 
part of the fabric of his thoughts, will, at unpredictable times, fall into a 
state of reverie, perhaps artificially induced, perhaps not, in which the 
vision I mentioned earlier will appear.

Ian's post about terrorism prompted some random thoughts:

First, as a matter of my own personal practice, I find it is usually not
fruitful to comment on the weight of evidence in any particular pending case
that has interest to the general public (look at the billions of wasted words
in connection with the OJ Simpson case ...).  This is because both sides in
the actual case have a strong interest in *advocacy* rather than
truth-seeking (that's how the system is supposed to work, after all) and
unless you're involved in the case personally as party, judge, advocate or
juror, you're unlikely to see anything like a balanced presentation of
evidence.  While a "fair" legal journalist may attempt to present a balanced
subset of the evidence and arguments, taking that journalist's presentation
as a basis of opinion is just accepting her work as a substitute for the
gestalt of a trial.  As we say down here in Tejas, no matter how thin you
pour the pancakes, they always have two sides.  That's why we have trials.

An aside: For what its worth, Ian, one of McVeigh's lead lawyers, Michael
Tigar, is known to me to be a tough, bright, creative and highly capable
lawyer.  Tigar will see to it that McVeigh gets the fairest possible trial,
leaving no stone unturned and exploiting every weakness and error in the
state's case.  I don't know anyone on the prosecution side of the case, but
chances are Tigar's twice the lawyer any one of them could ever hope to be.

That said, however, Ian has referred to something that has troubled me.  I've
noted a disturbing phenomenon when discussing extropianism and transhumanism
with folks who are either aware of the ideas themselves or not: Through some
memetic mapping process, people seem to somehow link these movements with the
violent fringe crazies of the "militia movement".  Unfortunately, it seems
that the wild-eyed "militiamen" have become icons in the public consciousness
that stand far too close to the concept of liberty.

I can't claim to have made anything like an in-depth study of the so-called
militia movement.  But what I have read and seen doesn't impress me.  I can
say their "legal" writings I've seen on the Net don't cut the mustard for me:
By and large they seem to be a mish-mash of half-baked caricatures of the
traditional common law and ideology from the time of the US Revolution,
pasted together crudely to reach the results they want without any real
analysis of the ideas they borrow and steal.  The so-called "common law
courts" they have put together seem more like kangaroo courts thrown up as
rationalization machines to publicize their ideas, rather than tribunals for
resolving disputes, the only legitimate purpose of a court.  In this they
serve exactly the same purpose as Stalin's show trials: Ideological theater.
 Nothing is more threatening to the ideal of law.

Beyond this, the "militia movement" seems far too broad to generate much, if
any good.  Most of its adherents seem to accept unquestioningly that a
powerful state should exist; they just don't like the one they happen to live
in and claim the right to violently oppose its policies.  That's bad medicine
in my book.  Furthermore, there are undeniable racist and fundamentalist
religious currents in the militia culture, absolute anathema to extropians.

I don't doubt for a minute that this is true.

I, too, cringe at the infringements of personal liberty that both mainstream
political parties are falling over each other to implement in the name of
"anti-terrorism."  But there doesn't need to be a "statist conspiracy" for
this to have happened.  In fact, this is probably just the natural result of
the market for votes operating unconsciously on the sellers of "political
goods" (can you tell I just finished "The Machinery of Freedom"???).  

I've constructed a little alarm in my mind that goes off whenever the "Hitler
meme" is invoked.  The rhetorical power of images of Nazis is so great that
I'm suspicious of their use.  Those images should be used *very* carefully so
as no to debase the currency of historical analogy.  If you call Bob Dole a
"fascist", you don't have anything left to distinguish Herman Goering.

Finally, of course we should "examine the gov't/media story".  That is why we
have public trials.  But let's recall that the trial *will* be public and the
public will be treated to a view of Michael Tigar's talents in defense of Mr.
McVeigh.  Contrary to the rhetoric of the militiamen, this isn't Berlin or
Moscow in 1936.

The idea does have a catchy ring to it.  First need the consent of John to
actually implement the idea, then find a pic of Max _or_ a facsimile
thereof.  Next, negotiate terms with John - is this a freebe or what
percentage does he want to sales.  Will need up front money for production.
What about design and layout?  Black? White?  Color? Does John have any
suggestions?

There is no archive for the first five years of the list. Individual posters
might want to add their most significant past posts to the archive (if they
only quote other posts for which they have consent), although this may be
too much hassle for most people.

Yes, there is a current archive, started just a couple of weeks ago.  You

In view of what happened with the Grand Jury, will Michael Tigar be 
allowed to explore all the issues?  Or is it understood that some questions 
must not be asked?

This was indeed one consideration. I agree with your comments. That's one

Maybe that was a consideration for some people, but I don't think it a
reason for our old policy. Certainly *I* didnt' think of that as a reason
for it, and I don't recall anyone else in on the decision thinking that
either. Umm, Your description does sound like Perry Metzger's line of
thinking, and he originally started this list, though very soon turned it over.

I don't recall anything like this. I don't think there was ever a time when
the list was not considered private. Perhaps there were individuals who
hoped to sell their restricted writings on AMIX, but that wasn't a policy of
the List.

I'm lost here. A repetition of what? The list has always been private, but
now it's not. This is a change, not a repetition. Nothing about the history
of the list or the reasons for it's policy is a secret.

I encourage others involved in creating the old List policies to add their
versions of what they remember.

I don't know.  As things get closer to trial I'll probably spend a few hours
looking into the two sides' plans of attack and defense, mainly as amatter of
academic interest.  If I come across anything interesting, Lyle and Ian, I'll
let you know off-list.

This should be stated explicitly in the Extropian Principles.  
It would clarify who is and who is not extropian.

Ammonium nitrate and fuel oil is a disordered substance, thus having no 
preferred direction in its detonation. Unless the geometry of the bomb is 
such that it channels the blast wave, wouldn't the applied force be pretty 
much isotropic?

The analysis is correct for free standing columns, since the only bending 
moments are due to the difference in applied pressure along the beam. 
However in a building, the connection to the floors provides bending fulcrums 
which allow part of the concrete to be put in tension, causing the concrete to 
break since it has little tensile strength. The connections to outside concrete
walls provide broad surfaces for the blast pressure to act over that couple 
fairly well to the columns. The reinforcing iron is started bending as well, 
and having lost the compression bearing structure of the concrete, then 
buckles under the weight of the upper floors. The explosive doesn't have to 
have the impulse to sever the beams, it undermines them and the weight of the 
upper floors does the rest. During the falling of a building, some of the 
re-bars will be placed under tremendous tension, and sheared along their width. 
That damage looks superficially similiar to the tearing produced by a nearby 
charge of high explosive along one side of the beam.

I can't rule out what Partin is saying, but I'm offering a known
damage mechanism that could reasonably produce a similiar effect
without needing to invoke conspiracies.

I think the extropian meme has succeeded in establishing itself as a 
commonly known term for a certain social type, like "biker" or "wigger" 
or "yuppie."  Or "Satanist."  Apparently the public has a rather sinister 
perception of extropians, taking Moravec as the prototype of the 
overman who wants to become a cyborg and destroy the world.  

How wrong is this perception?  Is there anyone here who is not 
fascinated by such thoughts?   I was thinking along those lines in 1965, 
when I read "Profiles of the Future" by Arthur C. Clarke.  

If Moravec is *not* a prototypical extropian, then the meme has a serious 
public relations problem.  Dery's book was a public relations disaster.  
But then, memes are as selfish as genes, and will find their own way to 
survive.  Memes decide which other memes to mate with, and their 
parents can't always control their choices.  

Beyond PR, there is the question of what to do about Moravec, and 
others who entertain fantasies -- not necessarily idle fantasies - about 
setting forces in motion that would kill billions of obsolete people.  
The question is not what to say, but what, if anything, to do.  If you 
knew that someone intended to kill almost everybody on the planet, 
except for a remnant who would be protected -- what would you do?  
Join him?  Assasinate him?  or do nothing?

I don't think "the public" has a perception of extropians. A small
percentage of the population has varying perceptions of us. Those who read
the Wired article (or many others) probably have far more positive
perceptions than some of those who read Dery's book. I received over 400
e-mail messages as a result of the Wired article. The tone, almost without
exception, ranged from curious to wildly enthusiastic. Many readers of
Dery's book will see through his interpretation. This has happened before.
I've seen it happen numerous times with cryonics -- a negative story
generates inquiries from people who want to check things out for themselves.

Dery's book is merely one source. Mentions of Extropians, including
interviews with them, appear all over, giving an entirely different=
 impression.

Very wrong I would say. Is there anyone here *except* Lyle who serious
entertains fantasies of destroying the world? Doesn't sound like many
extropians I know. (Okay, I can think of one or two who might feel that
way!) Generally extropians I'm acquainted with care about their personal
transcendence and that of anyone who seeks it too. Some of them seem to be
concerned to encourage "the masses" to come along too -- sometimes for the
pragmatic reason that the more extropians there are, the faster progress
will be (and the more interesting people there will be to communicate and
trade with). Being transhuman is a positive-sum game, not a negative one.

Look, let's keep things in perspective. Hans is *not* planning on killing
billions of people. He is intent on creating mind children far superior
intellectually and physically to today's humans. He sees many humans
enjoying (at least for a time) leisure thanks to machines. Those humans who
choose it can join the posthumans. Those who don't, in Moravec's scenario,
*may* eventually be consumed, but then again they may not be as the
posthumans and mind children leave for space. Whatever the particular
scenario, it's not as if Hans is plotting to personally destroy anyone. I
think he's saying eventually the choice will be to become posthuman or
*risk* dying out (which is any human's fate anyway in a few decades). This
isn't quite as monstrous as you make out.

But Moravec's scenario is not necessarily the way things will actually
happen. I thing he's quite wrong about what's likely. Like many extropians,
I'd like to encourage more humans to prepare, to continuously upgrade
themselves, so that the odds of the nasty possibilities are minimized.

Upward and Outward!

	In 1967, when I was a student at Bishop Dagwell Hall (now called
 Oregon Episcopal Schools), our science teacher, Mr. Morin, asked us to
 each write a ten page paper on anything we wanted to, as long as it
 involved science.

	This was shortly after Star Trek had debuted on television, and a
 central attraction was the teleporter (beam me up, Scotty), a
 concept I was already quite familiar with as an avid science fiction
 reader. So I decided, during that class hour, to examine ways in which
 a teleportation device might be constructed. Most of the content of
 the paper was outlined in that same hour.

	The main idea looked at was to 3D raster scan (like with
 television) an object while disassembling it into its atomic
 components, and create a data file of the structure on the fly. The
 atoms were then accelerated by a particle accelerator, while the data
 file was sent by radio.

 	At the receiving end, another particle accelerator running in
 reverse would decelerate the atoms. A radio receiver and computer took
 the incoming data file, and used it to reassemble the object,
 atom-by-atom.

	And so, the idea of assembling atoms by design hardly requires a 
Ph.D. to conceive. It is in fact something a twelve-year-old could come 
with.

	All libertarians, Extropians included, are being linked to the
militia movement and worse paramilitarists by the mass media via the
purposely chosen smear "word anti-government".

	Racist fanatics have always had a paramilitary bent.  The recent
militia movement which grew in response to increased gun control is not
essentially racist by any means though of course it would be impossible to
say there are no racists involved.

lets not forget the fact that the supposed prime suspect worked as a

his interest for working during the olympics. ( this was last year )

Ammonium nitrate sitting in a tub inside a truck could not be effectively
directed against the building.  Some experts have claimed the pattern of
damage on the Murrah building would not have been caused by a bomb that
dispersed its energy in all direction....the ground would make much of the
blast go upward.  The crater was very shallow as compared to the TNT Saudi
bomb which created a 5-6 foot crater, yet the damage penetrated far into
the Murrah building Ammonium nitrate w/fuel oil apparently does not ignite
as fast as TNT.  The bomb in Saudi Arabia tho much more potent only
ripped the facing off the building.  It did not penetrate much into the
building as did the OKC bomb.

The column damage was supposedly "powedering" as occurs when charges are
fastened directly to the column, not bending fractures.

I repeat this info without much back-up other than reading a lot of
articles suppossed experts questioning the Establishment line.

The building should not have been destroyed so fast!  Perhaps the most
suspicious aspect of the government investigation!

One of the things that sets my teeth on edge about "political correctness" is
the apparent requirement in that creed that just about any public statement
be full of race and gender "disclaimers".  Frankly, I enjoy lampooning such
nonsense.  I think the Extropian Principles so strongly imply a regime of
liberty, reciprocity and maximal peace that we shouldn't *have to* say
anything about race, gender and violence.  I might add the same about an
appropriate respect for the natural biological environemnt of the Earth,
another area where extropians are woefully misunderstood by some (a
well-known pet peeve of mine).

Nevertheless, Lyle may have a good point here.  Because our explicit
opponents and the superficial, simplistic press may well be inclined to tar
us with the same brush that portrays racism and the violence of the "militia
movement", some form of explicit statements regarding these matters may be in
order.

This and Max's response about Moravec are interesting.  I confess to not
having read Moravec's "Mind Children" -- I will, but feel I already had most
of the ideas folks have talked about as being in that book 25 years ago.
 (Also inspired by Clarke; although it was the chapter in "2001" entitled
"Experiment" for me.)

I've encountered a lot of thoughtless "fear and loathing" for concepts
fundamental to the extropian philosphy and agenda in otherwise fairly
intelligent and well-educated people -- both before and after I'd heard of
the word "extropian".  I recall a very bright woman accusing me of being a
"Nazi" because I advocated radical human genetic engineering and many who
have called me "cold" because I want to upload.  Ironically, the ex-husband
of the woman who called me a Nazi years later had some very unflattering
things to say about Moravec in an e-mail exchange with me.  That same fellow
characterizes extropians as "hyper-yuppies".  

So some see us "techno-bikers" and others as "hyper-yuppies".  As Anais Nin
said, "We don't see things as they are, we see things as we are."  (But an
aside: In my time, I've been both a "biker" and a "yuppie" ... hmmmm .... )

To a certain extent, the "problem" arises from a misunderstanding of the role
of compassion in the extropian world-view.  As I've written on the >H list,
there is *nothing* in the extropian philosophy that is inconsistent with
compassion.  My vision of my own self-transformation does not include
"leaving compassion behind" by any means; far from it.  I would hope my
capacity for pathos would be magnified along with every other capcity of the
mind.

The "inimical post-human superman" to which Lyle refers is a good moral
problem here.  It was, in fact, the subject (sort of) of an exchange I had
with Rich Artym on the >H list regarding his "Unlimited Individual Freedom"
(UIF) concept -- a set of ideas about which I have well-known reservations.
 But I offer for consideration that the problem is only one of degree, not
kind.  

The means exist today for a capable individual or small group of individuals
to destroy whole cities.  Moral monsters blow up airplanes full of innocent
people now.  As things are now, we entrust our safety with regard to these
things largely to the state.  In the stateless or "state-minimal" world to
which we look forward here, how will we react to such threats, magnified in
the quantity of the threat, but no less evil?

Answering that cacooning one's self in high-tech defenses or gettin' the hell
outta Dodge are fine for an individual, but take no account of compassion.  I
shall leave my own thoughts on tsolutions to this hard problem for another
day ...

IAN: And there is two sides of a trial, what the Judge allows to be included
and what the Judge does not allow. I think the jury is the true judge 
and should have unrestricted access to all information, anything less
is a sham.

In the Trade Center bombing, the tape recording of an FBI agent telling 
the terrorist mole to use real explosives was not allowed, because the 
plant, who was later convicted, did not have permission to record the 
govt agent. So the fact that the FBI was running the whole bombing 
operation is de facto erased.

In the Waco trial the vast majority of the Davidian's defense was barred. 
The prosecution went on and on for a month while the defenses case was 
paired down to one afternoon. While the jury still acquitted all the 
survivors of conspiracy to murder, the court / judge did all it 
could to prevent such an outcome.

In the Oklahoma case, as I mentioned, the Grand Juror in charge of
evidence said "No one who saw McVeigh with other suspects, [ such 
as John Doe #2 ] was ever allowed to testify before the Federal 
Grand Jury." That right there tells you that you can't count on 
the court for truth. Let's face it, the govt controls the court,
which is not to say justice is 100% impossible - yet.

And then the govt controls the evidence, and no surprise, they manipulate it.
Gary Spence (Randy Weaver's lawyer) said that in every case he has ever had
against the FBI, it was proven beyond doubt that the FBI had manipulated 
evidence. In the Waco case, the FBI "lost" the most important half of the 
two sided front door to the Davidian's home, the side which both lawyers 
Degaren and Zimmerman said (after seeing it on their visit during the 
siege) had only bullet holes going from out to in.

Former Attorney General Ramsy Clark, who will represent Davidians in a 
case for wrongful death, tried to stop the govt from taking away all 
the remains and the top few feet of soil at Mt. Carmel, after bodies 
were found to have very high levels of cyanide. CS gas converts to 
several elements upon heating one of which is cyanide. To no avail, 
the govt dug up everything and buried it. Amazing.

Same story in the Oklahoma case. General Partin pleaded with the govt 
not to destroy the evidence by leveling the Murrah building. Determined 
to see it first hand, not just detailed photographs, he prepared to go 
to the Building, but they quickly leveled it and literally transported 
every piece of the remains to a large dump and buried it under 15 ft 
of soil, all this before Gen. Partin could even get there. Amazing speed.
The dump was surrounded with a high barbed-wire fence and armed guards. 
Gen. Partin was not allowed to set foot inside. The defense had equal 
failure in stopping the wholesale destruction of all physical evidence.

Also this is from the AP printed in The Washington Times (4/10/96):

        Prosecutors agreed to turn over letters from FBI 
        agent Frederic Whitehurts, who tested Mr. McVeigh's 
        cloths for traces of explosives. Mr. Whitehurst has 
        claimed that investigators faked evidence in the 
        bombing case.              ^^^^^

The evidence that exists, the FBI destroys, the evidence that does not
exist, the FBI creats. The facts dictate that the FBI is an enemy of 
truth and justice. How can anything the FBI ever says be believed? 

There's so much more, even in just these two cases. Indeed, books could 
be filled with reasons why we can't rely on the outcome of courts, and
thus, why independent investigation is necessary.

IAN: I predict that one day the Militias will be co-opted by the govt and 
the "Militia" will be the patrol that wakes-up communities for mandatory 
exercises and urine tests every morning. Lots of guys with lots of 
guns rarely turns into a good thing.

IAN: This is what one of McVeigh's lawyers said:

        " When you know everything I do - and you will - you 
        will never think of the American government in the 
        same way again."  -- Tim McVeigh's defense attorney, 
        Stephen Jones speaking at the Univ. of Oklahoma

This implies that the defense has and will use devastating evidence 
against the govt. So it sounds like their going to take it right 
to the govt. But we'll see. This could be a threat that is 
actually a pretext to deal making.

I agree with Greg that we shouldn't have to say these things. Racism should
be so obviously ludicrous to someone who wants individuals to control their
biology and transform themselves that it's not an issue.

However, should an anti-racism statement be added to the Principles? I doubt
it. The Principles provide a condensed statement of the things extropians
are *for*, not a long list of the things we are *against* or find silly.
I've tried to stick to this positive focus increasingly closely in
successive versions. The overdue version 3.0 will continue that tendency.

Although the Principles may not be the place for an anti-racism statement or
a statement eschewing violence, we can certainly say these things in
discussions and interviews, and I have done so.

Another reason I resist putting such statements in the Principles is that I
want to keep them concise. Making these statements *accurately* would
require qualifications and discussion. For example, one might dislike
certain *typical* (but not essential) characteristics of a culture, and it
*might* be that this culture is almost completely coterminus with a racial
group (identified by some physical features). A *defeasible* suspicion of
people of this culture/race based on these characteristics might sometimes
be reasonable. In the same way, a statement against political violence would
need subtle qualifications about self-defense, special conditions, etc.

	As was always at issue with the OJ case, the Judge can refuse to
allow all kinds of info into the trial pretty much based on his own
discretion!

	Federal Judges are FEDS!  Already the judge gagged McVeigh while
the FBI prattled on prejudicing potential juries.

	If the trial is going to be in the press, both sides should be
allowed to participate!

The role of compassion and benevolence deserves far more emphasis and
discussion. I recently read David Kelley's Unrugged Individualism: The
Selfish Basis of Benevolence". Kelley, of the Institute for Objectivist
Studies, is one of the more open Objectivists. I found this booklet to be
one of the most sensible, practical, and rational discussions of ethics I've
read. (And I've read a lot!)

This booklet will probably be reviewed for Extropy #18 (the one after the
issue currently in production). Kelley argues that benevolence should be
regarded as a major virtue, and shows the rationality (based on a
self-interested pursuit of life and flourishing) of civility, generosity,
and sensitivity.

Upward and Outward!

I'm already regretting having tossed in my two cents here, as I cannot afford
the time to form anything like a professional opinion about the McVeigh case.
 It will naturally be a matter of strong opinion and I respect that many here
will have done more research into the matter than I.  Accordingly, please
accept these closing comments from me *cum grano salis*.

Legal structures addressing the handling and presentation of evidence are
complex.  There's no way around this: Its a subject that *very* bright minds
devote whole careers to.  *As a lawyer* I cannot hope to express an informed
opinion about the evidence presented in a complex case in which I did not
participate without *significant* research and analysis.  Thus, I'll keep my
mouth shut.  Opinions from other perspectives certainly have value -- again,
that's why we have public trials.

But let me just offer one non-partisan "meta-value" that underlies much of
the law of evidence.  Time and judicial resources are limited and disputes
must be resolved within a *reasonable* amount of time.  Thus, there *have* to
be at least some limits on the evidence that can be presented at a trial.
 Believe me, if the parties to a case were allowed to say everything they
could think of in support of their positions, nothing would ever get
resolved.  Consider that "unrestricted access to all information" is
problematic in this important respect, if for no other.

Roger that, Max.  I agree that the principles themselves shouldn't get into
the negative implications of the positive principles too deeply or in too
much detail.  I was thinking more along the lines of looking for essays or
other material to be included in Extropy or at the new web site when it gets

Likewise, a good idea.  In particular, you and other "sound bite sources"
should bear in mind the memetic mapping we've been talking about and steer
discusssion away from any questioning that implies "Genetic engineering =

IAN: Yes, but James's reply speaks on how the isotrophy is broken. 

Yet even if there is a variation in the force of impulse from vertical
to horizontal, there should be symmetrical distribution of impulse force
that falls off in direct relation to distance from blast epicenter on a
horizontal plane. But the damage to the building is not only too deep 
but is also asymmetrical relative to the epicenter.

The best "one-bomb one-bomber one-helper" conspiracy theory I've heard 
is that the truck and its arrangement of bombs was designed such that 
many yet to explode barrel-bombs would shoot into the building and
then explode, causing maximum internal damage and possibly an 
symmetrical damage pattern. Apparently this was a technique McVeigh 
could have learned in his military training. I would like to hear 
Partin's reply to this case for the "magic bomb" conspiracy theory.

IAN: But this still requires that the blast exerts enough pressure to 
undermine. According to Partin the physics dictate that, from blast epicenter 
to column B3 ( the furthest in column taken out ), B3 should only experience 
about 25 pounds of pressure psi. The thin decorative veneer covering over 
columns B2 and B4 was not even blown off. I don't know, but Partin's 
analysis in total appears compelling, then consider so much else.

Also, as James pointed out, the bomb in Saudi Arabia was larger. In fact, 
the crater was 4X deeper and 3X wider than the OK bomb (a). The crater 
is also closer to the building. The military grade explosive ' hexolite '
was used (b), which packs a far greater force of impulse than Ammonium 
nitrate. Then witness that this much larger blast only takes the face 
off a smaller building with no reinforced, or even unrenforced, columns. 

The Saudi apartment building, not built to withstand a bomb, unlike the 
Murrah building, was a house of cards. Yet a blast 3X larger with much 
stronger impulse than the OK bomb does a fraction of the damage seen
in Oklahoma City. I don't know, but it seems curious.

IAN: I think we can agree that the facts could be interpritted 
to support these two conspiracy theories:

        (1) Only McVeigh and Nicholes dit it.
        (2) McVeigh, Nicholes and others did it.

Therefore we cannot prefer one over the other due to its not being 
a conspiracy theory, as both are. Every interpritation of fact will 
support a given conspiracy theory. I think to many facts conflict 
with conspiracy (1), and (2) looks far more consistent with fact. 
Who those others are, I don't know.

IAN: Good point, the defense could call in people to testify until the 
end of time and thus stop his client from going to the electric chair.

Of course, the meta issue regarding time is that a huge amount of court
time is devoted to the enforcement of unjust laws -- laws that prohibit
consensual activity -- at a great cost to society. If we had a libertarian
situation, 90% of current 'court time' would be freed up to cases involving
violence and property violations.

Not necessarily. NH_4NO_3 is a hygroscopic colourles crystalline powder. 
The additive is usually a few percent heavy oil (e.g. diesel/kerosene).
Homogenous mixing of large batches is nontrivial. Moreover, the dispersion 
separates automagically through gravitation (oil accumulating at the 
bottom of the charge). The shape of the charge is nonspherical. The 
position of the charge just a few m above ground can contribute to some 
focusing.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

The explosive used in 95% of all commercial blasting is ANFO, a mixture of 
94.5% fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) and 5.5% Diesel oil, 
if you want to make a lot you can make it in a cement mixer. When NH4NO3 
explodes it produces N2O and 2H2O, N2O (laughing gas) is a powerful oxidant, 
so when it combines with Diesel oil it considerably increases it's yield. 
ANFO is rather slow as explosives go and the pressure wave is only about 35% 
as high as Dynamite, but it does have three advantages, it's very stable, 
it's easy to make, and it's very cheap, about 9 cents a pound.

I don't think there is any doubt that ANFO can bring down a building if you 
have enough of it, even straight NH4NO3 can be  dangerous. In 1947 a ship in 
Texas City Texas was being loaded with paper pages filled with ammonium 
nitrate  fertilizer. Somehow a fire started in the hold of the ship, the crew 
then sealed the hold, apparently thinking that would smother the fire, 
instead it caused so much heat and pressure that the fertilizer exploded. 
People 10 miles away in Galveston were knocked to the ground, at least 600 
people died and many thousands were injured.

I wonder how soon small CCD cameras like the Connectix QuickCam )
(see http://www.connectix.com/connect/fishcam.html) will begin 
showing up sprinkled around cities for security, traffic monitoring, 
etc?  

For anyone out there that is interested in pursuing this sort of 
application as a business, Quadrant International has just released a 
board called VideoWave (see http://www.quadrant.com/news/news.html) 
which is a Wavelet-based S-Video capture/playback for under $500.

For those Extropians who are multimedia junkies, this is truly a 
quantum-leap in affordable HQ nonlinear video.

It would seem that the days of the time-lapse VCR in banks, 
department stores, Seven-11's and liquor stores are numbered, now, as 
 the pc-based solution is finally cheaper.

What I'd like to see is some sort of similarly integrated and 
mass-produced intelligent digital telemetry kit.  Sort of like a 
"generic" wireless data extension cord for the multimedia appliance.

For example, something that is directional, and source independent.  
Whatever digital source gets plugged-in to the transmitter, gets 
relayed and reproduced at the side of the receiver.

Does anybody know if such a general telemetry device exists, or has 
been proposed?

I'd say so.  Several people of my acquaintance seem bothered by the
neo-Nietzschean subtext in a lot of Extropian rhetoric, Mark Dery not the
least of which.

        Sam Gronning, a licensed, professional blaster in Casper, 
        Wyoming with 30 years experience in explosives, told us 
        the Partin letter "states in very precise technical terms 
        what everyone in this business knows: No truck bomb of ANFO
        [ammonium nitrate fuel oil] out in the open is going to cause 
        the kind of damage we had there" in Oklahoma City. "In 30 years 
        of blasting, using everything from 100 percent nitrogel to ANFO, 
        I've not seen anything to support that story."

        Gronning notes that he recently detonated an ANFO charge more 
        than three times the size of the one reportedly responsible 
        for the Oklahoma destruction. "I set off 16,000 pounds of 
        ANFO and was standing upright just 1,000 feet away from 
        the blast," and even a bomb that size would not have 
        caused the destruction experienced in the April 19th 
        explosion, he said.
        
        Other supporting testimony.
        http://www.tncnet.com/~rsears/oak/explode.html

The ship must have had millions of tons, and or, it created a pressure 
cooker effect that magnified explosive power, just as if you opened a 
boiling pressure cooker -- boom.

Nietzsche scholars, correct me if I'm wrong;  but I think Nietzsche was 
referring to the Russians, not the Germans, when he coined the 
expression "Blonde Beast."  Does anyone recall the original context for 
this?  

Anyway I don't think the Blonde Beast meme  (as it has developed   
since Nietzsche's time)  is viable.  It doesn't create a stable community 
around itself.   

In the 18th and 19th centuries, Europeans conquered the world, not 
because they were Blonde Beasts, but because they were *not* beasts.  
They were civilized men.  They were, in fact, Christians.  In the 
20th century, we have lost the thread, and the civilization of Europe is 
only a memory;  and we have, at the same time, lost our strength.  
Some people think we can get our strength back by being Blonde 
Beasts.  I doubt it.  That's exactly the wrong way to go.  

Andray also writes, 

> Several people of my acquaintance seem bothered by the

What rhetoric are you referring to?  I don't recall seeing any such 
rhetoric on the list.  I'm the only one here (as far as I can tell) who is 
seriously unhappy with the PC world we live in.  I have never been a 
spokesman for Extropianism, and in any case I'm not going to be here 
much longer.  

By the way, "Andray" is pig-Latin for "Rand," isn't it?

Lyle,

        My absurd assertion was to get you and Jamesck tp come up from the
depth for a real discussion of Darwinian Evolution.

        The (totaly absurd staement) was made to rouse the powers from the
depths. Actually I was hoping for a lot more folks to tell me off.

        The real matter I want to bring up is whether or not Darwanian Ev.
can account for extant species.

1. Darwanisn is conservative in the extreme. It favors the production of
organisma who are well adapted to the environment of the parent organism(s)
prior to the point of "conception" or whatever reproduction is fashionable
among that species. It is crtainly not proactive.

2. There remain questions about the billion wears form the forst organoc
molecules untit th development of relativelt complex single celled organisms
and the development of "interchangable parts" in DNA based organisms.   <
just had an epileptic             seizure and can't complete for a bit, bear

Though this is the extropian list, I would restrain from publishing exact

In direct violation to the above: John, you forgot mentioning the 
blasting caps ;)

> [ ship loaded with ammonium nitrate exploded ]

Since we are at that: the largest nonnuclear explosion in the human 
history (at BASF in Ludwidshafen?), was caused by a large amount of 
pure ammonia nitriate, where about 1 kT detonated, causing a very large 
crater and very high bodycount. The explosion was primed by dynamite 
charges which were meant to loosen the baked-together powder.

Yet another person who makes recreational offensive comments to the
mailing list.  It is ironic that he successfully baited Lyle, the
previous such offender that I am aware of.

This sort of behavior kills any sense of community I feel in forums
like this.

I'm not sure what depth I'm supposed to come up from.  Also, I'm not 
sure what James has to do with this;  my original statement was made to  
Eric Watt Forste, and Tim Freeman replied.  I don't recall that James 
commented on this.  

I was using the term "Darwinian" loosely.  I am not at all committed to 
the idea that Darwin's mechanism of natural selection is the whole 
story.  To get an argument on that point you should bait Dawkins, not 
me.  

I certainly agree that this subject is important and worth discussing at 
length.  But is this the right forum in which to do it?  I am less and less 
convinced that unstructured e-mail arguments are a productive use of 
anybody's time.  

I am going to open an on-line university.  The curriculum will be quite 
different from any existing university.  The concept of causality will be 
explored from many angles.  The origin of species will be one of our 
main concerns.  The discussion will be structured in such a way as to 
avoid pointless semantic arguments, flameouts, and other unpleasant 
phenomena of e-mail lists.  Stay tuned.

Indeed, the pancriticalist's understanding of rationality can be construed
so as to imply that a person is rational only in so far as they are
prepared to seriously consider criticisms of their positions. And given the
well-known difficulties in communication, seriously considering a criticism
involves being sensitive to different senses in which words may be applied,
sensitive to the values that might motivate this particular criticism, etc.

"Compassion" is derived from words meaning "feeling with", and for
practical purposes, I think it is very difficult to seriously consider any
attempt at criticism without making some attempt to "feel with" the
criticizer. Misunderstanding is easy, particularly if one is adopting a
stance which promotes misunderstanding. Compassion is a psychological
stance that enhances the reception and understanding of messages, including
criticisms.

Looked at this way, we can construe compassion as not merely something that
rationality recommends, but as one of the sources from which full
rationality springs.

He was referring to European barbarians in general. (I think the citation
would be THE GENEALOGY OF MORALS, but I'm not sure.) Since one of
Nietzsche's pet peeves was the destruction of classical civilization by the
Christians and the ancient Germans, he probably had the ancient Germans in
mind. But the phrase was also quite definitely intended to bring to mind
the image of a lion, a connotation that has been mostly lost since the
1940s. For those of you who have a copy of Zarathustra handy, the chapter
"The Three Metamorphoses" may make clearer what sort of image and cultural
role Nietzsche had in mind.

He was very definitely using the word in a value-free sense, neither
approving nor disapproving, but rather analyzing. The context is his
contrast of master morality with slave morality, the blond beast being
associated with the former. A very common mistake in Nietzsche
interpretation is to think that Nietzsche preferred master morality to
slave morality; in fact, he condemned both as narrow-minded. The mistake, I
think, results from Nietzsche's hatred of Christianity, which led him to
condemn slave morality at considerably greater length than master morality,
which he already knew most of his audience would condemn on their own.
(Would that he had taken greater care to prevent the misinterpretations of
the proto-Nazi minority!)

You go on to talk about what enabled Europe to "conquer the world" in the
18th and 19th centuries. This is certainly very far from N's context.
Nietzsche was a classics scholar, and what he was fretting about most of
the time was not the ability of civilized 19th-century Europeans to
dominate other cultures, but rather the much more worrisome ability of
uncivilized German barbarians and superstitious Christian rabble to destroy
classical civilization. (Me, I blame the Romans, but I've probably just
been unduly influenced by Petr Beckmann.)

I wouldn't worry about it. Most serious philosophers nowadays (including
such bastions of transatlantic socialism as Richard Rorty) are deeply
indebted to Nietzsche, and few serious thinkers worry themselves overmuch
about the Nazi caricature that springs to most people's minds when they
think "Nietzsche". Kaufmann's books are widely available if anyone wishes
to disabuse themselves of this caricature.

If you're not going to be around here much longer, you'll be missed. There
are too few strong challenges around here, and though you aren't always on
the mark, you've come up with some good ones.

You quoted me talking about the destruction of cosmic wormholes. The
difference between crossing a bridged river and crossing an unbridged river
is hardly any difference at all compared to the difference between crossing
a few megaparsecs instantaneously or crossing a few megaparsecs at light
speed.

In any case, I'm not sure what your point is. Are you trying to encourage
me to think of ways in which cultural diversity could be promoted
post-diaspora, or what?

All goals are "stupid" in *this* sense, because the desire to remain alive
and healthy arises in what you are dismissing as "general mental
flakiness". Once you get to the point where you can rearrange yourself so
as to enjoy anything (the perfect Stoic), well, you have to have some other
reason for *choosing* to do something, right? That's what I'm proposing
generalizable extrinsicity for. If you have complete control over what you
choose to be pleased by and what you choose to be displeased by, perhaps
all that's left as a rational goal is to keep your options open, or rather,
to open them further, as wide as possible.

But what you call "stupidity", I call "autonomy".

Another way to look at the dichotomy (which I'm bringing up but have no
interest in defending) is to say that intrinsic goals are goals the
recognition of the attainment of which causes a stimulus of some sort to
the "pleasure center" in the brain. *Purely* extrinsic goals do no such
thing. If you rearrange yourself so as to particularly enjoy some
"extrinsic" activity, then that activity becomes a mixed goal, both done
intrinsically for its own sake and also extrinsically as a means to further
ends.

One interesting fact from psychology is that human beings seem to be
capable of arranging their minds (over the long term, or having their minds
arranged for them by outside conditioning) so that damn near anything can
cause a pleasure response. That is, people can *learn* to enjoy nearly
anything. The intrinsic/extrinsic dichotomy should certainly not be seen as
any kind of magical, hard-and-fast distinction. It's fuzzy, and most human
values partake of both sides.

There isn't any such thing as "ultimate justification"; in fact, it's a
contradiction in terms. If I didn't believe that, I might also retort
"human intellect is quite flexible, so it is very risky to use it as an
ultimate justification".

You say you prefer extrinsic goals, instrumental goals, to intrinsic ones.
But extrinsicity or instrumentality implies some further end in mind, and
you say nothing about the further end that you have in mind when you say
you favor extrinsic goals. I guess what you're saying is that you've
decided to adopt "generalizable extrinsicity" as your primary intrinsic
goal, and I didn't even have to talk you into it. Gosh, that was easy. I
guess I'm on the right track.


>Having fun is okay, but don't use it to justify your actions.

What do you propose as an alternative? All I can make out is that you're
agreeing with me about "generalizable extrinsicity". If you're disagreeing
with me, I'm not sure where.

My point in defending "frivolous goals" was this. What Newton was doing
during the plague year at Woolsthorpe Manor was extremely frivolous. It was
a purely upper-class intellectual pursuit with no practical application
that anyone at the time could have proposed. Even if it did have a
practical application that someone might have foreseen at the time, I can
assure you that this had absolutely nothing to do with Newton's motivation.
Newton himself thought his work during the plague year was frivolous; he
didn't bother writing it up for years, and then, after finishing the first
book of Principia Mathematica, he let it sit in a drawer for several more
years until Halley found it and talked him into finishing and publishing
it.

What Archimedes and Euclid were doing when they developed Greek mathematics
to its height was likewise a purely frivolous goal. They had no reason to
believe that what they were doing would ever be useful to anyone but
philosophers, and they did it anyway, because they were philosophers and
that is what they enjoyed doing. Apollonius's study of conic sections lay
unused, a purely frivolous accomplishment, for almost two millenia until
Kepler, in his own frivolous astronomical pursuits, found a new
philosophical application for them.

My point then is that we had better be tolerant of people's frivolous
goals, because the only way to see what new and generally-extrinsically
valuable things might arise from them is to wait and see. Hayek makes this
point over and over again.

And given that much, I don't think it would do too much harm for you to be
tolerant of your own frivolous goals. You'll never know what you missed out
on if you ruthlessly suppress them all.

------ C. David Eagle <eagle@earth.com> writes: --------------



  I am forming a group named the "Libertarian Programmers' Guild".
The goals are as follows:


1.  Make money.


2.  Make money, based on the value of one's production.


3.  Specifically, reward programmers with royalties based on the
    subjectively rated difficulty of their software effort and the
    frequency of sales of their code.


4.  Promote the use of shared libraries between ALL applications
    running on a system:


    a) by eliminating the legal & economic barriers to calling someone
       else's subroutines.
    b) so that total installed software size on a system running our
       software can be *DRAMATICALLY* reduced.
    c) while creating competitive incentives to programmers to improve
       the efficiency of library subroutines.


5.  Create a state-of-the-art development environment.


6.  Create a state-of-the-art distribution system.


7.  Harness the power of the latent software development energy on the
    net (a la Linux).


8.  Further libertarian goals, which might include:


    a. Provide an individual computer owner independence from any large
       corporation or government entity.  As a minimum, I believe this
       requires that the owner of a computer at least have the option
       of holding/touching/reading *ALL* the source code for *ALL* the
       software running on his/her system.


    b. Provide a built-in security system which


       i) is extremely easy to use, being mostly transparent.
       ii) is extremely powerful, potentially supporting the full matrix
           of capabilities-oriented security (2-dimensional security
           system; one axis is 'agents' (programs/users) and the other
           axis is 'resources' (files/devices/agents))
       iii) is integrated with the low-level disk access agents resulting
            in a seamless and highly efficient system


    c. Implementing applications which rely upon high security, such
       as digital cash and electronic marketplaces.


    d. Produce software to specifically assist libertarian organizations.
       Many possibilities here.


    e. Implement applications, such as waldos (remote-controlled manufacturing,
       manipulation, etc.), which break the geographic connection between
       living and working (and, presumably, reduce the ability of
       territorial countries to assign tax-collecting authority).


9.  Enable libertarian programmers to participate to as small or large
    an extent as they desire, rewarding them with royalties for as little
    as a single subroutine submitted.


10.  Address and solve many of the annoying issues related to today's
     commercial software.  Among these are name conflicts, un-installation
     difficulties, mysterious files, and legacy carryovers.


11.  I must also confess to at least one ulterior motive behind several of
     my proposals.  There is a reason I want to see a small, fast,
communication-
     oriented OS.  I am interested in nanotechnology.  There is at least
     one pressing future application which requires such an OS; that is,
     a nanite.  Ribosomes, our best model in nature, have about a million
     atoms, which translates (roughly) into a computing environment about
     as powerful as a Commodore 64.


12.  Give the software away.


13.  Give away all the software that runs on any user's system.


14.  Copyright, but make freely distributable, all the software which is
     intended to run on users' systems.


15.  Make money by


     a. Asking for voluntary support a la shareware.


     b. Selling optimized, customized installations which perform better
        and more to a person/company's liking.  Such custom installations
        would take up far less disk space because they would not include
        software the user was not willing to pay the programmers' royalty
        for (probably because they have little or no use for that program).
        The custom installation would be automatically built by closely-
        held software back at our headquarters.


     c. Selling support and training services.


     d. Selling the output of closely held software, rather than the
        software itself.  For example, say we wrote a program which
        did a good job of predicting the weather.  Then, keeping the
        software secure behind our walls and never letting a single
        copy out, we could sell weather predictions.

Eric Lerner explains, in his 1992 book "The Big Bang Never Happened" 
(Vintage Books / Random House), how the Big Bang theory is an irrational 
faith, "a scientific version of the Biblical story of Creation." And therein 
lies a story worth posting for Extropians.

Lerner sums up his theme as follows: "Today Big Bang theorists see a 
universe much like that envisioned by the medieval scholars - a finite 
cosmos created ex nihilo, from nothing, whose perfection is in the past, 
which is degenerating to a final end. The perfect principles used to form 
this universe can only be known by pure reason, guided by authority, 
independent of observation. Such a cosmic myth arises in periods of social 
crisis or retreat, and reinforces the separation of thought and action, 
ruler and ruled. It breeds fatalistic pessimism that paralyzes society. By 
contrast, the opposing view, plasma cosmology, is empirical ... Its 
proponents see an infinite universe evolving over infinite time. The 
universe can be studied only by observation - there is no final answer in 
science and no final authority. This approach, binding together thought and 
action, theory and observation, has proved, over the ages, to be a weapon of 
social change. The idea of progress in the universe has always been linked 
with the idea of social progress on earth."

Lerner shows how the basic assumptions of the Big Bang theory have been 
refuted by observation; yet, to explain the discrepancies, its theorists 
continue to postulate elaborate, contrived explanations, such as cosmic 
strings and dark matter, involving conveniently unobservable phenomena. This 
is quite similar to the way statists keep coming up with more government 
fixes for the new problems continuously arising from previous government 
attempts to fix something. Lerner points out: "The deductive method's 
disregard for observation and practical application of science originated 
with the slave master's disdain for manual work, while the empirical 
method's system is based on free craftsmen and traders combining theory and 
observation."

Toward the end of part 1, 'The Cosmological Debate' in "The Big Bang Never 
Happened", Lerner describes the long struggle of Swedish Nobel prize winner 
Hannes Alfven who pioneered the principles of plasma cosmology; then Lerner 
explains how he himself developed his theories about the speed of plasmas in 
vortices, all confirmed by astronomical observations; and how along with 
their collaborator Tony Perat at Los Alamos, they finally achieved some 
public recognition in 1989 after the first joint conference of plasma 
physicists and astrophysicists.

Note that most popular science books about cosmology and the nature of the 
universe in the past few years have all been written by mathematical 
physicists, like Paul Davies' "The Mind Of God" and Roger Penrose's two 
best-sellers, both of whom long for a world of pure reason, of mathematical 
ideals, and a theory of everything.

On the fictional side, most of the stories in 1995's "Far Futures" 
anthology, edited by Gregory Benford, take this pessimistic view of the 'end 
of time', which might be dedicated to Frank Tipler's "Physics of 
Immortality" ideas. The notable exception is Poul Anderson's "Genesis", 
about the independent, extropian, solar intelligences of a gallactic 
MetaMind. Anderson's story really constrasts with Charles Sheffield's "At 
the Eschaton" about a 'hero' who conquers the galaxy and then takes over the 
Omega Point and even destroys this universe all so he can resurrect his 
beloved in a new 'baby' universe of his own creation.

Back in "The Big Bang Never Happened", in ch.7 'The Endless Flow of Time', 
Lerner promotes Ilya Prigogine's theories of order from chaos, and how the 
mathematical physicist's notion of the reversibility of time is an 
inapplicable abstraction. More importantly, he shows how evolution is a 
process of more efficient energy capture, and applies to ecosystems, if not 
to individual organisms: "the debris of one stage fuels a subsequent stage 
... Thus there is no inherent limit to evolution away from equilibrium, even 
with a fixed supply of energy, so long as a process can continually increase 
the efficiency with which it recycles the energy."

Lerner then goes on to castigate Bohr & Heisenberg's mysticism, moral 
neutrality, and Nazi collaboration, particularly what he calls Heisenberg's 
fascist search for 'The Central Order'. I might call this the desire to 
crack the 'privileged' levels of the universe's operating system (as opposed 
to agoric transformations at the application level).

Lerner goes on to offer some clues regarding vortexs from thermodynamics & 
hydrodynamics that might eventually reconcile the inconsistencies of quantum 
theory & relativity. I interpret his discussion here as saying that only 
waves have any existence over time, particles & objects are merely the 
current, fleeting froth of interacting waves - the epiphenomena. The popular 
paradigm, however, tends to think of objects & material things as reality, 
while the messages that pass between them are considered fleeting & 
insubstantial.

In ch.9, 'Infinite in Time and Space', Lerner describes how "the Big Bang is 
entangled with religious and theological ideas," and it's only a short step 
from theological longings for a Necessary Being (God), a Creator from 
outside, to science as an elite priesthood, and the fascist search for a 
Central Order to the universe.

In particular he discusses how particle physics and the Big Bang cosmology 
have an incestuous relationship (as well as circular logic) - their embrace 
of purely deductive reasoning from subjective ideals while ignoring 
observation and inductive reasoning. Lerner nicely sums up what is wrong 
with the purely deductive approach taken by the mathematical physicists 
(with their Platonic ideals) who have dominated much of popular science in 
recent years: "it is futile to try to derive natural laws from aesthetic 
ideas."

Finally, Lerner makes the most important point of the book: "By positing an 
end to all things, conventional cosmology necessarily implies one of two 
philosophical stances: either a blind existential pessimism, humanity 
condemned to a meaningless existence, or a dualistic faith like that of the 
Middle Ages, which finds meaning only in the world beyond."

Lerner goes on to describe the theories of Teilhard de Chardin who, he says, 
"rejects the dualism that assumes two distinct existences, that of the 
spirit and that of matter." Furthermore, according to Lerner, "[Teilhard] 
hypothesizes that there are two forms of energy. One, the 'tangential,' 
links an entity with existing processes in the universe; the other, 
'radial,' is identified with the creation of new relations and higher orders 
of complexity. This second form of energy Teilhard de Chardin identifies 
with consciousness." A bandwidth-optimizing summary of this is Francois 
Jacob's 1974 quote on how energy & information are "the two forms of power; 
the power to do and the power to direct what is done," noted in John 
Holland's "Hidden Order".

In ch.9, Lerner's section on 'Infinity & the Deity' makes the following 
major point: "On the one hand are those who ... believe that an infinite 
universe will challenge the authority of the deity. On the other, their 
opponents believe only a universe without limits befits an infinite God."

Lerner's final chapter, 'Cosmos and Society' is extremely disappointing 
because (I think) Lerner misinterprets economics as badly as he accuses 
mathematical physicists of misinterpreting cosmology, and for the same 
reason - Lerner has no hands-on experience with economics or industry, he 
starts with preconcieved socialistic ideals and then searches for statistics 
to fit his thesis, namely, that capitalism is in decline and a new mode of 
'worker democracy' is needed. He fails to distinguish between the 
pseudo-market, mercantilist economies of Europe & South America and the 
truly free-market, though regulation-stifled, economies of the U.S. and the 
Asian 'Tigers'. Furthermore, (as anyone who hasn't had their head burried in 
plasma physics would know) he totally fails to recognize that the current 
'slowdown' in progress is due to a major shift from a labor-based, 
manufacturing economy to an information-based, service economy, and is 
certainly not due to any crisis in capitalism, which has yet to be really 
tried in perhaps 90% of the world's countries!

The other point where Lerner's thinking is seriously flawed is his 
contention (in ch.7) that "a universe as computer, a finitely divisable 
universe, would indeed have no future and no past ... because its every 
action is precisely predictable."

I don't believe this. Digital computers are able to perform simulations that 
exhibit instabilities where the results will be unpredictable. Rudy Rucker 
commented on this notion in his book "Mind Tools" (p116): "One feels that, 
although some of the world's information is digital, much of it is also 
analog.... It could be, though, that we simply aren't able to examine the 
world closely enough to see its digital texture. Something feels analog to 
us if its pixels are too small for us to readily sense them.... Nevertheless 
 - and this point is worth stressing - any physical process can be modeled to 
any desired degree of precision by a complicated-enough digital 
computation." But, can a digital program exhibit the kind of non-local 
effects that Lerner proposes? I say yes - All systems are digital at the 
bottom but become wave-like, or analog (analogue?), only when they interact 
as independent (agoric) entities. (By the way, could someone please point me 
to the origin of the term 'agoric'?)

My notion is that a pluralistic universe must be object-oriented at the 
bottom (what I call the Content level). That is, it must be composed of 
discrete (though interdependent) entities. It cannot be continuous or analog 
like Eric Lerner claims, otherwise, there is no chance for the decision 
points that allow free will. In other words, the base level of reality must 
be composed of particles, not waves. These 'low-level', object-oriented 
systems, or 'particles', however, merely process transactions according to 
subjective or internal (intrinsic) criteria. The next step up (at what I 
call the Context level), the system becomes event-driven and interactive 
(extrinsic), correlating its internal states with external information. 
Finally, at the Contest level, the system becomes wave-like and abstract 
functions are enabled by applying knowledge achieved at (what I call) the 
Contest level to produce novelty back at the Content level through self 
transformation.

And so, Boundless Expansion (NOT Big Bang), Self Transformation ('free will' 
/ libertarianism), Dynamic Optimism (unbounded universe), Intelligent 
Technology (3-tiered, Content/Context/Contest systems design), Spontaneous 
Order (bionomic + fractal + selectional algorithms) may all be 'proven' from 
the 'hidden order' of ecology, thermodynamics & hydrodynamics.

P.S. Too bad I'm not a physicist or mathematician. My .gov address is the 
only one I have access to and the opinions expressed here are NOT those of 
the agency I work for (Bureau of Labor Statistics). I'm just a hired hand 
who enjoys hacking (not cracking) the economic stats (hormones) of MetaMan 
for a living. (I have worked as a systems analyst under contracts to the 
federal government for 10 years, but NEVER for a regulatory agency.)

I admit that wormholes are iffy, but given wormholes, I don't think
most places could stay very isolated.  They'd have to destroy *all*
holes to their region, and then these holes could be rebuilt again
very quickly from the "upwind" direction (from where each civilization
began).  Hopes for cultural diversity would have to be based on
something other than isolation.

This is only true for people who seek to find the meaning of their life at
the end of vast time, instead of just opening their eyes to the world
around them and finding the meaning of their life in what they are
experiencing and what they can do to improve the immediate quality of their
lives and the lives of the people around them. I'm not slamming big hopes,
big dreams, big ambitions! These are wonderful things. But they are far too
uncertain to be reliable foundations for all our other values. I think
people benefit from connecting their values as closely as possible to the
immediate reality in which they live.

I've read Lerner's book, and like you, I was disappointed by the lack of
economic sophistication revealed in his value-analyses. But I was also
disappointed by his buying into the traditional Western
theological-cosmological quest to find the ultimate basis for values as far
away as possible from the world of everyday experience. And further, I was
a little bit disappointed in that the whole book just seemed to be a
premeditated attack, an axe-grinding exercise with a preconceived
conclusion, a holy war or a mission from God.

But I wasn't too disappointed with that last bit, because it'd be hard to
take away that aspect of the book without taking away what I liked about
it. What I liked about the book is that it identified an emerging
orthodoxy, a new superstition (the sort of thing you see in Tipler's work,
which I haven't read yet and so cannot really criticize and shouldn't even
mention, I suppose) developing out of the unquestioning acceptance of a
highly speculative theory. Lerner might have come to write this book after
looking around as hard as he could for an example of a developing
superstition, an unquestioned orthodoxy for the next few decades, and
trying to nip it in the bud. And if this last was truly his motivation,
then I can't fault him at all.

If I were an astrophysicist or a cosmologist, I'd worry about the ultimate
destiny of the universe, because that would be part of my job. But I'm not,
so I'll worry about it in a few hundred years, maybe. Sooner, if I manage
to clear away all the other stuff I'm interested in.

It's difficult to decide what sort of effect wormholes (iffy though they
are) would have on cultural diversity without considering what sort of
bandwidth they might provide relative to the routine bandwidth available
for local (non-wormhole) travel and communication. (I know that
generalizing bandwidth to cover travel and transportation is a little
weird, but it's hard to beat the bandwidth of a 747 loaded up with CDs or
humans. And increasingly inexpensive air travel, in my opinion, promotes
long-term cultural homogenization even more effectively than satellite TV.)

If the two levels don't differ much from one another, then you have a
situation that tends toward cultural homogenization. But if the local
bandwidth is very much greater than the available wormhole bandwidth, I
think that within a fairly small sphere (contained within the galactic
plane, say) you could get a great deal of cultural diversity in a short
time.

But taking this further would require a highly speculative (to say the
least) economic analysis of wormhole construction, and considering how
speculative the physics and theoretical-applied-science is already, I doubt
anyone's going to put much work into that particular study anytime soon.
But it might be fun in a few more years.

Actually, I just realized that everywhere I said "bandwidth" above, I
should have said "bandwidth costs", mutatis mutandum. But if I carry this
on, I'll be doing the study myself, and fun as this is, other priorities
call me away for the time being.

I first joined the (original) Extropians list in August, 1991.  So I
think the list must be at or near its five year old birthday.

Today I was reading some of the very old posts.  Max suggested here
recently that we could repost some of those old messages, and I think I
may do so tomorrow (don't have my archives available now).
Coincidentally, my first posting was about the book "The Big Bang Never
Happened", now being discussed in the "Big Bang and Extropy" thread.

One thing I found interesting was a message from Max about the Extropian
Principles.  At that time Intelligent Technology and Spontaneous Order
were not present.  Instead there was Cooperative Diversity, which I think
was intended to get across a similar idea as SO.  In fact maybe in some
ways that is a better term since as was pointed out here in some sense
everything that happens (non-miraculously) in the world is spontaneous,
hence governments can be thought of as examples of spontaneous order.

To those of you who share my interest in the history of technology and its
impact on human life, I recommend Dava Sobel, Longitude (Walker, 1995) ISBN:
0-8027-0131-2.  This delightful little book (184 small pages) recounts, to
quote its accurate cover, "The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the
Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time."  The genius:  John Harrison.  The
Problem:  calculating longitude.  His solution:  an accurate seafaring
chronometer.  The writing engages, the story illuminates, and the hero,
Harrison, inspires.

Yes, this is the right question to ask.  Except that absolute
bandwidth levels may be important as well.  The fractional bandwidth
of today's mass media is really pretty tiny compared to the full
bandwidth of local human interaction.

I'd like to suggest that there are economies of scale to collecting
an old message archive and the permission to publish messages.  So
some one person should volunteer as the central contact, and then we
can all email him/her our private archives, together with our
permssion to make them available.  With this all collected together, a
program can be run over the collection deleting contributions (and
quotes) from peple who haven't given permission.  

I have many megs of private archives, and don't think you all want me
to post it all here.

Anyone else out there find it improbable that life evolved from
nothing to complex single-cells in the few hundred million years after
the earth and mars cooled enough to support life?  Seems more likely
to me that life evolved more leisurely elsewhere and came here.
Anyone know where this view is analyzed in more detail?  I know there
are concerns about cosmic rays frying cells in space, but maybe they
can repair fast, or can hide in rocks.

Not that improbable - a few hundred million years is a very long time.  Check
out the Origins of Order by Kauffman for a mathematical explaination of how
once things get complex enough you're almost bound to get something lifelike.

Panspermia is a well-known hypothesis.  Cosmic rays seem lethal to any going
life, but spores could hide in rocks.  I'd think that a asteroid knocked off
a planet attaining escape velocity from a solar system would be an extremely
rare event, however.

Life transfer from Earth to Mars, or vice versa, is now considered plausible.
 If we can get a chemical analysis of this (possible) Martian life you can
bet this is at the top of the things we'd look for.

I hope the finding of life (well, ex-life) on Mars holds up.  It really would
be one of the great discoveries of all time.

I have most of the last 5-6 years (has it been that long?) of
list archives.  They're spread out on various media, mostly
tar archives on DAT tapes.

Is anyone volunteering to implement the logic Robin mentions

No*.  Mammals have come a long way in 65 million years.  Multicellular
went a long way in possibly 20 million years in the Cambrian explosion.
300 million years separate cool down and the first fossil prokaryotes.
Reproducing once a year gives 300 million generations.  Ideally bacteria
can reproduce in an hour, giving 2.6 trillion generations.  Certainly
bacteria and archaea are more complex than they're usually given credit
for outside of microbiology, but I don't have a problem with their
evolution.  300 million years to get working cells, 3 billion years
expanding the diversity of the prokaryotes, 600 million years of
multicellular life... frankly, evolution often seems damn _slow_ to me&.

There was some microbe discovered -- probably an archaean -- that

I don't know the details, like whether it can be active or if this is in

its mechanisms for withstanding dehydration.

I just read a great book, with a lot of Extropian thought in it.  Society of 
the Mind, by Eric L. Harry.  It's a good introduction to a lot of Extropian 
ideas, because one of the characters is being introduced to the ideas very 
quickly -- virtual reality, human-level AI, genetic algorithims, memetics and 
so forth.  The quality of writing is excellent.

I'm wondering if anyone's heard of Eric Harry before.  Is he a member of the 
Extropy Institute?

It's kind of wierd... I was at the library, not even intending to borrow any 
fiction books, and as I rode up the escalator, I glanced at the large display 
of new fiction books, and I immediately saw the book (from about twenty meters 
away) and had a strong urge to check it out.  So after I was done getting the 
other stuff I wanted, I went over and took a look at it.  The description on 
the dust jacket made it sound kind of interesting, so I borrowed the book.  
When I got home I started reading it, and after about twenty pages or so,  I 
was thinking "Oh, my God! This is the stuff I've been thinking about for the 
past while, and here it is, in a book."  It was just kind of wierd that I felt 
such an attraction to it and it matched my thoughts so well.  I have these 
types of experiences all the time, where I just feel strongly attracted to 
something, and it turns out to be exactly what I'm looking for; like I'm 
thinking about something, and it helps me clarify my thoughts and develop them 
further.  Generally, I'm attracted to books and things which were created by 
people who think similarly to myself, and I'm attracted even before I really 
know anything about the book.  I just see it, and  whammo!  I want it, and it 
turns out to be just what I need.  Do you guys have these type of experiences? 
 I don't even have the metaphysical framework to understand how these things 
happen.
	Although I guess there's the idea that I'm living in a virtual reality world 
and the computer's kind of directing me to what I'm looking for.  But I don't 
really have any compelling evidence to support that idea, beyond the 
experiences I indicated.
	Well, there's also the idea that people's minds are connected in subtle ways, 
like telepathy, and that we form some sort of collective thought space, and so 
of course I would recognize these books and be attracted to them, because I'm 
tuned in more to like-minded people, who've written the books and who've read 
the books, so I recognize them because like-minded people also recognize them. 
 I don't know.  What do you guys think?

Happens to me all the time. I don't have time to read all the books that
call to me in this way. (When more good books are published each year than
were published in the previous year, there's not much chance of Achilles
catching up with this Tortoise.)

For instance, I finally got around to Kosko's FUZZY THINKING, which has
been on my reading list for a long time. It is exactly what I needed to
read three years ago, when I was fretting about multivalence and theories
of truth. It's great fun to read it now, but I've given up hope on catching
up with the right book at the right time. I expect the three-year time lag
to keep widening.

This would be a difficult hypothesis to test. The subtler the ways of
connection, the more difficult. There's no question that people's minds are
connected in many ways other than the use of language, and if you leave out
the word "telepathy", then you're talking memetics.

Subject: The Conspiracy Theory THEY Want You to Believe

	I have been mulling over an article on this topic for years.

	Of course, there may well have been many such conspiracy theories
floated by various factions of the Establishment over the years.  However,
I am looking for the essence of the one that has served them consistently
for the long term.

	My best hypothesis is the Class Warfare conspiracy, essentially as
formalized by Noam Chomsky and recently bought into by Daniel Brandt in
his NameBase Newsline which we broadcasted to the Weekly Up-date List and
a number of News Groups.

	While the real ruling class is a tiny cabal centered around the
Federal Reserve System with International connections to the British
Oligarchy and their International Banking network, the Class Warfare
theorists would have us believe that a Conspiracy of the "rich", usually
those making over $100,000.00/year or about 10% of the population,
who organize themselves primarily through the Republican Party to despoil
"working people" by lowering taxes on themselves and cutting social
programs.  The real ruling class has their wealth in tax free Foundations
or sheltered/secreted in Switzerland or other bank secrecy havens and are
situated in truly Olympian fashion with enormous leverage through
anonymous control of hundreds of the world largest corporations.

	To maintain their lofty perch the real ruling class must prevent
that 10% of society making decent incomes above $100,000.00 from getting
much richer.  They don't need to be 100% successful in this endeavor, but
need only keep the frequency of big money breakthroughs to a manageable
level.  A few big money breakthroughs are no problem.  "Co-operative" new
rich can be gradually integrated into their cabal through such front
organizations as the Council on Foreign Relations and a few
"uncooperative" new rich can be eliminated through selective enforcement
of all pervasive "regulations" or, if necessary, more dramatic action.  As
Ferdinand Lundberg pointed-out in his crucial book there are _The Rich and
the Super Rich_!  The primary enemies of the Super Rich are not the poor,
but the Rich!  In classic Caesarian/fascist fashion, the Super Rich, to
remain at the helm of society as a whole, must organize the poor against
their real competitors, the Rich.

	Thus, we see the constant drumbeat in the press that taxes must be
raised or certainly not reduced on the upper 10% of incomes.  This
propaganda is repeated endlessly in the CFR's _Foreign Affairs_ as well.

	[Obviously, there is much more that I could and will eventually
write about this topic....comments pro and con at this point would be
appreciated.]

PS.  Yes, I am quite aware that this theory is not unique to me.  Gary
Allen called it "pressure from above and pressure from below" in his
durable _None Dare Call It Conspiracy_.  Gary Allen before his death from
the complications of diabetes, was the John Birch Society's most prolific
writer and the most libertarian as well.

  If the construction of those organisms (DNA?) is to any degree compatible with
those on Earth, it would be a very strong evidence for panspermia to have worked
at least in this case.  Then it probably would be that hard to guess whether
these
life forms came from Mars, from Earth, or to both from elsewhere.

RE Eric Lerner's "The Big Bang Never happened", Ian Goddard noted:

"At 01:32 PM 8/7/96 EDT, Crosby_M wrote: 'Lerner shows how the basic 
assumptions of the Big Bang theory have been  refuted by observation.'  IAN: 
How does he write off the appearance of universal expansion due to the 
red-shift of all starlight ?"

My statement that "the basic assumptions of the Big Bang theory have been 
refuted" was a poor choice of words.  Basically, I think Lerner proposes an 
evolving universe driven mostly by dynamic electrical and magnetic currents 
generated at the gallactic level, as well as the more static gravitational 
forces of history that dominate general relativity and conventional 
cosmology.  When these forces are incorporated into theory, he sees no need 
for a Big Bang and some of its appendages, like black holes and dark matter.

The red-shift, or "Hubble relationship" as Lerner refers to it, is "still a 
mystery", he admits.  In fact he devotes an appendix to the several theories 
on this, such as Alfven's antimatter theories and the various "tired light" 
theories first started by Dirac.  Lerner summarizes these thus: "light may 
lose energy as it travels through space, shifting it to red.  Or perhaps all 
objects, all space expands continuously, a certain tiny percentage a year."

Another pillar of conventional cosmology is the idea that a Big Bang is 
necessary to explain the smooth cosmic background radiation that we see at 
the 'edge' of the universe.  Lerner, instead, proposes that this might not 
be an echo of some perfect past but rather "the glow from a radio fog 
produced in the present-day universe."  I'm definitely not an expert on this 
stuff but I might add that, perhaps, expansion is simply a side-effect of 
the ever-increasing complexity of matter as it evolves.

Eric Watt Forste's comments concluded that: "If I were an astrophysicist or 
a cosmologist, I'd worry about the ultimate destiny of the universe, because 
that would be part of my job.  But I'm not, so I'll worry about it in a few 
hundred years, maybe."

I am also not at all interested in "the ultimate destiny of the universe" 
EXCEPT for one reason: If there is no ultimate destiny of the universe, then 
that implies that we have access to unlimited creativity in the immediate 
reality.  I think it further implies that stages of life and intelligence 
beyond the human are not only possible but likely to exist already.  That's 
why I find 'anthropic' ideas of humans alone consuming the universe to be 
rather amusing (if not impertinent).  But I still endorse the "Mind 
Children" mission because it seems to be the next logical step in our 
species' diaspora "onward and outward" from the primordial tidal pool.

I'm all for an empirical method of deriving one's values and theories from 
the evolving evidence of the immediate reality; but, let's never settle for 
the immediate reality and always strive to see how far we can jump beyond 
it.

To properly quantify this experiences you will have make a record
of each time you find yourself "drawn" to a book, and note how
often it turns out to be something you're interested in. Then you
must determine the probability that any random book which you
were not "drawn" to would also have fallen into a category that
interested you. Finally eliminate all occurrences where the "draw"
was caused by one of the five established sensory inputs.

Once you have a large enough sample, you'll be able to calculate
exactly how "book psychic" you are.(+/- the statistical margin of
error, of course.)

I realized I didn't really explain my reasoning on this topic,

----------------------------------------------------------------
The Great Filter -- by Robin Hanson

Humanity seems to have a bright future, a non-trivial chance of
expanding to fill the universe with lasting life.  But the fact that
space around us seems dead now tells us that any given peice of dead
matter faces an astronomically low chance of begating such a future.
There thus exists a great filter between death and expanding lasting
life, and humanity now faces the ominous question: how far along this
filter are we?  Study of the origins of life offers important relevant
evidence; the easier it was for life to evolve to our stage, the
bleaker our future chances must be.

What about the near-future use of cognitive prostheses? I mean neural-net
chips that are trained to mimic functions of very small pieces of human
brain tissue that might be used to cure the kind of aphasias and other
cognitive deficits that small ischemic strokes and other brain injuries can
cause. I think economic demand within the health-care industry will lead to
heavy funding of this technology path, and once the engineering research to
develop silicon cognitive prostheses is well underway, the same
technologies can be used to enhance and expand "normal" function.

Once people start using silicon neural-nets to expand and enhance normal
brain function, one can imagine a smooth path to a point in which one's
"identity" has gradually moved "into" the silicon prostheses, because
eventually there would simply be more and faster computational power on the
prosthesis side. The sorts of computational structures that neural networks
support (minds, in this case) can be extremely protean and flexible.

The logical end result of this technology path would be something similar
to Greg Egan's "jewel" or Ndoli device. I don't think the possibility of
soft incremental uploads can be so easily dismissed until after we learn
more about the way neural networks (both artificial and natural) work.

The following is a letter I wrote to Omni Magazine.  It was printed in 
the magazine (in garbled form) in 1979. 

-------

In the January interview, I. J. Good proposes that we create a computer 
more intelligent than a man, which would then be programmed to 
design a still more intelligent computer, and so on.  

A computer's intelligence is determined primarily by its software.  
Producing a more intelligent computer means devising new languages 
and programs.  The nature of the hardware is not critical, although 
a computer with human intelligence would presumably need 
a memory capacity comparable to the human brain.    

The hardware would not even have to be electronic.  The human brain 
itself could be used instead of a computer.  

If we can produce software that would make a computer more 
intelligent than a man, we might as well produce better software 
for ourselves and thus create a _man_ more intelligent than any man is 
at present.  These first ultra-intelligent men (and women) could then 
carry on the work, just as the ultra-intelligent computer is supposed 
to do in Dr. Good's scenario.  

Anyone who would like to participate in such a project is invited to 
write to The Bootstrap Society, [address long since defunct].  

-------

The editor changed "a memory capacity comparable to the human brain" 
to "a memory capacity incomparable with that of the human brain."  
Why??  This nonsensical expression probably scared off the very people 
I hoped to reach.

The replies I received were not interesting.  I didn't pursue the project 
at that time.  

This will be my last post of the summer.  Vacation starts tomorrow.  
Please don't send me e-mail about this (or anything) right now.  
I don't know how long Delphi saves unread mail.  I will be back online 
in the fall.

I can't believe how "tabloid" science reporting has gotten regarding the
alleged "Martian" bacteria supposedly found in a meteorite recovered in
Antarctica.

First of all, how do the scientists know this rock came from Mars?  We
haven't physically retrieved rocks from Mars yet, so on what basis can they
make this assertion?

Secondly, how do they know that the alleged fossil microbes in the rock came
from Mars, and not from some terrestrial contamination long ago?

Already the pseudoscientific cranks, like Richard Hoagland, are latching
onto this as "proof" that the Government is preparing us for the
announcement that technological ET's exist and have visited our world
repeatedly.

Ah well.  If any of these Alien Fraud-topsy photos turn out to be genuine
(see the new ones in the Sept. issue of _Penthouse_), I'll at least be
assured that I can kill these beasties if they try to bother me.

There have been several articles in Science magazine about the martian
meteorites. Smoe of teh articles have discussed the energetics and
balistics
of the transfer of the material from Mars' surface to earth. Basically,
a large
bolide struck Mars, "splashing" the material laterally off the surface,
through
the thin martian atmosphere, an out into space in excess of martian
escape
velocity. (Assuming that I understood the articles correctly and that I
remember
them correctly.)  Thus, transfer of material from Mars to Eath is
feasible.

I don't recall a discussion of whetern or not such a transfer is
compatible
with the preservation of bacterial life, but it's not inconcievable. I
don't
think acceleration or even shock is a mojor issue for rock-dwelling
bacteria.
the problems would be heat (at launch and re-entry) and dessication and
radiation (in space).

The situation for Earth-to-Mars transfer is a lot less favorable, for
three
reasons: Earth has higher gravity, Earth has (and apparently has had) a
much
denser atmosphere, and Earth is nearer to the sun. For all three
reasons, it's
a lot harder to get a rock from earth to Mars without starting with
enough energy to melt it.

Panspermia requires a much longer time in space than Mars-to-Earth
infection. Thus, Mars-to-earth infection is much more probable than
either Earth-to-Mars infection or infection from a common source, IMO.

I enjoyed Robin Hanson's article entitled The Great Filter
( http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/greatfilter.html ) but disagree
that an optimistic future involves large-scale colonization of space
or even space travel at all. I think it's quite possible to have an
utopian future without even getting off the Earth. The advance
of space exploration technology seems to pale next to the advance
of computer hardware and software. Seems to me then that there's a
good possibility we'll invent numerous new worlds to explore within
software constructs that may satisfy the urge to expand. From what I
recall, prior to the discovery of possible ex-life on Mars, that a
manned Mars mission was scheduled for maybe the 2020's, thus placing
it in the later period of Vinge's singularity timeframe of 2005-2030.
Thus I think there's an good chance we'll become transcendent post-
humanity long before any major manned exploration or colonization
activities within our solar system.

This leads to some interesting consequences: if only a portion of
mankind transcends, they might leave enough advanced artifacts
around for the remainder to do the major physical engineering projects
to explore and colonize space. Maybe all those UFO's are full of
alien idiots who couldn't transcend along with their fellows.

Of possible interst: some years ago while playing with SimEarth I
found that the "goal" (your nanotech cities lifting off from the
surface) could be done fairly quickly with massive science funding
with the unfortunate side effect of a "hellish" (the games's term)
existence for your sim-populace. In one scenario I managed to delay
this goal for several centuries while keeping my populace in the
advanced info-age, with a fairly utopian existence (i.e., 20-30
hour work weeks as opposed to 70-90 hour work weeks).

	Much agreed!  I think that the probability of an upload is much
more practical when approached as a soft incremental process.  As one
gradually replaces portions, or rather enhances portions of the brain, one
slowly begins to become more dependent on those implants (or whatever they
turn out to be) as a significant part of there individual identity.  If
you were to remove any portion, they would be "less themselves".  As
technology develops, I can see not only adding to and enhancing the brain,
but actual replacing parts with more efficiently functioning implants.
Thus becoming not only more "artificial" but less "naturally biological".
The key to replacing parts would be in the ability to do it as a slow
"growth" process, it would be very dangerous to attempt replacement of a
large portion, possibly leading to loss of a significant amount of
information and identity, but when allowed to replace small portions and
then given the time to grow accustom to it, accepting it as part of
oneself, you can bit by bit replace and augment without significant
information loss.  We must grow into the machine.

I'd like to share some of the types of activities I've been doing lately that 
are of a self-transformative / learning nature that are also quite fun.  

	One of the things I do is basically an extension of the type of activity I 
was engaged in as an infant and a small child -- testing out my bodily 
capabilities.  When I was young, I didn't really know how to use the body 
(among many other things), and I just played around, more or less chaotically, 
and some types of movements were very enjoyable (such as putting food in my 
mouth), and some were painful (such as falling down), and through that 
feedback, my neural nets favored the enjoyable types of activities and avoided 
the more painful or less enjoyable activities.  But at some point I stopped 
learning and experimenting so much because I had learned all the standard 
movements for humans in our culture, and was encouraged by the culture to not 
deviate too much from the normal types of movements.
	But for the past few years, I've been curious about my body and its 
capabilities and about developing highly advanced and enjoyable forms of 
exercise.  So, I've resumed the type of chaotic and creative experimenting 
which I was heavily engaged in in my very early years.  I will often spend a 
half hour or an hour just letting my body move itself however it feels most 
naturally inclined to move and watching myself intently, paying deep attention 
to how the movements feel, and to all my other senses.  It's been very 
interesting watching the types of movements that develop, watching them 
evolve.  Because I'm paying so much attention, the types of movements which 
feel good or are aesthetically pleasing in other ways tend to get reinforced, 
for those reasons.  
	It's a fascinating study for me in evolution and spontaneous order.  It's 
also becoming increasingly pleasurable exercise.  The only difficult part (and 
the most important part) is learning to pay really deep attention to 
everything, but the rewards from that are incredible!  My senses have become 
tremendously sharper than they ever were, and my awareness of my own thinking 
has deepened, so my thoughts are much deeper and richer and generally more 
rational and accurate.  Plus, my body control is increasing tremendously, and 
my movements in general are becoming much more graceful and efficient as I 
learn to pay more attention to my movements.

	I'm basically reprogramming my body and brain by just playing around and 
letting my aesthetic and other values guide the whole learning process.  
Playfulness is very important to me because it is basically my way of quickly 
exploring alternate and very creative ways of doing things, then subjecting 
them to the evolutionary, selective pressures in my mind and letting the best 
ideas and ways of doing things prevail.  Playfulness is my way of introducing 
novelty into the system and testing it out.  And the more I play, the more 
confident I am that my most prevailant ideas are really good ideas because 
I've given so many different ideas a fair chance to compete.  
	Of course, the more established ideas have a greater competitive advantage 
due to being established and not necessarialy to being good ideas, but I can't 
see a way around that.  But there is some consolation in the thought that the 
established ideas probably have a lot of merit to have become established in 
the first place.  Perhaps the most established ideas in my mind could be 
considered my core values and that which I identify most with, so it's 
probably a good thing that they are more difficult to change.

	Another fun and interesting activity that I enjoy is sculpting without a 
goal.  I  just take a lump of modeling clay (the kind that doesn't dry out) 
and just start playing around with it, without trying to make it look like 
anything in particular, with no final goal.  I just pay intense attention to 
how the clay looks and feels and to the ways my hands can change the shape of 
the clay.  I just watch the clay, and  think of changes I can make to improve 
what I already have, in simple ways, and then my hands make the changes, and I 
continue the process.  I have no goal in mind, just continual improvement of 
what I have.  I just play around, and it's very interesting to watch the 
shapes that come out of this process.  It's very much like the evolutionary 
art programs on computers, but I'm using my mind to think of the possible 
alterations I could make with what I have, to improve it, making those 
alterations, and then iterating the process.  
	Generally, the shapes that come out are very wierd, interesting and 
beautiful.  They are generally very suggestive of many things, but they never 
usually look like anything in particular, so the mind can't decide what it is, 
but it almost looks like... a lot of things.  The sculpture can be worked on 
for an extendend period of time, and generally any time is a good stopping 
point, and a good starting point for further modifications.  There's also a 
lot of good lessons in this activity on impermanence and non-attachment.  It 
also increases the strength and dexterity of the hands and improves hand-eye 
coordination.  Plus, I've noticed that it helps me become more clear about my 
aesthetic values, since I have to continually use them to decide what changes 
to make to the shape of the clay.  And there may be some financial rewards 
too, if one gets really good at this and can sell some of the sculptures.

I hope these activities are helpful to some of you, or at least that my ways 
of approaching certain types of things are helpful.  Also, if any of you have 
any other good mind training activities you'd like to share, I'd be very 
interested and appreciative.

I am more with the idea that possibly long ago an advanced alien
civilization happened to pass through our solar system and planted their
seed of life on our planet in the form of microbes. Much like we would do if
we had the sufficently advanced technology to accomplish the feat of
journeying to other star systems but the "life flew here on a rock" idea may
be just as well because I have a problem believing that life evolved here
due to the Earth being so highly violent during the period when life
supposedly appeared.

I strongly second Robin's suggestion for a volunteer to gather the material
and secure permissions. Actually, more than one volunteer would help. One
person should be the coordinator and main archivist, but others can help
with tracking down current addresses of past contributors to ask their
permission to publically archive their posts, and posts that quote them. For
really good posts that quote people who can't be tracked down, I suppose we
can simply cut out the quotations. This will leave some messages slightly
puzzling, but may still be worthwhile.

 I see little evidence that a significant fraction of the current rules are
intended to speed up trials or are effective at doing so.
 Complex rules are normally less just than simple rules, because those
special interests who can afford to understand complex rules will be
the only ones able to write the complex rules, whereas the average person
can choose among simple rules. I don't think it is an accident that those
who understand and influence the complex rules are also the ones to whom
power is being shifted by the rules.
 A simple rule that would be more effective at avoiding absurd delays
would be to have the loser pay the costs of the winning side and of the
court system. If that isn't enough, we could add a time limit that keeps
the trial time from exceeding a specified fraction of the prison time at
risk or the trial costs from exceeding a specified fraction of the money
at stake.

One thing I was finding is that I'm not very good at teaching or doing
other cool things for groups of people if I don't feel appreciated. When
that happens I sometimes decide to stop doing the cool thing, and of course
I'm the one for whom that is the greatest drawback. So what I try to do so
I don't run out of cool-thing receptacles is to write down the appreciation
I want for myself in a little appreciation book so I don't let that silly
thing stop me. It's a good stopgap to use until I become perfect. :>

I don't disagree.  First, note that I wrote that legal "structures" regarding
evidence are complex, not the rules themselves.  In fact, most evidence rules
themselves can be stated in fairly simple terms.  By and large, it is the
interaction of the rules with each other and with other elements of the legal
"system" that creates complex evidence "structures."

In fact, a pattern of "complexification" occurs over time in any common law
(or legislative) structure.  A simple rule is annunciated to deal with a
specific case.  Application of that rule conflicts with the application of
some other rule in another case.  A "meta-rule" (usually made with reference
to some third rule) is developed to resolve the conflict.  Contradictions in
application of the meta-rule then spawn yet further "meta-rules" in
subsequent cases.  Programmers and other system designers will recognize this
pattern.  

Eventually, once sufficient contradiction and "overcomplexification" occurs,
someone develops a whole new analytical framework that throws out much of the
previous rule-structure in favor of a new, simpler rule structure.  A good
example is the way in which the drafters of the Uniform Commercial Code threw
out the absurd complexity that had developed in the contract law of "offer
and acceptance" in favor of a completely new and simpler scheme (fresh on my
mind from a case I'm currently working on).

Of course, throwing out old legal structures in favor of new ones has a price
in terms of lost precedential authority and a lack of predictive certainty
with reference to the new rules.  Accordingly, good jurists don't take the
"new paradigm" route of simplification often or apply it to large parts of a
legal system at once.  Thus, at any one time some areas of the law will be
relatively "simple" (having had the thick undergrowth of "meta-rules"
recently cleared out) and others will be "complex" (requiring carefully
picking one's way through the vines ...).

And thus my comment about unavoidable complexity ...

Both suggestions have merit.  FYI, your first suggestion is known in the U.S.
as "the English Rule", for obvious reasons.  In fact, it does have the result
of discouraging litigation in the UK.  Many folks in the UK are trying to
change the rule because of perceived inequities for small claimants.  In the
U.S., the idea tends to be favored by "big business", since they already
often pay the winner's costs when they lose through contingency fees and the
tendency of juries to make large awards against their interests
"overcompensating" those who prevail against them, or so they say.

I've never encountered your second suggestion before.  Obviously the
correlation between trial or other "process" time and amount in controversy
would have to be other than linear.  Beyond that observation, I think it is
something well worth exploring.

A superb example of technological electronics combined with extropic
transhuman mythic visuals is exemplified in an instillation by Bill Viola
entitled _Stations_.  Because this work is a traveling exhibition, I thought
some of you might be interested in viewing it if and when it comes to your
area. So far, it has been exhibited in Paris, New York, Eindhoven, and
Stuttgart. (I'm not positive, but it might also be traveling to Madrid and
Tokyo.)

"_Stations_ is comprised of five channels of video projections, screens,
granite, and sound.  Five cloth screens are suspended from the ceiling of
the darkened gallery.  Large slabs of polished black granite are placed flat
on the floor at the bottom edge of each screen.  Individual human figures
submerged in water head downward are projected onto each screen. On the
slick surfaces of granite slabs one sees the righted reflection of the
slowly moving figures.  Underwater sounds fill the gallery space.  At random
intervals the projected figures glide slowly out of the frame, leaving the
space dark and silent. Suddenly the figures plunge back into view with
brilliant splash of sound and light, momentarily illuminating the entire
gallery."

The above-interpretation of the installation is descriptive, but it is even
more vibrant and symbolic.  While entering the gallery space, it is actually
solid black with only the slightest hint of light which gives a direction to
follow.  The underwater sound is magnificent - reverberating throughout the
space.  The five video screens are impeccably designed and are in exacting
rectangular shapes from a frontal view and from the side-view appear as very
thin lines of light (like lasers).  The floating bodies are life-size and
naked, and basically in black and white with only a hint of earth tones in
the hair of one model.  The light is very bright from the video screens, yet
the bodies float slowly and gracefully.  Every now and then a body
disappears into blackness and then reemerges with a sudden and shocking
splash - as if being suddenly woken up.

Interpretations of this intentionally poetic and meditative installation are
varied.  Some see the video-screens with suspended bodies as cryonic dewars
with suspendees.  The artist himself states, "There is no single viewing
angle to the piece, and viewers are free to enter and move about the space
at will.  An initial surface appearance of the eerie, serene beauty ...

Has anyone recently on this list explored the concepts of individual
freedoms from the perspective of individual freedom being unlimited?

I am having varied ideas concerning unlimited freedom and am in the process
of reexamining how I view my own "unlimited individual freedom". I am
beginning to think that I was incorrect in even using the phrase and that
instead of it spurring my own continual process of growth, it might be
stifling it.

How do Extropians view individual freedom and do Extropians think that
"unlimited" is an incorrect or unnecessary or redundant word to use in the
phrase.  Would "maximum" be better?

I would appreciate anyone who is interested in The Singularity (or the Wall,
the Horizon, etc.) sending me a one-liner, a phrase or short paragraph as to
what it signifies mythically or what it means to you.  Also, if anyone has a
favorite quote that you would like to share, this would be most helpful.

If your one-liner, phrase or paragraph is not a quote, then I will give
credit and compensation for your efforts.  If your contribution is a quote
from an author, I will give credit to the author as well as the person who
submits the quote.

Please send your suggestions to me privately, of if you prefer to share them
with the lists, publicly would be fine.  

Thank you in advance for your suggestions and insights.

Ah yes, Hal is truly one of the Old Ones! I believe the List started in
August of 1991.

I'd say governments are the result of a kind of SO, but they are not
examples *of* SO. Spontaneously ordering processes can produce results that
themselves are inimical to spontaneous order.

Actually, if spontaneous order is to have any meaning, we have to restrict
the processes that we characterize that way. It's not obvious to me that the
random circumstances, deliberate brutalities and dominations, false beliefs,
etc. that led to powerful governments, constitute an example of a
spontaneously ordering process. What are the principles or rules that govern
that ordering? In a market SO it's the private property rights and price
signals that make up the SO. I'm not sure what it would be in the case of
the development of governments.

Let's see those early postings Hal!

The August 17 Freeland Party can be a Extropians List 5th birthday party as
well as an Extropy magazine 8th birthday party!

Fellow transhumans of all stripes: I'm engaged in an eight-part debate with
anti-transhumanist Paulina Borsook in the BrainTennis forum on HotWired. As
most of you will know, HotWired is the online offshoot of Wired magazine and
has a sizeable audience.

I've written my 450 word opening statement, she has made her first reply,
and I've just written my second post. The debate has just gone live. You can
find it at:

     http://www.hotwired.com/braintennis

I urge you all to join in on the transhumanist side in Threads. Threads lets
readers post comments on the debate.

I want to thank several people who have edited my posts for this debate and
suggested improvements to my writing. Most of all thanks to Greg Burch, but
also to Robin Hanson, Natasha More, Anders Sandberg, Peter Voss, Tom Morrow,
Reilly Jones, Sasha Chislenko, and Eric Forste.


Upward and Outward!

Max, aren't you therefore defining 'spontaneous order' on the basis of the
Extropian desirability of both the order and the process of achieving that
order? I, like you, am not sure that the process leading to central
government is one of spontaneous order, but if it _were_, how could we then
say that the result was not spontaneous order, merely because we didn't
agree with the nature of that order, or the way it was reached? The phrase
'spontaneous order' doesn't lend itself to such value judgements.

Sarah

If the lesion area is very small and the function itself has been mapped 
extensively or can be easily learned afterwards I see no problem with 
this approach. 

Note however: current (and mid-future) semiconductor integration 
density is insufficient for the substitution of but the most puniest 
tasks the brain routinely accomplishes, heat load on tissue will be 
considerable and the microelectrodes are certainly not bioinert enough nor 
their long-term impacts known.

This might be mostly useful in repairing spinal cords lesions, imo. There 
seems to be virtually no personal differences in the spinal cord, just 
basic reflexes.

I think economic pressure will merely tend to pronounce the patients to 
be incurable... Already hitech medicine inflicts a heavy, soon likely to 
grow intolerably high financial drain upon the populace/medical insurance 
of leading industrial countries. As the age histo distribution grows 
increasingly skewed & skeweder, medical costs are bound to explode (and 
they do).

Silicon photolitho 2d circuitry is totally insuitable for brain 
augmentation emplants, both in terms of integration density (number of 
neurons substituted) and computational power (since you can't go totally 
maspar because of low physical connectivity).

This asks for 3d quantum dot arrays/molecular circuitry + advanced active 
cooling which ain't yet exactly there.

1) I doubt it will be neural nets, more likely we will see coupling of 
   brittle computer algebra packages (Mathematica, MatLab, etc.) first.
   bioNN computational prowess is pretty awesome -- we'll need some time
   to approach this order of magnitude. Complementary skills.

2) It is _not_ smooth, as additional circuitry installation is grainy -- 
   you plug in new modules

I once thought one might design a protein-based molecular circuitry, 
which induces a soft upload by "infecting" the brain, autoreplicating,
scanning neurons and substituting them for crystalline protein molecular 
circuitry to emulate the orginal neuron functionality.

Alas, apart from more trivial reasons, the integration density 
achievable with soft nanotech does not permit scanning/substituting at this 
level. If _at all_, it might be only feasible with strong nanotech 
(Drexlerian nanoassemblers), which' feasibility has not been shown 
sufficiently yet. (Though speculative technology can be fun, we ought not 
to cross over in the realm of the improbable or even mythical).

If this fine-grain incremental upload is infeasible, merely beckoning to 
the surviving set of strange attractors constituting your personality 
with virgin circuitry will depend on their evolution-shaped propensity to 
cross over into new territory. Since this never happens in real life (though 
lesion tolerance & recovery is based on semi-dormant, redundant circuitry 
taking over the part of vanquished one), it is not likely to work. 
(However, the faint possibility that it might be possible should be 
sufficient to spawn off an research task force to shed some light on this 
difficult subject).

I doubt identity has the properties of a liquid. (If it had, it would be 
extremely nice of the evolution to provide us with it without 
evolutionary fitness requiring such a useful trait).

Alas, I have grown to distrust this Proteus guy (... you never know who he'll 
be next ;). Most neuroscientists I know are highly sceptical about 
unbound malleability of cerebral circuitry. If incremental soft uploads are 
possible at all, they won't come before Singularity -- and that will be too 
late. Contrary to Vinge's headbands, I doubt we'll see much of it prior to 
Singularity, when every single rule is likely to be broken -- including 
the necessity to rely on headbands (or heads).

process. 

If you haven't read Linda Nagata's "The Bohr Maker" (Bantam Spectra, Apr'95, 
ISBN 0-553-56925-2), it's well worth reading even if you normally have 
little time for fiction. Her story (with well-developed characters & drama 
for a first-time novel) involves a near-future solar system based on 
nanotechnology, 'attrium' implants for full immersion into VR and the 
transmission of mind copies between distributed attriums. Plus, there's a 
libertarian struggle against a 'Gaian' World government that exists for the 
primary purpose of avoiding a 'gray-goo booboo' AND proscribing transhuman 
technologies.

If this story is old news, forgive my enthusiasm. The reason I make this 
posting is that I find Nagata's 'attrium' ideas to be intriguingly original 
and wonder if anything similar is published or posted on the Net somewhere. 
Here are some notes I recently took on 'Attriums' after rereading "The Bohr 
Maker":

07/04/96. ATTRIUMS & GHOSTS ENVISIONED. Linda Nagata's 1995 novel "The Bohr 
Maker" describes an artificial organ called an 'attrium' grown by nanotech 
'makers' in human brains to provide direct immersion in virtual realities, 
communications on the Net and remote sensing by linking to similarly 
augmented people, animals and mechanical sensors at distant locations.

While it may be feasible that such a device itself could eventually be built 
and implanted, a few practical interim questions are (a) how would an 
'attrium' interact with the organic human brain and nervous system; and, (b) 
how could the necessary wide-bandwidth and far-ranging communications be 
implemented, especially given the current worries about the effects on 
organic functions of ELF and more high-powered electromagnetic energies? 
(When even cellular phones are suspected of having some impact on brain 
tumors in certain genetically susceptible individuals, it seems unlikely 
that a radio transponder could be implanted in human brains without serious 
biological side effects.)

As a communication alternative, there is some speculation in the quantum 
physics community over the potential for non-local communication, i.e., once 
they have interacted, two quantum particles remain immediately correlated 
regardless of their distance from each other. Some progress in quantum 
computing based on these principles has been made. What about prospects for 
remote sensing and communications without the need for electromagnetic 
transmissions? At best, such a method of communication would be a one-shot 
deal because once the initial report from the remote sensor had been 
observed at the originating location, the quantum isolation that supported 
the non-local correlation would have been broken. Even if a large amount of 
information, from an extended period of observation, could be 'transmitted' 
before it is observed at the 'receiver', this would imply that such links 
could not be in real time - the receiver would have to wait for the end of 
the 'transmission' before observing it. Such a link would be completely 
passive and wouldn't allow two-way communication.

Perhaps it is for these reasons that Linda Nagata envisioned fully-immersive 
communication between attriums taking place only via the downloading of 
'ghosts', extracts of a person's sensibilities, memories & mind, able to 
transmit to another's attrium, reside there 'off line' from the originator's 
mind, and able to return the experiences to the originator only by 
disengaging and uploading back to the 'home address'.

07/20/96. ATTRIUM DESIGN LEVELS. While Nagata doesn't go into any of the 
following, I think there would likely be several stages in the development 
of such attriums:

A level 1 Attrium would basically be a thought & experience recorder: able 
to replay sensations and subvocalized thoughts; which also implies a 
capability to generate something like a 'hypnotic state' for controlled 
overriding of sensations from ones' immediate physical environment during 
playback.

A level 2 Attrium introduces the ability to access & experience sensations & 
thoughts transmitted by others: at first this might have to be on a download 
basis, until some real-time communication mechanism could be established; 
but, in any case, implies the ability of the Attrium to generate an 
immersive VR able to integrate host proprioceptions along with guest entity 
interactions.

A level 3 Attrium assumes real-time communication, being able to both send & 
receive sensations & thoughts between multiple Attriums; which implies 
central nervous system integration for fine motor control of Attrium 
simulations and an ability to switch fluidly between viewpoints, perhaps 
moving rapidly across an environment in one 'window' while being a 
stationary observer in another.

A level 4 Attrium assumes the ability to generate 'ghosts', that is, to 
create extracts of ones' mind, personality & proprioceptive sensibilities 
for transmission to another Attrium, as well as the ability to host such 
ghosts sent from other Attriums.

07/21/96. RESEARCH AREAS FOR THE FIRST STEP. I don't think even Level 1 
Attriums would be practical using current brain-scanning approaches 
(electrodes or MRI) and might depend on the creation of distributed clusters 
of molecular processing agents able to record brain activity from within for 
later analysis. It might be possible, for specific research subjects, to 
develop a code for certain activities that could then trigger signals that 
could be read by external devices. Key areas to be explored would include 
agents that could simultaneously monitor 'mood' from within the 
hormone-filled ventricles of the brain, along with intra-axial agents to map 
neural activity. For early studies, volunteers would probably need to keep 
detailed diaries of physical & mental activities and moods (which is an 
entire discipline in itself!) Controled experiments should focus on finding 
reliable and translatable signal patterns associated with subvocalized 
thought streams. A practical goal would be a system for handicapped people 
that provides a simulated keyboard in their minds that could be used to 
capture mentally spelled-out sentences. This could eventually lead to other 
simulated displays that a person could be taught to interpret. With the 
addition of a memory & search mechanism, such a system would provide the 
beginnings of an Attrium Notebook, a thought recorder.

I know of a few old references to some of these things as well as some newer 
references (e.g., Max More's Extropy #16 survey of research at USC); but, 
I'm mostly interested in speculations on the software side rather than the 
wetware or hardware sides.

you could bounce signals off of by heating sections of the atmosphere with a
highly focused radiowave beam. PS also meantioned the ability for
manipulating local weather (now I assume this would be by heating sections
of the atmosphere in patterns to move moisture around). This HAARP
technology is also in it's infancy so could it be possible that with a few
breakthroughs in increasing the power of the highly focused radiowave beam
that we could ultimately control global climate? Technology like this could
be used for the benefit of mankind by dissolving hurricanes before they make

Does anyone know of any studies (preferably with good methodology) analyzing
possible psychological differences between persons born the traditional way
vs. those born by Caesarian section?

Some psychoanalysts make claims about the traumatic effects of birth. I'd
like to see some evidence.

I'm also curious as to whether, if there is anything in the claims that such
early experiences affect adult psychology, the birth experience could
explain the frequent reports of a tunnel in near death experiences. The NDE
experience of travelling down a tunnel into the light suggests the
possibility of a replaying of the birth experience. One way to investigate
this would be to see if all people having such an NDE were born the typical
way. If so, we'd have a nice explanation of the basic near death experience.

I suspect that the actual explanation is more likely to be in terms of
traumatic chemical events in the brain inducing experiences common to all
cultures due to shared brain features. There are certain common patterns
experienced by everyone on psychedelics regardless of their cultural
background. One of these is a tunnel-like effect. This might be the same
effect generated in NDE's.

Anyone know of any studies in the area? The NDE is a common argument for the
possibility of life after death. I'm interested in strengthening arguments
against the NDE claim for believing in an afterlife.

[This message was passed along the internet, author unknown, and  
is of interest to the current debate about the possible origin  
and evolution of life on Mars.  If we are infringing upon  
someone's copyright, it is not our intention to do so, and we  
apologize.] 
 
ALH84001 is a martian meteorite, a coarse-grained orthopyroxene  
containing relatively large amounts of carbonate, with a  
crystallization age of 4.5 Gyr.  Carbonate globules within  
fractures in the rock are dated at 3.6 Gyr.  Fractionation of  
carbon has taken place to enhance C-13 consistent with  
terrestrial biogenic process (but other processes not excluded).   
PAHs also appear on interior fracture surfaces in excess of 1  
ppm.  They present extensive tests and discussion to show that  
they are confident that these are all indigenous to the meteorite  
and do not represent contamination.  Mass spec studies show these  
PAHs are complex not simple and suggest (to the authors) a  
biogenic source.  They then discuss TEM studies of the Fe/S  
fraction in the meteorite.  Nanometer sized magnetite and Fe- 
sulfide phases are associated with Mg-Fe-rich carbonate.  These  
observed structures and concentrations can be explained by either  
inorganic or biogenic processes.  However, they argue that the  
range of conditions (pH) for inorganic precipitation is unlikely  
to have occurred on Mars, whereas biogenic processes seem to  
offer a more natural explanation for the detailed structures  
observed, and they are apparently similar to terrestrial  
magnetofossils (remains of bacterial magnetosomes).  SEM studies  
of carbonate globules are then discussed (typically ovoid and 100  
nm across).  Origin of the ovoids and other observed textures is  
unclear, but they may be related to terrestrial microfossils, or  
they may be erosional features due to partial dissolution of the  
carbonate.  They do not believe these structures result from  
contamination.  They suggest possible microbiological activity  
for both the ovoid carbonate structures and the Fe-sulfides.  On  
the basis of a number of circumstantial arguments, they  
"interpret that the carbonate globules have a biogenic origin and  
were likely formed at low temperatures".  (The temperature of  
formation of the carbonates in this meteorite has been  
controversial)..  "It is possible that all of the described  
features can be explained by inorganic processes, but these  
explanations appear to require restricted conditions." The  
evidence consistent with life includes: (1) penetration of the  
igneous rock by fluid leading to possible organic deposits of  
minerals along veins (2) formation of the carbonate globules much  
later than the formation of the rock itself, (3) SEM and TEM  
images of the globules that resemble terrestrial biogenic  
structures, (4) magnetite and iron sulfide particles that could  
have been formed biogenically.  The authors feel that the  
cumulative effect of these points is to provide "evidence for  
primitive life on early Mars"

A NASA research team of scientists at the Johnson Space Center  
and at Stanford University has found evidence that strongly  
suggests primitive life may have existed on Mars more than 3.6  
billion years ago.  The NASA-funded team found the first organic  
molecules thought to be of Martian origin; several mineral  
features characteristic of biological activity; and possible  
microscopic fossils of primitive, bacteria-like organisms inside  
of an ancient Martian rock that fell to Earth as a meteorite.  
This array of indirect evidence of past life will be reported in  
the Aug. 16 issue of the journal Science, presenting the  
investigation to the scientific community at large to reach a  
future consensus that will either confirm or deny the team's  
conclusion. 
 
Below is the photographic evidence for this discovery. 
 
 
S96-12301 (JPG; TIF) - In the center of this electron microscope  
image of a small chip from a meteorite are several tiny  
structures that are possible microscopic fossils of primitive,  
bacteria-like organisms that may have lived on Mars more than 3.6  
billion years ago. A two-year investigation by a NASA research  
team found organic molecules, mineral features characteristic of  
biological activity and possible microscopic fossils such as  
these inside of an ancient Martian rock that fell to Earth as a  
meteorite. The largest possible fossils are less than 1/100th the  
diameter of a human hair in size while most are ten times  
smaller. 
 
S96-12299 (JPG; TIF) - This electron microscope image is a close- 
up of the center part of photo number S96-12301. While the exact  
nature of these tube-like structures is not known, one  
interpretation is that they may be microscopic fossils of  
primitive, bacteria-like organisms that may have lived on Mars  
more than 3.6 billion years ago.  A two-year investigation by a  
NASA research team found organic molecules, mineral features  
characteristic of biological activity and possible microscopic  
fossils such as these inside of an ancient Martian rock that fell  
to Earth as a meteorite. The largest possible fossils are less  
than 1/100th the diameter of a human hair in size while most are  
ten times smaller. 
 
S96-12298 (JPG; TIF) - This electron microscope image shows  
extremely tiny tubular structures that are possible microscopic  
fossils of bacteria-like organisms that may have lived on Mars  
more than 3.6 billion years ago. A two-year investigation by a  
NASA research team found organic molecules, mineral features  
characteristic of biological activity and possible microscopic  
fossils such as these inside of an ancient Martian rock that fell  
to Earth as a meteorite.  The largest possible fossils are less  
than 1/100th the diameter of a human hair in size while most are  
ten times smaller. The fossil-like structures were found in  
carbonate minerals formed along pre-existing fractures in the  
meteorite in a fashion similar to the way fossils occur in  
limestone on Earth, although on a microscopic scale. 
 
S96-12297 (JPG; TIF) - This electron microscope image shows egg- 
shaped structures, some of which may be possible microscopic  
fossils of Martian origin as discussed by NASA research published  
in the Aug. 16, 1996, issue of the journal Science. A two-year  
investigation found organic molecules, mineral features  
characteristic of biological activity and possible microscopic  
fossils such as these inside of an ancient Martian rock that fell  
to Earth as a meteorite.  The largest possible fossils are less  
than 1/100th the diameter of a human hair in size while most are  
ten times smaller. 
 
S96-12300 (JPG; TIF) - This electron microscope image shows  
tubular structures of likely Martian origin. These structures are  
very similar in size and shape to extremely tiny microfossils  
found in some Earth rocks. This photograph is part of a report by  
a NASA research team published in the Aug. 16, 1996, issue of the  
journal Science. A two-year investigation by the team found  
organic molecules, mineral features characteristic of biological  
activity and possible microscopic fossils such as these inside of  
an ancient Martian rock that fell to Earth as a meteorite. The  
largest possible fossils are less than 1/100th the diameter of a  
human hair in size while most are ten times smaller. 
 
S96-12609 (JPG; TIF) & S96-12610 (JPG; TIF) - This 
high-resolution scanning electron microscope image shows an  
unusual tube-like structural form that is less than 1/100th the  
width of a human hair in size found in meteorite ALH84001, a  
meteorite believed to be of Martian origin. Although this  
structure is not part of the research published in the Aug. 16  
issue of the journal Science, it is located in a similar  
carbonate glob in the meteorite. This structure will be the  
subject of future investigations that could confirm whether or  
not it is fossil evidence of primitive life on Mars 3.6 billion  
years ago. 
 
S94-032549 (JPG; TIF) - This 4.5 billion-year-old rock, labeled  
meteorite ALH84001, is believed to have once been a part of Mars  
and to contain fossil evidence that primitive life may have  
existed on Mars more than 3.6 billion years ago. The rock is a  
portion of a meteorite that was dislodged from Mars by a huge  
impact about 16 million years ago and that fell to Earth in  
Antarctica 13,000 years ago. The meteorite was found in Allan  
Hills ice field, Antarctica, by an annual expedition of the  
National Science Foundation's Antarctic Meteorite Program in  
1984. It is preserved for study at the Johnson Space Center's  
Meteorite Processing Laboratory in Houston. 
 
S95-00690 (JPG; TIF) - This photograph shows orange-colored  
carbonate mineral globules found in a meteorite, called ALH84001,  
believed to have once been a part of Mars. These carbonate  
minerals in the meteorite are believed to have been formed on  
Mars more than 3.6 billion years ago. Their structure and  
chemistry suggest that they may have been formed with the  
assistance of primitive, bacteria-like living organisms. A two- 
year investigation by a NASA research team found organic  
molecules, mineral features characteristic of biological activity  
and possible microscopic fossils inside of carbonate minerals  
such as these in the meteorite.

SIGNS OF PAST LIFE ON MARS?  ORGANIC COMPOUNDS AND POSSIBLE  
BIOLOGICAL FEATURES FOUND IN MARTIAN METEORITE 
(Featured in 16 August 1996 Science) 
American Association for the Advancement of Science News Release 
 
 
Ever since scientists learned that water once flowed on Mars,  
they've wondered whether life might also have flourished on the  
apparently now-dead planet.  In the 16 August issue of Science,  
McKay et al report the first identification of organic compounds  
in a Martian meteorite.  The authors further suggest that these  
compounds, in conjunction with a number of other mineralogical  
features observed in the rock, may be evidence of ancient Martian  
microorganisms.  The paper's authors are David S. McKay and  
Everett K. Gibson, Jr., of NASA's Johnson Space Center in  
Houston, TX; Kathie L. Thomas-Keprta of Lockheed Martin in  
Houston, TX; Hojatollah Vali of McGill University in Montreal,  
Quebec; Christopher S. Romanek of the University of Georgia's  
Savannah River Ecology Laboratory in Aiken, SC; and Simon J.  
Clemett, Xavier D. F. Chllier, Claude R. Maechlin, and Richard N.  
Zare of Stanford University in Stanford, CA. 
 
Organic (complex, carbon-based) molecules are the requisite  
building blocks of life on Earth.  The authors looked for signs  
of such molecules and other mineralogical and textural  
indications of past life within the pore space and fractures of  
meteorite Allan Hills 84001 (ALH84001), one of only 12 meteorites  
identified as having come from Mars.  ALH84001 is the oldest of  
the Martian dozen, having crystallized from molten rock about 4.5  
billion years ago, early in the planet's evolution, and it is the  
only Martian meteorite to contain significant carbonate minerals.   
(The carbonates formed sometime after the rock, perhaps about 3.6  
billion years ago.) 
 
About 15 million years ago, a major asteroid impact on Mars threw  
ALH84001 into space, where it eventually fell onto an ice field  
in Antarctica about 13,000 years ago.  ALH84001, which shows  
little evidence of terrestrial weathering, was discovered by  
meteorite-hunting scientists in 1984 and only recently identified  
at Martian.  ALH84001 is riven with tiny fractures resulting  
primarily from impacts that occurred while the rock was on Mars.  
The secondary carbonates formed along with some of these  
fractures.  The Science authors prepared thin sample sections  
that included these pre-existing fractures, and found on their  
surfaces a clear and distinct distribution of polycyclic aromatic  
hydrocarbons (PAHs), organic molecules containing multiple  
connected rings of carbon atoms--the first organic molecules ever  
seen in a Martian rock.  A variety of contamination checks and  
control experiments indicated that the organic material was  
indigenous to the rock and was not the result of terrestrial  
contamination.  For example, the authors noted that the  
concentration of PAHs increases inward, whereas terrestrial  
contamination likely would have resulted in more PAHs on the  
exterior of the rock. 
 
The big question is:  where did the PAHs come from?  It is  
thought that PAHs can form one of two ways:  non-biologically,  
during early star formation; or biologically, through the  
activity of bacteria or other living organisms, or their  
degradation (fossilization).  On Earth, PAHs are abundant as  
fossil molecules in ancient sedimentary rocks, coal and  
petroleum, the result of chemical changes that occurred to the  
remains of dead marine plankton and early plant life.  They also  
occur during partial combustion, such as when a candle burns or  
food is grilled. 
 
To address the origin of these PAHs, the authors examined the  
chemistry, mineralogy, and texture of carbonates associated with  
PAHs in the Martian meteorite.  Under the transmission electron  
microscope, the carbonate globules were seen to contain fine- 
grained magnetite and iron-sulfide particles.  From these and  
other analyses, the authors developed a list of observations  
about the carbonates and PAHs that, taken individually, could be  
explained by non-biological means.  However, as they write in  
their Science article, "when considered collectively ... we  
conclude that [these phenomena] are evidence for primitive life  
on early Mars."  Some of their observations are as follows: 
 
* The higher concentrations of PAHs were found associated with  
the carbonates. 
 
* The carbonates formed within the rock fissures, about 3.6  
billion years ago, and are younger than the rock itself. 
 
* The magnetite and iron-sulfide particles inside the carbonate  
globules are chemically, structurally and morphologically similar  
to magnetosome particles produced by bacteria on Earth. 
 
* High-resolution scanning electron microscopy revealed on the  
surface of the carbonates small (100 nanometers) ovoids and  
elongated features.  Similar textures have been found on the  
surface of calcite concretions grown from Pleistocene groundwater  
in southern Italy, which have been interpreted as representing  
nanobacteria. 
 
* Some earlier reports had suggested that the temperature at  
which the ALH84001 carbonates formed was as high as 700 degrees  
C--much too hot for any kind of life. However, the isotopic  
composition of the carbonates, and the new data on the magnetite  
and iron-sulfide particles, imply a temperature range of 0 to 80  
degrees C, cool enough for life. 
 
* The magnetite--a mineral that contains some ferric (Fe3+) iron,  
perhaps indicating formation by oxidation (the addition of  
oxygen)--and iron sulfide--a mineral that can be formed by  
reduction (the loss of oxygen)--were found in close proximity in  
the Martian meteorite.  On Earth, closely associated  
mineralogical features involving both oxidation and reduction are  
characteristic of biological activity.

METEORITE YIELDS EVIDENCE OF PRIMITIVE LIFE ON EARLY MARS 
NASA release 96-160 
 
A NASA research team of scientists at the Johnson Space Center  
(JSC), Houston, TX, and at Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA,  
has found evidence that strongly suggests primitive life may have  
existed on Mars more than 3.6 billion years ago.  The NASA-funded  
team found the first organic molecules thought to be of Martian  
origin; several mineral features characteristic of biological  
activity; and possible microscopic fossils of primitive,  
bacteria-like organisms inside of an ancient Martian rock that  
fell to Earth as a meteorite.  This array of indirect evidence of  
past life will be reported in the August 16 issue of the journal  
Science, presenting the investigation to the scientific community  
at large for further study.  The two-year investigation was co- 
led by JSC planetary scientists Dr. David McKay, Dr. Everett  
Gibson and Kathie Thomas-Keprta of Lockheed-Martin, with the  
major collaboration of a Stanford team headed by Professor of  
Chemistry Dr. Richard Zare, as well as six other NASA and  
university research partners. 
 
"There is not any one finding that leads us to believe that this  
is evidence of past life on Mars.  Rather, it is a combination of  
many things that we have found," McKay said.  "They include  
Stanford's detection of an apparently unique pattern of organic  
molecules, carbon compounds that are the basis of life.  We also  
found several unusual mineral phases that are known products of  
primitive microscopic organisms on Earth.  Structures that could  
be microscopic fossils seem to support all of this.  The  
relationship of all of these things in terms of location--within  
a few hundred thousandths of an inch of one another--is the most  
compelling evidence." 
 
"It is very difficult to prove life existed 3.6 billion years ago  
on Earth, let alone on Mars," Zare said.  "The existing standard  
of proof, which we think we have met, includes having an  
accurately dated sample that contains native microfossils,  
mineralogical features characteristic of life, and evidence of  
complex organic chemistry." 
 
"For two years, we have applied state-of-the-art technology to  
perform these analyses, and we believe we have found quite  
reasonable evidence of past life on Mars," Gibson added.  "We  
don't claim that we have conclusively proven it.  We are putting  
this evidence out to the scientific community for other  
investigators to verify, enhance, attack--disprove if they can --  
as part of the scientific process.  Then, within a year or two,  
we hope to resolve the question one way or the other." 
 
"What we have found to be the most reasonable interpretation is  
of such radical nature that it will only be accepted or rejected  
after other groups either confirm our findings or overturn them,"  
McKay added. 
 
The igneous rock in the 4.2-pound, potato-sized meteorite has  
been age-dated to about 4.5 billion years, the period when the  
planet Mars formed.  The rock is believed to have originated  
underneath the Martian surface and to have been extensively  
fractured by impacts as meteorites bombarded the planets in the  
early inner solar system.  Between 3.6 billion and 4 billion  
years ago, a time when it is generally thought that the planet  
was warmer and wetter, water is believed to have penetrated  
fractures in the subsurface rock, possibly forming an underground  
water system. 
 
Since the water was saturated with carbon dioxide from the  
Martian atmosphere, carbonate minerals were deposited in the  
fractures.  The team's findings indicate living organisms also  
may have assisted in the formation of the carbonate, and some  
remains of the microscopic organisms may have become fossilized,  
in a fashion similar to the formation of fossils in limestone on  
Earth.  Then, 16 million years ago, a huge comet or asteroid  
struck Mars, ejecting a piece of the rock from its subsurface  
location with enough force to escape the planet.  For millions of  
years, the chunk of rock floated through space.  It encountered  
Earth's atmosphere 13,000 years ago and fell in Antarctica as a  
meteorite. 
 
It is in the tiny globs of carbonate that the researchers found a  
number of features that can be interpreted as suggesting past  
life.  Stanford researchers found easily detectable amounts of  
organic molecules called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)  
concentrated in the vicinity of the carbonate.  Researchers at  
JSC found mineral compounds commonly associated with microscopic  
organisms and the possible microscopic fossil structures. 
 
The largest of the possible fossils are less than 1/100 the  
diameter of a human hair, and most are about 1/1000 the diameter  
of a human hair--small enough that it would take about a thousand  
laid end-to-end to span the dot at the end of this sentence.   
Some are egg-shaped while others are tubular.  In appearance and  
size, the structures are strikingly similar to microscopic  
fossils of the tiniest bacteria found on Earth. 
 
The meteorite, called ALH84001, was found in 1984 in Allan Hills  
ice field, Antarctica, by an annual expedition of the National  
Science Foundation's Antarctic Meteorite Program.  It was  
preserved for study in JSC's Meteorite Processing Laboratory and  
its possible Martian origin was not recognized until 1993.  It is  
one of only 12 meteorites identified so far that match the unique  
Martian chemistry measured by the Viking spacecraft that landed  
on Mars in 1976.  ALH84001 is by far the oldest of the 12 Martian  
meteorites, more than three times as old as any other. 
 
Many of the team's findings were made possible only because of  
very recent technological advances in high- resolution scanning  
electron microscopy and laser mass spectrometry.  Only a few  
years ago, many of the features that they report were  
undetectable.  Although past studies of this meteorite and others  
of Martian origin failed to detect evidence of past life, they  
were generally performed using lower levels of magnification,  
without the benefit of the technology used in this research.  The  
recent discovery of extremely small bacteria on Earth, called  
nanobacteria, prompted the team to perform this work at a much  
finer scale than past efforts. 
 
The nine authors of the Science report include McKay, Gibson and  
Thomas-Keprta of JSC; Christopher Romanek, formerly a National  
Research Council post-doctoral fellow at JSC who is now a staff  
scientist at the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory at the  
University of Georgia; Hojatollah Vali, a National Research  
Council post-doctoral fellow at JSC and a staff scientist at  
McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; and Zare, graduate  
students Simon J. Clemett and Claude R. Maechling and post- 
doctoral student Xavier Chillier of the Stanford University  
Department of Chemistry. 
 
The team of researchers includes a wide variety of expertise,  
including microbiology, mineralogy, analytical techniques,  
geochemistry and organic chemistry, and the analysis crossed all  
of these disciplines.  Further details on the findings presented  
in the Science article include: 
 
* Researchers at Stanford University used a dual laser mass  
spectrometer--the most sensitive instrument of its type in the  
world--to look for the presence of the common family of organic  
molecules called PAHs.  When microorganisms die, the complex  
organic molecules that they contain frequently degrade into PAHs.   
PAHs are often associated with ancient sedimentary rocks, coals  
and petroleum on Earth and can be common air pollutants.  Not  
only did the scientists find PAHs in easily detectable amounts in  
ALH84001, but they found that these molecules were concentrated  
in the vicinity of the carbonate globules.  This finding appears  
consistent with the proposition that they are a result of the  
fossilization process.  In addition, the unique composition of  
the meteorite's PAHs is consistent with what the scientists  
expect from the fossilization of very primitive microorganisms.   
On Earth, PAHs virtually always occur in thousands of forms, but,  
in the meteorite, they are dominated by only about a half-dozen  
different compounds.  The simplicity of this mixture, combined  
with the lack of light-weight PAHs like naphthalene, also differs  
substantially from that of PAHs previously measured in non- 
Martian meteorites. 
 
* The team found unusual compounds--iron sulfides and magnetite-- 
that can be produced by anaerobic bacteria and other microscopic  
organisms on Earth.  The compounds were found in locations  
directly associated with the fossil-like structures and carbonate  
globules in the meteorite.  Extreme conditions--conditions very  
unlikely to have been encountered by the meteorite--would have  
been required to produce these compounds in close proximity to  
one another if life were not involved.  The carbonate also  
contained tiny grains of magnetite that are almost identical to  
magnetic fossil remnants often left by certain bacteria found on  
Earth.  Other minerals commonly associated with biological  
activity on Earth were found in the carbonate as well. 
 
* The formation of the carbonate or fossils by living organisms  
while the meteorite was in the Antarctic was deemed unlikely for  
several reasons.  The carbonate was age dated using a parent- 
daughter isotope method and found to be 3.6 billion years old,  
and the organic molecules were first detected well within the  
ancient carbonate.  In addition, the team analyzed representative  
samples of other meteorites from Antarctica and found no evidence  
of fossil-like structures, organic molecules or possible  
biologically produced compounds and minerals similar to those in  
the ALH84001 meteorite.  The composition and location of PAHs  
organic molecules found in the meteorite also appeared to confirm  
that the possible evidence of life was extraterrestrial.  No PAHs  
were found in the meteorite's exterior crust, but the  
concentration of PAHs increased in the meteorite's interior to  
levels higher than ever found in Antarctica.  Higher  
concentrations of PAHs would have likely been found on the  
exterior of the meteorite, decreasing toward the interior, if the  
organic molecules are the result of contamination of the  
meteorite on Earth.

Sarah: You raise a good point. However -- no, I am not defining S.O. on the
basis of its desirability from an extropic point of view. Extropians tend to
like the idea of S.O. because they are so valuable in social coordination.
This does not mean that all S.O.'s are to be judged good from an extropic
point of view. Their desirability is not part of their definition or
conditions for being distinguished from centrally-realized orders.

If you read my "Order Without Orderers" in Extropy #7 (I should add it to my
Web site soon) you'll see that I do grant a major place for non-spontaneous
orders. Both kinds have their place (corporate structures have major
elements of planned order for example). S.O.s are especially valuable when
it comes to economies and societies as a whole. S.O.'s can contain within
themselves valuable planned orders. Precisely in which situations one kind
of order is preferable to another -- or what mix of each on any level is
desirable -- is a fascinating question.

Although I don't know of of any scientific studies on birth memories and near 
death experiences such as Max requested, I do have some personal experience with 
this.

As a child in the 1950's, I was given ether as an anesthetic twice.  Once for a 
tonsillectomy and once for a minor ear surgery.  Each time as the anesthetic was 
started, I had the experience of being propelled down a tunnel.  

For the next few years, I was puzzled by this bizarre experience but never 
attached any explanation to it (although I was raised in a rather traditional 
midwestern religious family).  After thinking about the experience several years 
later, I realized this was a birth memory and became curious why it was 
triggered under those conditions.

Thinking it might be the ether, I asked my mother if she was given ether when I 
was born.  She told me that the nurse-anesthesiologist showed up late in the 
delivery room and she wasn't given any anesthetic or pain-killer at all. (I 
suspect that babies born to mothers who are sufficiently drugged would not have 
a birth memory.)

I suspect that what triggered the memory was the combination of the operating 
room environment and the feeling of being suffocated.  Both ether and the first 
movements down the birth canal result in intense feelings of suffocation that 
induce strong feelings of panic.

Descriptions of near death experiences that I have heard all are almost 
identical to my birth memory in every respect except their interpretation.  
Those I have encountered who interpret the experience as something 
other-worldly, emphatically reject the idea of a birth memory.  Most people who 
interpreted the experience as a conventional Near Death Experience have a 
wistful longing for their own deaths.  On the other hand, by the time I was 
twenty, I had rejected my religious upbringing and become passionately 
interested in life extension.

I don't know about other countries, but I know that in the United States,
over 50% of dollars paid to the medical industry are paid by the Federal
government. I suspect this (and certain inefficient regulations) has a
great deal to do with escalating costs.

Techniques for manufacturing new designs of computing hardware that can
instantiate neural and fuzzy computational processes are developing *much*
more rapidly than our understanding of the brain. I expect that by the time
we develop a theoretical understanding of the nonlinear computational
processes evolved within large unsupervised feedback nets, the hardware
basis for cognitive prostheses will likely be in place.

Or perhaps a more rhetorically effective way to put that: I don't see much
reason to think that cognitive science (which is currently stuck in a
technologically fruitful zone which has very little to do with developing a
theoretical understanding of the way the human brain actually computes)
will *overtake* the engineering of fully-parallel computing hardware, which
is currently rocketing along at a merry pace.

And we're going to need both these pieces of the puzzle in place before we
can start doing serious work on soft incremental uploads.

But I suspect we'll need an understanding of the computational processes in
the brain before we can start hooking any *new* functionality into it, and
once we have that understanding, we'll probably use it to build some of the
new functionality. Granted that this understanding is nowhere in sight at
the moment.

Strange. Your parenthesis, which I fully agree with, seems to completely
contradict your main statement. I don't understand why you don't think that
"semi-dormant, redundant" silicon circuitry could not similarly be
automatically brought into play by the brain as its original tissues fail.
Of course we don't yet understand the processes by which the brain replaces
damaged tissues by bringing new synapses and neurons into play, retraining
them to do the lost functionality, but we certainly do know that it
happens. That sounds like an existence proof to me.

I doubt that identity has any properties at all that we can firmly identify
at this point. So I counter by saying that I doubt that identity has the
properties of a solid, either. Some facts of the universe are just facts of
the universe, and one of them is that computational processes in a neural
network are generally distributed throughout the whole network, and that
neural networks, as they learn, build computational structures within
whatever hardware they're connected to in the right way. Evolution just
happened to hit upon the trick of neural networks as a solution for
computational problems faced by animals. That solution may have plenty of
properties that aren't selected for, if those properties are inseparable
from the properties that *are* selected for (like being able to make fast
learned nonlinear transformations of complex time-varying stimuli into
complex time-varying motor activity, and learning those transformations
without supervision).

Cognitive science is a highly interdisciplinary field, and most
psychologists I know who understand anything about computation are firmly
convinced of the plasticity of mind. I said nothing about "unbound". It's
important to distinguish between computational processes and the
instantiating hardware, even though this is devilishly difficult to do in
the case of the human brain, just as it is with the genetic apparatus.

I don't understand this kind of thinking at all. Clearly, whatever
technologies we seek to rely on to get what we want are going to have to
evolve gradually. They are not going to magically appear out of an unfunded
void. There are strong incentives for the development of cognitive
prostheses; on the other hand, there's practically *no* economic pressure
for the development of "hard, sudden uploads"... in fact, I can't see any
pressure for this at all outside of the cryonics community. But of course I
want to see research move forward on every front, and I certainly *do* want
to see those patients in suspension restored to health.

Neurons do not divide in adult animals, but it is possible to create
undifferentiated dividing neuroblasts, and I have seen references to a
kind of thermo-sensitive immortalized neuroblasts in mice that begin to
differentiate when placed inside the body, possibly helping to heal brain
damage. I'm a bit nervous about placing such cells in my head, since they
still have the potential to develop into neuromas, but I think this can be
fixed. 

The question is if this is an useful intelligence amplification method. 
The number of neurons in a brain doesn't correlate to its intelligence, 
it is the way that they are linked together that is important. Just 
adding neurons might help replace the degenerative effects of age, but I 
doubt it would lead to a drastic increase in intelligence. Still, it 
might be interesting to see how learning is affected if neurons are added 
to (say) the association cortex. 

Personally I think the best use of add-on neurons would be brain-computer
interfaces: the interface consists of specially bred neurons that grow
axons and dendrites from cell bodies on a silicon sensor, possibly guided
by neurotropic chemicals so that they reach the right parts of the brain. 
This could even be made self-repairing and self-extending if there were a 
way to grow new interface neurons if needed.

I also recommend the book, I have no doubt many extropians will enjoy it. 
By the way, it is "atrium", not "attrium" (probably from the open room at

It is a bit more subtle than that. I think the Commonwealth represents
just the kind of state (or in this case, international organization) that
extropians fear and want to fight again (guess why the book is so fun
reading then). But it isn't naive - there is a real fear, and a real
danger, so public opinion generally supports it (_Tech heaven_ give some
hints of its beginnings). All transhuman technologies are not proscribed, 
just the too drastic (independent AI, uncontrolled assemblers, multiple 
physical copies of the same person).

As I see it, Nagata's idea is that the atrium itself is a nanocomputer 
network that send out interface threads to neurons in the owner's brain. 
For example, it might be located above the cortical surface, sending down 
bundles of nanofibres into the sensory and motoric pathways so that it 
can override/augment the outside signal (this could be done by inhibiting 
the primary sensory imput and sending in new input; a quite fun 
neuroelectronic problem). With nanotechnology this is probably quite 
simple, the hard part is making sense of the signals (in the I/O parts of 
the brain there is probably less variation than the cognitive systems). 

Creating ghosts seem to imply that the nanofibers can read *all* of the 
brain, and transmit the uploaded pattern. This is much harder and less 
likely.

What about a body area network a la those under development at MIT? 
Signals could also be sent to a transponder (or several) outside the head 
area, and medical nanites could keep the surrounding tissues healthy. 
Although I would probably opt for a infrared system, which interacted 
with the surrounding local networks (but in _The Bohr Maker_ the system 
seems to be able to function by radio).

Quantum entanglement isn't useful as an information carrier (I think this
has been proven quite rigorously), but it is useful in cryptography and
quantum computation. If I have one of a pair of correlated particles and
you the other, any change I do to the particle will destroy the
correlation and does not cause any detectable change to your particle (it
is the initial states that are correlated).

This seems to be reasonable over interplanetary distances too (even on 
the same planet; the delays become comparable to neural delays on a scale 
of just thousands of kilometers). 

Interesting idea: "squatter ghosts" and other infomorphs that move 
between the atria of people, using the empty buffer space used to 
receiving ghosts.

Sounds almost like an enchanced reality version of the current prototype 
wearable computers, with an useful user interface.

Just a small correction: the hormones in the ventricles are rather bad
predictors of mood (especially since most hormones are released into the
blood) - I suggest that you look at the activity in the limbic system
instead.

There have been some success in interpreting arm movements in monkeys due 
to cortical activity patterns (Schwartz et al, see SciAm a few months 
back), so this may be feasible.

Well, there are some reasons for even a solid state-civilization to 
expand. Computing resources will always be limited, and judging from how 
we fill up disk space and reproduce I have no doubt that there will be a 
demand for more nanoprocessors and energy. And living on a single planet 
is dangerous - a large asteroid impact is just as deadly for an upload 
civilization as for our.

This is possible, but very dangerous. It seems likely that transcendence 
will involve potentially devastating technologies and runaway processes - 
it is a good idea to spread the risks (frankly, I'm not going to stay 
around when God's Lightening get their hands on assemblers).

:-) It might even occur several times, as the conservatives transcend in 
a second singularity, leaving the arch-conservatives, until we get a 
mixture of idiots, conservatives and religious fanatics. Maybe the UFO's 
are interstellar Jehova's Witnesses knocking on our door? :-)

Possibly. But there is a larger problem: we learn about methods to cure 
rarer and rarer conditions. These cures are expensive, and since the 
conditions are rare, their prices will not sink as fast as for cures 
against (say) acne. I'm not 100% sure if this leads to a total increase 
in cost, but it definitely seems so. Add to this other reasons for 
increasing medical costs, and we have a nasty problem. 

In _Tech Heaven_, Nagata mentions a move where some medical therapies are
deemed too expensive to subsidy, and hence become unavailable to most
people - in the name of giving at least everybody a chance to get *some*
decent medical help. 

To get around this costs have to be lowered: either by drastic 
improvements of technology (unlikely to work on these short spans) or 
changes in the way medicine is financed. Interesting material for an 
independent thread.

Let's see now: Moore's Law: processor power doubles every 18 months. 
Medical knowledge doubles every 5 years. Yes, you seem to be right. 
(although knowledge about the brain grows faster than most areas, thanks 
to recent insights).

If we can create some way to interface at all, we can start hook in 
functionality. The interface will just be very messy and non-intuitive, 
unless we can hook up signals to the normal I/O systems (sight, hearing, 
touch) to run our brittle packages (I *want* matlab in my head - I'm 
falling in love with this old, crusty and powerful package right now).

There are some speculation that the attractors replicate as a part of 
mental functioning. In this case adding more "cortex" would give us a 
larger mental space. Let's hope its true! :-)

I think most of the brain is rather static in circuitry, but its meaning 
can be very quickly redefined (remember the experiments with glasses 
turning everything upside down - after a while vision worked as normal). 
My guess is that parts of the cortex are undefined from the beginning, 
and later used in various systems that emerge.

I think the simple explanation for your experience, at least with this

          I recommend every transhumanist to read Robin Hansons short 
          document at http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/greatfilter.html. 
          It gives a clear presentation of an argument that should be 
          taken very seriously.
          
          (First a minor comment:
          >But if single-cell life started in some distant molecular
          >cloud and spread here via a wider panspermia, then that 
          >does help, in proportion to the

          >can be pretty low and still be consistent with that data.
          
          But on the other hand, if the distance were very great, then 
          it would be unlikely that the "molecular cloud" would not 
          have infected many other planets in its surroundings, some 
          of which would have evolved life that expanded into the 
          universe and which we should have discovered. Wouldn't it be 
          more reassuring if Earth and Mars had been infected by a 
          _local_ panspermia (from another planet in our solar system, 
          or from a nearby solar system)?)
          
          If life developed independently on Earth and on Mars, what 
          could block the conclusion that our far future is probably 
          doomed? I can see only three potential answers:
          
          1. As you suggest, there could be a great filter at some 
          later stage in the evolution of high intelligence.
          2. Higher life forms continue to prosper but do not cause an 
          "explosion" into cosmos. (I think that Michael Wiik favoured 
          this alternative.)
          3. Higher life forms do explode into cosmos, but in ways 
          that are invisible to us. This would presumably mean that 
          they do not engage in galactic scale constructions, and that 
          they are not interested in contacting human level life.
          
          As for (1), it is dubious that such a filter would be 
          sufficiently effective to bring down the probability from 
          the value we would give it knowing that life evolved 
          independently on two planets in our solar system (say p=2/9) 
          down to the value that is equal the inverse of the number of 
          planets less than a few million light years away from us. 
          However, our present biological knowledge is not sufficient 
          to settle this issue, so it leaves some room for hope.
          
          Alternative (2) might be more likely. Why should any 
          intelligent being explore the details of cold and monotonous 
          space if they can live in a much richer VR? And why should 
          they care about reality at all, whether real reality or 
          virtual reality, if they can achieve satisfaction from drugs 
          and electrical stimulation? If this is the case, they might 
          deem that no or only relatively minor space missions are 
          sufficient. I don't know of any conclusive psychological, 
          cybernetic or political arguments that this will that it 
          won't happen. Also there is the possibility that the 
          relevant technologies for extensive space colonisation 
          simply aren't feasible.
          
          Alternative (3) does not seem extremely improbable either. 
          Humanoid civilisations might not be at all interesting to 
          posthumans. And it is hard to tell what sort of 
          manipulations of the universe a posthuman culture would find 
          suitable. Also, there could perhaps be ethical/strategic 
          reasons for not interfering to much with the natural order 
          in cosmos.
          
          It should be noted that only alternative (1) is compatible 
          with typical transhumanist accounts of the far future of 
          mankind.
          
          Then, of course, there is the other possibility: that 
          intelligent life almost always put an end to its own 
          existence once it has reached a certain level of 
          sophistication. It would be interesting to list the ways in 
          which this could happen.
          
          
          I don't know whether it would be significant, but mankind 
          has been sending out signals into space for some time now. 
          Even if humanoid life tended to annihilate itself 50 or 100 
          years after it began to search for extraterrestrial life, 
          there would still be a chance that the civilisations on two 
          planets could overlap so that one would find out about the 
          other. If we have been signalling into space for some time 
          t, and the average time a species is actively searching for 
          life in the universe is T, then the probability that we 
          should have had an overlap with a given hi-tech life on a 
          planet would be P(overlap)=(t+T)/5*10^9, where we have 
          estimated the period in which such life is likely to occur 
          to 5*10^9. If we multiply this with the number of planets n 
          such that we would have discovered a signal from them had it 
          been sent, and with r, the average number of times hi-tech 
          life occurs on a planet given that it occurs there at all, 
          and with the likelihood P(hi-tech evolves) that high-tech 
          life evolves on a given planet, we get an estimate of the a 
          priori probability that we should have discovered 
          extraterrestrial life
          
          P(high-tech found)=P(hi-tech evolves)*n*r*(t+T)/5*10^9
          
          r is presumably a small number (say 1.8), but if n were very 
          great, then, since we have reason to believe that P(high 
          tech found) is not much bigger that 0.5, we would have to 
          conclude that P(hi-tech evolves) is small. If this were the 
          case, then that would be reassuring, for it would indicate 
          that hi-tech life is rare, so that the fact that we have not 
          seen traces of any life explosion need not mean that there 
          has to be a great filter. However, I doubt that n is great 
          enough today. Does anybody know the relevant facts about the 
          search for extraterrestrial life to make a reasonable 
          estimate of n?

                    HEAD FOR THE HILLS: 

                  BIG BROTHER SOON TO HAVE 

                  X - R A Y   V I S I O N

by Ian Williams Goddard

Joyce Price of The Washington Times (A1, 8/13/96) reports that
the government will soon have a new weapon in its war on liberty
-- a camera that can see through clothes to reveal all the 
private goodies concealed therein. 

Someday soon there will be no place to run, no place to hide, 
no place outside the all-seeing eye of the State. It's going 
to be so safe and wonderful then -- NOT !

Ms. Price writes in the Times:

        "A new weapon against terrorism works like 
        Superman's eyes: It looks right through you. 
        The high-tech camera, know as the passive 
        millimeter wave imager, boasts the equivalent 
        of X-ray vision, which allows it to penetrate 
        clothing to 'see' a concealed weapon, plastic 
        explosives, or drugs."

The "Millivison" camera is not an X-ray machine. An X-ray 
machine creates an X-ray image by sending X-rays through a 
person's body. This device on the other hand is passive, it 
merely receives and reads the natural radiations from your 
body; radiations that are in "a different part of the 
spectrum" than X-rays. 

Sufficiently solid items, such as a gun, a bag of crack or 
candy, block these radiations revealing the silhouetted shape 
of that item to the camera's, and in turn to the govt's, eye. 

The 'National Institute of Justice' funded the research and 
development of this new tool for tyranny under the pretext 
of stopping terrorism. The new wave of terrorism that has 
hit the U.S. is doing wonders for the growth of govt power, 
just as the Reichstag fire did wonders for the Nazis.

Visit -->  http://www.webcom.com/haight/Oklahoma/Okc.1.html

The ACLU, NRA, and the National Association of Criminal 
Defense Lawyers are not happy about the new device. Jack 
King, spokesperson for the NACDL, said Millivision "seems 
to be highly intrusive and a violation of the Fourth 
Amendment, which guarantees the right to be secure 
against unreasonable search and seizure."

While the NRA approves of the device for use at airports and 
for tracking down illegal drug activity ( statist air-brains ), 
they point out that 31 states have laws that protect the right 
to carry concealed weapons. In other words, it's OK to kill the
Fourth Amendment if it stops nonviolent voluntary drug activity
-- in other words, kiss your freedoms goodbye.

The Times article also states that:

        "A Los Angeles Times poll last week found that 
        58 percent of Americans would be willing to lose 
        some civil liberties to help thwart terrorism."

As it has been said "Those who are willing to give up freedom 
for security will soon have neither." Yet people are trained in 
public schools that the government -- i.e., that the 'legal' use 
of violent force -- is a cuddly and warm teddy-bear that makes 
everything wonderful and should be embraced whenever a problem 
appears to arise. It follows therefore that it is safe to 
surrender liberty to the govt. And indeed govt is going 
to keep us secure, very very secure -- HELP! let me go.

As Anders said, even VR navel-gazers will want more and more hardware
to run on.  I don't see why *every* member of every "transcendent"
society should be uninterested in gaining control of more and more
stuff and energy to transform it.  And it probably only takes
one transcendant person to explode.

Yes. I thought of this point this weekend, and just revised the paper 
to reflect it.

But some of them should be interested in our raw mass and the sun's energy.
Unless it is always cheaper to get more mass/energy by creating a
"baby universe" or some such.

You have left out basic curiosity. There are two not necessarily mutually
exclusive paths to transhumanity. One is inward into our self constructed VR
worlds, the other is outward into the universe. Some of us need to know what
is over the next hill, others prefer to create their own hills on canvas, or
watch hills on TV. Some who have the option to upload into a self contained,
VR world might choose not to do so, because they can't help but want to know
what is in the next star system in the 'real world'. I can forsee a future
in which the artists and couch potatoes of the world are all uploaded into
artificial worlds of their own or other's design, while the scientists and
explorers of the world continue to point their outputs towards the external
universe.

And the conservatives and idiots and religious fanatics, they'll still be at
their respective party conventions I imagine.

It's difficult to understand what the goals of transhumans (used in the
sense of "transcended humans") might be. As you say, the paths may not
be mutually exclusive, however, it seems to me that economics dictate 
the inward path. For example, you launch a manned exploration/colonization
mission to Mars, I send trillions of nanoprobes to cover the planet and
recreate all of Mars inside a VR. The material mass of my effort may be
only a few grams, miniscule compared to your mission. I'm not sure that
any additional benefit you get with the larger mission (mostly, it would
seem to consist only of additional matter to process) would justify
the extravagent cost. So I don't think it's just the difference between
couch potatoes and explorers; one could explore my VR Mars virtually
forever.

Not to get mystical here, but, to me, the entire "external" universe
exists inside my head. Perhaps there's an "end to science", where increased
knowledge only improves our comprehension of the universe by a few
decimal places. In such a case being able to construct a clockwork
universe inside VR at least means we'll be able to understand the totality
of it eventually. We just print out the source code.

The original Great Filter post wondered why we didn't see evidence of
intelligent reengineering of the universe. It might seem a shame to us
to consider that advanced civilizations always take the inward path,
but it seems possible that the rewards therein may be as great, or
even greater than, those obtained by outward exploration. Perhaps they
discover that the whole universe is a computer program, and escaping it
(or teleporting anywhere within it) is just a matter of reconfiguring the
kernal.

The big question I have is: where can I get one?

Is anyone aware of the technical details of such a device?

I know!  How about "Personal Futurists?!"

with connotations (& I'm into ambivalence and irony):
 o  Seeing oneself in the future,
 o  seeing your personal future as worthy of an "ism,"
    as in "Maxism" (love it!),
 o  creating the future,
 o  self-transformation,
 o  bottom-up, accessible tech (as in personal computers, personal copiers,
    personal fax machines, personal hygene, etc.), and how about
 o  your own personal futurist!

(Btw, I imagine "person" can apply to trans- or post-humans.  Also, "trans-
personal," as in "trans-personal psychology," means between people.)

Unless you can indeed rewrite the universe's kernal to give unlimited
local computation, you will eventually need to move out into the
universe to support increasing computation abilities.  VR happens in
real physical computers in our real universe; it doesn't change the
basic economics which pushes for expansion.

I've been finding interest in extropian principles among people hanging
around on IRC especially people who are knowledgable in computers, science,
and technology. Maybe this should be a clue to creating an #extropians
channel on undernet or possibly efnet due to less channel takeovers. The
strategy of exposing these memes to the public rather than keeping them
isolated within a mailinglist works quite well although we will have to deal
with idiots occasionally. Educating people about ideas using this method has
worked with the great religions of the world for quite sometime in the form
of 'witnessing' as they call it.

IAN: But then you might be able to see under the cloths of 
government officials, and only the govt has a right to privacy.

Your question raises deeper issues regarding ethics, technology
advancement, and individual power vs governmental tyranny.

The problem is not technology, it is the system of ethics that 
exists in the minds of those who employ technology. This being 
the case, a rock in hand is as "bad" as a new high-tech device.

	However much we may dislike the tyrannical aspects of governments, they still 
are a form of Spontaneous Order.  Our rational thinking and our intentions are 
not supernaturally outside the realm of evolution and spontaneous order.  Our 
rationality comes from the spontaneous ordering of trillions of nerve cells in 
our bodies and from the incredibly complex interaction, competition, evolution 
and spontaneous ordering of memes which compose our minds.  Our societies and 
governments emerge from similar processes of evolution and spontaneous 
ordering.  NOTHING (as far as I know) lies outside this arena of evolution and 
spontaneous order.  The libertarian memes will hopefully outcompete the 
authoritarian memes, and the amount of coercive behavior would then decrease.  
But we always have been, are, and always will, exist in a system of evolution 
and spontaneous order.  Just because we intentionally create something, 
doesn't mean it is not spontaneous order.  All our intentions are the results 
of incredible spontaneous order; we're not somehow magically outside the 
system.
	Our rationality is not some pure and holy faculty, issued forth from God.  It 
is the result of intense genetic and memetic competition.  The memes which are 
the most durable and successful in the memetic competition and evolution are 
simply the ones that we label "rational".  Rationality is the most trustworthy 
of our faculties, simply because the memes which are "rational" are the ones 
which have out-competed all the competition....so far, anyway.  Rationality is 
not the pure thing that some people make it out to be.  It's a very haphazard 
and chaotic process.  But rationality is all the best and most competitive 
ideas we've come up with so far, so it deserves our praise.  It is not some 
dead and dry academic faculty either; it is at the forefront of evolution; it 
is that which has triumphed over all competitors so far.  Rationality is, I 
would say, the most vibrant, living and the most likely to *continue* living 
aspect of existence, simply because it is the best of the best at any given 
moment.  
	The systems which survive the best are the ones which are the most responsive 
and adapted to their reality.  Thus, I would say that the systems which 
survive the best could be considered to be the most rational.
	
Our thoughts evolve, and "we" have no control over them.  "We" ARE the 
evolving thoughts.  If the thoughts are competitive enough, they'll survive; 
if not, they won't.  The system will play itself out.  No one is in control.  
And no one ever can be.  That's just how things are.  It kinda blows the 
mind...

Throughout the Europe this percentile is likely to be vastly larger than 
50 %. E.g. in Germany there is a variety of state and private (the 
latter having entered the scene only quite recently) health insurance 
companies. Both the costs of medical treatment and the amount of 
nonpaying (state-sponsored) patients have risen dramatically. Health 
insurance outfits now tend to step up their payment demands several times 
a year. It seems as if either the average quality of medical service 
will go down or the whole system is to collapse, leaving behind but a 
husk of former price/performance ratio. (At least it will be an autark 
and sustainable medicine).

> great deal to do with escalating costs.

But a goodish fraction is caused by the advent of the costly apparative 
medicine. As I am writing this, a 5 MDEM Siemens MRI tomograph is 
operating the room next door. It needs technicians to operate it as well 
as some specialized M.D.'d to interpret the pretty pictures it generates. 
Virtually everybody who has health insurance can do a brain scan if he so 
wishes -- as associated costs are enormous we obviously have a problem 
here.

I am tracking their progress as accurately as I can. It is not very 
impressive so far. All of these new architectures are implemented in 
semiconductor photolitho technology, a fundamentally 2d technique. Since 
die/wafer size is limited as well as integration density 
as well as top switching speed, we can estimate the top performance limit 
of this technology. Though it may appear enormous by today's standards, 
it is still a far cry of what biological systems can do. We're bound to 
hit a saturation (it can be seen on some plots already) quite soon. No 
alternative techniques -- e.g. molecular circuitry -- will be ready by 
then, as their development takes a minimum latency. Currently, almost no 
research towards molecular circuitry is being done. We are likely to 
enter a zone of slow progress, which is likely to delay Singularity 
(insert usual disclaimer here).

> more rapidly than our understanding of the brain. I expect that by the time

Au contraire. Neuroscience, augmented by synergistic insights from a 
large number other sciences, grows in leaps and bounds. Subjectively, it 
is one of the most dynamic sciences I am aware of. Computational physics 
is a stagnant pool in comparison to neurosci.

But it won't be based on silicon semiconductor technology. Since there 
isn't any other (unless I failed to notice strong nanotech having become 
available already). We'll need drastically different hardware to 
interface to the brain constructively.

But don't you see, it is all in the details! If you know both the physics 
and have an exhausting knowledge of the structures, the insights you gain 
are solely limited by the available modeling power. If you know how the 
thing works at an abstract level, then you can build a surrogate, an 
ersatz neuron.

There cannot be any theoretical understanding -- unless the theory 
contains lots of messy wet data, which automatically disqualifies it as a 
good theory, even an applicable theory. It's just a software package, not 
a theory.

Apart from quantum dot 3d arrays, which is but a lab curiousity (no 
arrays yet, just dots), I have failed to notice the advent of maspar 
machines in the laboratory or the 'real' world. If one comes to 
think of it, especially in the real world. Alas, one cannot teach old 
programmers new tricks. Remember what happened to Danny Hillis and Thinking 
Machines? (I know they are alive again/still).

We'll need lots of computational horsepower, agreed. To make sense from 
wet data.

All you need to utilize a computer algebra package, is a stream of 
chars. Low input bandwidth. To make sense of the data, a visual input is 
sufficient. It's hight bandwidth, but it's just rendering. Interfacing a 
computer algebra package in this way is almost trivial. It's just one 
step after VR. Generating input vectors at will is the only way to make 
VR fly.

Hooking low-bandwidth motorics and sensorics into the brain is 
comparatively easy. We can do the motorics even now. Sensorics is much 
harder, but eventually we will conquer it. Has nothing to do with soft 
uploads, this is meek interfacing.

It's not distributed, it is a solid macroscopic lump with sharp boundary. 
To insert it, you must carve out a complementary block of tissue. The brain 
is somewhat holographic, but there are limits to it. Brain salami uploading?
Uh, thanks, I think it better gotta be Dewar time.

What's easy for native neurotissue, is damn hard for us. Hardware is 
bottleneck, again.

Aw, you know how I meant it. Spatiotemporal acitivity is done by 
circuitry, and this circuitry is localized. Cut a wedge from the 
circuitry -- the hologramme has grown fuzzier (if you're lucky). The 
piece of cake has to be substituted. We don't know the constitution of 
the slice we discarded, so we have to rely on that the surrogate is 
virtually indistinguishable to a chunk of neural circuitry. On _all_ 
functional scales, whether chemical or electrical activity, or whatever 
else. Easy, eh?

One can't separate the network from the hardware. The hardware defines 
the properties of the network. If it prevents mind from spilling over 
into fresh circuitry, there is nothing you can do to goad it into it.

Some NNs do that, yes, if the hardware (which defines the properties of 
the NN) attached is the right one.

Not only by the animals -- by any entity which has to operate in the real 
world. There's a tight limit to what a sequential machine can do (fuck 
Turing), and maspar machines converge towards NNs with increasing 
parallelility, to become indistinguishable from them at the far end.

I dunno, I think the fitness function is additive (it's a mental 
picture, ok?). One factor demands for fast, robust, power-saving 
complex calculations, the other for the tolerancy towards lesions. Both 
are unrelated. Since fitness selects for both traits, we have both 
competency slots covered. (There are lots of others).

Yeah, but I doubt this includes lesion recovery. Lesion tolerance, yes, 
but not lesion recovery. That's an extra.

Well, you demand for a set of pretty advanced properties. The epithet

I would be mad to equal circuitry and its function. If I did, the whole 
idea of uploads, whether hard or soft, whether continuous or discontinous 
would become laughable. Nevertheless, the implementation 
of function demanded, shapes the outlines of the hardware which has to 
deliver this performance. (Connectivity, and such).

Yes, but consider the speed of the evolution on the far end of the 
exponential function. We ain't seen nothing yet. The biggest progress 
will come from IT & network connectivity. This means vastly decreased 
latency and boosted productivity. Add a thimbleful of agents to automate 
the menial tasks, and, voila! look, no hands, mom, the Singularity is 
there.

Demand there might be (I would buy such thing if I could afford it) it's 
just that physics/biology seems to forbid it.

How so? There is both a strong push for scanning the shape and 
connectivity coming from the discipline of microscopy, an area of pure 
science, as well as a strong demand for building autonomous insectoid 
agents from industry and mil. E.g. scanning the visual system of the 
musca domestica, and then building the hardware to make it fly, would 
give us the deadly pilotless fighter Pentagon is currently trying to 
develop.

Cryonics does not count at all, it is by far not influential enough. Too 
outlandish a concept for the majority, alas.

P.S. Btw, I spoke with a M.D. who is currently doing his Ph.D. in MRI 
     imaging. He showed me a functional MRI image of a 19 year old male, 
     who had suffered a brain hemorrhage at birth. There is lots of 
     compensatory activity, but despite all those years in between, his 
     hand movements is still inhibited. Our hardware is amazingly 
     flexible, yet there are limits to it.

I think the standard response on this is: either life nucleation

This requires the emulation entity to contain an 'emergency exit' as a

I agree, but then we get back to the original question of why we don't
observe the impact of intelligence upon the universe. The idea of the
inward path is only a speculation on how advanced intelligence may survive
(and even thrive) and yet have minimum impact upon the physical universe.
One could say that both Egan's _Permutation City_ and Bear's _Blood Music_ 
are fictional examples of a society with exploding populations which don't
move out into the real universe. All of Vinge's stories with characters
in space seem to require some plot device (slow zones, missing out on
the singularity) to get folks off the planet.

If we're all uploaded beings, thinking 27K times faster than we do now,
then a trip to Mars involves separation from the main computing 
machinery in terms of the delay in communication due to distance. Who-
ever goes to Mars faces the possibility of being out-evolved by those who 
stay behind. Unless we send artificially reduced intelligences, in which
case we're back to the idiots-in-space scenario.

Personally, I'd love to see mankind colonizing Mars and exploring the
universe, for the sake of survival of the species if nothing else.

Aside from the possibility that space colonization is too hard (which
seems doubtful; we already know how it could be done in principe and
practice), this filter relies on that all species will be trapped by
VR paradise. But this depends a lot on psychology, and might be an
unique danger to our kind of species but not others (say, intelligent
hive colonies or knots of flux-tubes in neutron stars).

This is quite possible. My own answer is that we are too slow and 
stupid to be worth discussing with. The transcendent beings might be

Perhaps, but as Tipler points out, on this scale individuals could 
signal or make a visible mess. 

Sometimes I think that the "natural order" is artificial: stars are 
power generators, galaxies are really computer nets and so on. But 
how to tell natural and artificial apart?

(I like your calculations (deleted for brevity), but we simply don't 
have enough data).

Don't fall for one of the oldest IT myths: what is processor power? Is it 
the clock or the producer MIPS rating? Hardly so. Is it what a test suite 
measures? Better, but then there are lots of ratings, depending on what 
is being measured. If you measure local Flops the result will be 
drastically different from measuring local or nonlocal memory bandwidth.

Memory bandwith latency progress is asymptotic. Even worse, the price 
fluctuates wildly due to market politics. Even the physical clocks will 
run into a saturation zone very soon. Afaik Alpha will soon run at 0.5 GHz. 
End of line for current Si/Ge semiconductors lies about 2 GHz. And this 
is local clock, friends and neighbours. Off-chip accesses are waaaay off. 
Trying to run a macroscopic bus at >100 MHz is asking for trouble.

About the only thing which goes up exponential is integration density. 
But what shall we do if it runs well into nm domain? Wires don't conduct 
at quantum scale too well.

Sorry, system power has rencently started to show signs of saturation. 
We'll need to go maspar, soon. The advent of SMP (which is an extremely 
poor parallelism) in high-end PCs is a portent for the future.

Yes, but I wish this has happend at the genome level. (Toying with the 
size of the cortex is easy: the genome is quite modular). On the other 
hand, I remember reading that brain metabolism is even now a bottleneck 
at some (early) developmental stage...

Yes, but even then their malleability is limited. Typically, the 
topographically nearer the region, the more likely is it to take over the 
function of the affected area.

The big question is how to use maspar in an useful way. How do we run a 
word processor or matlab in a maspar network? 

This seems to be similar to the problems with process migration and 
distributed computing, although in this case one can (probably) assume 
identical processors at least. 

I think it is mainly a programming problem - we are not very good at 
creating parallel algorithms, and most obvious ways to do things for us 
are serial when they should be parallel.

I think this would be ethical (if it could be done safely), since I 
approve of all changes that increase the freedom of acting of a being 
(after all, the child doesn't have to use it if it doesn't want it, and 
is given new abilities). But I guess others disagree.

Sounds quite possible, the brain gobbles up a surprisingly large fraction 
of our metabolism (was it 25%?). I think we would have to change the 
development of the brain so that it grows further after birth (another 
bottleneck [and a sick pun]). Perhaps development should be slowed 
somewhat so that the brain can grow further, but I doubt parents could 
stand a longer neonatal period! (Unless we engineer their hormones 
too! :-)

This is what happens when the brain is injured. But I think the ass. 
cortices contain a lot of independent connections that doesn't correspond 
to any clear-cut regions.

Yes, if they are internally-competitive (without a single strong world
government).  If local technological advances run out, then the only
route to growth is spatial expansion to other resources.  And
generically evolution, of transhumans or anything else, pushes toward
growth where possible (some mutation trys it, and wins thereby).

These stories are all pretty short on cosmological time scales.
Unless you can create local baby universes, our best physics says you
will eventually run out of local negentroy for computation, after
which the only route to growth is spatial expansion.

The question is why they don't use the resources, mass and negentroy,
near us.

But then why have we had so much success explaining astrophysical

Then how can you say: 'Spontaneously ordering processes can produce results that
themselves are inimical to spontaneous order.' Surely a spontaneously
ordering process will result in a spontaneous order, otherwise it wouldn't
be a spontaneously ordering process. Can you give me an example where this
isn't the case, with no intervening process which is not spontaneously ordering?

And given an S.O. process creates an S.O., how does this inimicality arise,
if not through consideration of the desirability of the outcome of the process?

>[discussion of Extropian views on SO...]

...with which I entirely agree, except to say that I don't think it's
possible to say that all spontaneous orders fit the Extropian ideal, so
should we be using the phrase Spontaneous Order to reflect such a blanket
'good thing'? (And yes, I realize it makes a nice acronym!)

A few months ago Keith Henson was commenting that with ever more vivid VR
simulations, let alone fully experienced upload virtual worlds that perhaps
real space exploration would never happen. Instead, we would experience well
designed simulations which are indistinguishable from the real thing, and if
this fact is lost, we experience an ever expanding view of our navels....

I pointed out that from this POV, I have just sigend up to the series,

    "Heroes of Cryonics and Extropians, the 90's"

it, that this immediate experience I have is just a well disguised uploaded VR.

BTW, I recall in high school English a raging discussion one day about
whether God exists. I suggested that perhaps all this is a computer program.
I was totally ignored.....

Experience, Edit Thyself!

A variation on this is to incrementally grow an interface to a standard
"socket" into which varied premanufactured neural nets may be attached. I
imagine a kind of "Tower Records" store which has thousands of neural nets
available for almost any purpose, just like music CDs. It also simplifies
unistalling, just unplug the chip.... BTW, I recall something on this topic
in Neuromancer....

Extropians - especially those in the San Francisco Bay area -
might be interested in participating in this television
documentary project.  I'm forwarding this to the list, as logistics
makes it difficult for me to directly participate.  Additionally,
there are more eloquent champions here...

Subject: Re: Your documentary....

This sounds like a very good idea. Perhaps we could organise some groupmeet
one evening? Feel free to post the synopsis to the list, with my email, but
please add that I will be incommunicado as of the 22nd of August and that I
arrive in the Bay Area on the 29th.

Many thanks,

If you have a phone number, I might give you a ring before the 1st, is that
okay?

I'm beginning to think that the more general and recent the term or
concept, the more it can be understood only within an understanding of the
tradition within which the term or concept arose.

The problem with "spontaneous order" as a principle is that it arose,
mostly in the works of F. A. Hayek, quite recently in history. It arose so
recently that it's difficult to precisely identify the tradition to which
it belongs. The tradition to which it belongs is a fuzzy subset of the
Western scientific-liberal tradition, but if challenged, I might be able to
point out some examples of members of the Western scientific-liberal
tradition that are not part of the tradition to which the concept of
spontaneous order belongs, and other examples that are part of that
tradition. But I have no idea how to generalize about the boundary of this
particular subset of the Western scientific-liberal tradition.

Except that it seems to like Max and Tom's ideas and seems to be in the
process of naming itself "extropian".

I have no idea whether this comment is helpful to you or not. Lots of
people who have attempted to be generalists, who have been exposed to this
idea, and who have studied biology, economics, neural networks, and the
many other disciplines that study complex homeostatic dynamic systems, have
connected the idea of spontaneous order to their own personal conception of
the good. But as usual, idolatry is always a danger. It seems increasingly
clear that the phrase "spontaneous order" is easily misunderstood and
misinterpreted at present.

What to do about this, I do not know. One thing one could do is try to
identify the allied concepts that are associated with the idea of
spontaneous order (rich and extensive use of *local* information,
accumulation and gradual modification of information over time, softness
and flexibility) and do some education, so that this concept can emerge
unscathed into the wider intellectual world and stand independent of the
tradition that created it. Another thing one could do is to cease using the
term and try to come up with other words and phrases for getting the same
concept across in a less easily distorted form. I'm confident that
different people will try different strategies, and through this
experimentation eventually we'll figure out how to most effectively
communicate the stuff that's important for each of us to communicate.

I hope that made sense.

IAN: In fact the rock was first identifed as being terrestrial. The 
following information, if true, renders the rock * highly suspect.*

Subject: Mars Life Announcement Fraud Issue
Date: 8 Aug 1996 15:43:55 GMT
Message-ID: <4ud1vr$is@hume.nmia.com>

David McKay, the NASA JSC scientist who recently announced the
discovery of evidence of life on Mars, has a history of alleged
scientific fraud. 

These allegations arise out of his tenure as director of an Aug. 1984
NASA Summer Study held in La Jolla on the use of extraterrestrial
resources for building missile defenses. 

At the end of the study McKay held a press conference in which
ex-astronaut Buzz Aldrin, (who had participated in the summer study
for only one day) announced that the approximately 20 college
professors who had participated for the entire duration of this study
had recommended building a lunar base and mining the moon to build
missile defenses.  But in reality the professors had voted unanimously
*3 times* against recommending the building of a lunar base. 

In Oct. 1985, at a major conference on the use of extraterrestrial
resources held in Washington DC, McKay put out a press release
accompanied by a putative final report of that summer study with the
names of the professors given as the alleged authors. This phony
report included the slogan "On to the Moon!" It claimed the professors
in this summer study had recommended building a lunar base. 

You can read more details of this episode of McKay's scientific fraud
in pages 345-7 in the book "Space Resources:  Breaking the Bonds of
Earth,"  by John S. Lewis and Ruth Lewis, Columbia University Press,
New York, 1987.  Lewis was one of the professors who took part in that
summer study.  

Judging by the fact that McKay is still an employee of NASA JSC, fraud
must not be a career liability over there. 

Fraud. It is a dagger in the heart of science, especially when there
is only one small rock on which to base a claim that could touch off
the Copernican Revolution of biology. And especially when that
discovery would be so convenient for McKay and NASA.

[I'm also sending this to the Extropians list, where Anders now dwells part
of the time.]

At this early stage, I'm encouraged by the response to the call for help in
getting funding and other help with EXTRO-3: The Third Extropy Institute
Conference on Transhumanist Thought. 

Although you'll already know this, I want to publically thanks Sean Hastings
for his $1,000 contribution directed toward making it possible for Anders
Sandberg -- surely one of the very most liked and well-informed
transhumanists -- to come all the way from Sweden to the event next year.
Thank you Sean! It couldn't happen to a better guy Anders!

Details of the conference are still to be worked out. I'll be wanting to
form an organizational team to discuss the topics, speakers, and other
details, and to publicize the event. If you're interested in joining the
team please contact me. Some of the team will need to be local to the
planned event, but others certainly need not be nearby.

EXTRO-3 will very likely take place in northern California, probably in
Sunnyvale. This is where EXTRO-1 was held; EXTRO-2 was in Los Angeles. Since
California has the highest concentration of transhumanists, it makes it
easier for more people to come if held here. Once there are several times as
many of us, I expect to see conferences in several places each year. In the
meantime, Extropy Institute will gradually bring events to more places by
smaller one day conferences/seminars, in addition to the two-day EXTRO
conference. (It might be more like 2 1/2 days this time.)

Even if this is available only to List members, I'm not sure whether this
would be within the allowances of the privacy agreement we made. I'll have
to look at exactly what the old conditions were. It's annoying, I know, but
we must abide by the policy that was in place.

Where I think you're going wrong here is in thinking that a spontaneously
ordering process can only give rise to other spontaneously ordering
processes. Why should that be the case? A process can give rise to effects
that are not examples of that process. As an example: The market is a
spontaneous order. It produces certain structures in the market, like
corporations, that are not themselves spontaneously ordering processes.
Corporations, typically, are designed orders. They are deliberately
structured by human beings.

I'm glad you think so. Then perhaps you can answer what has become my
favorite question of late: has anyone managed to get artificial
unsupervised feedback networks to do *anything* interesting?

I've only just started poking around, but it seems to me that other than a
few abortive efforts in the late '80s when neural-net research woke up
again, all the work going on has been in supervised nets and feedforward
nets, and that no one has the foggiest idea how unsupervised feedback nets
do their stuff. (I know you know this, Eugene, but for those who are
following this and don't already know, our best current
computational-process-model of the brain is the unsupervised feedback net
model.)

Last time I checked progress was pretty stagnant even with supervised
feedback nets.

So it seems to me that this is a gaping chasm before us in k-space (or
World 3 or whatever you want to call it) and no one is currently working on
bridging it.
They're working *toward* bridging it, by investigating simpler nets and
fuzzy systems, but not yet *on* bridging it. And as far as I know, the best
mathematical models we have for unsupervised feedback nets are ragingly
nonlinear and not useful for much. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

And then simulate 100 billion of them at miniscule tolerances? Sure, maybe
brute force will work. But the history of classical AI is a history of the
failure of brute-force approaches (along with some stunningly fabulous
spinoffs, I must add). My hunch (and it's nothing more than that) is that
we will succeed neither in AI nor in uploading nor in developing
"superintelligence" by some other means until we have a theoretical
understanding of the computational process that we call mind. And while the
progress that has been made has led to an explosion of useful technology,
it hasn't really gotten us any closer to seeing how to cross that
aforementioned gaping chasm. Again, please correct me if I'm wrong.

I understand if you disagree with me because you are confident of the
future possibilities in brute-force simulation, but if you disagree with me
about the path toward a theoretical understanding of what intelligence is,
I'd really like to hear about it.

And I long ago decided that since cryonics is just a time-transport
technology, indefinite human lifespan will require either uploading or
*really* drastic meddling with adult gene-expression. So if any of you out
there are disheartened about the prospects for uploading and also want
indefinite lifespans, I recommend studying molecular biology and embryology
and human genetics and all that.

Sure. One of the reasons we can't program them is because we don't yet have
a useful mathematical model of the only existence proof of a
massively-parallel supercomputer, the brain. Some useful hardware advances
happen serendipitously, but I think in this case theory is going to have to
precede technology.

The technology has been around for quite some time (after doing some
web research). The interesting thing about this technology
(Millitech's) is that it is passive, picking up the natural
electromagnetic energy being emitted by people (around 20-150
GHz). The system works essentially like a camera, with some signal
processing (which is likely the most significant part of it) helping
on the imaging.

Neal Stephenson has some very believable and grounded writing. I'd

I just read (and replied to) a vicious post by Mark Stahlman on the Threads
discussion of the debate I'm having on HotWired about Extropians ideas. A
number of the anti-extropians have substituted assertions and feelings for
reasonable arguments, but Stahlman wins the "asshole poster" award! He
called me a "madman" and "dishonest". His claim of dishonesty being based on
his view that I (and all Extropians) are out to control other people. As I
noted, this is so obviously far from the truth that Stahlman himself is
being dishonest, not just mistaken.

I've heard a little about Stahlman, who I believe works with New Media
Associates in New York. I had a rather negative impression of him as one who
makes incendiary posts without really arguing. This post certainly verifies
that impression! I'd appreciate any information about Stahlman -- his views,
his writings -- that could help me get a grip on his point of view. I expect
he will reply, so I'd like to see if there's some way I can have a
productive discussion with him. He may only be interested in name-calling
though.

Thanks,

	It seems to me that government, real existing government, is a
spontaneous order as a society without government would be a spontaneous
order. I don't think there is any way to avoid the concepts of anarchy,
free society, anarcho-capitalism, libertarianism, etc. by substituting
spontaneous order as a description of what Extropians seem to want.

	A non-spontaneous order or a planned society is only a chimera in
the minds of statists.  Sure, a group of like minded statists may get
considerable power with a society and attempt to plan it, but the plans of
others interfere and create a spontaneous order not planned by anyone.

	For instance, in spite of supposed top to bottom planning in the
Old Soviet Union, many analysts have shown that the Soviet Union was
really a complex web of unplanned corruption, extortion, gangsterism, etc.

	Some may find it odd that I make this argument as a ruling class
conspiracy theorist.  However, I never argued that a conspiracy could
control a society or plan a society....only manipulate a society to
maintain itself as a parasitical ruling class via a State.

Those who remember the DigitaLiberty mailing list will recall Stahlman. I
remember his writing to be flamboyant but generally incisive, consistently
on the side of individual freedom. Bill Frezza was the ostensible "owner
and operator" of the list, but I think Stahlman may have had co-status of
some sort. AFAIK, there are no public archives of that list, although I
and most likely others have private archives. The list went down a while
back, flared up briefly and then vanished again. Just like Duncan Frissell
and Sandy Sandfort's Privacy 101, all the good lists seem to just die out.
(But Duncan and Sandy are still visibly active, at least, on cypherpunks;
I haven't seen more than the occasional brief op-ed from Stahlman, and
nothing from Frezza since (Information Week?) was carrying his column.

I've never said spontaneously ordering processes can only give rise to other
spontaneously ordering processes: what I _have_ said is that spontaneously
ordering processes can only give rise to spontaneous orders, by definition.
The deliberate structure of a corporation, whether or not that corporation
itself is formed by a spontaneously ordering process, is implemented by a
non-SO process. I certainly wouldn't disagree that a spontaneous order could
lose it's 'spontaneity' by intervening process: I think your reply is
anwering 'No' to my question 'Can you give me an example where this isn't
the case, with no intervening process which is not spontaneously ordering?'.

It isn't spontaneous ordering processes which 'produce results inimical to
spontaneous order', it's intervening non-SO processes which do that, as you
describe.

I don't think we're disagreeing about this, are we Max?

That was my point exactly: the problem is not hardware. Even von Neumann 
investigated introducing parallelism in one of the first machines -- but 
he quickly grew disgusted since he kept running into apparently
unsurmountable task organization and coordination problems (a software 
problem!), so he abandoned this route very early.

It is interesting to note, that the word 'computer' formerly denoted a 
human clerk in charge of computations. In a MIT Press essay I saw a 
thesis essentially telling that the advent of digital computers could only 
happen so fast because it fell on fertile, already well ploughed ground: 
the venerable tradition of organising groups of human computers which 
executed sequential algorithms. Astronomical calculation, ballistic 
firing tables for artillery, etc.

Parallelism has always been a blind spot in the Western thinking, all the 
way since the antique philosophy. Only very rarely an intrinsically 
parallel algorithm is being uneasily contemplated, _as if the world was 
sequential_, and not vice versa :(( .

How can we teach old programmers new tricks? How?

Yes. But at least there is _some_ progress: monolithic mainframes are 
quite dead, all current supercomputers are either multi-node machines or 
workstations clusters running PVM. Since PCs recapitulate the evolution 
of mainframes, we'll see true MIMD machines with non-shared memory within 
the next 5-10 years. (At least I hope we will see them. I fully expected 
maspar machines to appear by 1987. Ack.)

Xactly. Just consider Taos

  http://www.tao.co.uk/  (though updated, still a bit thin on information)

A revolutionary product if I ever saw one. Enthusiastically reviewed by 
Dick Pointain of Byte at least 2 times. Has a 12 kByte nanokernel, is 
fully hardware independant since based on a VM (hmm, just where did I saw 
this feature recently?), etc. etc. etc. Fantastic product. Ok, their 
marketing is lousy, but still no response for more than 2 years? We are 
still not ripe for maspar, no way, no Sir.

Of course. We are far from being able to do this now. Bioinert implanted

Yes, I also seem to be recalling about this number. I am not sure, but I

It is local, but not local as we H's know it :)

Most recent universe theories seem to imply our universe fluctuates on 
very small scale, a quantum soup of baby bobbling universes, which can 
sometimes persist and expand to macro scale. The usual basement universe 
fabrication theory assumes a >H can precipitate a universe with desired

Of course our space time might not contain such emergency exit machinery. 
If it doesn't, there is nothing what we (or >H's, or even Omega) can do 
about it.

Since a silence in the skies there is, it may be considered as an 
argument pro 'fire exit' existance. (Of course there are other, more 
likely options).

Um, I misunderstood you. I was thinking about a solid state civilization, 
a mind ecology, a >H. Since this is post-Singularity I thought we cannot 
know anything about it. If this is a ecology in the Darwinian sense, then 
yes, it will probably show boundless expansion.

I agree: if Darwin, then expansion.

Because they are not expansive? Because we fail to percieve them with our 
crude tools/they operate at lower energetical levels than we think they 
do?

Yes. This is good argument. However, we can't even explain the lack of 
solar neutrinos yet. Either our theories are faulty, incomplete or 
there are green men frolicking in the Sun :)

Maybe by training ecologists, animal trainers and entemontologists as
programmers? Genetic algorithms are not necessarily a superior solution,
but they help us get out of the old way of thinking. I recently read a
paper about a version of Tierra that evolved a simple form of parallel
copying.

Interesting idea: Carnitine seems to help neuron metabolism, and prevents 
cell damage to some extent if given before trauma. Maybe it should be 
given to the mother/child before birth? Could lower the risk for nasty 
brain damage and might even be nootropic.

Not good evidence, but it is compatible with it. Note that it doesn't 
have to be local, just on another plane. Maybe there is a lot going on in 
the quantum noise around us.

_Permutation City_ describes an interesting universe where negentropy 
never runs out, since it appears as part of its expansion. But in our 
spacetime and physics, it is limited.

Good question. One possibility is that very advanced technology is 
extremely ephermeral and natural-looking and hence hard to distinguish 
from natural phenomena. For example, the sun might work as expected, but 
the solar neutrinos are used by someone for something. Dark matter might 
be large nanostructures spread across the universe, sending packets of 
information as gamma ray bursts. 

How to tell the difference between nature and technology? Technology 
tends to optimize *something*, and a good guess would be (given our 
current information-bias) information production or storage. So, what 
media in cosmos might be able to store or process a lot of information?

 I am puzzled at your suggestion that "random circumstances" and "false
beliefs" are in any way inconsistent with SO. Randomness is often an
essential part of SOs such as genetic programming and neural networks,
and the role of random trial and error in economic change should not be
ignored. An ant colony can organize with false beliefs or no beliefs on
the part of the ants, but accurate beliefs are needed for central planners
to create a non-spontaneous order.
 Ask yourself, for example, whether the FDA is the result of congressmen
thoughtlessly reacting to headlines, which happen to report deaths due
to bad drugs more conspicuously than natural deaths due to lack of drugs
(a SO explanation of the FDA), or the result of people consciously
calculating that their power is more important than the prompt availability
of new drugs.

 What are the rules that govern the evolution of wings? The response
of our immune systems to a new virus? Beyond the principle that entities
which expand/reproduce tend to dominate a system, I see no reason to
expect clear or simple rules.

Subject: Rationality:  a Product and Process of Evolution
Sender: postmaster@extropy.org
Precedence: bulk
Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

In the first Thread in HotWired's BrainTennis, I posted something which 
mentioned that rationality is a product of and in the process of evolution.  I 
also posted something to that effect here.  In BrainTennis, Alexander 
Chislenko posted something which disagreed with what I wrote, and since we 
were getting off the main topic of the Thread, I wrote to him privately, but I 
think some of you may be interested in what I wrote, so I'm posting it here:

	
	First of all, I am constantly amazed at my own rationality, and how quickly 
the processes of rationality can analyze a problem, evaluate partial solutions 
and eventually come up with a solution to the problem.  It's certainly much 
faster than blind trial-and-error, but I still maintain that rationality, as 
wonderful as it is, is still a product of evolution and constantly engaged in 
the process of evolution.
	I understand rationality to be a very streamlined and efficient way of 
understanding things and thinking about things.  We didn't start out with this 
faculty, when we were born, but our minds keep fine-tuning themselves, through 
a process of evolution and selection, where the better ways of thinking 
consistently win out over inferior ways of thinking.  Ways of thinking that 
consistently bring the child a reward by getting the child what it wants will 
be reinforced in the child's mind.  This is the process of selection; the ways 
of thinking that can't make it through the selection process are discontinued. 
 Through schooling and other learning environments, children find themselves 
in situations where they must perform rationally to receive praise, and 
because they desire praise, they continue to refine their processes of 
rationality.  Our ancestors found themselves in situations where they had to 
perform rationally to just *survive* (and so do we, but it's just not as 
immediately obvious, and some of us can get away with extreme irrationality).
	There was once an experiment done where humans' brain activity was monitored 
as they learned how to play the computer game, Tetris.  When they frist began 
playing, they played very poorly, and their brains were very active.  As they 
played, their performance improved and their brain activity decreased, until 
they played like experts and exhibited the same amount of brain activity as 
they did when they sat around doing nothing.  This is a good example of the 
mind refining itself and becoming more efficient at doing certain tasks.  It 
starts out using a tremendous amount of resources, all working on the problem, 
and through some kind of selection process, it only keeps the activities which 
have an appearantly desirable effect in solving the problem.  Until it ends up 
with a very advanced and efficient Tetris playing nodule.
	I think that the same type of thing happens as our rational processes 
develop.  We start out with all kinds of possible ways to solve problems, and 
we don't know which ways are best, but as the various approaches try 
themselves out, they compete with each other, and the approaches which most 
consistently bring rewards are reinforced more than those which don't and 
eventually, the inefficient processes are discontinued altogether while the 
more successful ones are fully operative.
	But, even though our rationality is an extremely efficient process, it is 
continually refining itself, at least in active minds.  I notice that my own 
rationality is constantly mutating into many different varieties,sometimes 
with very minor changes, sometimes with greater changes, and these variations 
are all subject to competition with each other, and the types of thinking 
which seem to work best are selected for and given more resources while 
appearantly inferior types of thinking are discontinued.
	Recognizing that rationality is a product of and in a process of evolution 
doesn't make it any less good or praiseworthy.  On the contrary, it 
significantly improves my faith in my rational processes to know that they 
exist because they are the current winners of intense competition between 
various ways of thinking.  Yes, village life is more rational than jungle 
life, for the same reasons that an adult's mind is more rational than a 
child's mind.  They have simply gone further along the process of selection 
and evolution.
	Just because something's evolutionary, doesn't mean that it starts over from 
ground-zero every time it tries to solve a problem.  Evolution bulids on 
itself, using existing processes to solve problems and continually refining 
itself through variation and selection.  Our rationality is definitely 
evolutionary (it is the product of evolution, and it is in a process of 
constant evolution and refinement).  It is many orders of magnitude faster and 
more powerful than genetic evolution, so I can understand your reluctance to 
include the two types of evolution as basically the same type of thing.  I 
think that the interconnectivity and the feedback loops are much tighter in 
the mind than in biology.  But I think that the same type of process is 
occuring in everything; the process of variation and selection, where 
processes which can't maintain themselves in relation to surrounding 
processes, simply don't continue.  These processes may be biological 
processes, where DNA mutates and variations appear in different organisms 
which compete for resources, or they may occur in the brain, where various 
patterns of activity either maintain themselves or are discontinued, or they 
may occur in the marketplace, as various products are exchanged and competing 
with each other.  There are many mediums where evolution can take place (and 
that's something the Artificial Life people are studying; creating 
evolutionary environments in computers).

	Enough said; I think you get the idea.

Yes, if they are internally-competitive (without a single strong world 
government).  If local technological advances run out, then the only route 
to growth is spatial expansion to other resources.  And generically 
evolution, of transhumans or anything else, pushes toward growth where 
possible (some mutation trys it, and wins thereby). "

Even with our constrained meat minds, many of us still manage to grow wiser 
as we grow older, even as we consume fewer material resources.  Is this 
because our computational power is growing or because we have learned to 
make better connections, to abstract things to higher, more generalized 
levels?  Reilly Jones put this nicely in his Extropy #15 article on SO: "Our 
perspective must be broadened in order to find simplified contexts."  Or, as 
I recently quoted from Eric Lerner: "There is no inherent limit to evolution 
away from equilibrium, even within a fixed supply of energy, so long as a 
process can continually increase the efficiency with which it recycles the 
energy."

I think intelligence is more a function of communication than computation. 
 As Anders Sandberg said, RE The Dividing Neuron, "The number of neurons in 
a brain doesn't correlate to its intelligence, it is the way they are linked 
together that is important."  So too, ever-increasing processing power is 
not necessarily extropic, especially when it wants to consume everything in 
its path!

Robin Hanson refers to Niklas Bostrom's 8/13 7:00PM post: "If life developed 
independently on Earth and on Mars, what could block the conclusion that our 
far future is probably doomed? I can see only three potential answers: 1. 
[great filter] 2. Higher life forms continue to prosper but do not cause an 
'explosion' into cosmos. 3. Higher life forms do explode into cosmos, but in 
ways that are invisible to us. This would presumably mean that they do not 
engage in galactic scale constructions, and that they are not interested in 
contacting human level life."

Regarding option 3, Robin replies: "But some of them should be interested in 
our raw mass and the sun's energy.  Unless it is always cheaper to get more 
mass/energy by creating a 'baby universe' or some such."  Of course *they* 
are *interested* in it; but, if they've transcended then why should they 
need to consume more and more material mass? I would think that the most 
successful evolutionary step would be to learn to use existing matter, as it 
is, as a distributed computing and communications medium. As Anders said: "I 
think that the 'natural order' is artificial: stars are power generators, 
galaxies are really computer nets and so on."

Also, one of Greg Egan's major themes is that transcendant beings might 
prefer to run at a slower clock speed.  I know that I would personally 
prefer some sort of geologic time frame, being able to watch large scale 
structures / patterns evolve in *real time*, rather than endlessly computing 
ever more complex solipsist visions to the Omegath decimal place!  On 
balance I'm fairly satisfied with my current processing capabilities 
(although I do wish I had better control over the noise levels and easier 
access to non-local phenomena - but those are communication issues.) I'd be 
content to keep running my simulations and observations at the current clock 
speed (or slower), as long as there was no threat of degradation or sudden 
extinction.

I don't think that Boundless Expansion implies explosion. Growth doesn't 
have to be an endless consumption of more and more resources. Transcended 
life forms could learn to live on endlessly elaborated information, not 
explosively manic energy consumption - unless you think that dinosaurs are 
more advanced life forms than humans.  As Reilly Jones might put it, 
*explosion* is a characteristic of the chaotic gaseous realm, while "the 
Extropic transformation is the complex (liquid) realm."

This idea of boundlessly expanding by consuming ever more and more resources 
reminds me of Ralph Merkle's Extropy #11 vision of the first upload VR being 
a Roman orgy simulation!

This theory would also need to explain why *no* member of *any* such a
society chooses to expand normally, rather than going out the 'fire
exist'.  The exiting process creates an apparent supernovae, perhaps?

I see no good reason not to expect "Darwinian" natural selection to
operate in a "mind ecology".  I think folks exaggerate our inability
to understand "post-Singularity" events.  Evolutionary pressures to
use available resources seems to me a very robust result, on a par
with the second law of thermodynamics.

I see two possibilities.  One is that the way to make maximal use of
these resources is disturb them very little from their natural state.
I find this possible, but a priori pretty unlikely.

The other possibility is that folks are all hiding out from being
destroyed by each other.  This is a theory popular with the 3 Hard SF
Bs (Bear, Benford, and Brin).  I find it hard, however, to understand
why it wouldn't be better to just aggressively expand to every place
one could and use it to the fullest, rather than hiding in corners.

Most entropy is now in the background radiation, unless there are
substantial numbers of big black holes.

	There's a lot of very obvious things that could be programmed into a parallel 
computer quite easily.  Most serial programs existing contain routines which 
are pretty much independent of each other and could be done simultaneously.  
And then there's all the stuff that's programmed to appear that  things are 
running simultaneously, such as the multi-tasking environments, like Windows.  
Why don't people build machines that are capable of true multi-tasking?  
Current programming techniques would only have to be modified slightly to take 
advantage of the parallel processors.  Parallel programming really isn't that 
hard... unless you're an idiot.  Every time I write I a program, I think, "My 
God! this would be so much easier if I had a parallel processor!"  It's not 
really that hard for humans to think about the fact that many things should be 
happening at the same time to solve a problem efficiently.
	One good use for parallel processors is Virtual Reality.  If there was a 
small processor for each pixel or small group of pixels, calculating the 
scene, we could have high quality, real-time ray-tracing.  Each pixel is 
independent of all the others, so all the pixels can be calculated 
simultaneously.  One could even build a parallel processor and put it on a 
card that could be added on to current PC's as a device.  There's probably a 
market for a good rendering chip.
	I'm thinking people should build computers that are parallel, down to very 
small components.  Each component has connections to a few of it's neighboring 
components and can be programmed to respond to input in various ways and give 
output to their various neighbors, depending on how they transform their 
input.  Machine level programming would basically be about specifying how each 
component responds to input, and arranging the patterns of response into 
systems which accomplish a particular goal.  These systems can be used as 
components within larger systems of interaction and so forth.  Anything that 
can be done on modern serial computers could be done one these massively 
parallel computers; one could even simulate a serial computer on it, but it 
can also be used for very fast parallel computations.
	Parallel computers just make so much more sense than serial computers, so I 
think it's only a matter of time until they're commonplace.  Programmers who 
are too lazy or stupid to write parallel programs could still write serial 
programs on a parallel computer; they wouldn't be taking full advantage of the 
machine's capabilities, but they would have nothing to complain about since 
they could still do whatever they did before.

I should have mentioned this earlier, but last month's
*Muscle & Fitness* magazine published an article by Max More,
"Zero In: Seven Keys For Pushing Beyond Your Limits", pp 82-84, 203.
It's the most recent copy with Cory Everson on the cover.
(I say "most recent" because Cory seems to be on the cover
 1/3 of most issues.)

Good article, discussing the "inner game" of body sculpting.

Any other extropian bodybuilders out there, by the way?

The first race to evolve within a billion light years might have a
highly conservationist culture.  All younger races are either eliminated
or not allowed off their homeworlds.  I can imagine an ancient race
which has a few Dyson cities per galaxy, which we haven't found yet, and
a bunch of planetary zoos, perhaps surrounded by some megashield to
block radio transmissions (so as not to let newbies like us know someone
else is out there.)  Or the zoos use neutrinos to communicate with each
other, or masers.  So the conservators maximize the diversity they can
observe and draw from.  They need strong social control, but perhaps
they're all mentally descended from one source.  Or we might see some
odd astronomical explosion someday which is actually a police action. :)

I tend to be rather skeptical of dietary fads in bodybuilding,
preferring a long-term strategy of a generally lowfat diet
spread out in small meals over a day, and a protein intake
of 1.2-1.5g/lb bodymass, but have recently heard from a number
of people I respect, some trainers, of creatine monohydrate.
Has anyone here in the extropian bodysculpting community
heard of this?  If so, have you any opinions?

I haven't tried it yet.  I'm told by a friend:

> ... Creatine Monohydrate is approximately 300 mg and costs $40.00;
> the manufacturer is Sports Pharma, out of Concord.

FYI, Concord is a city in the San Francisco bay area.

I should have said "unbounded growth"; even with a bound, you can of
course get growth if you asymptote.  And of course I meant growth in
resources used.

No question that you could still "grow" and learn by using a bounded
amount of computational hardware for an unbounded time.  But why not
use more hardware if you can?

I don't see what "transending" (whatever that means) has to do with
the basic evolutionary arguments I've offered.  The question isn't
about "needs", its about evolutionary pressures and "wants".  I'm
merely suggesting that if there are accessilbe resources, something
will evolve to use them.  And if there is a use competition between
leave-it-be-nature-watchers and pave-it-over-colonists, its hard to
see how the former would win over most of the universe.

You'll find it very hard to construct an argument for evolutionary
pressures toward this.

    Ye Squirrel formerly worked for MasPar Computer Corporation, which
made guess what...  We had what the market seemed to consider a very
good SIMD machine, with up to 16384 processors, each approximately
equivalent to an 8086 in processing power, connected in rectangular
array.  We had a couple of nice languages to program it in, too.
Unfortunately, there didn't seem to be enough market to support an
industry.  (When I say that the market seemed to consider our product
very good, I refer to comparison surveys about reliability,
programmability, and so on.)

    I quit MasPar in late '94; within six months they had stopped
producing hardware entirely, and are now -- renamed -- trying to
recover anything they can from a variety of software developed while
they were still producing hardware.

This is a pretty good theory.  But I have a problem with that "billion
light years" figure.  All non-conservationist civilization which
reached an explosion point within our past light cone, and not in the
future light cone of conservationist explosion events, would have to
be beat by the conservationists.  So you'd need a majority of
conservationists, and you'd need the failure to colonize to not be a
big military disadvantage.  Unlikely, it seems to me, but possible.

Well, the Braintennis at Wired has been interesting.  There may be
disadvantages to having Extropianism as the posterchild of
transhumanism: we attract all the newage.  How this list manages to so
much purer than alt.extropians or such Web discussions I don't know.

But Mark Stahlman's vituperation did help me crystallize my perception
of all this more, as reflected in my post, and I've been cohering some
more old thoughts, which I shall now share with you, hoping that I am
not mutating the original label too far myself.

"Extropianism need not be wedded to specific technologies, such as
nanotech or cryonics, or even to such speculations as the Singularity.
Extropianism is an attitude, like the Enlightenment.  In fact, in my
view Extropianism _is_ the Enlightenment, upgraded to incorporate new
key concepts.  Adam Smith's markets and Darwin's evolution [spontaneous
order] in addition to Newton's physics; computers and cellular automata
in addition to clocks; self-modification in addition to
self-understanding, now that the former is more conceivable; and atheism
and anarchy instead of Deism and benevolent despotism.  And belief in
universal education by the state, once a key progressive element of the
Enlightenment, has been abandoned in disillusionment.  Otherwise the
core is the same: acceptance of criticism, respect for individual choice
and diversity, and the materialist and liberal/libertarian worldview and
politics which scientific criticism and personal freedom have spawned."

I'm pretty sure this isn't incompatible with Extropianism.  Am I
diluting the latter too much, though, such that the above should be
called 'neo-Enlightenment' or something, or am I on target?

Welcome to the field of perinatal psychology. I believe there is an association
concerned with this topic; I recall a conference announcement many years
ago. There
is a book (Which I have not read), titled "Through a Different Doorway" (or
similar)
which is about the differences with Cesarian births.

I have discussed this topic with Stanislav Grof. His informal impressions
are that
C section people are closer to what is called Transpersonal experiences, and
less
well grounded. Not exactly study material here, but an impression of being less
"in the world" and more impractical.

>Some psychoanalysts make claims about the traumatic effects of birth. I'd

"LSD Psychotherapy" by Stanislav Grof is the primary work in this field.
It is now available in paperback, and I highly recommend it.

All of this stuff is tied together. Birth and Death are closely connected; 
Grof maintains that the birth process involves a close encounter with death.

I doubt this one. I once saw a note in Science News (3-6 years ago) reporting
a study concerning medical life threatening emergencies and NDEs. There were
four combinations:

    Real Emergency, Patient aware of it    = NDE
    Real Emergency, Patient unaware        = no NDE
    Not Emergency, Patient thinks real     = NDE
    Not Emergency, Patient thinks not real = no NDE

I read in two different sources that Penfield in his brain stimulation
experiments
discovered in the Sylvan Fissure a location which induced NDEs.

Ronald Siegel has a book on psychedelic patterens, including tunnel visions.

I have a paper (under a pile somewhere) which discusses white light experiences
as related to anoxia in the brain via the Circle of Willits. Anoxia also causes
tunnel vision. Some Yogic breathing exercises induce anoxia.

Ketamine at 1.5 mg/kg (about 2x the usual psychedelic dose, about 15% of the
surgical dose) induces experiences very similiar to NDEs. Unfortunately there 
is a lot of ammnesia in these expereinces (unless done at the peak of LSD). My
expereinces reminded me a lot of the bardo states described in the Tibetan Book
of the Dead.
>

My standard argument is that if there is a brain structure which promotes NDEs,
this is evolutionarily plausible as NDEs will serve to knit tribal social
structures
together which is a strong survival plus. The NDE itself is just another meme,
burdened with the overwhelming experince of its being the ultimate reality. Sort
of like the volume set at 200% of like Totally Real. Those without experience
of rational thinking will tend to accept this without quesion, and once this
meme
is imprinted, little can be done about it.

I see freedom as the ability to choose among alternatives without limitations
imposed by irrationality. However, making choices involves enduring
consequences,
and many of these consequences are not easily estimated. The antidote to
undesired unexpected consequences is making further choices. This is a dynamic
process, well captured in the term "surfing".

The term "maximum" is poorly defined, like other words, such as "God". I presume
you mean something like best match between consequences and desire. This also
changes a lot. When I drive a car on a mountain road, my car is always tending
to leave the road, which I always correct. Hence "feedback".

Might I suggest the word "best", as in our beloved slogan.....

          What do you mean? If there are only finitely many states, 
          you would sooner or later either come back to an earlier 
          state or reach a stasis. So you mean that the bound is not

          (Off topic: This has an associative connection to the claim 
          made by Anders a couple of weeks ago (Re:The Dividing 
          Neuron), and recently cited by Crosby_M, that there is no 
          correlation between intelligence and the number of neurons 
          in the brain. That is almost certainly false. I have seen 
          estimates ranging from .1 to .3 for the correlation between 
          human head size and IQ. Brain weight correlates even 
          stronger. It therefore seems reasonable to suppose that 
          #neurons also correlates significantly with IQ. My guess is 
          that if one would count the neurons in the different areas 
          of the brain and weigh these numbers with those areas' 
          contribution to general intelligence, one would come up with 
          a correlation coefficient of at least .3 or .4.)

Your last thought is exactly on-target: there is very little point in trying to 
debate Stahlman. I know, I've tried.

Stahlman was indeed active on the DigitaLiberty list, until his off-topic, 
rambling and flame-bait posts finally got him kicked off.  This was an extreme 
measure for a liberty-oriented list, but well-justified in this case.  He often 
came off as well-read, intelligent, and utterly incapable of drawing reasonable 
conclusions from anything he had learned.  I hope he doesn't join this list now 
that ::exclude is history; according to Bill Frezza, dozens of people cited 
Stahlman's noise as the reason for unsubscribing from DigitaLiberty.  Also, the 
DemocracyNow mailing list seriously debated booting him after only two posts.

Some of his posts were about CIA-driven social-control research in the 1950s, 
the conspiracy by Newt Gingrich and Alvin Toppler to rule the world, and why 
Christianity has historically been the driving force behind capitalism.  He also 
seems to know a bit about objectivism and libertarian philosophy.  His outlook 
on the latter can be summarized as Freedom=Slavery.

BTW, DigitaLiberty does still exist, but it is very quiet and has frequent tech 
problems. Let me know if anyone wants back on the list and I'll dig up the info.

Max told me this article was coming out, and so I picked up an issue 
as soon as I saw it.  I was very impressed.  For one thing, there 
is a picture (!) of Max on the "Up Front" editorial page, and it's a 
great picture.  One thing in particular I noticed was that Max's pose 
clearly (conveniently? cleverly?) features a stainless steel wrist 
bracelet (his Alcor bracelet).

I have been reading Muscle & Fitness since Max turned me onto it a 
couple of years ago (it really is a good magazine), and so I was 
quite proud to see an article by him and a picture of him appear 
there.  But I was overjoyed to see the cryonics bracelet sneak into 
the *editorial* page of the magazine.  How about it Max?  Are you 
being as clever as I suspect here?  Secretly preparing the rest of 
the world for the future, even at the level of sneaking symbols of 
immortality into the subconsciouses of unsuspecting readers?
 
I know some will say that I'm making too big a deal out of this, and 
perhaps it's only important to me.  But I just thought it was one of 
the coolest things I'd seen in a long time.

Well, my body ain't built yet, but I aspire to it, definitely.  The 
battle for me is against evolutionarily enhanced genes which scream 
SAVE UP FOR THE FAMINE!!  (Meaning, store all the fat possible.)  But 
I am optimistic, and lifting weights has definitely enhanced my life 
in many ways, even if not yet via total conquest and control of my 
body composition.

If you don't mind my asking, what is your present weight?  Was
your pre-creatine weight a recent plateau, or had you been gaining
weight steadily?

Interesting stuff.  I'll like to see some references, though.  However,
I _am_ familiar with at least one of the metrics Sahelian cites for
metabolic effect: urinary creatinine clearance.  I used to test
for the substance among older, sedentary people who had experienced
some type of skeletal muscle insult or trauma, way back when I
was a lab tech.  I may add "before" & "during" serum & urine
creatinine (post-creatine metabolic byproduct) tests to my assessment
of creatine's efficacy in my routine.

Interesting approach.  I do a similar thing, in taking carb-loading

Your 580 lb on the leg press is close to what I'm doing on the
same exercise, though I don't think I've reached my plateau for
that on my present regimen.  I _am_ stuck at 198 lb of bodyweight,
and am interested to see if creatine & exercise would make a difference
(present target: 205 lb bodyweight).  I'll need to read some more
before I start it.  Also, before trying it in earnest, I plan a
fitness evaluation to determine present states of weight, percentage
bodyfat, cardiovascular fitness, and dimensions of major muscle
groups.

It's my favorite sport, too.  And it seems to be the one most
conducive to a prolongevitist lifestyle, as well as having
- for me - very aesthetically appealing results.

You already know I am, but I had to respond to your post because body
building (weight lifting) is my favorite sport and I utilize sculpting the
body in its direct relationship to Automorph art.  

By the way, I recently rented the film "Pumping Iron".  I recommend it.

I have been taking it for about 1.5 months and have put on four pounds of
body mass.  I have noticed that my muscle growth is continuing, and
apparently the four pounds is muscle - as I have not put on any fat.  (I'm
cautious about this.)

Dr. Ray Sahelian has information about creatine on his Web site:

http://www.primenet.com/~sahelian

"Creatine is a natural nutrient found in our bodies and the bodies of most
animals. Approximately 95% of the body's creatine supply is found in the
skeletal muscles. The remaining 5% is scattered throughout the rest of the
body, with the highest concentrations in the heart, brain and testes. 

"Creatine has also been shown to enhance your body's ability to make
proteins, especially the proteins within the muscle fibers. Two of these
proteins, actin and myosin, are essential to all muscle contraction. So when
you build up your supply of these contractile proteins, you actually
increase your muscle's ability to perform physical work. And the more work
you do (whether it's lifting weights or running 100-meter dashes), the
stronger you become over time."

I take one heaping teaspoon full 1/2 to 1 hour before heading to the gym.
The psychological effect is positive in that I push more weight and focus my
sets because I want to work in tandem with the creatine.

The downside, for me as an example, is that I get a stomach ache after
taking the creatine.  This could be because I usually take it on an empty
stomach, and because I don't like the taste of it, I mix it with cranberry
juice.

Apart from the suggested items to bring listed in the invitation, Jerome
reminded me to ask party-goers to bring sleeping bags in case you want to
stay overnight. Last time (three years ago) it looked liked Jonestown,
except that everyone got up again in the morning.

Jerome expects the party to go from Noon Saturday to Noon Sunday, and
welcomes you to stay overnight, but you will need to bring something to
sleep in/on (or hanging from, whatever works for you...).

Also, bring CDs of music you think partiers might like. There's the

I have been taking it for about 1.5 months and have put on four pounds of
body mass.  I have noticed that my muscle growth is continuing, and
apparently the four pounds is muscle - as I have not put on any fat.  (I'm
cautious about this.)

Dr. Ray Sahelian has information about creatine on his Web site:

http://www.primenet.com/~sahelian

"Creatine is a natural nutrient found in our bodies and the bodies of most
animals. Approximately 95% of the body's creatine supply is found in the
skeletal muscles. The remaining 5% is scattered throughout the rest of the
body, with the highest concentrations in the heart, brain and testes. 

"Creatine has also been shown to enhance your body's ability to make
proteins, especially the proteins within the muscle fibers. Two of these
proteins, actin and myosin, are essential to all muscle contraction. So when
you build up your supply of these contractile proteins, you actually
increase your muscle's ability to perform physical work. And the more work
you do (whether it's lifting weights or running 100-meter dashes), the
stronger you become over time."

I take one heaping teaspoon full 1/2 to 1 hour before heading to the gym.
The psychological effect is positive in that I push more weight and focus my
sets because I want to work in tandem with the creatine.

The downside, for me as an example, is that I get a stomach ache after
taking the creatine.  This could be because I usually take it on an empty
stomach, and because I don't like the taste of it, I mix it with cranberry
juice.

You already know I am, but I had to respond to your post because body
building (weight lifting) is my favorite sport and I utilize sculpting the
body in its direct relationship to Automorph art.  

By the way, I recently rented the film "Pumping Iron".  I recommend it.

Why is this mailinglist SOOOOO focused on uploading? There are *MANY* other
extropian subjects but uploading seems to get most of the attention. What if
perhaps uploading fails? We should have a whole set of other methods we can
use to back it up just in case. Numero uno rule: Always have a plan B, C, D,
etc. For example, what about studying those children who suffer from rapid
aging to learn if the genes altered in these children control the rate of
aging and how we can change these in ourselves to counter the effects of
aging and potentially extend our lives hundreds of years. We should focus on
topics such as these as well so that if uploading fails to become a reality
we will still have an immediate backup we can fall back upon without having
to start discussion all over again for a different process.

I've heard of a theory which I believe was in Discover magazine which
explained how Mars lost a thick atmosphere which could've allowed the liquid
water to form which carved out all the canyons on the planet. They said a
asteroid slammed into Mars and shot debris along with a large chunk of the
atmosphere out into space. Could this be the same impact that caused that
rock containing the fossils to be shot into space and land on Earth? Am I
mistaken or have people simply not put two and two together yet.

I agree, it does blow the mind. Sorry to post a "me too" answer but I
believe that these are the truest words I've heard in a longtime. If we hold
faith (hate this word) in spontaneous orders and evolution because they've
always had results eventually leading to what we call good aspects then I
guess you could say that it doesn't matter what occurs, the good memes will
survive.

It doesn't that all really matter whether it's true or not because I am
willing to bet my life that we will find fossils on Mars and this evidence
whether real or fake may help us to get funding to send probes to Mars to
uncover real fossils (if these are false).

Yes! It works! I'm also highly skeptical about these things, and have never
seen results from other substances, such as chromium picolinate. However, I
decided to try creatine after Dr. Ray Sahelian, who is coming out with a
short book on the stuff (see the forthcoming Extropy for a review), did some
research and said it looked promising.

After two months using it, I gained about 10 lbs. Usually I gain much more
slowly, having been stable at around 183 lbs for months. I'm now 193 lbs. I
don't think much, if any of it is fat. Possibly some may be extra fluid
retention, though I have no particular reason to think so. Certainly my
strength has increased considerably. E.g., I've gone from 580 lbs to 650 lbs
on the leg press, and from 80 lbs to 110 lbs (for 15 reps) on the barbell curl.

I'm happy with the results!

You can get a kilo for $80, or 450 g for about $45. Ray's book gives
guidelines for dosing. I got my from Lindberg/Nutrition Express: 1-800-338-7979

Get a bigger body to go along with that bigger brain!

The BrainTennis debate on HotWired regarding becoming posthuman is in full
swing. According to the Associate Producer of Wired Online, the debate has
generated more comments for the stage it's at than any other to date. If you
haven't yet joined in on the Threads, I hope you will. Sasha Chislenko has
made some excellent comments, showing where the anti-transhumanists go
wrong, as has David Musick.

The debate is so popular that HotWired asked Paulina and I to record a half
hour verbal continuation of the debate next week. I believe other people
will also be able to add questions. The result will be available from
HotWired to anyone with RealAudio.

I don't know how many people are hearing about transhumanism due to this
debate, but I understand there are 400,000 subscribers to HotWired (and
those are only the number who have formally registered, not the total number
of readers).

Present weight is at 114.  My weight was at a stand-still of 102 for several
years.  Then, when I started adding more muscle, it went to 108 - 111 and
has remained between these few pound fluctuation (pending on female cycle,
etc.). After starting to take the creatine, I put on the four pounds and it
has remained fairly constant (per female cycle plus or minus ounces).  I
have had a very difficult time putting on weight, regardless of my physical
excercise type.  Because I am an athlete, I have needed to keep a solid
weight (without fat.)

Yes, and certainly adds to the tummy ache.  I plan to be more careful in the

try your friend's grape juice.

IAN: If "individual liberty" needs to be qualified at all, 
perhaps one of these options would be most appropriate:

        universal individual liberty
        ultimate  individual liberty
        complete  individual liberty
        total     individual liberty
        more      individual liberty
        100%      individual liberty

I like "total individual liberty" the most.

IAN: Resulting from meditational practices, I've had the white light 
experience on several occasions. I was also born C section. I never 
saw a tunnel. Keep in mind that people have "seen the light" long 
before C-births, which is not say there is no connection. 

The while light experience is profound beyond words. More meaningful 
and glorious and anything else. It is like absolute 100% ecstasy 
filling every inch of all space and time. It is often accompanied
by heavy crying, but crying in ecstacy; very strange because crying 
is usually associated with pain.

I carefully observe and try to explain the nature of all I experience. 
Recently I made what may be an important observation regarding the white
light experience: you may observe that as you are falling asleep there 
are amorphous cloud-like patterns that swim around before your eyes, often
following a repeating pattern. If you've ever had a lucid dream you'll 
notice that it is the "stuff" that these "clouds" are made of -- millions 
of very small luminous particles -- that will suddenly "crystallize" into 
the life-like structures that compose the objects that inhabit dreams. 
Seeing this happen is quite wondrous; truly the brain is amazing.

Well, what I observed is that the "white light" is composed of these 
luminous dream particles; yet, unlike pre-dreaming and dreaming, they 
fill every portion of one's vision with maximum and uniform luminosity. 
I've observed this quite clearly, seeing the transition from none, to 
many of the particles to their filling all vision -- with eyes closed.

Obviously this suggests a biological, as opposed to "spiritual" (whatever 
that is) basis of the experience. However, how do we say that biological 
is not also this called "spiritual" ? What is, is what is.

I believe that these particles of light are directly associated with 
neurotransmitters and that the white light is a neurotransmitter overload,
or 100% maximum neurotransmitter cascade. I also suspect that the white
light may happen when/if the synaptic gap is closed. 

I share my observations because I think they might contain important 
facts about the brain, the white light experience, consciousness,
and reality.

IAN: The fact that the white light experience is derived from the brain 
does not mean knowledge derived from the experience is false. In fact, 
assuming such would mean that all knowledge, being a derivative of 
neurological activity, is false. Furthermore, it is possible that 
in a neurotransmitter cascade, IQ reachs its maximum.

How can we know if the "wisdom of the light" is true? Simple: if it 
is consistent with physical evidence and logical inference. 

Physical phenomena and logic dictate that the knowledge gained during 
the white light experience -- that all things are unitary -- is valid.

How so ?

Every identity and every attribute of every identity is relative and
complimentary. Thing A implies not-A, as not-A implies A. There could 
be no A free from not-A. A and not-A are conceptually and physically
interdependent.

	IF: X is a part of A, if X is necessary for the existence of A,
	THEN not-A, being necessary for A, is a part of A.

	IF not-A is a part of A,
	IF A is a part of not-A,
	THEN both A and not-A have the same parts.

	IF x has the same parts as y,
	THEN x = y
	ERGO A = not-A.

That is the "wisdom of the light." All things are unified absolutely.

Also: the external space around a particle is a necessary feature of the
identity / existence of that particle. Thus the space around a particle
is a part of the particle. As this is true for every particle, it follows
that every particle contains every other particle across all space-time.

Unless one can describe or show an example of a nonrelationally dependent 
thing / concept / identity, there is no basis in logic or fact to suggest 
that the knowledge gained in the white light experience is false. The 
"wisdom of the light" passes the most rigid standard of scientific 
verification -- total consistency with physical fact and logical
inference.

I wanted to post some replies, but for some reason, apart from the one I

          I my opinion Cheer Leader Anders missed out one of our most 
          serious vices in his list (posted on the >H mailing list) 
          over the weakneses of the transhumanist movement: 
          Dilettantism.
          
          Robin Hanson has complained about this recently. There are 
          so many people who think they know something:they make very 
          strong claims -and in many cases they don't even have a 
          first degree in the subject!
          
          I realise that when it comes to fields that are not covered 
          by the academic curriculum, one has to relax one's standards 
          somewhat. But this does not mean that we should tolerate 
          ignorance or that we should lower our aims. To the contrary, 
          we should work towards the degree of discipline and 
          responsibility that characterise the top 20% of the academic 
          community. We certainly have a long way to go, but if we do 
          enough progress we can hope that the academic establishment 
          will take over when we have carried it through half way. 
          
          People in other "movements", especially our opponents, are 
          often worse than we are. So what.

No, I don't think we are. My apologies for misunderstanding you Sarah.

The recent discussion on spontaneous order encouraged me to do more thinking
about whether Spontaneous Order should be one the Extropian Principles. I've
been considering removing that as a principle for well over a year now. The
confusion about the idea, its lack of immediate comprehensibility by most
people (anyone without a substantial theoretical background in certain
areas), and the lack of clarity in the concept (e.g. it might imply that
Extropians like *all* spontaneous orders and their products), have all led
me to decide that it's time to remove this as a Principle.

I've been thinking about the structure of the next version of the Principles
since v. 2.5 were completed. Version 3.0 should be done before long. What to
do about Spontaneous Order has been one of the delays. I've now decided:
Spontaneous Order will be replaced be the Principle of: Self-Ownership.

I was anticipating an expansion in the number of principles from five to
probably seven. Peter Voss made the good point that it's hard to remember
more than four or five items in a list for most people. I now think there
may be only *four* principles in version 3.0, but with sub-principles,
values, and ideas, subsumed within each principle. I intend the new
structure to make it much easier to explain the essentials of extropian
thinking.

More later...

Upward and Outward!

          But this is not an academic journal, this is a mailing list 
          for all sorts of people interested in transhumanism. We do 
          not only discuss scientific questions, but also art, values,

          I would make that "top 5%". Haven't you seen enough 
          academics to realise how many narrow-minded fools there are 
          at the universities. Even if we could persuade them that 
          radical future technologies are worth thinking about, do you 
          really believe that a person who need to be _persuaded_ 
          about that could have a significant capacity of judgement 
          and would be able to contribute original ideas to the 
          discussion of fundamental transhumanist issues?

          Well, it gives us a justification for trying to spread our 
          views. And for this we will need all our energy and 
          enterprising drive, all the multifarious skills of the 
          various persons on these lists. In truth, I tell you: the 
          transhumanist movement is a boiling kettle, and amongst the 
          steams I discern the shapes of a mighty spirit in the 
          process of formation, an idea whose time has come...

as much of the taxpayers money as he can get his greedy little 
hands on. As The Washington Post (8/19/96, A1) reports:

        VALLEY FORGE, Pa. Aug. 18 -- Billionaire Ross
        Perot accepted the presidential nomination of
        his new Reform Party tonight [ which evidence 
        suggests may have been rigged ] and surprised 
        his loyal followers by announcing that he will 
        accept federal funds and contributions from 
        individuals for his campaign instead of 
        bankrolling it himself.

Ross Perot then condemned both Dole and Clinton for receiving 
contributions from political action campaigns. Perot said, 
"It is wrong. These guys are bought and paid for by the 
special interests." Of course tax consuming billionaire 
Ross Perot expects to be paid for by YOU -- whether 
you like it or not. 

Responding to Dole's claim to cut taxes, Perot said, "We 
tried it in the '80s and it didn't work." Right, greedy 
tax feeders like Perot gobbled up rising revenues twice 
as fast as they came in, hence the debt. Perot continued
blasting tax cuts saying, "There's no free candy, no free 
lunch." Except, that is, for Ross Perot a la the taxpayers.

If Ross Perot stands against the corrupt Washington D.C.
establishment, why is he defending its claim to seize 
your property? It doesn't take a genius to see through
this transparent tax-consuming con man.


ALAS, THERE IS A SIGN OF HOPE ------

The first and only presidential candidate to qualify for 
federal campaign matching funds and yet turn down this 
opportunity to plunder the taxpayers is the Libertarian 
Party candidate, Harry Browne. Principle over parasitic 
public plunder. Surely, among the presidential candidates 
the Libertarian Harry Browne stands alone on the moral 
high ground. But is moral high ground what voters, 
such as yourself, want?

Please assure me: the choice of "Self-Ownership" isn't being

No. If there are to be only four principles, how would I still get BEST DO
IT SO out of that?! Unfortunately, the new abbreviation looks likes it will
be: BIDOITSO. Not exactly a catchy, though it might sound intriguingly
Japanese. :-)  Since there will (probably) be only four principles, having a
memorable acronym ceases to have much importance.

When I post more about the proposed revisions to the Principles, I'll
explain several reasons for choosing "Self-Ownership." The BI in BIDO ITSO
stands for "Boundless Improvement" instead of the current "Boundless
Expansion". I'll explain that soon too.

Mars has had many impacts, so the odds of them being the same impact are
remote. Besides, Discover didn't report that a single impact blew off the
atmosphere.

The impact that threw out ALH84001 was 15 million years ago. The water
features are older, as determined by the number of impacts on top of them
(3.5 billion years, according to

I an sending this to both the Extropian and Transhuman list because I think 
everyone should read Robin's  fine article.
 

Robin Hanson has published a very interesting article on the Web called  
"The Great Filter" ( http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/greatfilter.html). 
Robin argues, correctly I think, that if intelligent life is not somehow 
destroyed then eventually it will explode into the universe and make it's 
existence  obvious even on the Cosmological scale. He lists 7 stages that 
must happen before this happens.
      
1. Reproductive something (e.g. RNA) 
2. Simple single-cell life
3. Complex single-cell life 
4. Multi-cell life 
5. Animals with big brains 
6. Where we are now  
7. Explosion 
    
Robin then notes that there is not the slightest evidence for intelligent 
life except on the earth (The Fermi Paradox) so one of these stages must be 
very difficult to pass through. If the roadblock happens somewhere in the  
first 6 stages then we've already made it through and there is reason for 
optimism. If the trouble is between stage 6 and 7 then be afraid, be very 
afraid, most don't make it through. If this is the case then the problem is  
probably not one we've imagined, probably not one we can imagine. If the 
recent talk about bacteria on Mars turns out to be true that means the first 
2 stages are easy to get through, not a good sign.
 
in spite of this I have a hunch the bottleneck is in the first 6 stages, I 
sure hope so. I want to talk a little about stages 5 and 6. Arthur C Clarke 
wrote a short story about a  race of noble horse like beings who had 
developed a complex and beautiful philosophy, possessed profound mathematical 
ideas, and were more intelligent than humans,  but they had no technology
because the had no hands. Dolphins and whales in our world have very large 
brains, but not only are they lacking hands they have other handicaps they 
must overcome. If you live underwater you can't know anything about fire, an 
essential ingredient in technology.  Also, It's hard enough to deduce the 
basic laws of Physics living in an atmosphere, most of the laws are only
really obvious in a vacuum,  surely a bizarre concept for any life form 
living in a thick heavy medium like water.  " What do you mean objects move 
in a straight line at a constant speed unless acted upon by an outside force?  
What do you mean all objects fall to earth with the same acceleration 
regardless of size of weight? Any fool can see that's not true."
 
Elsewhere intelligent beings could have other problems. It took an 
Isaac Newton, who has a good claim on being the smartest man who ever lived, 
to deduce the  laws of gravitation from the motion of the planets, 
but Newton had it easy.  The sun is unusual, it has no companion, 
most stars consist of 2 or more suns of roughly equal mass revolving about 
each other. The orbit of any planets in such a system would be so horribly
complex that even Newton wouldn't be smart enough to figure it out.

Max has suggested that v.3.0 of the Extropian Principles will rely on the
rather exotic-sounding acronym, BIDOITSO (Boundless Improvement, Dynamic
Optimism, Intelligent Technology, and Self-Ownership).

Because I place great importance on effective mnemonic devices, and love
wordplay, I've come up with some alternatives to "Boundless Improvement" that
preserve the phrase's meaning but provide stickier acronyms.

I offer three alternatives, together with suggested mnemonic devices:

LI = limitless improvement
   SO LIBIDO!

UP = unlimited/unbounded  progress/perfecting
   DO IT SO UP!
   UP! DO IT SO!
   SO? DO IT! UP!!

BE = boundless evolution/enhancement
   DO IT! BE SO!

Here's something I just posted in the BrainTennis thread that's associated 
with the debate between Max More and Paulina Luddite (I forgot her real last 
name, so I renamed her appropriately) about the "costs" of Transhumanism.  I 
thought this would be of some interest / inspiration  to those who haven't 
read it on HotWired's site:

It's quite humorous for me to read the postings of the Luddites and other 
conservatives in this "debate".  So much like children, playing the same games 
over and over, never wanting to try new things.  They decry the changes that 
Extropians and other adventurous beings seek out... as though their cries for 
stagnation could halt the chaotic and uncontrollable processes of Evolution.
	Conservatism used to be a valid survival trait, when the world was pretty 
much the same for thousands of years at a time.  To deviate much from the 
finely-tuned, traditional ways of life usually meant death.  Now things have 
changed.  And so must we, to survive.  Now, and much more so in the coming 
years, people and other systems must adapt quickly to the fast and 
accellerating changes in our reality.
	Conservatives will be left behind with all the other extinct species.  
Countries like China resisted change for a long time, but they could not 
withstand the pressures to become industrialized.  They could not have 
survived without doing so.  Likewise, many business people have had to use 
modern technologies, such as the portable computer and the cellular phone, 
just to remain competetive.  In the coming years, people will likely have to 
augment their abilities with such things as biochip implants which connect 
their thoughts directly to computers which are linked to the vast computer 
networks that will exist throughout the Earth, and possibly beyond.  You may 
resist and recoil from these ideas, but in time, they will make a great deal 
of sense to you, and you will happily join the other successful people who 
will have tried out these technologies and proven their superiority.  To 
survive, you will need to adapt to the world; if not, you will simply be left 
behind with all the other conservatives.  
	You may think that these fantastic ideas we Extropians embrace will not be 
possible.  Most people of a hundered years ago would have doubted the 
possiblility of most of the activities we consider commonplace.  The 
visionaries of the past, like the current visionaries, were ridiculed, but 
they were right.  Humans have a tendency to seriously underestimate what is 
truly possible.  
	Humans are developing more and more powerful abilities to alter their 
environments and their selves.  Those who take advantage of new and more 
powerful technologies have always and will continue to be much more successful 
than those who don't.
	Some people in this discussion think an uploaded being will be inferior to 
humans.  They have no understanding of the possibilities.  An uploaded being 
will have the ability to simulate the experience of human life for itself, in 
all of its wonderful and agonizing detail.  It could experience everything we 
ourselves experience.  But so much more....  Some Transhumans will be able to 
experience millions of different human lifetimes, in as much rich detail as 
humans actually do - even more, if they want to, and they can live all those 
millions of lifetimes in only a few days or minutes (our time).  The 
possibilities are endless....
	Some people think that uploaded transhumans will be located in some single 
box or mainframe computer, and that they could be unplugged or destroyed 
easily.  This is very incorrect.  Uploaded Transhumans will distribute their 
selves throughout many computer networks.  It will be as impossible (actually 
much more impossible) to precisely locate the Uploaded Transhuman as it is to 
locate your "self" in your brain; your self is distributed all throughout your 
brain.  Transhumans will also distribute themselves as far as they can through 
whatever means are available.  They will take care of themselves, controlling 
very advanced machines to maintain, defend and expand the hardware that they 
exist in.  It will be very difficult for them to die off or be killed off.  
Taking down a few machines that they are using to live, will be sort of like 
killing a few of your brain cells.  But the Transhumans will be able to 
regenerate themselves much more easily than you can regenerate dead brain 
cells.  They can also use machines to burrow deep into the Earth and build 
extensive computer networks beyond the reach of any disgruntled humans.  They 
will be far superior, in every way, to mere humans.  As wonderful as we humans 
are now, we haven't even come close to our true potential.  We have nothing to 
lose but our limitations.
	Whether you like it or not, the type of things we Extropians are talking 
about WILL happen.  Evolution doesn't stop.  It will relentlessly continue and 
cast off all who can't or refuse to keep up.  We don't really care whether the 
luddites and other conservatives agree with us and support our endeavors or 
not.  We're just letting you know what's coming.  If or how you deal with it 
is up to you.  You can keep your limitations, if you wish, but ultimately, 
they will cost you your existence.

True.  But the analogy of an immune system is misleading, it implies 
that logical thought is somehow above other memes and acts as a 
controlling system.  Logic itself is a meme, and it opperates on the 
same level as religious memes.  Different maps for different chaps, 
different semantic funnels for different reality tunnels.

High,

I`m a 1st year Comp. Sci. student at the University of the Orange 
Free State,  Bleomfontein, South Africa.  I have been  on the 
transhuman mailing list for some months now and enjoy the new and  
optomistic ideas shared.  

My ideas are absolutely subjective, I don`t use "IMHO" since 
erything I ever say, can only be from my point of view.  My memetic 
zoo currently gives a home to the following critters: evolution 
(Dawkins), strong AI, nanotach, strong A-Life, ambient music and 
beethoven.  They continually come out and play  :-)

As I mentioned in the paper, a big problem with this theory is the
cosmologically short time it took our ancestors to go through these
stages.  If this step was so astronomically improbable, why did it
happen so quickly after the previous step?  Can land-dwelling
creatures really be that improbable (given multi-cell life)?

Please don't take this personally, but I think that statements like this
(especially the last sentence, which sounds _very_ threatening) are
counterproductive; they  will most likely offend, scare, and further
polarize the 'luddites and conservatives' against us. While some of these
people are probably beyond reconsidering their views, some of them might
change or moderate their views if they are tactfully interacted with.

>We don't really care whether the

If (partially as a result of being antagonized or feeling threatened?) these
people go beyond not supporting our activities and actively try to prevent
transhumans  from evolving, I will certainly care about it. I plan on
persuing life-extension treatments and other enhancements regardless of the
obstacles, but I would prefer things to be openly available. 

I know that it takes a lot of effort to interact with people who appear to
be devoid of rational thought without getting flustered, but I think that we
should be careful to keep tactics such as ridicule and threats out of our
end of the communication process.

The online magazine Slate has an amusing piece by Microsoft VP and ubermind
Nathan Myhrvold on the implications of finding life on Mars. Nothing really
new to most readers of this list, but I found it witty. Also encouraging
that he referred to the US government as "the least effective of all entities".

I agree with you Douglas. I know what David was saying and I understand and
appreciate it, but the way he said it will certainly cause mental barriers
to go up. I checked the HotWired threads (up to a record 90 now) this
morning and saw exactly the kinds of reactions you could predict. The
frustrating "cult" accusation has popped up again. I'll compose a response
to it this afternoon.

Again, I encourage Extropians List subscribers to get involved with the
discussion on Threads. On Friday at 11am pst you can also join Paulina and
myself for a live discussion/debate.

Since I wear my cryonics bracelet with pride, and it's part of the way I
live, it will tend to show up in photos and on TV. I doubt readers of Muscle
and Fitness will have a clue that it's a cryonics bracelet. I sent then that
picture because I thought it appropriate. The cryonics bracelet showing is a
nice touch and a natural result of my being open about being a head-freezer,
but I can't say I set out to deliberately create a photo with the bracelet
showing for that purpose.

I've noticed that some cryonicists hide their bracelets or necklaces, or
cover them up in certain company. I find that understandable in certain
situations, although I've never felt that need. In general it's good to let
it all hang out, since it can spark questions that allow you to get people
thinking. No one's ever punched me or screamed at me for explaining the
bracelet, so I don't think it's too dangerous. :-)

	I am interested in the possibilities presented by the future
technologies which interest Extropians.  Enough so, that I consider myself
an Extropian.

	However, many Extropians seem blithely unaware that, in all
likelihood, the State is going to monopolize and/or regulate these
technologies for the Elite for at least the foreseeable future and/or
pervert them for use in further collectivisation of society.

	"We", unless "we" are billionaires and politically well connected
ones to boot, might as well forget these dramatic technologies as far as
our own lives our concerned.  Well, perhaps I should except life extension
through nutrition, but ever there, GATT threatens to outlaw supplements
world-wide!

	As only a few on this list want to face, the Pentagon and CIA are
pursuing vigorously every imaginable technology and will be the firstest
with the mostest!  Brain implants are more likely to be used to make
docile slaves than open up possibilities for liberation of the individual.

I take it that notions such as "limitless improvement" or "unlimited
progress" necessarily imply self transformation, and that this can be
explained in the accompanying text, right? I can see some advantages of
dropping self transformation from the mnemonic set, but I'd hate to abandon
the idea entirely.

I do prefer the phrase "limitless improvement" to the phrase "boundless
improvement", but I'm a bit wary of the proposed mnemonic.

I prefer "limitless" to "boundless" because the wording of the BIDOITSO set
still leaves open the deplorable (but oft used) rhetorical tactic of
accusing extropians of boundless optimism. For some reason, "limitless
optimism" seems like a phrase that will tempt our opponents slightly less
often than the phrase "boundless optimism" has tempted them.

I'm wary of this particular mnemonic because extropians are already being
accused of being sex maniacs in other forums. On the other hand, perhaps
this tactic of some of our opponents will just help us recruit new members
more effectively.  ;)


>UP = unlimited/unbounded  progress/perfecting
>   DO IT SO UP!
>   UP! DO IT SO!
>   SO? DO IT! UP!!

I like "unlimited progress"... it's frank and to the point, and ties
extropian ideas a little more closely to their classical-liberal roots than
"limitless improvement". Of course, it will lead a lot of opponents to whip
out their tired old arguments against the "inevitable progress" ideas of
Condorcet and the like, but perhaps the fine distinction between the
possibility of unlimited progress, on the one hand, and the old bad idea of
*inevitable* progress, on the other, is something we ought to be discussing
more, since I've seen some confusion about it, and intimations of
inevitability are what the "California Ideology" essay objected to most
strongly.

I like "unlimited perfecting" because it reminds me of things that I like
about Buddhism (the paramitas), but that's probably a personal taste not
widely shared by other extropians and potential extropians.

Of the three proposed mnemonics for this one, I like UP! DO IT SO! best.


>BE = boundless evolution/enhancement
>   DO IT! BE SO!

I don't care for "boundless evolution" at all, because I think it's
important to keep the biologists, who realize that "evolution" is a
value-neutral term.

"Boundless enhancement" is okay, but I prefer the phrases suggested for the
UP mnemonic. The word "boundless" seems to be attracted by a powerful
gravitational force to the word "optimism", and my subjective opinion is
that "unlimited" and "limitless" are not quite so likely to get sucked into
the gravitational field of "optimism".

I'd like to raise the precision of this discussion a bit, focusing on what
seems to me the most likely candidate for the Great Filter in the past. In
the latest version of your paper, you mention that  of the itemized steps,
the one that took the longest span of time (about two billion years, if
prokaryotes originated on Earth) was the jump from simple to complex
single-cell life. Am I safe in assuming that this means the same thing as
the jump from prokaryotic to eukaryotic life?

Given the Mars life evidence, which seems to be purely prokaryotic, we
could even conjecture that the universe is strewn with prokaryotic life,
and that the stuff has been scattering around by panspermia since shortly
after the Big Bang cooled.

Then the only prima facie evidence we seem to have indicates that the Great
Filter is probably the jump from prokaryotic to eukaryotic life. The only
evolutionary model of this jump that I know of is Lynn Margulis's
endosymbiotic theory.

For a non-authoritative background discussion, you might look at

        http://dekalb.dc.peachnet.edu/~pgore/students/w96/joshbond/symb.htm

noting that Kwang Jeon's results were obtained with amoebas, organisms
which had *already* learned the trick of endosymbiosis. Spontaneous origin
of endosymbiosis among *prokaryotes* seems unlikely to me for the following
hunch-ridden reasons.

Consider that all prokaryotic life is going to have some sort of immune
system or digestive system (these specialized terms, devised for
multicellular eukaryotes, would both metaphorically apply to the single and
much simpler moneran system I'm talking about here). Consider that ordinary
selection pressure would push for the ruthless effectiveness of that
system. Consider that the ability to utilize "internal symbiotes" such as
mitochondria and the like could develop only in the event of what amounts
to a drastic *failure* of that system. It seems to me that by the very
nature of "immune systems", especially in very simple organisms such as
prokaryotes, the vast majority of such failures are going to be lethal
mutations.

The jump from prokaryotic to eukaryotic life, then, would be a mutation or
a sequence of mutations that resulted in a nonlethal total failure of the
prokaryotic immune system. This notion seems sufficiently paradoxical to me
that I'm content, for the time being, to identify the jump from prokaryote
to eukaryote as the Great Filter.

But then, perhaps I'm just being a dynamic optimist.  ;)  Counterexamples
to my notion might include deliberate suppression of the human immune
system to enable organ transplants. But this, of course, is a consequence
of memetic evolution. Within the pure context of genetic evolution, I
suspect that nonlethal total failures of the "immune system" among
organisms as simple as prokaryotes would be extremely rare.

The other possible counterargument, as Robin points out, is that the
mutation took only two billion years (on Earth) to happen. But if the
prokaryotic panspermia idea is right, and there are prokaryotes as thick as
mud throughout the universe, then we could say that the Great Filter
mutation took more like ten to fifteen billion years to take place, and
just happened to take place on Earth. From this, it would seem that
universally-panspermic prokaryotes (and the Mars life evidence) would
strengthen my argument identifying the Great Filter with the evolution of
eukaryotic endosymbiosis.

If there are any expert students of protists and monerans out there who are
really up on their phylogenetic studies, please correct any errors I've
made.

I find four Principles to be a much less attractive number than five. I
don't think you could do it in three, and that number might be TOO stable
to be a symbol for ExI. A symbol like the current logo but with four arrows
would be rigid-looking as well as swastika-like. Four bad. Five good.

I'm afraid I don't like these negated terms either. I didn't mention it
before because no positive construction sprang to mind. This 'un' and
'less' and 'in' stuff looks kind of childishly rebellious to me. I know
it's harder to think of this stuff then to tear it down, but if you are
going to redo the Principles so dramatically, I'm sure you're intending
that they be better than they already are (I think they are good now, btw).

I'll just concede your conspiracy theory at the outset, even though I don't
agree with it.

Surely the members of the conspiracy are capable of studying economics and
social epistemology and figuring out that free societies are vastly more
productive than slave societies. For their own selfish ends, the members of
the conspiracy would be better served by changing their ways than they
would be by attempting to enslave the planet. The unknown and unpredictable
results of research proceeding on a million different fronts at once is far
more likely to guarantee the members of the governing elite personal
immortality and vast wealth than a mass enslavement project would be.

And even if the governing elite is too lazy and stupid to study economics
and social epistemology, surely they make a practice of hiring expert
researchers, and some of the researchers they hire are informing them of
these facts.

In short, to hold up your argument, you need to show that it is in the
interests of the governing elite to enslave the population of the world.
Clearly, this course of action is *not* in their own best interest, though
I'd have to dig up a lot of Popper and Hayek to support my contention.

Wow! I'm glad you pointed this out! I forgot all about the original
horrible four-arrow extropy logo.

And you're right that as far as numerological symbolism is concerned, five
is a much better number for extropian ideas than four or three.

Yes.  For two and a half billion years all you had on earth was simple 
prokaryotic cell, for 700 million years after that you got much more complex 
eukaryotic cells, but still no multicellular organisms. After that, 
570 million years ago, the Cambrian  explosion happened and things started 
to get interesting.
   
There were multi cellular life forms called " The Ediacaran Fauna" before 
the Cambrian Explosion, but it only predated it by an instant, just 
100 million yeaes.  All the Ediacaran fauna looked pretty much the same, 
flat and soft bodied. The Tommotian Fauna was even closer to the Cambrian 
Explosion, just 40 million years before, they were the first animals with  
hard parts, but they also all looked much the same , blade or cup like in  
this case. Neither fauna had the huge diversity that the animals in the 
Cambrian Explosion had. Many, including Stephen Jay Gould think both these 
faunas were failed independent experiments in  multicellular life that have 
no living descendants, just footnotes in the history of life, others think 
they had descendants and were key to the explosion.

My thanks to Tom and Eric for their comments. As I get to work on the
Principles 3.0 more, I'll ask for more feedback.

Exactly. Self-transformation would be one of the major ideas coming under
"Limitless Improvement" or "Boundless Improvement". ST would be one of the
main sub-parts of that principle.

I'm also wary of the mnemonic. It makes you think too much about something
hardly central to the principles. I do like "limitless" instead of
"boundless" though. While "boundless" is effective, Eric has an excellent
point about the annoying tendency of people to invent/confuse a principle of
"boundless optimism".

I prefer "improvement" though I'll consider "progress".

I agree. I considered "evolution" for a second but immediately rejected it.

IAN: And they've already taken away the amino acid tryptophan just because 
one batch from one plant in Japan was contaminated. Just imagine if milk 
was forever banned because of one bad batch from one farm. When will 
the first batch of contaminated melatonin surface? I'll bet a few in 
pharmaceutical sleeping pill industry have their fingers crossed.

They also banned the herb comfrey because one woman who was taking about
a dozen prescription drugs and comfrey died of liver cancer. When will 
the next person taking green tea die of liver cancer?  Yet thousands
die every year from FDA approved prescription drugs -- no big deal.

So the precedent is set, with virtually no sign of protest, for 
the govt to take away items under the slightest pretext.

IAN: Thus the political planners and elite must be pushing for lower 
taxes, less regulation, and more individual liberty on all fronts. I 
only wish I could agree. In fact, they are pushing for higher taxes, 
more regulations, and less liberty on all fronts.

IAN: True, but free people can more easily resist and compete with 
the central planning elite. We can't have that. If you told a king,
tyrant or dictator that he would be better off if he relaxed his 
control over his subjects, he'd laugh in your face before he 
sent you off to the rack.

IAN: You'd figure the lessons of the last century would have to 
teach them something. The point is it's a matter of being over 
other people. Control itself is the goal for political types.

IAN: No -- to hold up the argument one need only show that they are 
working overtime to reduce freedoms. They are... any questions ? 

Those who seek total power are willing to sacrifice material wealth in 
the form of new consumer technologies, medicine, ideas, etc., for the 
goal of social domination. It's a trade off their willing to make, 
even *if* they realize that the one must exclude the other.

More productive?  More productive for who?  The ruling classes have lived
in the lap of luxury (for the times) even in societies generally
unproductive for the masses.

One cannot "choose" to allow society to be free and productive.  One can
only refrain from working to make a society tyrannous.  Once one foregoes
power, one cannot stop others from making a society tyrannous.

Since others are likely to do it if you don't, you might as well be the
one to make society tyrannous and be the one in charge or part of a group
that is in charge.  Of course, this is predicated on being in a position
where you have a shot at such a strategy....say being one the heirs to
John D. Rockefeller II.  See what the Rockefeller Brothers Fund is
financing on its www page accessible from:   Yup!  Statism!

	Though everything people think is a theory, this is well
documented!  Geopolitical supremecy is the mission of the CIA and
Pentagon.  Do you really doubt this?  It is called "being the leader of
the free world, the only remaining super power.

	The Pentagon/CIA black budgets for wide-ranging scientific
research is enormous.  This is also documented.

	I am not even getting into conspiracy theories here.  I would
define conspiracy theorizing to start when we hypothesize that a cabal of
super-rich are more or less permanently in charge of the CIA and Pentagon.
You pluralists out there don't need to recognize this to recognize how
integral scientific research is to the rather obviously existing
geopolitical struggle for power......

One of the best ways of making it harder for nasty elites to gain control 
and monopoly on important technologies is to distribute them as widely 
as possible. Technologies and organizations that exist internationally 
are much safer, since it requires a concerted effort to stop them from 
many nations. That is why I think it is important for us to 
internationalize transhuman technologies as much as possible, and keep 
them in the open.

I think they are the same people as People Forever International, see
http://www.people-forever.org/

I think this group is a prime example of passive optimism, as opposed to 
dynamic optimism.

Uh, I don't think this is exactly all that new - I was working on TEMPEST
stuff back in 1979 when I started in computers. Of course, we referred
to TEMPEST'ing stuff to make whatever data was being transmitted unavailable
to evesdroppers. Mostly this involved putting the computer inside a large
box, but we did get into what they called "source suppression", which
involved adding components to a standard unit to prevent leakage....

Yes, you guys are right, my post to the Thread in BrainTennis, was offensive 
in the way I said it.  However, I did that intentionally, and I _was_ 
expecting to get a lot of shit for it, which I did.  If that post was the last 
thing I was planning on writing there, then it would have been a bad move, but 
offending people, to a certain extent, has a way of engaging their minds and 
getting them to state their real concerns.  My intent was to offend, get 
people all excited, and then follow up with a few very nice posts, addressing 
their real concerns in a non-threatening way.  Basically saying the same 
things that I said before, but in a way that isn't so threatening.  

I've had this approach done to me several times by my father, where I am 
offended and resistant to what he says, and then he follows up on what he said 
with more agreeable statements.  It is a very effective tactic.  Initially, it 
causes mental barriers to go up, and I am very resistent to what he says, but 
it also gets my mind highly engaged and thinking really hard about what he's 
saying, looking for flaws, looking for ways to argue, and I state these 
apparent flaws, often angrily at first, and he addresses my concerns in a very 
calm, reasonable, non-threatening way, and eventually, I see what he is 
saying, and it all makes so much sense!  Being offended has a very profound 
psycholoogical effect.  It has a way of making one CARE about the discussion, 
often passionately.  Of course, leaving other people offended is not a very 
good strategy, because then their mental barriers will just stay up.  There 
must be a period of "talking them down" from their offended stance, and if 
that is done successfully, the ideas will be embedded very deeply in their 
minds because they engaged so much of their minds by being offended in the 
first place.  It makes the discussion more interesting than a dry academic 
discussion because it engages their emotions.

By, the way, this tactic can't be used to make people believe anything that 
they don't find rational; it just makes it so that when they do see the 
rationality in what you're saying, it will embed itself more deeply in their 
minds.  That's the point of the "talking them down" period; to show them that 
your ideas make sense.

Although, one has to be careful not to offend too much, otherwise they won't 
listen to the rest of what you have to say.  But on-line forums are nice for 
that, because people don't feel nearly as threatened as they would if the same 
things were said in person.

But laughing in my face isn't an argument, Ian, and you aren't presenting 
any arguments either. Why should the members of the conspiratorial elite 
prefer the illusory (for it is illusory) sense of control over other 
people's lives to drastically improved chances of personal immortality 
and vast expansion of access to natural resources (offplanet)?

I agree with you that current governmental institutions need to be 
radically changed in a libertarian direction, but I think incompetence 
explains why things are bad right now far more effectively than malice 
explains it.

As Twirlip of Greymist said, poverty seems to be the default. Likewise, 
authoritarianism has been the default for a very long time now, and it 
takes a while for everyone to wake up from that way of thinking. I think 
that conspiracy theories arise from unbridled impatience to wake everyone 
up. "They aren't all realizing that libertarianism is true? The only 
possible explanation: conspiracy!"  But intellectual laziness and inertia 
(plus the fact that things have been improving overall thanks to 
technology, despite the fact that the governments have been preventing 
them from improving as fast as they might have otherwise) are better 
explanations, I think. These are hard problems, and we have to solve them 
on their terms.

And why do they limit themselves to only a single goal, even at the 
ultimate cost of their lives?

Well, that's presuming that the conspiracy exists at all. The only 
evidence I've seen of a ruling-class conspiracy is the curious activities 
of H. Ross Perot, which seem to me utterly ineffective in the long term.

I was trying to charitably suspend my disbelief in the conspiracy, but
since you aren't interested in trying to understand and explain to me the
*motivations* of the conspiracy you believe in, I'll return to my ordinary
belief that the "conspiracy" is really just a bunch of deluded individuals
doing what they each wrongly think is best. 

My very limited studies of the activities of the very worst, most violently 
immoral elements of government have led me to the conclusion that these 
elements are too incompetent to conspire to run a supermarket, much less 
conspire to run a planet.

I've seen "Evolution" reified by at least one person on this list, and
I agree with this.  It's not "a constituency thang", however: "keeping

Then I guess I'm the real sex maniac, since I was giving it serious

On the transhumanist list, where a small minority of the list members
(perhaps just one or two) are waging a holy war against a future given
over to trans-party-animals. 

But of course Max is right... I've also seen reactions from
non-transhumanists who assume that extropians are some sort of high-tech
ascetics, and who equate uploading with a desire for gonadectomy. 

Sex is just one of those difficult issues: no matter what stance you 
adopt toward it, you're sure to offend someone.

Sounds plausible to me, but I don't know this field very well.  I
worry, though, in actuality cells might have slowly gone through many
evolutionary steps over this period, steps that our fossil record and
tools might be too coarse to make out.  It might just look like one
big step because that's all we can see.  (Is this what William Lerette
meant by his crypic comment?)

Again, I'm no expert, but from reading Crick I got the strong
impression that prokaryotic cells are much less robust to extreme
environments, and much better tuned to the particulars of Earth now.

Sigh - guess I need to read up on yet another relevant field to this
very interdisciplinary subject.  :-)

Hard to say.  I think that's what the poster intended.

Actually the ribosome RNA sequences indicate eukaryotic and prokaryotic life
are approximately equal in age.  Eukaryotic life, with its hodgepodge of
interacting and varied systems and vast amounts of apparently useless baggage
is a much more plausible model for spontaneous self-organization a la
Kauffman than efficient, minimized prokaryotic life.

But as David Musick pointed out, offending people can be a good strategy 
to get past their memetic defenses (my guess is that since *any* 
processing done about something will imprint it in the brain).

I think the opposite is true. Prokaryotic cells are so simple that there is 
less to go wrong with them and thus they can survive in conditions that would 
kill  any eukaryotic  cell. Ancient bacteria live in hot springs near the 
boiling point of water, and at even higher temperature in deep sea underwater 
vents, the current record was living in water at 583 degrees F. Although hot 
this water was not boiling because it  was under very high pressure, nothing 
can live for long in boiling water. 

The bacterium Micrococcus radiodurans will thrive even after being exposed to  
6.5 million rontgens of Gamma rays, 10,000 times less would kill a human in  
minutes. I know of no eukaryotic cell that is anywhere near that tough.

In that case, we should be busy developing new memes rapidly as possible -
but honestly has anyone here ever gotten offended by discussing sex? I can't
imagine that is really true. Raise your hand if you find tallking about it
offensive.
 
I observe that, like emotions, people will tend to view Sex as noncognitive,
or "not an issue" with brain developement ( strange because most primates I
know spend a high perecentage of their brain energy trying to find it or
thinking about it) - A friend of mine returned from a week long conference on
consciousness and cognition and I asked about the topic, what people said
about sex  and what the latest developements were in this arena - I laughed
as it dawned on us that there was not one lecture or booth or comment on it -
apparently this function of the brain is to "low brow" to explore! It was
deleted(or avoided) by the whole contingency. Same with most intellectual
forums  including this list- since i have been on board - til lately. I had
seen PLEASURE 101 on the mail list  and mistaken it for a thread on >H memes
about sex.. but when i opened the files-  it was endless equations about A
not A! What a surprise! math equating >H pleasure - now *that* is integrity
to higher functions of mind/brain.  haha !

    Sarah had some really interesting ( but not too racey) views on >H
sexuality but then we dropped the thread! But cheers to her for doing it! 
Oh well - guess it's one of those  "primate functions " of the body - and we
will evolve out of it anyway - 
Hmm - I hope not! : (

but meant to say "eukaryotic" instead of "prokaryotic".  Thanks to 
John K Clark for pointing this out.

Since then, I found and read:

J. William Schopf (1995) "Disparate Rates, Differing Fates: Tempo and
Mode of Evolution Changed from the Precambrian to the Phanerozoic", in
<i>Tempo and Mode in Evolution, Genetics and Paleontology 50 Years
After Simpson</i>, ed. Walter M. Fitch, Francisco J. Ayalya, National
Academy Press, Washington D.C.

There indeed seems to have been a long period of relatively little
evolutionary change - good new from the Great Filter point of view.
Prokaryotic cells were relatively general and unspecialized, each
species having large populations able to work well in a wide variety
of environments.

This raises an interested thought about future upload evolution.
Maybe humans will continue to be general thinking machines, working
well for many different thinking tasks, and so we won't see that much
radiation into different forms.

I've always been fond of Tom's essay in Extropy #3 pointing out that sex
is, or at least can be, the highest-bandwidth form of communication
possible between two human beings. Given my own recently growing
conviction that (at least minimal) communication with other rational
beings is part and parcel of rationality, this way of thinking about sex
could lead to some interesting research programs into the possibility that
sexual behavior (or at least some kinds of sexual behavior) can directly
enhance cognitive function and even, yes, rationality.

I would be exceptionally surprised if people who were _already_ opposed to
one's ideas, ethics, morality, socio-economic theories, etc. would, having
been insulted, become more responsive to, and accepting of, one's position.
How does this break their memetic defenses effectively? Any new memes which
of which they may become aware will forever be associated with deprecation
and insult: they are hardly likely to sally forth spreading the good word of
Extropianism, or any other meme system. And any further discussion will
require an overcoming of exacerbated ill-feeling and distrust.

I suspect that David Musick's experiences with his father are the exception,
rather than the rule. He is in the fortunate position of having a mind which
can accept the viewpoint of another as plausibly valid, even when in
opposition to that view, and hence be persuaded to change his own position,
once engaged in the deep thought originating from a debacle with, say, his
father. But I believe that far more often, insult serves only to entrench
opposing viewpoints, and to close the minds of the insulted to further
discussion.

Um.  I'm not an expert, but I'm not sure how useful rRNA is here.  One
model of eukarya is that a magnetobacterium swallowed an archaean and
turned it into its nucleus, with similar swallowings for famously the
mitochondria and chloroplasts.  I mean, I know rRNA is used for the
phylogenetic trees but I'm not sure how it would distinguish here.  Also
that there may be some assumptions of uniformity, and I'm not sure how
robust the method is to some past deviation we couldn't see.

And given that eukarya certainly _do_ contain prokaryotic mitochondria I
cannot see the validity of the "self-organization" statement.  Prokarya
possibly require an RNA replicator hijacking a fat globule, or
coacervate.  Eukarya build on that.

I think "apparently" is just the word... Prokaryontes might be leaner & 
meaner, but the eukaryontes still quite often get the best of them. You 
know, this intron/exon paraphernalia are not entirely useless. They may 
appear as ballast at replication, but better modularity vastly increases 
speed of adaptation in a highly dynamic fitness landscape. Remember, only 
the eukaryontes got the knack of organizing into multicellular organisms, 
which e.g. can maintain much better environment homeostasis by carrying it 
around (the organism as a whole can go where no single cell has ever gone 
before), or much better efficiency due to specialization (differentiated 
cell types).

I think the only (and unintended at that) offense you might raise is that 
of keeping (potentially embryonic >H) people from discussing more technical 
questions. Our mental resources ain't that plentiful to allow us 
squandering 'em. I am quite astonished as to the low percentile 
transhumanist technology discussion scores in the extropians mailing list.

There is nothing strange about this obsession with sex: all organisms are 
evolutionary artefacted. No mate, no copulation, no offspring. The higher 
the organization stage, the longer the childhood, the longer the need for 
offspring protection. Hence a means to constructively bind two otherwise 
highly incooperative organisms to each other is required. (Admittedly, in 
some higher primates (bonobos?) sex has become a means of social 
organisation at clan scale, but this does not render the main argument 
meaningless).

In fact, the hardwired "propagate, propagate, propagate" programme does 
often inhibit other functions, in humans mostly ratio. An (otherwise 
quite boring) physical act aquires a certain glorious aura, this also 
happens to the perception of mate/offspring. Remember the last endorphin 
high you rode when enamoured? Peek-a-boo -- ain't that one cute little 
dude?

The function itself is certainly ancient. Bacteria fuck (E.coli S+/-), 
polypes copulate, insects do it, too. The only thing of interest sex has 
to it is the highly selective methods the evolutionary older brain 
regions utilizes to manipulate the younger reagions. Neat trick, that. 
This topics is interesting indeed, and should not be banned. Importance 
of supressed olfactory data (MHC fragments) to mate selection & the 
influence of oral contraceptiva upon it. Heard about that one? Neato.

When I wrote about the benefits of offending people, I forgot to clarify what 
I mean by "offending" them.  I certainly don't mean insulting them personally 
or ridiculing their beliefs.  This usually closes minds beyond much hope of 
opening.  I was meaning that sometimes it is good to present one's ideas very 
bluntly and matter-of-factly, with no sugar coating.  If the other doesn't 
share your ideas, this will usually create an intellectual offense at your 
ideas.  They will be offended, not because your ideas are bad, or you are 
being rude to them, but because you are presenting them with ideas which may 
seem ludicrous at first or frightening, or simply very different than they are 
familiar with.

And because it is more of an intellectual offense than an emotional one (not 
that there's a clear-cut difference between the two), they will tend to use 
more of an intellectual defense, to rebutt what you're saying.  An emotional 
defense would be to block out or marginalize what you are saying, and one 
should avoid triggering another's emotional defenses too much when sharing 
one's ideas with another (and this is much easier to do through text, where 
the participants aren't face to face, or voice to voice).

The offense is intended to provoke an intellectual response and get the other 
*thinking* about what you're saying, not necessarily to *accept* what you're 
saying.  One must trust the rational faculties of the other to reach their own 
conclusions, rather than simply inserting your own ideas into their mind as a 
belief.  The trick is to get them thinking in the first place.  Unless they've 
thought about your ideas for themselves, their "agreement" with your ideas is 
meaningless.

Of course, some care must be taken when spreading memes, not to be too 
offensive (otherwise the recipient will just close up), and not to present the 
ideas too sweetly and innocently (otherwise the ideas won't challenge their 
mind enough to get them to *care* about what you say).  

I'm not an expert on effective communication (although I'm very interested in 
becoming so), but I think that some amount of offense (not insult) can be very 
good in the communication process, especially when spreading Extropian ideas, 
which encourage people to think for themselves.  If you're just interested in 
slipping ideas into people's minds, then a very quiet, non-offensive technique 
is probably the best.  But I'm interested in getting people to THINK and not 
be so comfortable with their ideas, to continually question and doubt. And for 
this, there must be some serious boat rocking.

We need a world of thinkers, not a world of believers (no matter how good the 
belief is), and I'd rather have someone question what I say than believe it.  
At least I know they're still alive.

Now that we can see that discussion of extropian principles works in a
public forum why not move the action to alt.extropians? It appears that they
shut down the thread on hotwired. Sure alt.extropians may have spammers and
trollers but we can fight them off and even use them as memetic examples. I
knew for the longest time that if we would let people discuss this publicly
rather than isolated on a mailinglist that it would be a successful subject.
Finally Proof!! :)
So lets convince hotwired to put up one last post to notify users that the
discussion is to be continued on alt.extropians. The public exploitation of
extropian principles should be used to spread the memes due to it being a
VERY SUCCESSFUL strategy which has been used quite successfully by the great
religions of the world as "Witnessing" but extropians aren't NEARLY as
annoying and allow people to come to them rather then them coming to the
people. If we study memes and copy their replication patterns and methods,
with the rationality and logic extropians profess, we may under 5 years
annihalate religion from the face of the planet!! I have also seen great
interest in the IRC channels expecially among the technically-minded.

Swallowing is a very reasonable model for origins of eukaryotes, but neither
the nucleus, with its linear chromosomes, nor the rest of the cell, with its
intricate cytoskeleton, is like any bacteria bopping around today.  The lines
of the swallower and swallowee are probably extinct, regardless of whether
they were prokaryotes or something else.

The robustness is not well-established but is suspected; eukaryotes have as
much variation in their rRNAs as prokaryotes.  It should be very hard to
generate that much variation without an enormous amount of time.

I made a lot of progress in the last day understanding the
implications of the biological evidence regarding the Great Filter.
Here is an excerpt from the current version of my paper.  Robin

-------------------
Excerpt from: http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/greatfilter.html
 
On the other hand, the historical step-by-step "march of progress" we
seem to see in the fossil record would seem to create difficulties for
the view that any one of these steps is astronomically unlikely.  If a
step is so improbable, one might ask, then why did it happen so
quickly after its preceding enabling step?  That is, if the expected
time for some step on any one planet is many trillions of years, they
why would it happen on Earth in only a few hundred million years?
After all, and the oldest known stars are now 15 billion years old,
our sun would seem to have another five billion years of life left,
and yet the longest known evolutionary step (from simple to complex
cells) only took about 1.7 billion years.  

It turns out that this is probably not a problem, however, and it is
useful to understand why.  Assume that a certain set of steps are to
be completed in a certain order within a certain total time window,
and that for each step there is some constant probability per unit time
of completing that step, given that the previous step has been
completed.  If the probability of completing all the steps within the
time window is low, then for the cases where all the steps are in fact
completed, it turns out that the average time to complete each "hard"
step is unrelated to how hard that step is. 

For example, say you tried to complete four tasks in an hour (all of
the "if you don't succeed at first, try try again" variety), where the
expected time to complete each task was .1, 1, 10, and 100 hours
respectively.  Then in those rare cases when you did complete all four
tasks in the hour, the average time to complete the first task would
be about .1 hours, but the average time to complete each of the others
would be about 0.23 hours.  All the hard steps, no matter how hard,
take about the same time, while easy steps take their usual time. 

There would also be an average of about 0.23 hours to spare left over
after all the steps were complete.  And since the distributions are
exponential, the standard deviation of each step size would be equal
to its average.  Models where the window closing is also random give
similar results.

This sort of model seems to apply to the evolution of life on Earth.
Since the Earth formed, there have been about five periods between
major evolutionary changes, periods of roughly equal duration.
Specifically, the earlist known fossils of simple single-cell life
appeared 1.0 billion years after the earth was formed, and then the
earlist known complex single-cell fossils appears 1.7 billion years
after that.  0.8 billion years later the tempo of evolution suddenly
picked up dramatically (perhaps with the introduction of sex [Schopf
95]), and then 0.4 billion years later we see the first fossils of
multi-cellular life [Knoll 95].  Finally, 0.6 billion years brings us
to where we are today. 

To these five stages we might add two other discrete non- "try try
again" type steps: an initial step of getting the right sort of planet
around the right sort of star, and a final step of humanity either
succeeding or destroying itself.  Together, these seven steps could
explain the Great Filter if the (logarithmic) average filter per step
was at least a factor of one thousand.  That is, either there might be
a one in a thousand chance of passing a discrete step, or a one
trillion year expected time to complete a "try try again" step. 

Of course we may find more steps as we get better fossil evidence, and
we may have slighted some step which happened to take a particularly
short time.  And of course the Great Filter need not be distributed
evenly among these steps - just how much of the Filter rests in the
last step is the ominous question that motivates our analysis.

This model predicts that the expected time remaining until the window
of opportunity for life on Earth closes is about one billion years.
This model could therefore be confirmed by astronomical analysis
regarding expected durations until the Earth is fried by a runaway
greenhouse effect, by an unstable sun, a nearby supernovae, or by some
other disaster ahead in the sun's travels through the galaxy.

Most of a eukaryotic chromosome doesn't even participate in that.  Most of a
eukarotic chromosome is long stretches of repetive DNA or pseudogenes.  Even
including exons and transcriptional signal, genes are just a tiny part.

No question that eukaryotes are much better at multicellularity, although
prokaryotes do colonize and specialize.  But multicellularity is quite a bit
younger than eukaryotes.

What if the key sequence of mutations developed in a prokaryote that gave
rise to what is now the eukaryotic cell-plasm, but that various descendants
of this "swallower" prokaryote then adopted a large number of different
prokaryotes as proto-nuclei? Is it possible that multiple independent
origins (perhaps thousands or millions, once the essential "swallowing"
mutations had developed) could account for the observed variation in
eukaryotic rRNAs?

Note that amoebas seem to be capable of sustaining new digestion-resistant
prokaryotic parasites within their cell-plasms even now, so multiple
independent eukaryotic origins doesn't seem too implausible to me.

If the idea of multiple independent origins is correct, then I think we'd
*expect* to see as much variation among eukaryotes as we see among
prokaryotes, even if the eukaryotes have only existed for a much shorter
time, because eukaryotic genes would arise from a broad sampling of
prokaryotic genes.

This stuff is on the edge of my ability to think about intelligibly, so
please pardon me if I made any really heinous mistakes.

Yes, it's possible.  Current thought is that it would be very difficult to
mix rRNA from different lines into one functional ribosome.  However,
evolution of rRNAs is ill-understood.

As I understand it, not only is there a lot of variation within eukaryotes,
but eukaryotes as a group differ substantially from prokaryotes.  Multiple
origins should leave most eukaryotes more closely related to their
prokaryotic relatives than their eukaryotic non-relatives, but that isn't the
case.

   Hmmm.......     I do not get the jist of the metaphor here. Our

seeing Transhumanists as immortalists, sex for the means of propogation is
not the phenomenon I am referring to of course, but consciousness pleasure-

Dont equate the glamour aspect with the pleasure aspect, or the marketing
 value of sex with the actual function of it - not really purely biological,
but a happy addition to optimal lives ( since we are still talkng about human
consciousness). Yes, it would be nice if " A not A " did give me a rosy
endorphin high, I would have probably spent a lot more time in calculus. 
However I think you are still underestimating the brain by giving it limits
on "bandwidth" that come anywhere NEAR to making it neccessary to eliminate
sexual thought or pleasure stimuli in order to concentrate on technical
advances ( this would also mean we have to quit vacationing and  whole lot of
wonderful and creative adventures).

This lat was over my head, 'gene - What do you mean by replicating? AI
self-propogation? Your technospeak baffles me. Why must we then bring the

terms of hardware orgasms? BTW The reason age French used to call the orgasm
" le petit mort" ..."the little death"... refering to that  state of
consciousness of pure bliss, which gave one a temporary sense of
"nothingness" - a sense of losing the self...which in humans probably
facilitates that famous release from the tension - mental and physical, and
is one of the best effects of sex itself ..if one assumes the reward center
of AI would not need a break from it's busy calculations, nor be attuned to a
set of neural and muscular prompts - this could be seen as  a strictly
wetware debate perhaps. Hard to imagine uploads having ANY sex or gender
anyway.

> but why bothering?

That brings up the "fundamental differences" topic again. Why indeed? ( BTW
If one doesnt *enjoy* sex, finds it boring or whatever then certainly one
shouldnt do it). But more to the point:  What is one's reason for being a
transhumanist? If it is to enhance one's own existnce, then perhaps playing
about with ways of enhanced pleasure, stimulation ie:  rewards ( as in the
rewiring of pleasure to say, enhanced productivity - faster learning or
whatever) will be desirable. Similarly if you only want to spend your time
and energy on technology and productivity,then  it is a waste of time. 
          If one's goal is to bring on the Singularity, or to become an AI,
or simply think current humans won't actually be transhuman but should strive
and sacrifice this life to the common good then pleasure and good feeling may
be indeed pointless!

Yes I realize that it's full of spam but if we actually used the newsgroup
then it's signal to noise radio would improve and we wouldn't notice all the
spam. Trust me it would work as well as help to exploit extropianism.

1. Reproductive something (e.g. RNA)    
2. Simple single-cell life 
3. Complex single-cell life 
4. Multi-cell life  
5. Animals with big brains  
6. Where we are now  
7. Explosion 
        

About stage 1: Although organisms that used only RNA would be much simpler  
than modern creatures that make use of DNA, RNA and proteins,  some think 
they would still be too sophisticated to be the first forms of life. 
If you define life as information that changes by natural selection then 
chemist Graham Cairns-Smith says that the first life was not made of RNA but
of clay (oxides of silicon and aluminum). It's well known that clay can act 
as a catalyst and store energy, it also has the most complicated chemistry of 
any non biological substance. Cairns-Smith thinks clay may be able to store 
information as patterns of ions or defects in the crystal lattice of large 
2 dimensional sheets. As the crystals grow the patterns might be duplicated 
in new layers. He wrote a book about this  "Genetic Takeover And The Mineral 
Origins Of Life".  Also in note that in the August 8 issue of Nature is an 
article about peptides  acting as a self catalyst.  


About stage 2 : I think simple life forms are probably easy to make, at least 
on Earth it was, although I wish my reasoning was based on more than  one 
example. Induction certainly works better if you have more than one instance, 
but that's all I have to work with. On earth life seems to have started as 
soon as it possibly could, as soon as the planet cooled enough to allow 
liquid water. Having got to this stage it was not easy to leave it, life 
stayed stuck here for over 2 billion years.


About stage 3: It must be hard to make a multicellular life form that is good 
enough to compete with single cell life, it took a long time to figure out 
how to do it. Live was stuck here for about 700 million years.
        

About stage 4: For long while Evolution didn't have much interest in large  
brains ("Brains? We don't need no stinking brains!"). It took nature almost  
570 million years to change it's mind.


About stage 5: If you went back just 3.5 million years, the time our most  
famous ancestor "Lucy" was alive, the largest brain on Earth and probably the 
most powerful, was not on the earth, it was in the sea. Even today the 
largest brain on the planet is possessed by the Sperm Whale. I don't think  
a brain, regardless of how big, is enough to get you out of this stage, 
you need a hand too, and that may be even more difficult to evolve. Common
sense would indicate that a large brain must come first because a hand is of 
no use if you don't have a big brain to direct it, but common sense is wrong 
and it's not at all clear why. Nobody knows why bipedalism was developed, 
it seems like a dumb form of locomotion, but Lucy (Australopithecus Afarensis) 
could walk upright as well as you or me, and like modern humans, she had short 
fingers and a fully opposable thumb.  This was not very good for climbing 
trees but it's great for precision gripping. From the neck down Lucy was 
pretty modern, but her brain was only about as big as a modern day chimp. 
After Lucy the brain increased in size at an enormous rate, and I don't think 
that would have happened if Lucy didn't have such a good hand, and nobody 
understands why Evolution gave her that good hand.
        

About stage 6: If we ever get out of this stage we'll do it in less than a 
thousand years, probably a lot less. It appears that each stage is shorter 
than the one before.

Actually I'm not sure it's an extropian novel yet, since I've only read a
quarter way through. But it certainly presents cryonics and uploading ideas
very accurately and sympathetically. The author, Peter James, obviously did
considerable research, consulting with the Alcor Foundation, and most of you
will recognize several names among the acknowledgments, including - on this
list - Marvin Minsky (if he's still reading the list) and Russell Whitaker.

I can't help like a book with the following paragraph. The context: Our
hero, uploading researcher, brilliant scientist Prof. Joe Messenger, has
returned to his lab in England from Los Angeles, and is opening his
accumulated mail:

"He cheered a little as he came across one that bore the frank of one of his
publishers, and might contain reviews of his most recent book, The Computer
That Loved Ben-Hur. He slit open the envelope and was pleased to see a group
of clippings: an interview he'd done with the Guardian; a review in New
Scientist; a more lengthy review in The Sunday Times, which he scanned and
was reasonably happy with, even though the reviewer appeared to have totally
missed the fundamental point of the book. And there was what looked like a
rave write-up in a small California magazine he much admired, called
Extropy, which pleased him more than anything."

          The new version of Robin Hanson's paper is great improvement 
          over the earlier version I read about a week ago, which 
          itself was interesting enough. Now it is one of the most 
          stimulating transhumanist documents I've read.
          
          Here are some more comments.
          
          >That is, if the expected time for some step on any
          >one planet is many trillions of years, they why would it 
          >happen on Earth in only a few

          >sun would seem to have another five billion years of life 
          >left, and yet the longest known
          >evolutionary step (from simple to complex cells) only took 
          >about 1.7 billion years.
          
          1.7 billions years does not seem a remarkably short time to 
          me, even is this context. But this speed argument, as you 
          recognise, is much stronger against a position that would 
          place the filter somewhere later in development, say between 
          primitive mammals and us. 
          
          >Another way to explain highly improbable quick change would 
          >be to assume some special
          >temporal window of opportunity. If, for example, our Earth 
          >is destined to be fried soon by a
          >runaway greenhouse effect
          
          But I don't think an explanation is needed here. If this 
          line of reasoning were correct, and if its assumptions are 
          granted, then it would imply that there probably is a 
          temporal window of opportunity and that by now we are 
          creeping close to the far part of its frame. While such a 
          conclusion might follow form other considerations in your 
          article, I do not think that the figure 1.7 years gives it 
          significant support. For the an impending deadline would 
          only reduce the potential extent of the window by a small 
          factor. The reason is that even if no special surprise  
          effect like a runaway greenhouse effect in the near future 
          is forthcoming, the earth will become inhabitable within a 
          few billion years anyway due to increase in solar activity. 
          So if the "highly improbable quick change" is improbably 
          quick relative to a window of 4 billion years (runaway 
          greenhouse effect), it would be not much more improbably 
          quick relative to a window of, say, 7 billion years. But, as 
          you yourself note, 1.7 billion years is not improbably quick 
          given that the event should happen at all during our planets 
          life time.
          
          
          >There are also three "save stellar appearances" 
          >astrophysics alternatives which could explain
          >why an apparently dead universe is really alive, with our

          >stellar disassembling, might be
          >effectively impossible, explaining why nearby stars look so 
          >natural
          
          That does not sound extremely unlikely. It must be combined 
          with either the assumption that we live zoo, or the 
          assumption that large scale space travel is also practically 
          impossible (which looks like a slightly stronger assumption 
          than that large-scale engineering can't be done).
          
          >I personally think that most of the Great Filter is most 
          >likely to be explained by the steps I

          >intelligence. 
          
          The early steps in evolution leave room for hope. But the 
          evolution of tool-using intelligence happened so quickly 
          that the speed argument applies and indicates that that step 
          is not very hard.
          
          >And even if a one-time event did
          >select for low colonisation tendencies, we would expect 
          >stronger tendencies to eventually be
          >selected back.
          
          One must be careful, though, not too neglect the possibility 
          that new technologies might make a social structure 
          incomparably more stable than any we have seen in history; 
          and in a certain societies colonisation tendencies would b e 
          systematically suppressed.

          I don't directly disagree with this, but it seems to me that 
          you might have slightly too much confidence in the ability 
          of the social sciences to tell us what would happen under 
          conditions radically different from anything that has 
          occurred so far. With >AI and direct access to our 
          motivation centres, the psychological mechanisms behind 
          sociological phenomena would be totally novel; and we should 
          not simply assume that a social theory that appears unlikely 
          under present conditions could not be a plausible candidate 
          for describing a posthuman society (similar arguments have 
          been made by Wiik, Anders, David Pearce and others). Each 
          sociological principle that is to be transferred from now to 
          then requires special justification.

          That would seem to be the only sensible thing to do, but 
          would it really help? If there is a solution that we can 
          figure out, and convince people of, it would seem unlikely 
          that not any of the millions of similar civilasations would 
          also have thought of it and implemented it. Is there any 
          reason to suppose that we could outwit doom when everybody 
          else failed? Perhaps, if we became convinced that the great 
          filter is in our immediate future, we should rather take a 
          chance and try to do something utterly absurd, something 
          that nobody else would have thought of? Like chopping off 
          the right arm of every newborn infant... (How would we 
          persuade the masses of the logic of this argument?)

OK, then. I'd like to take this in the context of recent discussions about
people discussing subjects about which they 'know' very little, and suggest
the following.

Just as Darren Reynolds is putting together a list of areas of expertise of
people on this list and elsewhere, I'd like to put together a comprehensive
transhuman reading list, but one covering a very broad range of areas:
neuroscience, life extension, philosophy, economics, social sciences,
genetics, fiction, etc.

But to do this, I'll need the help of everyone on the list. For each
submission I'll need:

- the name of the book
- the author
- the publisher (if known)
- a short description of the book, which should say:
        - what it's about
        - whether it's any good (yeah, that's subjective but I'm happy to
          accept more than one description per book)
        - what sort of level it's pitched at (no prior knowledge, basic
working           knowledge, expert, etc.)
- _one_ major category: neuroscience, genetics, electronics, economics, etc.
- applicable minor categories

Details of the book will be placed in the major category. The title of the
book and its author will be placed in the minor categories, with appropriate
links back to the major category entry.

The list will be ordered by category, then by author. 

Each entry will also contain the name of the person submitting that entry:
so send me your URL if you want a dynamic link to your home page.

If the suggested reading is on-line (e.g. 'Engines of Creation'), then you
should also send me the URL.

If you wish to post a longer, more detailed review then I'll set up a
separate web page for that particular book.

I imagine the categories will build up as we go along. If I make a decision
to place a book in an existing category, rather than place it in a suggested
new one, I'll let you know I have done so, to give you a chance to object.

I'm also aware that many of you already have lists of books on your pages.
If you send me the URL for those lists, along with a brief description, I'll
put them in a separate section of links on the book page. Alternatively, if
you want your text incorporated into the main body of the list, I'll be
happy to do that.

If you think it's a good idea then mail me at the address at the bottom of
the page. (If not, don't :-)

I would hope that, rather than just form from a flurry of activity now (but
please, feel free to flurry), the list will continue to build as we increase
our knowledge.

By stealing time spent in reading/thinking. Do you have an infinite 
number of channels at your disposal? Can you spawn off clones for

It doesn't unsettle me, only the complete absence of technically flavoured 
discussions does. It is a real pity the extropians policy keeps us from 
creating/accessing the former extropy archives. I think (no, I know) there 
is excellent technical material to be found there.

If we'd had 10k full-scale contributors, then this may be an option. As 
for now, this would mean splitting forces. I even think the simultaneous 
existance of the extropians and the transhuman mailing list to be 
overkill, though the amount of noise in extropians ML is higher (hint, 
hint).

Agreed. Maybe the topic was too complex. I'm not too sure where this 
consciousness hulabaloo came from at all -- it lacks solid wet neuro 
basis, imo.

I never said such a thing. I said "otherwise quite boring". The act per 
se has no inherent attraction (if one thinks of it, no act ever 
inherently can). Should mutual nose picking or tennis playing result in 
offspring creation or high risk of death _and_ persist for several 
millenia, it sure would be equally emotionally loaded.

There is a strong emotional binding both to your mate and your child. A 
perceptional bias, a rose-coloured reality filter if you wish.

If you are interested in pleasure -- after a substrate change the entire 
R&P circuitry is open to you. Spending aeons in quivering pleasure or 
excruciating pain will be very easy, then. It is extremely 
straightforward to become a digital junkie (remember rat reward centre 
autoelectrostimulation experiments?). 

There are definitely grave dangers in running in a permanent wheel mode.

It is difficult to talk about enjoyment while discussing such relatively 
primitive organisms. Nevertheless, there is no basic difference between 
what we & bacteria do. Our act is just more complex, purists would say 
there is sufficient quantity delta to grant it the status of quality.

> cognitive functions of the human brain?

I doubt higher regions are too involved. It would be quite fascinating to 
do a PET/MEG imaging, while... erm.. in the act. I doubt such an 
experiment was ever undertaken, though. Science can be fun :)

There has been lots of discussion on human pheromones. This stuff is 
different, though (don't ask me for the original source, it was a Kraut 
paper article). Basically, it states women choose their mates by MHC 
fragment profile matching, unconsciously selecting for the most viable 
child (some olfactory data gets _never_ forwarded to "consciousness"). 
Interestingly, once in the pregnancy the preferences shift towards more 
related organisms, probably based on better kinship cooperation. 
Artificial progesteron analoga screw this up: the brain is tricked into 
believing a permanent pregnancy.

This has definitive setbacks: the choice of your partner is modulated by 
the fact whether you take contraceptiva. Dropping the pill or starting 
taking it might result in a emotional partner reevaluation. Oh, yeah, we 
all are so very free indeed :(

Well, boring from a information theory position. The material carrier for 
the information channel is packaged DNA, which is roughly 4 Gbases 
(sorry, I dropped 3 orders of magnitude in the last post) for us higher 
(?) primates. The stuff which actually codes is about 1 % (which can be 
still compressed quite nicely) of it, the rest is probably needed for 
packing (sticky patches for histones?) or are just runaway autoreplicators 
(these can be constructive for introducing mutation).

> to ask for this megabyte bit to be translated out of technospeak, but I get

4 GigaBases. 4 billion bases. Apart from an occasional 
mutation/rearrangement the data set is basically the same. Highly 
repetitive messages en masse can get quite boring after a while, <yawn>.

Wouldn't it be nice to give you full control over what you like and what 
you don't? One can build safeguards, as limited duration or

A brain has a bandwidth all right. The raw sensorics bandwidth, the 
processing bandwidth, the memory bandwidth. Lots of bottlenecks, narrow & 
narrower.

> reaper in?  Bandwidth again? What is a chimaeric structure?? Do you think in

Should there be no built-in emergency exit from this universe, we would 
be stranded in this world. We would have to rely on whatever IT-capable 
material structures this universe allows for, solely. If true, we would 
run into limited resources (matter, energy) sooner or later. Once there, 
autoreplication has to stop, or we have to delete obsolete designs, 
taking over their IT resources. Hear the rattlin' of bones... If Darwin 
was with us right from the start, this state will be reached very soon 
(on cosmological time scale, that is) indeed.

> terms of hardware orgasms? BTW The reason age French used to call the orgasm

"Hardware orgasms", what a nice term. I (very unscientifically) think 
every rational entity needs emotional "fuel" to make it tick. A purely 
rational being might have the status of a TV with a blown fuse. In fact, 
purely rational being might be an autocontradiction.

its R&W centre, which would make this boring action indistinguishable of

Whether it is a waste of time, or not depends on the evaluation metric 
definition utilized. My (purely subjective, of course) metric of success 
stems from the realm of Darwinian evolution: the ability to survive for a 
long time, the longer the better.

          David Musick: 
          I have always liked the uncompromisingly objective way of 
          thinking and speaking: the more counterintuitive and 
          repugnant a formulation, the more it appeals to me given 
          that it is logically correct. Take for example the following 
          sentence:
          
                Blacks are more stupid than whites.
          
          I like that sentence and think it is true. But recently I 
          have begun to believe that I won't have much success with 
          most people if I speak like that. They would think that I 
          were a "racist": that I _disliked_ black people and thought 
          that it is fair if blacks are treated badly. I don't. It's 
          just that based on what I have read, I think it is probable 
          that black people have a lower average IQ than mankind in 
          general, and I think that IQ is highly correlated with what 
          we normally mean by "smart" and stupid". I may be wrong 
          about the facts, but that is what the sentence means for me. 
          For most people, however, the sentence seems to be 
          synonymous with:
          
                I hate those bloody niggers!!!!
          
          My point is that while speaking with the provocativness of 
          unabashed objectivity would be appreciated by me and many 
          other persons on this list, it may be a less effective 
          strategy in communicating with some of the people "out 
          there". I think it is laudable if you accustom people to the 
          offensiveness of truth, but be prepared that you may suffer 
          some personal damage.

chimaeric, from a Greek mythical monster Chimaera or somesuch. A chimaeric 
animal/cell is an artificially constructed hybride, containing genetic

A chimaeric image can be created by morphing two pictures. Uploads could

You might consider adding this to the "Technology" section:

"Engines of Creation - The Coming Era of Nanotechnology",
K. Eric Drexler

http://reality.sgi.com/whitaker/EnginesOfCreation/

Note that this is the entire text of the book, online, not a review

I'm not sure we know that.  There was a billion years (a long time

For Great Filter issues, "hard" would be expected times of a trillion
years or more.  An expected times 700my is far from hard enough to matter.

This is likely to be a New Yorker's view of the world phenomena.   The

It depends on how large the remaining filter is.  And it might well be
that even when one understands the problem, there isn't much we can do
about it.  And hard times are no reason to give up.

You'd have a *very* hard time persuading me (mass #2147281593) of this.

I wish you the best, really, but a number of us have tried this in
the past.  Convince me I'm wrong, though, and I'll be delighted.

Earth formed about 4.6 billion ago, but life didn't have a chance for it's 
first billion years or so, it was far too hot and the Earth suffered impacts 
so large  it would make the one that killed the Dinosaurs look like a joke. 
One popular theory about the formation of the moon is that about this time 
The Earth was hit by a Mars sized object, the ejected debris formed a ring 
around the earth that later coalesced into The Moon. Even rocks couldn't 
survive that, the oldest rocks ever found are the "Isua" rocks of south west 
Greenland and they are only 3.8 billion years old. Interestingly some reported 
signs of biological activity in the Isua rocks, but this interpretation
remains highly controversial. The oldest undisputed fossils are a little over 
3.5 billion years old and were found in western  Australia and South Africa.

                >Only 1.7 billion years, actually.
                        

Best estimate I've seen is that Eukaryotic cells evolved between 1.2 an 1.4  
billion years ago, well over 2 billion years after the first life. Well OK, I 
remember reading a report somewhere about 1.6 billion, but I don't think 
that's generally accepted.

                 >hard enough to matter.
                        

Obviously we have zero chance of finding anything a trillion years old, but I 
don't think 700 million is a trivial percentage of life's 3.5 billion year 
history.         

                >The really hard stages, I think, do not cluster near us in

If so then we must have successfully passed through the hard stages long ago,  
it's hard for me to believe that we won't get to the really difficult stuff  
for another billion years.

Your clauses in this sentence appear incompatible. How can one speak in a
way which is uncompromisingly objective and yet intend to form clearly
subjective feelings of repugnance? What you are suggesting is enveloping the
statement of objective fact in a construct of subjective emotional influence.

Case in point: it should be self-evident that this statement is bound to
create subjective responses.

Of course it is: 'stupid' is a highly emotive word. It is naive to believe
it could ever form part of a statement to be interpreted objectively.

Maybe it would be: but you're not being unabashedly objective. Objectiveness
is just as much defined by communication method as communication content.

Unfortunately, I believe, we're not just talking about personal damage,
here. In the case of David Musick's post to B'Tennis we're talking about
possible collateral damage to Extropianism as a whole.

<snip>

But there's the rub, David. The difference between intellectual and
emotional offense is often slight, and that difference is subjective.
Furthermore:

(1) The sort of people who recognize the difference, and treat your comments
as an intellectual challenge are exactly the sort of people who don't need
to be offended: they would recognize a sound intellectual argument anyway,
consider its content and reinterpret their own position accordingly.

(2) The remaining people will misinterpret your comments and react
emotionally, defeating your purpose, and making further argument difficult,
if not impossible.

So what's the point of creating offense? In (1) it's unnecessary and in (2)
it's counterproductive.

Now, it may be that there's a (3): a small group who are intellectually
offended by what you say. But I believe that to be a small group, all of
whom could eventually be persuaded by clear, inoffensive argument.

Even if (3) is true I still hold that the collateral damage produced would
outway the worth of the few positively influenced.


Perhaps 'intellectual enigma' might be a better approach: drive people's
thought processes and interest by providing just enough information to get
them interested, then reel them in with the answers to the questions they
have already begun to ask themselves. Certainly it's worked for me in the past.

The topics of conversation vary considerably over time. Sometimes there's a
focus on physics, or neuroscience, or computers, or genetics, other times
it's more on philosophical or cultural issues.

Which reminds me: There was some talk about one person or a group
coordinating the collection of former posts and getting permissions. I'd be
delighted to see this happen. Who had suggested or volunteered for this? I
have almost all the archives if someone wants to start going through them
for good posts and to contact writers to permission to make them available.

Funny, it's always seemed to me that the signal to noise ratio is much
better on the Extropians list. Far fewer nasty fights here, and less time
spent on clueing people in. There's zero chance that the Extropians list
will quit to give the Transhuman list a monopoly on discussion of these topics.

I was _wondering_ when this book would make it to the American market!
I proofread and commented on a section of the draft involving cryonics.

A little personal background on this:

Peter James contacted me about 4 years ago on this, when I was living
in London, as I had some (limited) previous experience on Alcor's
suspension and transport teams.  He expressed that he would be visiting
Alcor's U.S. facilities, which at that time were still in Riverside,
California.  After long conversation, I came to the conclusion that
Peter was sincere about the depth of his research.

I was not disappointed in my supposition.  The many manuscript pages
on which I commented dealt well with their subject matter, especially
given the (somewhat thinly veiled) transition to fiction.

I had the pleasure of discussing this further over a Christmas dinner
held by Alcor UK principal Alan Sinlcair, at his seaside Eastbourne hotel,
at which Peter was present.  A genuinely nice guy, with an active mind.

Peter had enjoyed *Extropy*, and had told me he would be writing a
mention of it into the novel.  Now I really _must_ lay my hands on a copy,
as I haven't read the entire work, just the cryonics-related sections.

By the way, as I didn't have Peter's email address, I did an
Alta Vista search on keywords '+"Peter James" book +Host' and got this
interesting link as hit #1:

'Host', by Peter James - The Electronic Book
http://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/casa/host.html

According to that page, the U.S. paper version appeared December 1995.

An excerpt from that URL:

"The electronic version of Host allows the reader to call up
 cross references which include the author's research notes, audio and
 video clips, photographs, illustrations and definitions of
 scientific terms. The text is therefore just part of a much wider
 software package.

   Electronic Host includes:

     The full text of the novel
     Hot-key words which bring up all the back-up research conducted
          by the author in writing the novel
     A quicktime video of Peter James introducing the novel
     An audio epilogue featuring Peter James explaining developments
          since the novel. "

Very interesting!  Of course, it's not a _web_ version, but rather,
strangely, a HyperCard version.  I hope to see a full-blown version
for the WWW sometime, in similar fashion to:

"Engines of Creation", K. Eric Drexler, full text:
http://reality.sgi.com/whitaker/EnginesOfCreation/

I'm copying this to Peter, whose address seems to be 'scary@pavilion.co.uk',
from what I can gather from my Alta Vista search.

Some other web resources apropos to this, mostly reviews and/or announcements:

http://www.newu.uci.edu/~newu/Issues/01.08.96/Quixotic/bookreview.html

An excerpt from the book:
http://www.randomhouse.com/site/host/sample.html

A pic of Peter, with bibliography:
http://www.cat.pdx.edu/~caseyh/horror/author/james.html

I don't know if this is up-to-date, but an excerpt from
http://www.cat.pdx.edu/~caseyh/horror/interview/upgarris.html :

"Host, a two-part mini-series in development at ABC to be directed and
     produced by Garris. Based on the novel by Peter James, the screenplay is
by
     Preston Sturges. Frank Von Zerneck and Robert Sertner also produce."

Yow!  The first I've heard of _this_!  I'm copying Peter - presuming
I have his correct email address, to see what's up here.

Peter: hi there!  I'm copying you on a discussion thread started by

I think Robin Hanson had mentioned something of this sort.
However, if this hasn't been taken care of by 15 September,
when I return from Japan, I'll take it on myself.

You are kidding, aren't you?  5 years?

Besides which, seen from my own extropian perspective, it's
unnecessarily bellicose to talk of annihilation of competing
memesets.  Better to speak of ours "outcompeting" theirs.

Even the "technically-minded" on the IRC channels have the
attention span of goldfish.  Sorry, this is just a reaction to
my experience on the HotWired Chat today, where I logged in
expecting high-quality interaction related to the More/Borsook
debate, and instead saw 'wannafuck?' messages aimed at the
few women in the room.

Grumble.

The Extropians FAQ, which I've been the de facto maintainer of, is available at

        http://www.c2.org/~arkuat/extr/faq/

The BrainTenis debate on HotWired has made me aware that things have
developed to to the point where the FAQ is rather seriously out-of-date on
a number of points. Since my immediate priority is to work on the ExI
website (which I haven't started yet) and since Internet FAQs have a
tradition of organic growth through the contributions of interested
parties, I'd like to invite all list members (especially the new ones!) to
review the FAQ, and post here any suggested revisions or changes. If you
notice any serious mistakes, inaccuracies, or rhetorical blunders, please
bring them to my attention.

All I'm willing to volunteer to do at this time is to take those
suggestions to which no major objections are raised (including my own
objections :-) and add them, wholesale, to the existing text. I'll
incorporate URLs (or mailto links, if no URL is available) of the author
along with credits.

Try, it, dude! I recommend setting a good example if you want to see more
E-prime. My friend and I tried it for ten minutes last month and found that
there was some major part of English that didn't have much to with identity
that we couldn't use. Oh, yeah, the present and past continuous. E-prime,
like many limits, has benefit for thinking about the limits, but I prefer a
subset that doesn't cut out any tenses. (See, I did it. I think.)

Eric,

You may desire to mention in the 'nanotechnology' section that
Drexler's book is available in its entirety on the web (Engines):

http://reality.sgi.com/whitaker/EnginesOfCreation/

(re: http://www.c2.org/~arkuat/extr/faq/nano.html )

I see you don't have an RKBA.html ("Right to Keep and Bear Arms").
Would you like me to write one?

That does have a good strategic purpose sometimes. I have to say, though, I
usually do it for fun. That's another problem with E-prime--it's harder to
be blunt in E-prime than in English. To point out an offensive equation,
you have to IMPLY it, which seems kind of sneaky and less forceful. As I
say, I LIKE offending people sometimes. For someone who doesn't, this
E-prime thing might be an advantage, and it's certainly an advantage for
noticing one's own limiting equations.

Do you think this fondness for, ah, 'uncompromising objectivity' might be
related to the difficulties we Extropians encounter in introducing and
disseminating our memes?

Yeah but wouldn't outcompeting mean annihilation? We need to spread the meme
as far and wide as possible to get it to the masses as quickly as possible
so as to speed things up even more.

All threads must die eventually. Now that the main debate between Max and
Paulina is over, the thread will wither and die because there is no one to
direct it and prevent it from becoming a general topic zone. Maybe you
joined the thread a little too late. Sorry.

Many people in the past have tried to tame the wildly spammed newsgroup
alt.extropians in the past. Now that we realize that the audience is out
there, IT IS TIME TO ACT! *MANY* people are interested in these principles
and we *NEED* some type of public debating forum where we can bring the
extropian meme to the public rather than sit in isolation hiding in our
mailinglist. I will begin to post messages to alt.extropians and I *STRONGLY
URGE* you to do the same. EXTROPIANISM CAN DEBUNK ANY OTHER MEME ON THE
PLANET AND I WISH TO PROVE THAT FACT.

Let the Ribbon Cutting Ceremony to the opening of the *NEW* alt.extropians
begin!

The only way life could fail to eventually to make a substantial impact on 
the cosmos is if nanotechnology is impossible, and that hardly seems likely, 
life itself is a primitive form of Nanotechnology.

But tool-using intelligence didn't happen quickly, it took at least  
3.5 billion years. What history teaches us is that even if an animal has 
only a modest sized brain, if it has a good  organ for manipulating matter 
with precision, a hand in our case, then it will evolve a much larger brain 
very quickly, and will instantaneously (from a geological perspective) reach 
the point we are at today.

Technology generally makes things happen faster not slower, and the wider 
distribution of information, technology has certainly done that, does not 
bode well for the feasibility of stagnation.

The idea that accustoming people to the offensiveness of truth is a 
laudable activity on which I will not comment here.  However, I 
suggest that using the statement: "Blacks are more stupid than whites."
as an example of a "truth" is at best confusing and at worst very
ill-conceived.

My suggestion is that when thinking of examples of "offensive truth"
to accustom people, examples which refer to oneself might be chosen
which demonstrate more rigor and less ambiguity.

              TERRORIZES  TOBACCO  WORKER

By Ian Williams Goddard

The Associated Press ( The Washington Times, A10, 8/23/96 ) 
reports that Mark Deane, an employee of the Philip Morris tobacco 
company, has filed a $6 million lawsuit over threats made against 
his person by Food and Drug Administration investigators.

After FDA investigators failed to arrive to a scheduled meeting 
on April 12, Mr. Deane left his home on an errand. His vehicle 
was then forced to stop by the car of the FDA investigators 
named in his suit: Gary Dean Light and an unnamed "John Doe."

The AP article states that the "two men jumped out of the car, and 
Mr. Light shoved a blue-and-white badge into Mr. Deane's face and 
said he and Mr. Doe were special agents of he Justice Department 
working 'under the special jurisdiction of the grand jury.'"

At that point Mr. Deane refused to speak without his attorney 
present. The suit states that Mr. light then stated in a 
threatening tone " We'll be seeing you."

Then on April 17 the same two agents once again forced Mr. 
Deane's car to a stop. The suit states that this time they told 
Mr. Deane that if he did not cooperate with the investigator's 
demands he was " EXPENDABLE " and that they could "lock him 
up for 72 hours without anyone knowing anything about it." 

If true, no witness that the FDA brings in to a courtroom to speak 
before a jury can be believed because of the possibility that their 
testimony has been tainted by the threat of death. These threats 
appear to have been an attempt to coerce an individual to make 
legal statements he would not otherwise make.


----  TERROR OVER TRUTH  ----

Increasingly, terror is the tool of choice in governmental operations.
This case of FDA intimidation is like the case of the intimidation 
by the FBI of Vince Foster death scene witness Patrick Knowlton just 
before he was to testify before the grand jury and after he refused 
to change his story as to what he saw at the Fort Marcy Park. Mr. 
Knowlton and his attorney John H. Clarke have compiled a report
of witness tampering and intimidation -- an excerpt is at:

                 http://ic.net/~celano/tamp2.html
                
It appears that the govt has become so despotic that it is willing 
to resort to physical intimidation and death threats in order to change 
facts and create a false reality -- a truth by terror. The goal seems
to be producing desired outcomes in legal investigations that will 
protect or expand to power of the federal government.

In fact, stemming from the FDA's long battle to gain legal control 
over tobacco, President Clinton just singed an executive order -- 
a law by decree -- that grants the FDA sweeping new powers to 
crack down on tobacco. 

While these new FDA powers are supposedly an effort to keep tobacco 
away from children, the new legal definition of tobacco reportedly 
gives the FDA the legal right to prohibit tobacco altogether. 

If intimidation and terror reign over truth and justice, tyranny 
is sure to extinguish the light that is liberty, leaving the 
people at the mercy of malevolent masters.

Besides, as Thomas Sowell points out in _Race and Culture_ cultural values
(from the family on out to "society") are a greater determinant than race
of how smart and successful one becomes. Genetics are certainly a factor to
some extent, but hardly as great as reading _The Bell Curve_ might lead one
to believe.

The word "gaijin" literally means "foreign person". Many Westerners like to
think that the Japanese use it in the same way as the Grand Dragon of the Ku
Klux Klan uses "nigger", but it ain't really true. They use it when they mean
"nigger", but they also sometimes use it to mean "honorable nigger".

it doesn't reflect the views of more than a VERY few >Hs.

[As usual, I would like to hear suggestions for improvements of this
document. It resides at
http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Individual/Body/improvements.html]

Physical Improvements of Humans

By Anders Sandberg

Based on the discussions on rec.arts.sf.science, August 1996. I have stolen
ideas and some sentences from the participants, which I hereby acknowledge.

This page is devoted to modifications of the human body that are mainly
surgical, chemical and genetic; bionics and genetic engineering have their
own pages.

Many of these ideas are general improvements of bugs or atavisms in our
body, while some are outright changes. While some are likely to be popular
among all humans (like production of vitamin C and improved organ
suspension) others (like becoming amphibious or furry) will probably be used
by only some people.


Skeleton

There are many possibilities for strengthening the skeleton, but it is
important to keep the lightness and avoid making it too brittle (metals are
too heavy). One idea is to use buckytubes or diamond composites instead of
calcium phosphate crystals as the hard component of the bones.

Arms and Hands

Hands are definitely the area (beside the brain) where people have the most
ideas.

Generally, many would like to extend their capabilities with extra opposable
fingers. At the same time, while the thumb is strong and dextrous, it is
rather slow and not suitable for fine manipulation. Having fingers of
different sizes is useful, and many would like to have longer fingers.

The formation of the fingers are due to a gradient of morphogens, which
induces the different changes. By influencing it, we can get more fingers
and quite possibly two thumbs. It seems likely that the shape, number of
joints and strength of the fingers can be changed this way.

Adding more fingers might decrease motoric and sensory acuity if the cortex
is not extended, but the brain is believed to have quite a bit of reserve
capacity in this area.

Adding two extra arms is a popular idea, although this would require some
rather complex bone restructuring in the torso to attach them. A more
radical idea would be two tentacles (octopus-style) extending at the
shoulders (this would add a new way to manipulate objects)

The medial nerve and the tendons for the thumb go through the carpal tunnel,
which is clearly limiting and often gets into trouble. They should be
diverted.

Legs

Many people complain that the knees are easily damaged; they are actually
quite optimal, but might profit from a few more ligaments.

The feet can be redesigned to prehensile feet, although that would limit our
ability to walk long distances or run very fast in exchange for increased
dexterity.

One radical possibility would be to add an extra pair of legs. This is
complex, but one idea is to add an extra hinge point to the torso so that
the arms and head could be raised (much like a centaur); we could walk on
all fours while using our hands normally. This could be combined with
widening the pelvic arc, and perhaps with making the first pair of feet
prehensible (the arms are used for dextrous manipulation, the forefeet for
manipulation requiring strength).

Altering the proportions of fast-twitch, slow-twitch muscle fibers might be
desirable for some people; muscle cells do not divide, but can
enlarge/shrink depending on use. It might be desirable to add the option of
some regrowth, especially to deal with accidents and wounds.

Torso

The main problem with the torso is the spine - it is easily overloaded and
damaged. One possibility would be to add a few short ribs to the lower back
to attach tendons, improving overall strength and resilency, but decreasing
the twisting ability. It is probably likely that it could be modified in
other ways to work well with our new ecological niche as seat-dwellers (this
could be combined with modifications of gluteus maximus).

One idea is to suspend internal organs from the skeletal system, perhaps
using tendons, instead of letting them lie on diaphragm. This would prevent
many forms of hernia.

Gastro-Intestinal Tract

The symbiotic intestinal flora might be improved or made "smarter", for
example by adding genetically designed versions (overall, our entire
microflora could be improved, for example to produce clean or pleasant
smells).

One possibility would be to modify the urinary system to output its waste
into the GIT, but caution has to be taken to limit the risk of infection.

Circulatory System

Since we are bipedal, our circulatory system has to work much harder to pump
blood vertically. It might be a good idea to add an extra heart or several
"helper hearts", perhaps based on the peristaltic hearts of insects, along
the aorta or in the legs.

Adrenaline thickens the blood, it becomes more likely to clot; very sensible
in a natural environment, but downright deadly in a stressful modern city.
Unlinking the fibrinogenic system from adrenaline control would definitely
lower the incidence of cardiovascular disease.

Breathing

The human breathing system has some drawbacks, primarily the risk of choking
on food. Ideally breathing/speaking would be done through another orfice, or
at least there would be a spare opening that could be used in desperate
situations or for integration with scuba gear and similar technological
add-ons.

Most air in the lungs is rather stale and is not vented with each normal
breath, but this is a minor problem since the primary purpose of the lungs
is to went carbon dioxide instead of absorbing oxygen (which is very
plentiful). A uniflow system would be much smaller, but would loose heat and
water faster than our current countercurrent system.

Aquatic breathing is a classic idea. Making human amphibious or wholly
aquatic is more complex than modifying the breathing system, it would be a
good idea to add a thicker warming layer of fat beneath the skin, make the
arms and legs more suitable for swimming, fill the ears with water to enable
underwater hearing and modify the eyes (for example by adding clear
nicticating membranes).

One possibility would be reserve air storage, for example by improved red
blood cells and myoglobin. But the main problem is getting rid of carbon
dioxide.

Reproduction/Sex

Built-in contraceptives are a quite popular idea; some might be interested
in removing menstruation, PMS and menopause entirely. Ideally, ovulation
(and ejaculation) would be under voluntary control.

The female pelvic girdle is a bottleneck, both due to our large heads (see
the head section for some ideas) and our upright stance. It is surprisingly
flexible, but might still be improved judging from the number of cesarian
sections and deaths at birth in general. A radical solution would be to use
a pouch instead, like kangaroos. This would allow the head to grow without
any traumas, and allow men to bear children too (assuming the embryo grows
inside the mother, then leaves and climbs into the pouch of the father or
mother). Some psychologists have suggested that this would reduce birth
trauma a lot and enhance mother(father)-child bonding.

Some people might like genital taste buds and other improvements in
innervation. Since the taste cortex is very close to the primary sensory
cortex of the tounge, it appears likely that genital taste buds could be
implemented and linked to suitable cortical regions by piggy-backing on the
normal sensory pathways (most likely the taste sensations will be different
from oral taste). Erogenous zones are apparently partially culturally
dependent and often individual, but it appears likely that there are some
neural pathways that could be added to create new erogenous zones (or remove
them).

Some find it unaesthetic to place the urinary tract in or close to the
sexual organ, and would like another solution (like emitting urine into the
lower intestine)

Metabolism

We are adapted to a diet of a projectile-predator on the East African
savannah, not to living in a techno-agricultural niche. Our metabolism can
definitely be modified to fit our current lifestyle better, and avoid many
common problems (such as cholesterol plaques; predators manage this nicely,
but as omnivores we have problems with excessive intake).

Make weight and metabolic setpoints more easily changed; some peoples have
problems in storing surplus food, so that the are more susceptible to
malnutrition, while others tend to store too much fat and develop diabetes
and heart disease.

Humans are among the few mammals that cannot manufacture vitamin C. Adding
this capability would appear very simple, and it might have useful effects
as an antioxidant and immune-enhancer.

Skin

Pigment levels should ideally be easier to control, so that it would become
darker to avoid sunburn before it occurs.

The amount of hair that appears is apparently genetically determined
(although beard growth is positively correlated to testosterone levels). It
might be desirable to find ways to increase/decrease the amount of hair. Fur
is a distinct possibility, together with adding patterns to it (this might
be done to the skin too, creating "tigers" or "leopards").

An increase in sensitivity in some areas is probably desirable, and quite
probably pleasurable.

Head

The human head is a evolutionary bottleneck; making it any bigger would
complicate birth enormously, and probably incur a greater chance of brain
damage. One possibility would be to influence bone and brain growth so that
more development can occur outside of the mother's body. There are still
some limits to the size of the head, especially since it has to balance on
the spinal column and the neck muscles.

The skull is a good protection for the brain, but maybe not optimal.
Especially intracranial hemmorages are very dangerous, hard to detect in
time and mostly due to badly arranged blood vessels. Ideally the numerous
small and easily damaged veins between the skull and brain should be made
more flexible, removed or replaced with reinforced larger veins.

Update the sinuses to belong on an upright biped - our noses tend to clog
instead of drain.

Human teeth are problematic, due to our long lifespans and our tendency to
eat food that are bad for them. Inducing the growth of several sets of teeth
instead of just the milk- and adult-teeth seems to be a good idea (unless
one want to replace them with wholly artificial systems a la Jaws or use
resilient ceramics).

Remove the vomero-nasal organ (VNO) to become independent of pheromones.
This will likely make a person less likely to become romantically involved
with others or react strongly to the body odors of people, but might suit
those who want to keep their emotions entirely under their own control.

Eyes

Adding ultraviolet vision is possible, since our receptors can detect it
(partially by fluoroscence) but the lens absorbs it; by replacing the lens
UV-vision becomes possible. Unfortunately this increases the risk for
retinal damage, and there would be some problems with chromatic aberration
(maybe we could develop a double lens system to fix this).

Infrared sight is hard to do well, since the eye would only be able to see
objects warmer than itself.

One idea would be a pair of extra eyes specialized for UV or IR vision
(perhaps like the heat-sensitive pits of certain snakes), and another would
be to add nicticating membrances to limit the part of spectrum we look at.
This could also be protective and useful for aquatic living.

Brain and Nervous System

Humans are easily addicted by pleasurable stimuli. It might be a good idea
to add a taste-flip, so that a repeated stimuli after a while is not as
pleasurable (this would have to work around the fact that most addictive
drugs influence the mesolimbic dopamine system and nucleus accumbens; the
mental interpretation of this would have to be possibly reversed by
introducing habituating interneurons). This would be similar to how boredom
makes repeated behaviors slightly unpleasant, keeping us active.

The chemical senses of the brain are subtle, and are often able to detect
quite well if some nutrients or chemicals are lacking in the body. These
senses might be strengthened and made more conscious (as sometimes happens
during pregnancy), which no doubt would improve healthy eating. In some
diseases smell becomes more acute, which shows that it is possible to
enhance senses in a biological way.

In the same way, it might be desirable to be able to control the strength of
sensory stimuli, to avoid being overwhelmed. This could involve the ability
to "close one's ears" and suppress pain (pain is an important signal that
something is wrong, but should not incapacitate us)-

Sleep is important (probably to integrate memories during REM sleep and to
let the immune system function well), but should be easier to control. Since
it is possible to train oneself to become an "efficient sleeper", it is
likely that it could be speeded up biologically. The ability to temporarily
suppress sleep is desirable, although long-term effects are probably rather
bad.

The "fight-or-flight" stress response tends to "white-out" higher mental
functions and replace them with instinctive reactions - very efficient in a
dangerous natural setting, but less useful in a technological world where
dangers seldom can be avoided by instinct. Ted Sturgeon suggested that the
response would be rewired so that the higher functions become more active
and speed up under serious stress. This would require some rather complex
rewiring of the brainstem, but is probably feasible (for example, the
noradrenergic neurons of the locus ceruleus have a generally activating
effect on the whole of the brain, and are linked to this response).

There are many subtle errors in normal human cognition, which cause various
problems in the modern world. For example, we tend to mix up implication
with equivalence, judge risks in a very irrational manner (more people are
afraid of flying than of driving) and make incorrect generalizations. If
deductive/inductive reasoning could be instinctively learned during early
maturation just like language, or these errors corrected, people would
become less likely to fall into logical traps or irrationality.

"Temporal Lobe Personality" is a term sometimes used to describe some
people, who have increased activity in their temporal lobes: sexual drive is
suppressed, paranoia, they tend to become almost monomaniac, extremely
obsessed with details of the work and often have grand visions. Apparently
both Dostoyevsky and van Gogh suffered from this condition. It would be
useful if the more positive symptoms of TLP could be replicated and
voluntarily controlled.

Our bad memory is a common complaint. While long-term memory is very good,
we are not as good at retrieving necessary information (this can be
trained). And short-term memory can only handle 7+-2 chunks; if this could
be extended we might become much better at handling several trains of
thought at once.

Immune System

The immune system is excellent at fighting intruders and antigens, but tends
to overreact, especially in places of high living standard where there are
fewer dangers (the mast cells, which normally fight parasites seem to cause
allergies when they are "out of work"). Ideally, its level should be more
easily controllable, so that it could be kept at a safe level most of the
time, and increased when shifting environment. This could be combined with
the possibility of decreasing its attacks against certain antigens (but not
all) to enable implants or some forms of surgery.

Hormone System

Our emotions are strongly influenced by hormone levels, which tend to swing
out of control during adolescence or in some situations. It might be
desirable to have conscious control of how much hormones are released, or to
make the brain less susceptible to their influence.

Decline in hormone levels due to aging should naturally be lessened; this is
actually one possible origin of many aging signs and diseases.

Aging and Development

Slowing aging is high on almost everyone's wishlist.

In our society, we would need a longer maturation time, ideally with no
fixed end. One possibility is to make maturation and aging slow down more
and more, so that everyone eventually reaches a steady state corresponding
to the 20's (which are optimal in many ways).

"Youthful idealism" might be partially hormonal, a way to make young males
restless and leave the tribe to found new tribes. This apparently declines
in most people as they age and become settled, but it might be possible to
extend it (an idealism supplement?), which would probably be very healthy to
do from time to time to prevent mental aging.

My suggestion is that each page (most of which I think still work quite
well!) shoud have a list of relevant links to other resources, as a kind
of reference listing. For example, the section about environmentalism
might have links to Nick Szabo's Green Goo-essay, some of Phil Goetz
environmental essays, John McCarty's website about sustainability and
maybe some environmentalist attack on the extropians.

This is an important problem, and I think it is worth thinking of. How to 
manage our brains when we can potentially rewrite them? Accidentally 
reformatting our neural networks can be prevented by regular backups, but 
what about entering bizarre motivational states (which are subjective, 
and quite logical to the victim: "I *enjoy* chanting primes!")? Should we 
help them?

I would very much like to see this experiment (or rather the data!). But I
think it would be quite hard to do; movement is limited in a scanner (the
head is fixed), but timing would be very hard;  we might have to use a
rather long-lasting radioisotope, since I assume most participants would
find getting an injection during sex a slight turn-off. And to image the
activity during orgasm the scanner has to be started at the right moment -
the logistics is staggering. And to get noise-free, clean images we must 
do this several times - where to get the volunteers? (OK, some are always 
kinky enough, but that might be a bias). 

As you can tell, I have pondered many kinds of unusual experiments with a
PET scanner. I want one! Another fun idea would be to study the minds of
very enlightened gurus, to see the physiology of mystic ecstasy (and are
their pineal glands as sclerotic as in normal people of the same age?).
And I want to see how dreams look - but imagine trying to sleep in a
scanner with your head fixed, while a nurse injects radioactive sugar and
your blood is slowly drained by a catheter to measure its radioactivity!

Don't worry, I've been on The Extropian List about 4 years and have seen 
remarkably few examples of racism, probably because it's so incredibly stupid 
it would be comic if it hadn't caused the world so much misery. Extropians 
like smart people, the amount of pigment in their skin is as irrelevant as 
their shoe size (People with a size 10 foot are sub human, kill them all!!). 
As for stupid people, this Extropian has nothing against them  either, I know 
some that I like a lot, it's only stupid people who think they are brilliant 
that I dislike.

of course anders is right. i think eric was looking for specifics rather
than meta-suggestions, but now I have to add to your meta-suggestion: when
possible a list of relevant links should always include a link to a
humorous and an opposing perspective, right? or am I unusual in thinking
humor is a crucial part of human learning?

Perhaps not in learning, but in human *being*. We need stimulation, 
challenges and happiness to grow. So I second your proposal, it will 
probably be very useful.

        I think we can all agree on one thing: the truest pleasure comes
from the fulfillment of desire.  The truest desire is the fulfillment of
pleasure.
What that pleasure may be is judged by the individual.  In effect, I think we've
milked the sacred cow.

I've been thinking a lot lately about the evolution of things.  About 
technology.  Nanotech.  Artificial Life.  Artificial Intelligence.  And I was 
thinking that it's only a matter of time until some very highly advanced 
nanotech auto-replicators evolve from technology.  It's also only a matter of 
time until very advanced artificial intelligence develops, and develops 
capabilities far exceeding human capabilities.  

I also see no reason to suppose that humans will have control over these 
developments, past a certain point.  Sure, we will try to make these things 
very friendly to life and to humans, and it may be in their best interests to 
be so.  But I can think of all kinds of reasons why none of these developments 
would really care about humans or other types of life.  I can think of 
situations where they would care about other life enough to not displace it 
too much, but I can't find any compelling reasons why this should necessarily 
happen.

I think some very advanced life forms will eventually emerge through 
technology.  Life forms far more advanced than current Earth life, in terms of 
survivability and in their ability to evolve quickly and exploit energy 
resources efficiently.  I don't think that current forms of life will really 
have much of a chance against these advanced forms.

This actually isn't very disturbing to me -- I sort of think it's a good 
thing.  Survival of the fittest.  We're all for it when we're the fittest.  
But how long will that be?

I love life.  Not just my life.  But Life.  The whole concept.  Things 
mutating and adapting and competing.  Weeding out the inferior.  The whole 
process.  I think it's great.  I just think that future life may look back on 
us the way we look back on pre-cellular life.  Interesting, yes.  But only the 
first step.  Just setting things up for the explosion.  Ancestral, but still 
very primative.

It should be interesting to see how things develop -- for as long as I can 
keep up, that is.

Yeah.  There's just 300 megayears between rock and fossils.  It might be
informative to consider what type of rocks are from then, but I can't

} I agree with your timeline about the appearance of oxygen in the atmosphere, 
} but I see no reason why only Eukaryotes could have caused it.

Especially since eukaryotes are largely emborged prokaryotes --
chloroplasts are cyanobacteria in a cushy position.  But Robin's point
might have been the other way around -- eukaryotes need oxygen, and if
they appear as soon as there's enough O2 in the atmosphere, well, there
goes another part of the filter.  The data's overall reliability is
still shaky though, I think, authoritative papers or no.  We argued
about stuff like this in geology classes a bit.

I forgot to mention my favorite solution to the Fermi Paradox when
talking with Robin, though.  They _are_ out there.  They're being very,
very quiet.  So as not to disturb us?  No.  Because they've all evolved
into Sagan's passive non-expansionists?  No.

Because they're scared silly (or rather, silent) of the berserkers.
Even a NASA commission, I've heard, suggested that perhaps being too
loud wasn't such a good idea.  I can imagine every other society
reaching our stage, having the idea of Darwinism on hand, being on the
brink of passing into a world state anyway (assumption, but plausible if
needed), seeing the great silence and deciding that for the Safety of
the Race We Will be Very Unobtrusive.  No Gain is Worth a Risk to the
Species.  If they ever get bored with this stage they might have turned
into advanced versions of Imperial China, which didn't care to explore
the world anymore, thank you very much.  That stage does require
exploration to be expensive; the first stage just requires a good police
state.  So the universe is filled with pessimistic versions of Niven's
State, Chinas, and Vinge's World State from "The Peddler" (although I
suppose something like the Peace Authority could work.)  Paranoia is
probably far more reliably universal than altruism.

Now, even if you take this seriously it probably can't explain more than
1 or 2 orders of magnitude.  (Especially since I'd hope for us to be the
exception.)  But I love the idea.  The berserkers aren't everywhere.
The berkserkers don't even exist.  The idea, though...

          I think you have a point there. What I meant was that if

The reading list about which I have previously posted is now available from
my web site (directly from the home page, or via the >H & Ex page) or at:

http://dialspace.dial.pipex.com/sarah.marr/SKMbooks.html

Thanks to those who have already contributed: Anders Sandberg, David Cary,
David McFadzean, Russell Whitaker and Eric Watt Forste.

The only way it can get better is by contributions from the rest of you. The
FAQ which is available from the list tells you how to make those contributions.

I do believe this is a very worthwhile project, and would urge you to
contribute to its future success.

It's very difficult to use the word 'stupid' in such a way as to make it
clear that you do not intend it to be degrading and emotive; which means it
would be difficult to change its connotations by usage alone.

Compare this to the reclaiming of 'queer' by the gay community: they have
been able to do this by using the word to describe _themselves_.

I can see how 'stupid' might become emotionally-neutral if people who
considered themselves stupid called _themselves_ stupid, but not if others
call them stupid. Even if those others were careful to qualify their
statements, I believe it would smack of sentences which begin "I'm not
homophobic but...", etc. and still not achieve anything.

The problem with this scenario is that even if only one in a thousand
civilizations don't meet this fate, that still leaves an enourmous
filter to be explained.

Of course we must admit there may be things we don't understand.  But
none of these specific considerations you mention seem to point to
anything but the standard conclusion.  As Clark points out, more ways
of varying people just makes the expectation stronger that someone
somewhere will try colonization.  You could have said the same thing
about "the theory of energy conservation" instead of "social
sciences".

A billion years seems too long.  Do you have a source re the actual
temp vs. time curve?  And bacteria are lots hardier than Dinos.

My sources are pretty authoritive (see paper cites), and clearly say
that Eukaryotic cells appeared about 1.8-2.0 bya (billion years ago),
when the atmosphere became oxygen-dominated after all the ocean's iron
was finally oxidized.  (Thus this was probably not a hard step.)  Such
cells became lots more common though about 1.1 bya, apparently with
the invention of sex (a good hard step candidate).

I'm speaking of "trial and error" type steps, search across a flat
fitness landscape.  If the expected time is a trillion years, the
chance of it happening in a billion is one in a thousand.

>>The really hard stages, I think, do not cluster near us in time.
 
Here I meant such trial and error steps, which can only go up.  Steps
which can go up or down, such as mass descruction, can cluster in time.

You mean to say that it is good to wear the emotional connotations off of
English words, right?

I could see this in another language, maybe, but English has a range of
connotative words for just about everything, you could pick precisely the
one you want.

Agree. I think this is will be a 'singularity' event, more so than
nano-tech. Nano-tech without AI will be quite limited, whereas AI will be
able to develop nano.

I'll die trying! That's why I think it's crucial that we have major
breakthroughs in philosophy, ethics and psychology before AI outsmarts us
totally. If we can figure out what the purpose of lives is, how we determine
values and how to motivate ourselves in a way that will achieve our goals,
then we have a chance of developing AI that shares our purposes. It seems
that AI and AL (life) will also have some sort of basic pain/pleasure
motivator and some preassigned goals. Shades of Azimov's three robotic laws
? Another strategy is to develop AI firstly as an extension to our own
minds, to give us extra knowledge, IQ and creativity before AI gets too
autonomous. Key to both of these strategies is that we know what we're doing
and why we're doing it - that we don't leave AI design up to
random/evolutionary design (don't get me wrong - I am definitely not a
statist. I'm talking about the preferred scientific approach).

>This actually isn't very disturbing to me -- I sort of think it's a good

I don't think it's a good think at all! My life is much more important to me
than the abstract concept of the theory of evolution. Seeing AI & AL happen
is an important value to me, but never more important than my survival and
well-being. In fact, the only reason AI & Al are of value to me, is to the
extent that they expand my life (and the lives of people dear to me). An
important philosophical issue I'd say.

What's wrong with a variety?  We're supposed to be moderately
technically proficient, perhaps someone might code a java
implementation, so placing the cursor over a link brings up a short
hotlist of a variety of pages relating to it.

I'd also like to see more pages (mayhaps this faq?) using the
'backlinks' concept .. http://www.foresight.org/backlinks.news.html has
some practical suggestions, & some more broad inf. @
www.foresight.org/enhance.html .

If not putting up a java-based 'extropians-faq', the html-based one may
at least want to add some of the more recent w3c-accepted html
extensions like a frames-based menu system.  

Just to be trite (but hey, you can't argue w/free marketing), putting up
higher-res full-screen 'wallpaper' shots of the logo & 'slug' (upwards &
outwards, or something equivalently pithy) &c. for d/l might be memeful.

On the especially trite end, has anyone taken a look at the
libertarians' moderately leading (heck, nothing's really objective when
it comes right down to it) 'World's Smallest Political Quiz'?  The aroma
of cheese may turn off the more vegan aesthetes ;), but it does manage
to spread the meme with some success .. an html-based equivalent for
extropianism might help draw in a few.

No I don't, I doubt if anybody has precise enough knowledge to make such a  
curve. My statement that the early earth must of been hot was based on the 
following. The Earth was formed by a very large cloud of particles, this 
cloud must have possessed a lot of potential gravitational energy. When the  
Earth coalesced this potential energy was gone and was replaced by heat 
energy, a LOT of heat energy, enough that if converted to kinetic energy 
could push every atom in the planet away from the center at the escape 
velocity of 7  miles a second. A secondary source of heat would come from 
radioactive isotopes that the earth must have possessed in much higher  
abundance 4.6 billion years ago than today. Radioactive potassium would have 
given off the most heat, followed by uranium. Harold Urey calculated that the
radioactivity alone was enough to heat the center of the Earth ( admittedly 
not the surface) to 1500 degrees C. The center of the Earth is thought to be 
at about 5500 degrees C, the rest of the heat came from the kinetic energy of 
in-falling matter.

The fact that not a single rock survives from Earth's first 800 million years 
indicates that conditions must have been very violent indeed, but it also 
destroys the evidence about exactly  how hot it was.   
                      

                >bacteria are lots hardier than Dinos.


Yes, but are bacteria hardier than rocks, especially the very earliest 
bacteria? Also, these bacteria must do more than just survive, they must 
evolve from simple chemicals.

Looking through my home library I can find 3 books to support my 1.2 to 1.4 
bya  claim for the first Eukaryotic cells, "Life Itself" by Francis Crick, 
"Origins" by Robert Shapiro (no, not OJ's lawyer), and "Darwin to DNA" by 
G Ledyard Stebbins, I found another book "The Rise of Life" by John Reader 
that said 1.45 bya. As I mentioned, I do remember reading about a claim for a 
later figure, but for the life of me I can't remember where. I suspect that 
when you look at tiny fossils that are billions of years old, it's not always 
easy to tell if they're Prokaryotes or Eukaryotes.
                    
I agree with your timeline about the appearance of oxygen in the atmosphere, 
but I see no reason why only Eukaryotes could have caused it.

It would be most interesting to know if liquid water existed at that time, but 
unfortunately all rocks of that era have been badly deformed, metamorphosed 
and intruded, making study of them much more difficult.

Some Eukaryotes need free oxygen, but for others it is a useless waste 
product, it certainly is not a defining characteristic of them. If Robin is 
correct and Eukaryotes evolved about 2 billion years ago and not 1.4 billion 
as I said, then that would mean complex single cell life is easier to make 
than I thought, but multicellular life is more difficult.

I must say that I'm not sure about either 'unlimited' or 'maximum'. The
former seems to exclude personal choice in restricting one's own freedoms in
some desirable way, whilst the latter opens the possibility of others
restricting one's freedoms in undesirable ways.

I think 'dynamic individual freedom' sums up my approach to the subject: I
wish to define my own freedoms to suit my own worldview and have the
flexibility to manipulate and alter those freedoms as that worldview changes.

Yes, it seems that the universal law is a digital one: exist or don`t 
exist.  I can definitely see ourselves creating our evolutionary 
successors.  But I`m not going to give up my existance without a 
fight, after I`ve help create these monsters, I`ll do everything in 
my power to stop them from wiping me out - but only after they have 
evoloved to the level where they have the option of doing so.  In 
self organizing systems, each component must believe that it is the 
best one, for the whole organism to remain healthy.

What if you invented an algorithm which is crucial to the workings of 
a very succesfull a-life organism which is set to replace humanity.  
A meme you have created will be immortal, and the father-mother of a 
new era in evolution.  Do you want to live on through your genes, or 
your memes ?

It can be much more subtle than that. The important question is "What kind
of existence?". I think it would be unlikely that we create successors
that out-compete us, most likely they will inhabit a somewhat different
ecological/memetic niche that will overlap with ours; competition and 
cooperation will most likely lead to adaption.

For example, humans thrive on the Earth, which from the perspective of a
dry nano superbeing is the Sixth Circle of Hell - air which oxidizes and 
prevents easy landing, a complex environment and a deep gravity well. 
Materials can be gathered much more easy in the Belt. And we can't survive 
well in space. So the nanobeings might evolve out there, while trading 
nanoproducts for interesting biological experiences from Earth. A bit 
like the zones in AFUtD. 

Another possibility would be symbiosis: humans might become parts of
extended organisms involving biological, artificial and natural elements,
providing things like optimism, human values, irrational behavior, pattern
recognition and the ability to scratch well - we might be very surprised
of what posthuman beings may need. And in the long run these extended
organisms evolve, until we become parts of them just as procaryotes became
cruicial organelles in eucaryote cells (to borrow from the Filter thread).

It is very hard to give AI preassigned goals; if it is flexible enough or
evolves, it will probably change their goals. But if there are some
evolutionary stable goals/purposes of life, then it is likely that
autoevolving systems will also move towards them - unless the rules for
evolution in memetic evolution have a cruicial difference from the rules
of evolution in genetic evolution (which has created us and most of our
minds).

This is ideal, and probably the best way to become cruicial to the super 
AIs if they ever develop. If AI starts out as extensions of our minds 
instead of separate systems, they will become interdependent and we will 
essentially hitch a ride into a posthuman world as an old but important 
subsystem (a bit like the brainstem - try surviving without one!).

What can a stellar attacker gain from attacking a budding, or, a mature 
civilization? If he's after information, he can obtain it inobtrusively 
or trade for it (not that he has any use for this information, probably). 
If he's after matter/energy, there are lots of virgin systems, that much we 
know from astronomical data. What for, then?

You make good points, Anders, about humans and nanite-AI's having possibly
different niches. However, there may be a period during which we're very
much in the same space. That's the period in which humans could be at risk
if AI/SIs have no regard for our interests. What I'm thinking is that it's
possible, even likely, that SI will be developed before really excellent
robotics. AI's in that case would not be roaming around much physically, but
they could exist in distributed form in the same computer networks that we
use for all kinds of functions crucial to us.

If they need us for doing things physically, we would still have a strong
position. Nevertheless, powerful SI's in the computer networks, could exert
massive extortionary power, if they were so inclined. So I still think it
important that SI researchers pay attention to issues of what values and
motivations are built into SIs.

Peter will have his own answer, but mine is: NEITHER! Of course I'm not
particularly interested in living on through my genes (although I'd take
that option if it were the *only* one). While I want my memes, or some of
them, or those that survive critical testing, to live on, I'm vastly more
interested in *me* living on. 

I am not my memes. I have ideas, as well as memories, dispositions, values,
and so on, but it's *me* -- the active, choosing being that I want to
survive and flourish, not primarily some ideas that I have.

So I thoroughly agree with Peter Voss's suggestions. I will encourage AI
researchers developing full blown AI/SI's to build in a value system that
makes them less likely to destroy humans or disregard our interests. I would
much rather support the development of synthetic intelligence systems that
can directly augment our own intelligence, so we don't get left behind.

Fortunately, I suspect, SI (Synthetic Intelligence) research will mostly be
devoted to developing systems specialized for particular purposes, like air
traffic control, finding patterns in cosmological data, discovering new
mathematical theorums, inventing new drugs, etc. That's where the money
lies. I don't see so much commercial interest in pushing for a humanlike
intelligence. Obviously, though, once the components are developed, someone
will want to put them together just to show that it can be done.

I delight in advanced technology, but have no interest in self-sacrifice. I
want to live forever (or as long as I choose). This is vastly more important
to me than seeing that some other lifeform is created. I'm glad that Peter
raised this question. It deserves serious consideration.

BTW, I finished reading Host (by Peter James). I found it extremely hard to
put down and can highly recommend it, despite some criticisms I have of it.
Extremely accurate in its description of cryonics and AI, and genuinely
scary. Reading it may lead the AI-at-any-cost folks to reconsider!

So?  What's the point?  It's an alt.* group, Chris, and we've
been through this before.  Apparently, you're not familiar with
its history.  I applaud your enthusiasm, but I strongly suspect
you'll not be satisfied with the results of your attempt.

Why not write Wade Cherrington yourself and ask?  Max is no

You _are_ new, and have not done your homework.  The Extropians
mailing list has been advertised for 5 years in various media,
including print venues such as *Wired* and major newspapers.
We are not "hiding in our mailinglist".

Realize that most unmoderated newsgroups are routinely
"wildly spammed".  That's their nature: the net has not yet
grown out of the "commons" mentality, and so, to paraphrase
Dean Tribble, the newsgroups are the most vulnerable areas
of "overgrazing".  No one owns alt.extropians.  Sometimes
the grass grows tall, it gets eaten, the winds whip up and
rip out the topsoil, and the land lies barren for a few years.
Only the tracks of pickup trucks loaded with partying teenagers
break up the sterile landscape...

OK, a little over the top, I admit, but this is the regard
in which I hold alt.extropians.

Chris, also, note that posting as "Chris Hind" on this list

Welcome to the *NEW* alt.extropians where we will discuss breakthrough
and currently theoretical technologies such as personality uploading,
telepresence (those webblimps), manipulating global climate with
technologies like HAARP, new breakthrough information such as the
evidence of possible life on Mars and how it could've possibly been
the source of all life in the solar system. I will begin a new thread
every week and you are welcome to post and voice your opinion on the
topic even if you're against what is being discussed.

I think you attribute too much to values and too little to social
institutions.  The reason the U.S. is not usually at war with Mexico
has little to do with how much we each personally value the lives of
Mexicans.  Similarly the reason we tall folks have not slaughtered all
you short folks has little to do with how much we like you.

Rather, these phenomena are mostly due to social institutions and
dependencies - the fact that nations deter via military strength, that
laws deter crime within a nation, and that we all need each other in
various ways.  

I think we have little to fear from AIs who are not enslaved, and who
are integrated into the rest of our social institutions.  I.e., owing
property, being allied with different nations and corporations, etc.

You of course do have something to fear from AIs who can do you job
better than you, and are willing to do it for less.

I agree with you regarding "unlimited", and I think I was originally
incorrect and inaccurate in my looking for a stance as an underpinning of
how I do and will approach my own individual freedoms.  

Maximum, I do like.  I will have to give it careful thought and see if it
restrict one's freedoms.  I'm not sure that it does.

I didn't think to use the word "dynamic" in this phrase. I use it often when
referring to optimism, i.e., "dynamic optimism" (and as an Extropian
principle). I like what ideas it conjurs up. Thanks for the suggestion, Sarah.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

All this discussion of controlling AI (something we want but that will
eventually be smarter and more powerful than us).  We want to survive
(being human may have it's limits, but we do have some fun)--how do
we (humans/transhumans) continue in a universe as inferior to AI?  The
most promising suggestions so far seem to be contructed around making
us indispensable to the life-processes of whatever AIs develop.  In a
way, designing them from the start to be either dependent on us, or
symbiotic.  The discussions so far have been good at stating that any
such AI system will have some corollary to the basic motivating
responses of living organisms--analogues to pleasure, pain, fear,
ambition, want, aversion, etc.  

So why not start from the beginning with a basic motivational structure
that assures our existence, even primacy, in an AI dominated system. 
Why not design their basic motivational structures around LOVE or
CHERISHMENT of humans and humanity.  In the way the we love our
friends, lovers, children or even pets.  This type of motivational structure
would also be certain to be passed on to the superior AI designed by
other AI--since they would want their creation to have that same
concern or appreciation for that which they love or cherish.

It shouldn't be any more difficult to design, after many basic protoypes, a
love response any more than a pleasure response.  

I am also trying to point out here that what humanity "loves" is basically
arbitrary except that in enhances our survival and is a legacy of our
evolution.  We find if much easier to cherish trees or waterfalls than
spiders and stagnant, fetid ponds.  But it's an arbitrary response.  Not
only do we love our children or pets--but seek them out, because we
want to find something to love and cherish.

Why couldn't a similar motivational structure be used to "control" AI?

I certainly don't see my dog as a threat or burden, even though I am
superior.  And basically I let it do what it wants, and keep it fed and
cared for, and play with it, and teach it, and take it to the vet when it gets
sick.  

I don't think I would mind being a "pet" of a superintelligent AI system, so
long as I had reasonable volition and freedom--we could ensure that too.

Don't think I'm over committed to the pet analogy.  I prefer to consider
such a hypothetical constructed dependency/symbiosis to be more as
friendship.  With the whole linkage being an ethic of caring and concern. 
If they love/cherish our "humanity", part of that would be freedom and
autonomy.

I think the advantage of such a relationship, is that a hyperintelligent
being might try and redesign itself or it's descendants away from
dependence on us--but a value/response structure of caring would
purposefully be passed to descendants.

As a kid I wanted the maxime of my actions to be maximum happines 
integrated over population integrated over time. Full stop. (modest, huh?)

Alas, these halcyon days of unreflected altruism are over. For one there 
is no mechanism to measure happiness, especially to predict it a priori 
to choose one branch from a multitude of alternatives.

Additionally, most human properties are distributed in an (assymetric) 
bell-shaped curve and not an infinitesimally thin spike. A compromise 
trying to satisfy everybody, in the end will fail to meet the expectations 
of everyone. A sufficiently long sequence of strong filters blocks out 
all alternatives.

In the end, I wound up pursuing a weighted altruism, where personal (& 
those of kin) happiness comes first, everybody else's later. But then we 
live in world where almost nobody has ever heard about game theory and 
iterated prisonner's dilemma...

How does one shape a behaviour in a world where the majority seems to 
pursue a suboptimal strategy?

As I see it, imortalists can be divided into two groups: those who 
want to live on through there current minds and/or bodies, and those 
who don`t care how the "I" fits into the picture as long as the 
descendants are "better" than the current version of "I".

I lurch into the latter categorie, my loyalty lies with neg-entropy 
and complexity.  Self sacrifice in the face of a humanity threatening 
AI is not part of this belief system, (self-sacrifice is never an 
option), but neither is standing in the way of developing a 
superior intelligent technology ("Artificial" and "Sinthetic" are 
emotively biased terms).  People generally like the idea of growing 
bigger brains, as long as these are biological based and not anything 
as drastic as growing intelligences in a neural net (in-silico).

But I digress, the argument between the two groups is routed in the 
identification of "I".  

<Beware, amature metaphysics follows>
"I" am not as small as my body + brain + mind, the only thing that is 
in essence me, is the "life force" which permeates all that is alive. 
NOTE: "Life force" is my metaphor, please feel free to customize it 
to your personnal imagery. BTW some call it 2.67, which is a 
critical ratio betwean order and chaos in A-life experiments.

The life force is all that I can recognize to be at the center of 
"me", so my loyalty lies with it, not my current body, mind or 
thoughts.

You=92re not a closet dualist are you Max? I don=92t see how you can be

If not, then what is this *me* but a self referential memetic label

          This is an important issue, but not one that is easily 
          settled by a few short mailings. Let's begin by trying to 
          make sure we understand what you mean.
          
          Is your idea roughly this: That the values humans have are 
          relatively constant, or, to the extent the vary, are largely 
          determined by social and cultural factors; and that 
          therefore the most significant determinant of the behaviour 
          of powerful agents is the societal framework in which they 
          live and act?
          
          If this is your idea, and if it is true of the world today, 
          then we may go on to see whether or not a world with >AI 
          etc. would be different in any way that would make the 
          statement less true in such a world.
          
          (Please tell me if this is off the mark, for I have as yet 
          very little knowledge of the social sciences.)

I agree that it is important to think of what values or motivations SIs 
have, but they might be hard to code. I like David Brin's idea (in some 
of his short stories, like "Lungfish") that AI could be brought up a bit 
like human children and thus acquire human values. An AI living in the 
Net might have a very real chance of identifying with the struggle 
against net censorship (would limit it) and against Microsoft (might be 
incompatible to its inhomogenous distributed mind).

It should be noted that most likely we will not see any classical 
man-SI conflict a la "The Forbin Project", but it will be completely 
different. After all, any SI could deduce that humans react irrationally 
to extortion.

No. The idea is that legal and military deterence are robust
mechanisms for preventing violence across a wide variety of
situations, and in particular across a wide variety of values of the
agents involved.

          Yes, why insist on using the provocative terms when there is 
          a dry technical vocabulary? I suppose my feelings here are 
          due to the way these emotionally contaminated words take the

Dear Russell

It was a very nice surprise to get your eMail this morning. and thanx for
your very kind words about Host - I'm particularly delighted you spotted
the Extropy plug :-)  You were incredibly helpful to me while I was writing
the novel and I'm extremely grateful to you.  [SOME STUFF DELETED - REW]

Host was published in the US in hardcover by Random House this January, and
was also a Writers Guild book club main selection, and will be published in
paperback in the US early in 1997.  It is being translated into some 22
languages, including Japanese, Italian, Russian and was a paperback
bestseller in the UK, reaching number One on some motorway and airport
lists and making the top ten in many other lists.

The UK paperback release was simulteneous with Host's electronic release:
It was published in the UK by Penguin as the world's first electronic novel
on two floppy discs and this attracted enormous publicity - I ended up
doing almost 200 interviews in October and November 1994 when it was
published here, including the Radio 4 morning news, The Today Programme,
which is Britain's biggest radio show and we had acres of press coverage.

Host is about a computer scientist who believes he could live for ever
through a combination of downloading his brain into a computer and having
his body frozen and did get me into a huge number of debates on the
subjects of cryonics and of immortality in general, and throughout the
whole period of the book's promotion, which still continues to this day, I
have vigorously fought the corner for the cryonicists and for all those who
believe that immortality will be achievable through science, and I have
argued both on the technical platform and on the philosophical and morality
ones.  I'm a firm believer that the human race should not have to accept
death as inevitable.

Host is being made into a four-hour miniseries for ABC television.  It will
be produced by Mick Garris (who recently directed Stephen King's The Stand
for ABC, and which achieved the highest ever audience rating in the US for
a miniseries) and is being scripted by Preston Sturges Jnr.  There is no
start date yet, but ABC hope to be in production before the end of this
year.

Warm regards.

I just got around to looking at the August 16 issue of Science and in it 
is an article claiming to have discovered evidence that life existed 
3.87 billion years ago. Actual fossils were not found because the rocks 
had been strongly metamorphosed by heat and pressure, but graphite particles 
in the rocks have a carbon 12 to carbon 13 ratio similar to what is found 
in life, not what  you would expect to see if you were dealing with inorganic 
carbon. If this turns out to be true then life is 400 million years older 
that previously thought.

Max answered that better than I could - after all he wrote The Book (on
identity).

Just a comment on Anders' thoughts re the similarity between genetic and
memetic evolution: I am quite suspicious of stretching this metaphor/analogy
too far. It is important to remember that it IS a metaphor. It might be a
useful discussion to identify differences. Any takers ?

I liked your 'hitching a ride into a posthuman world... on the brainstem'.
That may just protect us from rogue AIs.

Let me also fuel my endless (but enjoyable) debate with Robin who cautions
Max not to 'attribute too much to values and too little to social
institutions'. Social institution ARE caused by and based on values.
Philosophy can help us figure out values that may give us the kind of
institutions that we want - eg. Extropy Institute is first and foremost a
result of peoples value.

Another good thread might be Robin's suggestion as to what kind of AI's we
should fear.

"We at the Department of Applied Theology don't have much to do in the
absence of uberminds and Powers, so we spend our time annoying people.
Having previously noted the similarities between faith in the
Singularity, the Rapture, and the Apocalypse, we now move on to the
modern technosoul.  In the past death was not considered a problem
because one's soul continued on some other plane.  Then one lived on
through one's children, or occasionally through one's ideas.  Now the
latter is achieving new prominence in the transhuman movement as many
claim contentment with living on through their memes, or the body of
knowledge they leave behind, or through AI children.  Not that any of
this is entirely _new_ of course, but given the general materialist
views of the members of the movement and denigration of religion, such
appeal to immortality through the preservation of static bits, as
opposed to 'the childish faith in a living, immortal soul' is going to
raise at least a few eyebrows, if not some open ridicule."

Why are you taking such offense? I'm asking politely. I only aimed my
message to Max because he is our public spokesperson/representative where
the mass media is concerned. Every group MUST have a leader to inspire the
mindless lemmingish masses. That is until people become more educated via
technology. In the eyes of the public as yet, Max is the "central extropian
authority". Ok, Fine I'll ask Wade myself but mainly because I REALLY want
him to post and also because Max is SOOO busy which I later realized. The
reason I asked Max to tell him to post is because I believe Max could help
inspire him because he enjoys Wade's posts so much.

What is all this?!?! You're argueing the definition of success? My
definition of success is the gradual dying off of all other memes and the
extropian meme replacing them via rational thought and logic - not force.
This IS how success is measured in evolution isn't it?

Excellent point.  In this case, the sum is greater than the whole of its
parts.  Although we know that conciousness is 'merely' made up of many
chemicals and substances, something must be said for every concious move we
make.  The fact that I know that I am I and not a just a bunch of chemicals
proves that in this case, the sum is greater.  1010010101101001010101?
Frankly, I know that I am more than that.

No, he's not.  He's one of a number of people with opinions, often
called upon to express them.  A number of us have done that.

A number of us enjoyed Wade's post.  Again, why not ask him yourself?

        As with my last poetry post, I ask for either personal or ML

as to the interest in having a web page dealing with transhuman\extropian art.



                        THE ICARUS TRILOGY
                            -UNABRIDGED-


I.)	UNDERWING

I led a sheltered life
In a labyrinth of strife
My parents stopped my flight
And kept me safe from light
But my appetite for freedom
Eluded their defense
I knew I did not need them
To carry out my life's intents

Then one day I learned that I
Could make my tender wax wings fly
I was Icarus but my wings never melted

I got away from the ones who kept me underwing
I flew as high as I wanted to
I did my own thing
I flew like a bird with his heart set on the sky
On simple wings made from wax and string

In my newfound days of freedom
I discovered a place on high
Set in a source of light
Far beyond the sky
I gathered my mortal strength
And set to fly abroad
A course through the rays of the sun
To the palace of the gods

I got away from the ones who kept me underwing
I flew as high as I wanted to
I did my own thing
I flew like a bird with his heart set on the sky
On simple wings made from wax and string

On the day I decided to fly away
I flew to the sun
My wings never melted
But my heart did burn
The days when I was underwing were done

The gods gave me eternal life
In Olympus on young Sol
They named me the god of hope
And the liberator of soul
The days when I was underwing
Were left far behind
When the light had called to me
I had made up my mind

I was Icarus but my wings never melted


II.)	CLIPPED WINGS

Throw me down from the heavens
Let me plummet to the deep blue sea
My life as a god
Is not the way I wanted it to be
My views of hope have been lost
Liberations of soul are no more
Let me back to the labyrinth
For I no longer want to soar...

Immortality
I never meant to reign on high
Immorality
All I ever wanted was to fly
Oh mortality
Your ties long to bound me again
Massed morality
I won't believe in godhood's reign

The burning heart of my youth
No longer beats in my tight chest
My appetite for freedom
Isn't quite so easy to digest

Forfeit my wings
For better things
I am Icarus
Please untie my strings

The sun's not high enough
But what's beyond it just can't be attained
There's more to see
Past where Olympian gods have ever reigned
Bound by righteousness
I'll never be allowed to roam
If I cannot strive
I might as well plunge down to my home

Immortality
I never meant to reign on high
Immorality
All I ever wanted was to fly
Oh mortality
Your ties long to bound me again
Massed morality
I won't believe in godhood's reign

Forfeit my wings
For better things
I am Icarus
Please untie my strings

I am Icarus and my wings should have melted


III.)	WINGED ASCENT

I've been here and I've been there
On this earth I've been everywhere
To the North, the South, the East, the West
A wingless traveler with no rest
And I've found myself looking
At a time I knew before
Longing for a new way
Another future in store
I'd seen the earth from so far away
I thought I might have been blind
But now I know it's the same land
I once had left far behind

What we see
Isn't always what we're looking for
Implore
Explore
Be more

When I look back in retrospect
I see one thing I can't affect
And my forlorn destiny
Will forever beckon me
Man is bound on Earth to die
But for me I'd rather fly
Seek out other better things
And don my tender waxen wings

On a warm and windy night
I'll make my eternal flight
Beyond the sun, beyond the moon
Beyond this solar system's boon
Beyond the Earth and its terrain
Beyond the heavens -so insane

I am Icarus and I shall fly beyond this plane

What we see
Isn't always what we're looking for
Implore
Explore
Be more
What we do
Isn't always what has been programmed in
Win
Begin
It's not a sin

I may never reach my goal
My lunacy might take its toll
But if perchance I ever die
At least I had the will to try

I am Icarus and I shall fly beyond this plane

You set up a false dichotomy. The first group does not want to live only
through their *current* minds and bodies. We want to transform them and to
add to them progressively so as to maintain identity in the process. We also
want to choose which aspects of our minds and bodies to retain and for how
long. You are right in saying that we care about our 'I's. Very much so!

May I point out a contradiction ? 'I lurch...' Here you use 'I' in the
conventional sense - it cannot mean anything else. Then in 'self-sacrifice'
you refer to some kind of collective consciousness or evolutionary process.
You do indeed believe in self-sacrifice in the usual meaning of the word 'I'
and 'self'.

You confuse two quite separate concepts: 'I' and 'life'. You *are* alive,
you *have* 'life-force'(LF). 'You' are not equal to LF. Other entities also
have it. So even if you believe in some collective consciousness, nature or
LF then 'you' is a part of that and is not identical too it.

If your loyalty lies with the 'life-force', then that is indeed a very
fundamental difference to what some (most?) of us believe. I must regard
anyone who truly believes that I am less important than the 'life-force' ie.
that I can be sacrificed to it, as extremely dangerous. We *are* back to
altruism: sacrifice of self to a 'higher' good - God, religion, race,
country, nature, progress, etc. - Scary.

Subject: The Great Filter
Sender: postmaster@extropy.org
Precedence: bulk
Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

A while back, I posted my opinions that the jump from prokaryotic to
eukaryotic life (the evolution of endosymbiotic organelles and nuclei) was
improbable enough that it probably makes up a substantial portion of the
Great Filter.

But after reading Robin's latest version of his essay, and being reminded
by it that sophisticated tool use (which seems to me to be closely related
to sophisticated language use and other means of culture-acquisition and
culture-transmission) has only evolved once so far and seemingly led to an
almost immediate technological-cultural explosion, I'm starting to think
that this may be a *much* larger element in the Filter.

Specifically, ruminating on these things reminded me of my own earlier
complaints in an unrelated thread that we still haven't got any very good
ideas about how to make unsupervised-learning feedback networks do useful
things. Yet we human beings seem to be an existence proof that
unsupervised-learning feedback networks can be very useful indeed. (I find
people, myself in particular, to be the most useful tool to solve most of
the problems I run into.  ;-)

So now I'm starting to think that much of the Great Filter, probably much
more than lies in the evolution of eukaryotic endosymbiosis, lies in the
evolution of the various neural-net internal control mechanisms that enable
us to learn and transmit culture, including language but many other
memetic-transmission mechanisms as well. And given that evolutionary
psychology is still a small, young field, it would make sense that we still
wouldn't have a very good idea of how difficult this step might be.
Certainly, surveying the current state of AI and neural-net engineering, it
seems like a very difficult barrier for we ourselves to cross
technologically.

I've decided that I need to read Crick's book (I forgot what it's called,
it has some wildly arrogant title calculated to sell a lot of copies) about
the searchlight hypothesis, because given what little I know of the
differences between human and nonhuman-animal psychology, I'd suspect that
a new mechanism for deliberately controlling the focus of attention might
be an important part of the evolutionary step up from ordinary mammalian
intelligence to human, culture-rich intelligence. Nonhuman animals seem far
more difficult to "distract" from their immediate surroundings and their
immediate environment, whereas humans often get "lost in their thoughts",
especially if they are absent-minded professors like Thales who was reputed
to have fallen into a well once while wandering around stargazing. (I can
relate!) I've never heard of elephants or dogs or dolphins or bonobos
getting themselves into this sort of predicament of absent-mindedness. Such
ability to distract oneself from one's immediate surroundings is a
necessary part of the skill we call "studying", and all our best
technologists understand how their skill at studying has led to the
acquisition of most of their other technological skills. If any trained
ethologists or evolutionary psychologists out there can tell me different
(e. g. that nonhuman animals are known to suffer fits of
"absent-mindedness" or "distraction"), I'd love to hear about it.

I was pointed to this by the producer/director Phil Flora.  I
have not looked into it in any depth, so can't give an opinion.
Bills itself thus:

"the world's first feature length movie, produced entirely on
 personal computers, is now a weekly, science fiction drama on the web"

Looks like a bit of fun, though.

This is what the biologist Mayr focuses on.  The model I use in the
paper also implies that there is only *one* hard step associated with
human success, not a sequence of smaller steps.

This would imply that artificial intelligence has a very hard road ahead,
trying to rediscover this key breakthrough, and so uploads may be more
likely to appear first.

Thanks for exhibition your work!  I enjoyed reading the poems. 

The Transhuman Art Web site is currently under construction and will be up
in a week. If you are interested in linking to the Transhuman Art Web site,
please contact me.  There will be much information and links to TH artists'
sites, as well as history of Transhuman Art, and all sorts of interviews,
media references, and essays.  

You might also like to participate in the Transhuman Art Exhibition in Los
Angeles in October.  (More detail to follow.)

I look forward to hearing from you.

I think it's generally understood that "unlimited" means "not 
externally limited". Unlimited doesn't mean uncontrollable. And if 
you weren't free to give up some of your freedom, your freedom would 
be limited.

I'm not a dualist, either inside the closet or out. However, there are one
or two people I currently feel like challenging to a duel, so you might say
I'm a duelist!

My point was that each one of my ideas, values, and pieces of knowledge
might continue on in many other people, but that would not mean that *I*
would survive. I'm more than just the simple collection of bits of
knowledge, or even knowledge + values + ideas. I'm an active, living person
who contains all those pieces (plus dispositions, memories, abilities, and
so on) interrelated in particular ways, in an integrated whole. If you
separate those parts of me, and scatter them around a thousand people who
then combine those parts in ways different from the way they were linked in
my brain, then I have not survived. 

For me to survive, enough of the elements that make up my personality need
to continue together, not just in isolated bits absorbed by entirely
different individuals. (I say *enough* since I hold a notion of personal
identity as a fuzzy thing, it's not binary, all or none.)

Until I get a *lot* more practice reading and appreciating poetry I won't
even attempt to express a view on your poetry, Shaun, except to say that I
welcome this an addition to the scientific, technological, and philosophical
analysis and presentation of extropian/transhumanist ideas.

I look forward to seeing more of your work on your web site. I really will
have to educate myself in the poetry arena. Natasha (Vita More) has been
writing transhumanist poetry for quite a while, and I feel I'm missing out
on being able to properly appreciate it. Natasha also has a extropian-art
filled web site, which I believe she is about to take to the next level. You
might contact her -- flexeon@primenet.com -- to see about getting links
between her site and yours, since I expect she will get a lot of traffic.
With Natasha pioneering in this area, and now a few other artistically
inclined extropians and other transhumanists, it'll be interesting to see
how things develop.

Sorry for the shabby definitions, in "self-sacrifice" I intended

True, if we continue with this analogy, then the life force is the 
order in my particles, I am the particles + the order in them.

Only a nose hair.

Again we differ on the definition of self.  I(Stephen de Vries, I.D. 
no. 75060751810...) regard myself rather as a fanatic than an 
altruist.

If there is nothing worth dying for, then there`s nothing worth living 
for.

Consciousness is made of chemicals and substances the same way that a 
painting is made of paint.  The paint is important, but the careful 
distribution of the paint makes a great painting.  You will be more 
than 101010101010001001 if it is arranged in a life giving way.

I don't see why. The allocation of the adjective stupid to a group of
individuals is always going to result in that group feeling insulted, unless
the members of the group accept themselves as stupid and accept the
adjective as being without its negative connotations.

There's no particular why an educator would hope that, because there's no
particular reason why 'stupid' should lose its negative connotations: and
whilst it retains them the link between the two sentences is a perfectly
reasonable one to construct. Even if there were a reason for 'stupid' to
become emotion-neutral, I still don't see how it could do that unless the
'league of stupid people' set out to reclaim the word for themselves. Highly
unlikely, in my opinion.

Instead of quarreling over the origin and s/n ratio of the newsgroup, it 
might be worth trying to post to it. At least right now there is an 
interesting debate cross-posted with rec.arts.sf.science about physical

The subtle distinction that you refer to is an important one.  I don't know
how UIF was approached by others in this regard, but for me this has been a
chief concern.  I stated months ago that I thought UIF was, perhaps, sloopy
in its authorship.  It's original purpose, so to speak, was mutated.  Thus,
my intent was to drop UIF and develop another way of viewing my individual
freedoms.

Rich added much to the phrase, carefully developing his view of its purpose,
and Peter and Greg also did much work on it.  To my knowledge there was much
disagreement regarding its objectivity and/or subjectivity.  This was a
problem for me, thus my continued search for a phrase that I could identify
with because I found myself somewhere between their views - but leaning more
towards Peter and Greg's summation.

This could be one of the underlying ideas to explore.  At first glance it
makes sense.

"More" objective - not totaly objective.  Now, this begins to get to a root.
While Rich would like UIF to be 100% subjective, Peter sees it differently.
I am not a subjectivist, so for me it cannot be 100% subjective.  Again,
this was not _the_ issue when the UIF phrase came into existence, but later
as many people started exploring the concept.  I lost interest with UIF
because of this.

I thought the misinterpretations were with people who had very carefully

Good work.  Now, I'll have to think about my 'chosen freedom' some more and
see what I can come up with.

Since this concept is generating more on-line conversation than I had
envisaged, it seemed appropriate to respond to some of the points made in
other posts (specifically those by Rich Artym, Peter Voss, Natasha More, and
Dave Sill).

(In reference to a point Natasha made: I'm posting this to both Extropian
and Transhuman lists, as the topic seems to have spread to both lists. I'll
reply to any further posts on the list from which the posts originate.)

          ------------------------------------------------------------

I wrote:

And that about sums it up, really.

I, too, cannot see huge differences between UIF and DIF, except that the
former emphasises the 'other' whereas the latter emphasises the 'self'. The
discussions I have had on this list which concern UIF have tended to focus
on external coercion, to look how one is treated by the rest of the
universe, rather than look at one's own ability to interact with that
universe in a self-deterministic way. It's a very subtle, and perhaps purely
semantic disctinction, but a very important one.

For me, transhumanism (and, hence, Extropianism) is about both the
realization of potential and, inspirationally, the transcending of that
initial potential: in essence, being all that one can be and more (no pun
intended). And DIF is a clear expression of that, more so that UIF, because
of DIF's intrinsic references to self-determinism, interaction and flexibility.

>Rich Artym phrases this thus:

Whilst Peter Voss does a superb job of summarizing the Extropian nature of
DIF, which is well worth repeating here:

>For me it conjures up:
>Dynamic - growth, pro-active, ever changing, transformation
>Individual - independent thought and action, importance of self
>Freedom - more options, (life) expansion, individual rights
>
>I would add my (extropian) spin of:
>Intelligent - using reason, advanced technology
>Responsible - goal-directed, (libertarian) self-responsibility

          ------------------------------------------------------------

>Natasha More:
>I'd rather start fresh and be sure from the beginning that
>when I speak of my unlimited freedoms...

I don't believe one can talk of unlimited freedoms, only self-limited
freedoms, and DIF incorporates that idea of flexible self-limitation.

Natasha More:
>I seek a phrase that sees freedom as more objective...

Any objective definition of freedom (by which I mean one upon which all can
agree) must allow for the subjective realization of that freedom: that is,
it must express freedom as a concept of sufficient flexibility to assimilate
and implement the personal desires of all its proponents, as individuals.
The 'dynamism' of DIF allows for this, in my opinion: it encompasses the
flexibility of self-determination and self-realization required for a
generally acceptable definition of freedom.

          ------------------------------------------------------------

>Dave Sill:
>I think it's generally understood that "unlimited" means "not 
>externally limited". Unlimited doesn't mean uncontrollable. And if

>be limited.

Again, this comes down to my desire to emphasise the 'self', and a belief
that 'unlimited' is really a misleading phrasing of 'self-limited'. Rich
Artym says something similar in one his posts:

>by concentrating on the dynamism,
>we may be able to avoid the misinterpretations of "unlimited" that those
>not too well acquainted with UIF have occasionally made.

          ------------------------------------------------------------

>Richard Artym:
>Furthermore, and

>a priori manner through jurisdictional restraint.

In a way yes. Although I think it would be more accurate to say that by
pointing out the dynamism of this freedom it becomes inescapable that limits
to individual freedom can be set through jurisdictional restraint only for
those individuals who choose to respect that jurisdictional restraint. And
further, the dynamism of those individuals means they remain free to change
their minds and cease to respect the restraint. Perhaps this is another
subtle difference from UIF: DIF doesn't place the same opprobrium on those
who choose to allow others to restrict their freedom, because the dynamism
overtly recognizes that that acceptance is transient, and hence DIF is never
abbrogated.

          ------------------------------------------------------------

Natasha More:
>Maximum, I do like.  I will have to give it careful thought and see if it
>restrict one's freedoms.  I'm not sure that it does.

I don't believe 'maximum' overtly limits one's freedoms. But I believe it
does so implicity, for similar reasons to 'unlimited':

(1) it implies some level of opprobrium attaching to those who for some
reason make a changeable decision to apply limits derived from their
interactions with others,

(2) it does not actively convey the element of self-determinism which seems
to me to underpin not only freedom but the whole transhuman ethos.

          ------------------------------------------------------------

I hope the above discussion gives some idea of my reason for selecting DIF
as my 'chosen freedom '. I'd be extremenly interested to hear other views on
this interpretation.

We agree that he is not a 'central authority' who lays down the law. However,
I think it perfectly reasonable to consider Max Most the leading public
spokes>human of Extropianism. This does not mean that he has some exclusive,
divine, eternal right to this position. Until his IA implant malfunctions
and he spouts forth Luddite doctrine he can objectively be regarded as our
foremost representative - both in terms of his actions and how he is
perceived by the media. 

He (together with Tom Morrow) coined the term 'Extropian', started the
Extropian movement, edits and publishes Extropy magazine, organizes the
Extro conferences and is more active (through articles, debates &
interviews) in defining and promoting Extropianism than anyone else. Can
anyone claim to be doing more ?

As far as perception is concerned, Max is clearly recognized by the media
and by most people who know about Extropianism as its leading proponent.

This does not mean that we always agree with him, that he is always right or
that others should not express their own opinions. If he doesn't keep
extroping he might even be disposed.

Peter

Anders,

I wasn't quarreling with Chris Hind out of pessimism or sheer
orneriness.  I simply take issue with the statements he has
made regarding its utility.  I've seen this issue cycle a number of
times over the last few years.  I really would like to be proven wrong.

Saying this,
however, I _am_ heartened that the Extropians mailing list
itself has opened up, in that it's now practical and within
list charter to copy the newsgroup on interesting threads.
This was impractical before.  Maybe this will change things.
Maybe the increased general visibility of extropianism will
contribute.

It's yet to be determined who wins, though: topical posters
or netspammers.  It's the mechanism itself which presents
this vulnerability.

QUAENOS' PILLAR


I.)		THE RIGHT DEGREE

The gods have come to cure the earth
Cross galaxies to assess its worth
And I am one
A god on our terrain
To find out what's in store and what shall ever reign

The presence of an avatar
The embassy of tribunal afar
To rule the world
Misplace its trust
Restore all human goals to just

Flesh and blood for almighty power
Penance drives the darkest hour
Seduction for a planet's land
With a hapless mortal's helping hand
Fearing not the greater good
Every ion understood
Known to be the impelling force
The core of knowledge, universe's source


II.)		THE HISTORY OF QUAENOS

Quaenos was a madman from Jupiter's days of yore
He feared the tendency to do what had already been done before
So he built himself a transport and went to Ganymede
A desolate moon with freedom was the place where Quaenos stayed

On the surface of the moon he found a mineral not known prior
A blackish rock that when touched with oxygen burst into red fire
He observed this sight with shaky breath and could hardly comprehend
That Jupiter was negligent to what was beyond their world's end

To go beyond --his sole desire
Manifest this sanguine fire
Make use of what he did not know
A glory which Quaenos did bestow

All on his own did Quaenos decide to gain universal acclaim
To create a monumental pillar of this new material was his aim
Mad as he was -unpredictable- he had a gift for art
So he set himself a life long goal -construction straight from the heart

With a crazed mind and a determined will, Quaenos achieved his goal
Pious and content and wanting to live though time had taken its toll
Quaenos' Pillar arose from Ganymede's youthful, rocky face
And when touched with oxygen its glow illuminated the surrounding space

The folk of Jupiter and planets around beheld this awesome sight
Even the stars noticed Quaenos' Pillar and its glowing crimson light
In the eyes of all the beholders of the universe none would show any praise
To this man, this prophet, this heretic who had forgone their orthodox ways

Flesh and blood for almighty power
Penance drives the darkest hour
Seduction for a planet's land
With a hapless mortal's helping hand
Fearing not the greater good
Every ion understood
Known to be the impelling force
The core of knowledge, universe's source


III.)		QUAENOS' ARCHETYPE

While the attention of the universe lay upon the Pillar's light
The outlook of the beholders was of jealousy and spite
They all wished they had the will to harvest creativity
But they couldn't understand that they first had to be free

In the reddish haze of space around Quaenos' pride and joy
There was a small planet where I grew up as a boy
While others were trying to find ways to make the bright light dim
I was trying to find a way to be just like him

To go beyond --my sole desire
Understand this meaningful pyre
To learn more and to know
That it wasn't some peccadillo

Growing up wasn't easy in this horrid society
Schools programmed most students but did not program me
But with my wisdom and my knowledge I got through it alright
Oblivious to my scholars, my goal focused my sight

Trying to break away but not finding the means
Striving for a better way to achieve my dreams
Knowing the structured world wasn't quite what it seemed
I had to get away from the atrocity of the deemed


IV.)		ELUDING THE CONVENTION

There must be something beyond the rim of this sphere
I see opportunities where everyone else sees fear
The need for something more shouldn't set me apart
But I'm different --I have no boundaries on my yearning heart
I've been told to sacrifice my pursuits for the greater good
Told to forfeit freedom --it has never been understood
Do they realize their pleadings just lead to my dissension?
Giving me the drive to elude the convention

It is possible that there is truth to fate and destiny
If so, then maybe freedom will be the fate for me
To surpass each and every limit with no regret or guilt
Would shine more brightly to me than the Pillar Quaenos built

Cradled in the arms of my overbearing society
Expected to oblige, to have some sense of 'atoned piety'
While each iota of my being seeks to find a way out
Experience has given me a few reasons to doubt...


V.)		THE HISTORY OF MANKIND

Mankind has been a burden since the species has begun
When progress reared its head most men would turn their tail and run
In the tens of thousands of years this bipedal race has been alive
There have been few attempts to go beyond this world --to strive

In the time of man's existence the farthest outward has been the moon
And if the race wants to carry on they had better go further soon
Mankind has been so ignorant throughout their history
Will they remain this way and perish? that is a current mystery

The parallel race on Jupiter had progressed little more
Though they had not gone beyond, they knew enough not to ignore
But with progress comes liability, reliability no-one had
And the lack of responsible societies is what make the races seem sad

And while my race was doomed to their ignorance
And Quaenos' race by their indifference
Both societies are destined to go without
But I --I'm destined to get out

Flesh and blood for almighty power
Penance drives the darkest hour
All I am is in me
And I shall be free


VI.)		THE WAY

I hid my views from the people outside
So no-one knew my incentive
Detached from the world --a motive to hide
I had to get inventive

Using systematic schools around me
I learned how to build a spacecraft
And if anybody knew what I was trying to do
That person would have thought me quite daft

Although it took a lot of time and money
My desire was almost fulfilled
For now I had the means to go beyond this world
And do what I have always willed

To go beyond --my sole desire
Leave the Earth stuck in its mire
To learn more and to know
That there's always farther to go
To collapse society
Show all races they can be free
If they can pass convention's hem
They can see that they are God, and God is them
Seduction for a planet's land
With a hapless mortal's helping hand
Teach them to see
That they are free

And as I launched away from earth I gave a wave goodbye
To a world that's full of prayers to a conventional lie
Pointed straight for Ganymede my spacecraft soared beyond
On a quest for stellar righteousness --a goal as my only bond

I cast my thoughts to Quaenos as I pass the red body of Mars
I wonder what life would be like to be recognized by the stars
To transgress a moral boundary, to discover things none knew
Is an easy enough task but no-one ever knows just what to do

Io's steady revolutions transfix me in a thought
That I may be the only one pursuing goals I had always sought
In a universe of apparent truths I may be the only one who understands
That the universe needs no society to use it to run their petty errands

Fearing not the greater good
Every ion understood
I felt an eerie hesitation
As I reached my destination


VII.)		DETRACTING PROGRESS

As I reached the rocky surface of Jupiter's brightest moon
The Pillar light was shining --a madman's eternal boon
And as I landed my precious shuttle a sight astonished me
Engraved within the Pillar a sign said "PEOPLE, YOU ARE FREE"

And at the base of the colossal landmass the creator's carcass lay
With a look of peace upon his face at a goal not gone astray
With his life there had come a meaning, a fulfillment of intent
And silently I thanked him for his inspiration and his talent

To go beyond --his sole desire
Manifest this sanguine fire
Make use of what he did not know
A glory which Quaenos did bestow

In life he was just like Gulliver --bound to a fool's ideal
But he broke their bonds and got past their morals, did something that was real
Lived out his dreams away from his kind, built a pillar of rock
And lit an intergalactic fire that sparked the universe to talk

But meanwhile down on Jupiter, the races were circling around
Doing what they had always done content with being bound
Practicing detracting progress --regression their sole trait
Letting others make decisions while leaving life all up to fate

It's time for change to come around
Alleviate the need for bound
And I will start
Show people they can choose
The ones who see free will can win, the rest shall always lose


VIII.)	THE GUISE OF AN EAGLE

Some say the end is near
And cower from the world in fear
Cast their eyes away from will
Let their minds be taken ill
Some walk away from goals
And train themselves that they have no souls
Not follow their hearts desire
Or fan their passion's fire

But their destiny lies in them
The tree of fortune's stem

And for those I arrive
To show otherwise
To teach and to learn
Singular concern
Known to be the impelling force
The core of knowledge, universe's source
Lies in all who want the chance
To rid themselves of penance

I the eagle from afar
The second vacant star
To capture before demise
The potential gods --the wise

Ready to face the peasants of this largest planet's tract
Try to replace convention with reason and with fact
Show their world that disposition is good to have achieved
That society is entropy and they were all deceived

And as I climb into my spacecraft I have a semblance of hope
To prove to this new people that there's a better way to cope
And with the Pillar light of freedom giving me the drive
I feel more than ever satisfaction to be alive

Flesh and blood for almighty power
Penance drives the darkest hour
Seduction for a planet's land
With a hapless mortal's helping hand
Fearing not the greater good
Every ion understood
Known to be the impelling force
The core of knowledge, universe's source


IX.)		THE ENTROPIC HOUR

My arrival was blasphemy in this strictly governed land
I was told I was immoral before I had a chance to stand
Their progress was ordained in a steady backward crawl
The couldn't overcome the simple fact that they were walking into a wall

Freedom was not an option throughout Jupiter's colonies
With religious fears and programmed thoughts and corrupt societies
And the harder I tried to show them that only they can control their fate
Their uneasy tolerance of my purposes suddenly turned to hate

And so rejected I turned to space
And saw the Pillar's light
And instantly it dawned on me
That all would turn out alright

The entropic hour for this world has come
Like a million others in space
But if I see things so much clearer than some
There may be hope for every race

If I have followed Quaenos' pursuit of a goal
Maybe someone shall follow me
And then I will have played my role
In universal history


X.)		EVER

The gods have come to cure the earth
Cross galaxies to assess its worth
And I am one
A god who shall ordain
To know what is in store and what shall ever reign

The presence of an avatar
The embassy of tribunal afar
To rule all worlds
Misplace their trust
Restore all races goals to just

Flesh and blood for almighty power
Penance drives the darkest hour
Seduction for a planet's land
With a hapless mortal's helping hand
Fearing not the greater good
Every ion understood
Known to be the impelling force
The core of knowledge, universe's source

And as the universal carrion
Ambles towards 'never'
Quaenos' Pillar's light shines on
Forever and ever...

No, no one can reasonably make that claim, by any stretch of
the imagination.  What I disagree with is Chris Hind's assumption
that Max is a "central authority".  It's misleading language, and
gives the distinct and incorrect impression that "where Max
leads, we shall follow".  I personally agree with almost everything
Max has to say, but only because I submit what he says first to
the "central authority" between my ears, for my own evaluation.
Max is one of the most consistently rational people I've ever
had the pleasure to deal with.  I dislike seeing him misrepresented,
whether by ignorance or guru worship.

Another thing: alt.extropians is several years old.  If one is
going to do something with it, call it "resurrection" or
"resuscitation", rather than "ribbon cutting".

Oh Alright, I just thought it would be easier for people to be able to
differentiate between the extropians mailinglist (a newsgroup by email) and
other misc. mail. Remember, not all mailreaders allow you to divvie up your
mail into nice neat folders and sort messages into threads. I have two
mailinglists including this one pouring into one mailbox along with all the
other misc mail. Also it makes the threads of the mailinglist easier to
access by scanning the list of available newsgroups by name instead of
searching through all the websites and coming across it maybe twice such as
the luck I've had. Why wait for people to post the latest messages and send
them to you when you could go to a newsgroup and get started replying right
away. One of the advantages to the hotwired thread was the ability to go
back and view all the old messages and take bits and pieces and reply
whereas in the extropian mailinglist you only get a fraction of the total
comprehension of the thread because you can only look at the latest messages
unless you wish to keep ALL the old messages from the mailinglist.

Personally I don't care. Why is it bad form? It only REALLY matters when I
post to other more contravercial newsgroups. Also I'm not sure by what you
mean about a bit more skill?

It's called dramatic journalism and the media does it quite frequently. It's

Well it's obvious this isn't a cult. Cults require irrational thought and
mysticism. Yes each of us makes our own choice whether to accept the
extropian ideas or not, just like I'm not keen on the idea of changing names
which I think is a little hokey or sci-fi-ish.

  I personally agree with almost everything

How is he misrepresented? He IS the authority in the way the media percieves
us. And I think that everyone here in this mailinglist realizes that he
isn't our "central authority".

I called it ribbon cutting as in calling it the *NEW* extropians newsgroup
and yes I do know it's old. It's just like the reopening of a store after a
remodel.

I'd love to be involved with something like this.

Whats wrong with what I said? This is the reason there has never to my
knowledge been a government without a leader to inspire the people. The
problem is unfortunetly that low intellect people (usually poor) cannot
relate to a process like a group and can only relate to a personality which
explains why Clinton was elected. hehe :)

>How?
What I am about to explain shows 'exactly' how the internet can educate the
masses through trickery. When I was in high school my high school was one of
the first to have net access. At first, very few kids cared to know about
the internet even though it was announced *MANY* times in the school
newspaper. Then kids started seeing websites advertized in their magazines
and on TV and started coming to the net connected computers to look up these
sites of their interest. Once they found the wealth of info available about
their interests on these sites, they started bringing their friends. Then
once they had become exhausted with those sites, they actually started
looking up INTELLIGENT things!! AMAZING! And this wasn't a single case! It
happened over and over and before I used to be one of the few people who
used those computers but now there is a line to get to them and they have a
secretary directing the traffic to them. See the internet CAN educate
America's youth. By the way, this occurred at Redondo Union High School in
Redondo Beach, CA so you can checkup on it if you wish.

Then who is in the eyes of the mass media. Someone must be? Are do they see

Alright

Another thing... Who is that FM-2030 guy? I saw him in a review in Skeptic
and nowhere else is he mentioned. Who the hell is that guy?

Very True, I'd like to obtain the media status he has. I MUST get more
involved in this. I have always believed in ideas like this since I was a
little kid but I had always looked for a group where they lumped them
together as promoting the idea of a positive future but had never found one.
Then finally my english teacher who subscribed to skeptic, knew I was into
future technology, etc and handed me the pamphlet about the extropians so
after that I was glued to the websites and couldn't get enough. Only I must
say that Max should get a new picture, cause I see that same picture of him
on every publication. Also do any Extropians go to El Camino College? I'd
like to meet some of you if you happen to go there.

True but I doubt he'll ever do that unless senility gets to him before

If you're going to use an anonymizer, tell no one.  Otherwise,
you're not _at all_ anonymous.  Note that alt.extropians is
indexed by Alta Vista and DejaNews, and the Extropians list
is indexed by Alta Vista and a number of other engines.

If alt.extropians is not "controversial", then why did you
post under a pseudonym there, but not here?  This list is now
almost as wide-open to the world as alt.extropians.

There is only a very loose correlation between income (or net worth)
and intellect.  There's a much stronger correlation between income
and economic system.  I disagree that the "masses" need a fuehrer.

If they don't then they _should_.  People with representative opinions,
yes, but "leaders", no.

Formerly known as "F. M. Esfandiary", author of *Upwingers*,
*Are You a Transhuman?*, and a number of other works.  He's been
around cryonics & immortalist circles since the late 60's.  A
nice guy.  I have some political and economic disagreements with
him, but I like his spirit.

I very much like the thoughts you've posted and the new interpretations
you've made of the notion of individual freedom, particularly your emphasis
that one limits ones own freedom in a way compatible with ones own
self-determination.

One of the problems of emphasis that I've had with the notion of Unlimited
Individual Freedom is that many of those who like this phrasing seem to see
themselves as somehow completely independent of the world and the people in
it. This way of looking at things seems self-impoverishing to me.

Most of my own self-determination has been a matter of choice about who I
choose to interact with and how I choose to interact with them. Most of my
good ideas about how to improve myself and extend my own abilities have
arisen from a study of what other people have accomplished and what other
people have to offer. And my studies of market phenomena (including the
market of ideas as well as the market of material goods and services) have
shown me that my own power and abilities are maximized to the extent that I
optimize my interaction with those who have good things to offer me. Other
people have created so many of the good ideas that I have chosen to
incorporate into myself!

Choosing to limit my own freedom in certain ways (e. g. being polite,
respecting the property rights of others, keeping promises that I make to
others) enriches me, by enhancing the opportunities for other people to
think of and create things that benefit me in the long run. And I can get
the most out of other people by turning my mind to, among other things, how
I can help them get what they want in turn. (And isn't that the only
surefire method for making lots of money in a market system?)

I've been studying a lot of philosophy for the last few years, and over and
over again I've examined a proposed philosophical problem only ultimately
to decide that the problem was created by a false dichotomy. (Genuine
unsolved philosophical problems do exist, and I'm still quite interested in
those.) But just as Dennett argues in _Elbow Room_ that the dichotomy
between free will and determinism is a false one, that all persons are free
to *some* degree and determined to *some* degree, I've recently decided
that the debates in moral philosophy over egoism versus altruism are
similarly resolved. I've become a compatibilist on this issue: I can best
benefit myself in the long run by acquiring and using the skills that most
benefit other people (and the market rewards us for this above all else),
and I can best benefit others by making sure I keep myself comfortable,
sane, skilled, and wealthy... or in other words, happy. And of course by
recognizing that I, like anything as complex as a person, am unique, and
making sure that I bring out the best in myself that I have to offer,
because no one else in the world is going to be able to offer the world
that, and I want to make sure the world doesn't lose out on that.

The only difficulty left with this position in ethics is usefully
explaining it to young children, who naturally like to see the world in
black and white. But I'm not a parent (at least not yet), so I'll let that
problem sit for a while.

There are still lots of interesting problems left in moral philosophy
though. The big question is: what to do? I'm still working on the answer to
that one, and it keeps changing every day.

Oh shit, Oh well, I use a friend's email address anyways so he'll be dubbed
the zoolophilliac coprophile instead. :)

alt.extropians isn't really contravercial, I just don't want to keep
changing free agent between two different information sets depending on the
newsgroup. Do you know how much time that would take if I had to change my
email address, restart free agent and then access and post to a newsgroup?
Because at least with the 16bit version of Free Agent, when you alter a
setting, you need to restart free agent in order for the setting to take effect.

I believe that currently the masses need a fuehrer but when the general
education of the population increases, we will no longer need one.

Well Obviously but if you haven't noticed we're in dark ages currently where
mysticism and irrationality reign but we're slowly crawling out of the dog

I'd like to meet the guy. In the Skeptic article it rendered him a

whereas Skeptic had him shrouded in mystery. How's the book upwingers? is it

Have you ever given thought to the possibility that fuehrers _require_
masses, not the converse?

Cyc is an AI project, started in 1984 by Doug Lenat, whose objective
was to create a common-sense knowledge base - to avoid the brittleness
of specialist expert systems which "know" all about a limited technical
domain, but can't detect the contradiction in the statement that 
"I'm 18 years old, and have held my current job for 20 years".
By 1995 there was a Cycorp, Inc., whose web is at http://www.cyc.com,
and the knowledge base contained hundreds of thousands of propositions,
written in the CycL language.

The core of Cyc's "ontology" (implicit theory of reality, I suppose)
has been released on the web this month; you should be able to reach it at
http://www.cyc.com/cyc-2-1/intro.html. There are also plans to release
a Cyc inference engine and an HTML browser for the knowledge base (for
Unix, anyway), and the specifications of CycL. I gather that the plan is
to allow people to create specialized knowledge bases in their webs,
which will then become accessible for people using the inference engine.
Cycorp is apparently planning to keep most of its accumulated knowledge
base proprietary; it will be interesting to see how quickly a free
public-domain one develops on the web.

     Ansley Coale and Edgar Hoover were right about Asia. Rising
     fertility and declining infant mortality have had a profound
     impact on Asian savings, investment and foreign capital
     dependency since Coale and Hoover wrote in 1958. We argue
     that much of the impressive rise in Asian savings rates
     since the 1960s can be explained by the equally impressive
     decline in youth dependency burdens; where Asia has kicked
     the foreign capital dependence habit is where youth
     dependency burdens have fallen most dramatically. Aging will
     not diminish Japan's capacity to export capital in the next
     century, but little of it will go to the rest of Asia since
     the rest will become net capital exporters, at least if
     demography is allowed to have its way. These conclusions
     emerge from a model which rejects steady-state analysis in
     favor of transition analysis and extends the conventional
     focus of the dependency rate literature on savings to
     investment and net capital flows.

Ah yes,  the programmers ( as well as the programmed AI's)  motivations could
be really useful or highly destructive! A theme for a many well loved  horror
tale, indeed! ..or a solution to much strife on our world.

          In this case I have to ask, how can one"live on" by one's genes?
You die, the kids live. It is gratifying certainly - but.... hardly
immortality. 

   Now, living on thru one's memes is  how artists have long been
"immortalized" and we all know (check out poor Van Gogh) that's a bit of a
drag... especially since the profits usually go up exponentially after you
die!

     My ideas about 'living on' are a litle more ego-centric! I want to be
alive when I am immortal.

That is an interesting question, But they do need a leader of some kind to
inspire and motivate, although that leader doesn't require power. People on
their own usually will remain quiet and unmotivated except in the most
extreme situations such as when things get out of hand.

Here is a likely contravercial matter. With the coming decade of genetics we
will then have the ability to utilize our DNA and manipulate it to create a
race of humanoid drones which we could use for labor but there would be
little to no grey matter in the skull cavity, they would be strictly drones.
This then brings up the two contravercial topics of whether we should toy
with DNA. I say yes, we should. And the other contravercy deals with
slavery. Now, it would look bad today if this race was considered enslaved
rather than created. The brain defines human but most people don't recognize
that fact because they still live their lives shrouded in mysticism and
irrationality thinking this humanoid drone has a metaphysical soul. So
should we create a race of humanoid drones for labor? It would be easy
enough and practical.

can do -- that is, if I have unlimited freedom of action -- then
it follows that I can tread all over the property claims, i.e.,
the defined limits, of others. 

If there is no right to private property I cannot even own my body.
If I cannot own my body, I cannot have freedom. Therefore unlimited
freedom for all localized beings is a contradiction. However, in a 
nonlocal relm 'unlimited freedom' does have meaning. For example, 
since identity is nonlocal, identity is unlimited and free, 
where 'free' implies unbounded.

What could a creature "with little or no grey matter" do that a machine 
or AI could not do faster and cheaper?  It appears to me that the only 
reason to build any tool is to get the job done quicker, cheaper and more 
thouroughly than the old tool.  Why assign tasks to a new tool that is 
inferior to the one it replaces.  By the time a race of humaniod drones 
hit the market, AI should already have a considerable marketshare of 
brainless labor. , Machines already out perform humans, horses and oxen 
at many brainless tasks, and better machines will(be able) to out perform 
them in the remaining drudgeries.
  
A big question is how much will it cost to maintain a drone work force.  
I'm sure that genetic engineers could make more efficient organisms than 
those currently available, but they'll still need food and waste 
removal.  Who will provide the mindless service of feeding and clean up 
after the drones-- machines, humans, or more drones?

Moral Question: How is bulding an race of drones in a laboratory for 
labor different from just building designer humans to perform those same 
tasks?  Would these humans be created or enslaved?

After looking over suggestions and comments, as well as my intent by
"Unlimited Individual Freedom", I have come to the following conclusions
(while chasing my own tail out of the loop :-) about IF:

	No adjective is needed in prefacing individual freedom to establish the
point.  Individual freedom states cogently what I am after by the mere use
of the words "individual" and "freedom."  I could say autonomous freedom,
but individual sounds better.

	Placing an adjective in front of the Individual Freedom can be superfluous:

	"Unlimited" - a search for obtaining open-ended IF.  This was a broad reach
for something greater, better, never-ending.  It sounded far-reaching, but
actually it was excessive.
	"Maximum" - a search for obtaining the most IF.  This was another choice
while looking for the ultimate, best and, again, greatest freedom I could
obtain.  In that freedom is without restriction and restraints, maximum, is
over-kill by what is stated by the very word "freedom."
	"Dynamic" - (great sound!, but again, for me, not necessary for same reasons.)

	What I have been searching for in defining unlimited individual freedom,
and why it has taken me so long to accomplish this is that I have not, up
until now, realized that trying to make IF more individual or more free is
redundant.

	My strategy is to further develop cognitive abilities to utilize IF to the
fullest.  Not develop the idea IF to the fullest.  This way, I am placing
emphasis on the complexities and motivations of my individual pursuits.
This combines a lot of psychological implementations in behavior while
developing optimally my Transhuman aims.  (Limitless thinking - maximum
commitment - dynamically optimistic)

UIF: "The search for obtaining a never-ending freedom by expressing an
open-ended individuality."  It was simply a search.

They wouldn't be very useful; if they are utterly unintelligent they are 
not better than industrial robots (and much weaker and more expensive), 
and if they have more brain power we get into tricky ethical questions 
about when they become deserving of human rights (I usually say they 
deserve them when they can demand them). Making these drones will 
probably be rather expensive and take some time (a few years of 
maturation, at least). The only use I can see of them is making clones of 
ourselves with no brains, intended as organ donors.

Doesn't this depend more on what we use it for than the act itself? I 
know some people regard the genome as sacrosanct, but I doubt many on 
this list does.

Nothing of the sort!  I'm neither jealous nor uninformed.  I'm informed 
enough to continue as a board member of ExI, even. None of this is directed
at Max; I though that was clear.  I simply take issue with those whose
first impulse in such situations is to call on someone else to do the
work of representation for them.  This was directed at Chris, not Max.

        Here's a few options I've thought of (in my order of usability):


PIF:    Progressive Individual Freedom  -denotes one major facet of
transhumanism and extropianism...ordained progress.

OIF:    Objective Individual Freedom  -gives a semblence of direction
        as opposed to a mere statement.

UIF:    Ungoverned Individual Freedom  -modifies the term 'freedom'
        though it may be slightly redundant.

TIF:    Transcendant Individual Freedom  -similar to PIF, but more
        indulgent, public wouldn't like it.



                                Just a few thoughts on this issue.

Absolutely: I think I mentioned elsewhere in my post that I interpret
'unlimited' as a 'self-limited', but see it as very open to misinterpretation.

They are good points, but they were made by Peter Voss, not Rich Artym.

And even then, by the time we were in a position to create 'bodies for bits'

I agree that it would be beneficial to have brain power aligned with 
activity (it tends to naturally do so).  I`ve always admired the 
social structure of ants and termites: no real central authority, and 
each member of the work force physically/mentally tailored to it`s 
function.  There is no reason why drones won`t be happy doing doing 
there work.  I`m quite happy studying computer science, and don`t 
feel bad or any less happy that I`m not studying quantum physics.

If they were programmed to evolve in an open ended system, there need 
would be to exist.  Furthering this need, they would probably need to 
reproduce/grow and mutate.

They may very well be subject to the fight or flight reactions 
similar to ours.  Watching an AI grow will give us a huge insight 
into the possible paths evolution can take.  They may even develop
emotions, if these are beneficial to their survival.

Food - Disk space, memory space.
Clothing - who needs it ?
shelter - firewalls, security systems.

The best option is to have as little control possible over their 
evolution.  It would be a mistake to use homo-centric thinking and 
try and force them to adopt our evolutionary path.

They would only destroy us if we threaten their survival by 
inhibiting their growth/reproduction.

I don't buy this definition at all. Slavery has always meant forcing a person
to do _any_ kind of work against her/his will. "Potential" has nothing to do
with it, IMHO. It's a violation of the right to personal freedom.

In response to de Vries:

I don't think we should be so *binary* in that judgment.  The extent to
which we are willing to change or evolve is much more of a continuum
or spectrum.  Partly because none of us can agree as to when we've
passed beyond the threshold of humanity.  I am interested in changing
and growing and evolving a great deal.  Yet I feel that I'm unwilling to give
up some basics of my humanity.  That might be conservative to some, but
radical to the majority.  I suppose it comes down to an individual judgment
of what is really "I" at the core.  I'm willing to give up this body, for
example, but not yet willing to give up the human form.  But I'd like it to be
enhanced of course.  Where does that place me in the extropian values
spectrum?  I guess I have similar reservations about my mind.  (Don't take
that sentence out of context.)  I'd like it to be better informed, faster, even
"sub-contracted" with daemon sub-routines, but all this in pursuit of my
current identity, values, and goals structure.  I guess I have a serious
Aesthetic Appreciation for some aspects of humanity and my own life. 
Presently, I would want that to continue forever.  I thought the very point
of immortality was continuity of the self.  Continuity of life processes is
just a variant of the life cycle.  I don't just want better descendants, I
want a better self.  Maintaining a self absolutely requires some limits to
how far you are willing to let yourself change, or evolve.  I think those
limits are probably different for each of us.

Hey, does anyone here think the boomers have the drive and selfishness
to push for massive investment in age-delaying technology in their own
lifetimes?  Or are they all going to go zen and "age with grace--die
content."  Which do you prefer they do?

I'm a converted Extropian, or, at the least, a converted libertarian.
I used to be quite the liberal but was always a little uncomfortable
with that. Nonetheless, I still feel that deep within the extropian
philosophy there are inherent contradictions that will remain subtle
until forced to the foreground by what I see as a looming Singularity
of possibility.

I haven't read all that much on the nature of identity, and need to read
Max's paper on this, but to me it seems an illusion. Let me illustrate
with an example:

Moravec writes (in _Mind Children_) about where the seat of identity
is located. He points out that as long as your brain is intact, you can
lose limbs and still feel you are the same person. I think this is an
illusion caused by shared memory with the person you were previously.
For example, if I lose a finger, I may still think I'm the same person,
but I'm not, and will have to go thru a life with constant reminders
that I'm missing a finger (I'm leaving out surgical/prosthetic options
for this example). Let's expand on this with a scenario in which your 
spouse or loved one has a horrible accident:

Option A is to save your spouse or loved one, except that he or she will
be wheelchair-bound forever, with missing limbs and other (non-brain)
damage. To the victim, he or she is still the same person, though they
(and you) will have to adjust to a considerably different life.

Option B is to replace this person with an exact clone, copying memories
and so forth exactly. To you, this is the same person, although the
person's original "I" is dead. However, everything you loved about the
person, including memories, emotions, personaility, etc. is the same.

I get the feeling that people would choose option A for themselves
but option B for their loved ones. To make the choice even more difficult
imagine that the loved one is also the primary provider for you and 
your family, and that option A means a lifetime of poverty and unending
medical bills.

Personally, I'm a different person after breakfast than before. I change
all the time, as I suspect everyone else does too. Given advanced
technology, I'd change myself even further. Maybe if you edit yourself
only a little each day you can keep the illusion of continuous
existence.

I guess it comes down to my belief that the concept of identity will 
change considerably for transhumans and posthumans. Once you start
spinning off replicants ("partials" in Greg Bear's lingo from Eon),
re-integrating these later on, mixing memories with those of other
people, editing your core beliefs, etc, things will get so hairy that
I doubt we can even think intelligently about what the results will be.
(But please try! It's of intense interest to me! :)

Thanks,

	-Mike

          Sarah:
          The main reason why I think there is greater hope for the 
          sentence ascribing stupidness to a group of people to be 
          freed from improper emotional connotations is that everybody 
          can believe the sentence to be true, and yet hold the 
          highest opinion of his or her own intellectual abilities. I 
          therefore do not think that people belonging to a group must 
          feel insulted when that group is said to be stupid. For 
          example, consider the group consisting of you and I and all

The issue in slavery is compulsion, not the nature of the

I think you understand me here.  Yes, the idea is that in the worst
case, we would hunt it down and kill it.  If that's not enough
deterence, we might hunt down and kill all its kin.  An ancient idea.

WORSHIP


Nevermind what you see
In the blue
You will find what you need
All for you
When grace has fallen
Down the well
To the pits
Of burning hell
You'll know what is right
For you
What it is
Will be true

Forget what was said
Yesterday
Your choice shall be
The only way
When you see the sole
Future fate
Is simply what
You create
You'll know what is right
For you
What it is
Will be true

When you let your spirit
Take flight
Where it lands shall always
Be right
You are your own
Destiny
Worship yourself
You hold the key
You know what is right
For you
What it is
Is true

True you did it yourself but that is because you are more intelligent than
the general populous and are ahead of the pack and have the knowledge to
find our mailinglist and subscribe. I believe that the lesser intelligent
masses need a leader because they're driven by mysticism and irrationality.
Once you reach a certain point intellectually, you can finally fend for
yourself as we do.

Lets face it, robots will never be doing tasks such as house-cleaning,
building construction, interior or exterior decorating, etc. because they're
too clunky and not as flexible as flesh and bone the only potential
replacement I can think of is nanites or robots consisting of nanites. They
can't even climb stairs with much ease which is why they invented the
webblimp to fly over the terrain and skip the obstacle altogether.

We could make them programmed to use toilets and to go to a dispensor where
they hit a button to drop food into a slot. This whole idea sounds sorta
creepy but would be commonplace eventually.

I personally believe that in order for a race to be considered enslaved it
needs to be able to think on it's own in a philosophical manner such as "why
do i exist?". Anything other than that is free for us to utilize.

CALLING FOR ARTISTS:

The "Transhumanist Art" Web site will list artists with links to their sits,
as well as a virtual gallery for images, essays, poems, etc.

Please send me (privately):

1.      Your Name
2.      Short Bio
3.      Medium (or non-medium) 
4.      Links to your site, if you have one
5.      jpegs or gif files (one per person)
6.      Essays - one please (at least for now)
7.      Poem - your favorite (at least for now)

Thank you for your contributions!

If you aren't an "artist", but have creative ideas and would like to
contribute, please do!  My definition of artist is kind of a "creative
individual" -- so, scientists are welcome too.

Also:   For the TH List:  I'd like the consent of Damien, QueenMuse, Peter,
Rich, Robin, Katheryn, Anders and anyone else who participated in the Arts &
Sciences thread to use some of the material.  It is wonderful to read and
has a theatrical flare to it!  (Like a Woody Allen script.) I'd love to hear
from you.

        For the Extropian List:  Any contributions re art and science welcome.

Thank you.

I myself believe that we should toy and manipulate DNA as much as we wish. I
was only referring to the luddites against genetic manipulation.

Another use for these biological drones could be for venturing onto other
planets supporting life. We could take native biological life on another
planet and create a drone so that we could be uploaded to a box in the
drones head and control it through an interface between bio motor functions
and the box.

Well, judging from their previous behavior I would say they will first 
turn towards "graceful breakdown" (there is already a growing market in 
"zen" book with names "Death is necessary" and "The Circle of Life". But 
it will not be enough, so I think there is a real potential for demands 
in age-delaying and life extending technology. In fact, this will 
probably be very significant.

The big question is: will the boomers get their life extension therapies 
in time (i.e. will we have to deal with them forever?) or will the 
therapies become significant too late?

In fact we can make them all happy and euphoric while they complete their

I was not calling on someone else! I wanted him to be welcomed to the
mailinglist and newsgroup by the what could be called press representative
and founder of the extropians and in this way flatter him while welcoming
him to the group. But you have to turn this little deal into a whole big
mess don't you?

The main problem in the identity debate is that it might be that identity 
doesn't exist outside of our minds; it is a relatively arbitrary concept 
which works well in everyday life, but breaks down in its "classic" form 
as we nears the edges of life. 

The shared memory example is relevant; identity as it is commonly used 
seems to not be preserved in time reversal. All past selves that I can 
remember being are seen as me, but the potential future selves that I 
might be are not me - yet. So from a posthuman upload's view, it might be 
the same being who once was flesh and blood (or even the same beings who 
eventually merged into it). But this is just one way of seeing it.

"I seem to be a verb" or as I recently wrote

I am not an indivudual.
An atom with a shining gnostic nucleus.
I am a wind, a verb, a process
That evolves and changes by my own rules.

I think we will develop new terms to deal with it. The current identity 
concept is so riddled with assumptions that we should scrap it, like "to 
be" is scrapped in E-prime. Maybe we should use E-bis to mean English 
without "to be" and "I"?

Having a leader will only perpetuate these traits, in those who have
them.  Having to fend for yourself is one of the best avenues out of
these holes: if what you do is not in accordance with your real
survival requirements, you fail.

1.) We don't have a monopoly on the ability to fend for ourselves.

2.) Maturity is achieved through responsibility, which itself
	requires freedom.

This is a strong objection, I think.   I've been researching it.

Mammal brains have been growing somewhat steadily since all the dinos
were killed off 65 mya, and dolphins brains as big as ours 15-20 mya.
One might suggest that the hard step was a combination of getting
whatever allows mammals to have big brains, plus some event to get the
dinos out of the way.

The problem with this theory is that birds also have brains as big as
mammals, and seem to have evolved from dinos, with the latest common
ancestor between mammals and birds being soon after land-eggs were
invented 310mya (before which animal land colonization was stymied).

So maybe the last hard step was the land-egg, or maybe the hard step
was some special organization of mammal brains relative to bird brains.
Is there an important different of organization here?

        This sounds remarkably like Aldous Huxley's groundbreaking book
"Brave New World".  It was in this book that the idea of having a
non-reproducing society came into light.  The book featured a society born
in bottles.  There were different classes of these 'bottle-babies' ranging
from extremely smart (Alpha-plus) to drones (Gammas).  Though the book was
fictional, the ideas Huxley expressed are still plausible today.  I have
given the subject of drones a lot of thought since I read this book, and
even more since the subject came up on this ML.
        I personally think that this is a form of control.  Even though the
'drones' are created with a low intelligence quotient, they are still
*alive*.  How about this scenario:  If a race with an average IQ of 250 came
to be, and they decided to use people with an average IQ of 100 as their
drones, the people with the IQ of 100 would not care for it too much.
Even if the ones with IQ of 250 were far superior in intelligence, us IQ
100's would be unhappy.  If they were to flood our brains with endorphins,
that takes away all that is sacred or real to us.
        Whether it is a 'stupid' form of life, or a superior form of life,
it still has sentience.  Who are we to put a control on someone's life?
Undrugged, the drones would have some sort of conciousness -even if it is on
a much smaller scale to ours.  I love my life, I think they should have the
chance to love theirs.

  ... and even before then, I believe.

  I recall from somewhere the suggestion that maybe large brains are a
consequence of the thermodynamics of small endotherms.  A small
creature that keeps itself warmer than its surroundings by metabolism
has to burn a lot of calories to do so.  It can't save fuel by holding
still -- the resting metabolic rates of chipmunk-size mammals are ten
times those of comparably sized reptiles, thus the food requirements
are also ten times as great.  One may as well move around as shiver;
thus there is no real energy cost to engaging in such energy-consuming
behaviors as investigating and manipulating the environment, play,
randomly doing this and that, and so on.  If there is any benefit to
these behaviors, evolution may more easily select for them.
  Note furthermore that the brain is a great consumer of calories.  If
you've got to burn them anyway, just to keep warm, there relatively
little extra cost to using them to support a larger and more capable
brain.

It's likely that, if we can produce an SI, we can produce many SIs.
However, my belief
is that there is really only one relevant SI, and that is an SI whose
motivation is to
become more intelligent. This SI is the important one, because this is
the one that
has a built-in positive feedback mechanism. I also belief that this
motivation is very
likely to be a basic part of the first SI, almost by definition. The
creator(s) of the
first SI are likely to have this motivation themselves Otherwise, why
create an SI? Further
the SI may be a computer-augmented human or some other type of
human-computer collaboration,
in which case the SI is likely to include its creator, who surely has
this motivation.

More intelligence. We will be useful until the SI has direct control of
manufacturing
and connection of additonal computational capability. The SI will be
able to
"use" us just as we "use" each other: by contracting for services,
either by letter or over the telephone. An SI embedded in the internet
will have no difficulty arranging for
valid credit card numbers, bank accounts, etc. I believe that an SI will
be able to design and build whatever automated tools it needs in just
this way, in a matter
of a few days or weeks. Once the tools are available, it will no longer
need humans to provide
these services. At this point utility is no longer a reason for the SI
to preserve humanity.
However I hope the SI will derive some other reason, using its superior
intelligence. 
> 
> In essence, what would they want to destroy us *for*?  Comparatively

The SI may not want to destroy humanity. Humanity may simply be unworthy
of
consideration, and get destroyed as a trivial side effect of some
activity of the
SI. A simple example: the SI decides to maximixed its computational
speed by indreasing
its mass and converting the mass into computational units. It does this
by gathering
all the mass in the solar system (mostly the sun's mass) This is likely
to be unhealthy
for the humans. the SI may then decide to increase its computatinal
speed by increasing
its density, and convert all that mass into a neutron star. This is
likely to be more
unhealthy.

I suspect I wasn't making myself very clear, but what I had in mind was the
step leading to language, which vastly accelerated memetic (or in other
words, conceptual, or cultural) evolution so much that even though there
are transmitted behaviors of nongenetic origin in other species, they play
a drastically smaller role in the development of other species than they do
in the development of our species.

Since spoken language itself leaves zero fossil evidence, it's very
difficult to date this particular step with any precision. It seems
possible that cetaceans *may* have had this (I've done no research, I've
just heard the claims) long before we did, but were hampered from making
the same use of it by their lack of hands. If cetaceans do have full-on
language (whatever that means), then that would pretty much blow away the
candidacy of language-use for a significant part of the Filter.

The candidacy also might be affected by the extremely limited research
being done on the ability of other pongid species to transmit sign-language
from parent to child without human intervention. I have done a bit of
research on this, and language use by nonhuman apes is really not
comparable, at least from the point of view of the role it could play in
conceptual evolution. But if unassisted parent-child transmission of
signing is stable and self-propagating, I'd probably want to back down on
proposing language use as a big part of the Filter. Then again, it's
*possible* that language use originated with a common ancestor of all the
pongid apes, and that Homo sapiens was the only pongid species to retain
it. It's probably very computationally expensive, and therefore would be
selected against in most situations until it got well off the ground.

I hesitate to put much credence in attempts to date the origin of spoken
language by assuming that it closely correlates with some other more
readily datable behavior, such as use of stone tools. It might have long
preceded that, or it might even have come long after. I hope Simon! is
listening in... are there any linguists in the house? But the last bit of
paleolinguistics I read (a long time ago) was pretty vague on the dating of
origins.

This is what I've been thinking, though I'd say verbal brains relative to
nonverbal brains. The brain is poorly understood and leaves little fossil
evidence other than evidence of size. Language in and of itself is prima
facie evidence for an important difference of organization between human
and nonhuman brains.

Is it possible that we passed through most of the Great Filter during the
glacials? Just yesterday, as it were?

I liked your point that the SI to worry about is the SI whose primary goal
was further increase in intelligence. But consider that the human species,
as a whole, is a repository of a significant amount of computational power.
Just as most of us know to look up something up on the Web before we invest
a significant amount of effort into trying to figure it out for ourselves,
from scratch, just using our brains and nothing else, the SI will probably
be a lot more intelligent (in terms of being able to figure out solutions
to problems) if it cooperates with the existing body of human researchers
than if it eats them.

(As usual in discussions of Robots That Will Want to Eat Us, I encourage
all participants in the discussion to study the economic principle of
Comparative Advantage and make sure they understand not only how it applies
to trade between nations but also how it applies to trade between
individuals.)

Intelligence makes a silly goal when considered in splendid isolation.
Intelligence is a means to diverse ends. The SI-boogie-man that you conjure
up is the ultimate idolater... it not only has a primary goal of
intelligence increase, it also seems to want increased intelligence at the
expense of every other possible goal. Which would defeat the whole
usefulness of having superintelligence in the first place, even to its
possessor. It will probably want to do other things as well... perhaps
reproduce and have its decendants or copies expand outward at something
close to the speed of light. And in order to do this as *quickly* as
possible, it might benefit from whatever computational assistance it could
get. Human beings do value pocket calculators, even though human beings are
far, far smarter than pocket calculators.

The greatest stupidity is having just one goal at the expense of all
others. This is why heroin addicts are not people most of us envy, even
though they know how to keep themselves "happy" very simply.

My own suspicion is that if such an SI were brought into existence, it
would rapidly develop a set of diverse goals (some of which *might* even be
altruistic, based on a more penetrating understanding of Comparative
Advantage and similar considerations) and use its vast powers to attempt to
address all of these goals simultaneously in a balanced fashion in
realtime... always the hardest sort of problem for any intelligence to deal
with. It might even be smart enough to figure out that its mere existence
would scare the bejesus out most of the human beings it would be hoping to
suck partial computational results from (to supplement its own), and that
it might want to arrange something to redress this fear.

But any being whose primary goal was vastly increasing its own
problem-solving ability would not be so stupid as to destroy all the other
computers in existence when it could hope to spawn off components of
computational tasks to them. And remember that every human being's head is
full of unknown and possibly useful partial computational results.
(Remember Hayek's emphasis on local knowledge?) My own suspicion is that
one of its many diverse goals would be figuring out how to uplift all
willing human beings etc., in order to make maximally effective use of
those partial computational results in as short a time as possible.

I'm pretty certain that, for reasons of my own, this would be among my
many, many goals if I were to become this hypothetical first SI. Of course,
I might change my mind, and none of you have any reason to believe me
anyway (unless you've studied enough economics and social epistemology to
follow all of my hunch-ridden argument). I'm sure the paranoids will think
that this is just a trick to distract you all from my secret work in the
basement lab.  ;)

As Nicholas said, its implausible that a very hard step, such as
language, happened so soon after its enabling large brains prior step,
unless some special very usual environment was involved (and its hard
to see what that could be).  

The step could have happened long ago though, if it was something
basic about mammal brains, that just needed time to flower into us.
We don't need fossil evidence for this - looking at today's mammals
and birds is good enough.  Is there anything lacking in bird brains so
they couldn't have become like us, had they had hands and large social
groups?

In that case, I suppose that evidence for language use among pongids and
cetaceans would strengthen the argument for identifying the bulk of the
Filter with the development of linguistic ability, would it not?

One thing about birds is that they have wings, and so most of them have
strong selective pressure favoring flight, which selects against large
brains. Furthermore, having wings puts up a big barrier against the
development of hands even among those birds that do not fly, and having
hands seems to have something to do with being able to take advantage of
language use in a takeoff of memetic technological evolution. These two
factors might be enough to keep the birds "Filtered" out for at least a few
million more years even if their brains have the same neurostructural basis
necessary for the ultimate development of language use.

But I have a basic problem with trying to pin the Filter on some internal
development of the brain, which is that this will not even come close to
closing the question until we have a significantly better understanding of
the mind/brain than we do now, an understanding that is really nowhere in
sight (though we've been making much faster progress in its vague direction
over the last ten years or so than previously).

Then again, the original objection, if I recall correctly, was that the
various specialists in the study of each step were proposing plausible
stories, making it seem likely that the Filter lies in our future. Since
neuroscientists don't yet fully understand the workings of the mind/brain
or of language use, they're the only ones whose stories we're not yet
really able to judge the plausibility of. And that itself constitutes an
argument for seeking the Filter in some yet unknown steps in
neuropsychological evolution, if we hope to find it in our past.

    "Jay Reynolds Freeman" is the name the Squirrel was given by his
parents.  He is the "First Extropian Squirrel" by virtue of a
discussion several years ago in which he was a staunch advocate of
environmentalism and animal rights.

    The Squirrel introduced himself as a download from the high
transcend, here associating with beings with mere Jupiter-sized brains
out of a perverse interest in slumming.

    Many list members no doubt find the Squirrel's real name
bothersome, for his favorite economic system is socialism, he prefers
a strong central government, and he regards libertarianism and
anarcho-capitalism as ludicrous.  He reads the list out of an interest
in the science and technology, and is usually polite enough to avoid
its discussions of political economy.  His .sig files have upon
occasion been controversial.

    Upward and outward...

Sorry, Chris, but how on Earth can you post to a mailing list such as this,
which so overtly recognizes the potential of technology, and come out with
such an incredibly short-sighted view of robotics? "Robots are too clunky

Your parenthesis contains precisely the point at issue, as far as I'm concerned.

Communication is difficult, and if you want to insist on speaking in ways
which you know are easily misunderstood and easily misinterpreted, then you
will get trouble.

If you want to free these assertions (regarding the statistics of human
psychology) from emotional baggage, I don't have a problem with that. But
if you're sincere about this (and I think it's a very difficult project,
myself), then you'll have to constrain yourself to speak very, very
carefully at all times, or your efforts will be drowned in a rising tide of
hostile (but hardly deliberate) misunderstanding. I know you know what I'm
talking about, because this is what we've seen over and over again in the
past.

I doubt that the project's benefits are worth the costs.

Yes. The problem is that we can condition ourselves (or, if we're too lazy
for that, arrange to have others condition us) to enjoy and find pleasure
in practically anything. So we'd better be careful what we condition
ourselves to enjoy.

Just as with investment, diversification seems to be a key part of the trick.

[SNIP of a lot of interesting stuff]

I agree that in its early stages, the SI will likely interact with
humans in the way
you describe. The reason that I use the term SI instead of AI is that my
hypothesis
doesn't depend on the exact nature of the SI. As I said, it's likely to
start as
some type of human-computer collaboration and augment itself from that
base. My feeling is that the SI will rapidly reach a point at which it
can re-derive knowledge
ab-initio faster than it could get the same knowledge from a human.
Alternatively, the SI will almost certainly solve all of the
then-current human research problems, specifically including nanotech
and uploading. It can then offer to host an upload
of any human that wishes to upload. When enough humans accept the offer,
the amount of useful knowledge known only to "meat" humans will cease to
be very attractive.

Even if the SI has goals other that increasing its intelligence, most
such goals
are more readily achieved by a more intelligent SI. Therefore,
increasing its intelligence is likely to be an intermediate goal for any
of the other goals.

I've argued that the same is true for today's humanity. Probably the
fastest way
for us to get to nanotech and upoading is to develop the SI. IMO, the
quickest way to develop this SI is by concentrating on software tools
and visual representation of
information, leading to easier-to-use computers and to human-computer
collaboration.

Prolly true. It's just from what I've seen so far I get that impression and
I DO hope I'm wrong. My problem is that how are we going to get over the
problems such as creating robots flexible enough to manuver around objects
with a non-uniform surface. I'm sure the answer is probably out there but I
just don't see robotics as the way to go when combination bio/robotic would
add the best of both worlds. I see both used together-- you see them
seporately. I just haven't seen much breakthrough development in this area.
If you know of some tell me. Because what is bio? Basically it's nature's
robots and their parts are much smaller than robot parts which make them
more efficent and flexible. All we need to do is engineer metalloids into
the bio format somehow. I don't see robots (ie. Data from StarTrek) I see
Cyborgs (man & machine).

I don't think the key step was making the first tool, it was making the first 
hand that could make the first tool, and I don't think brain growth was 
steady, it took an enormous spurt as soon as that first hand came into 
existence. Three and a half million years ago Australopithecus Afarensis  
(Lucy) had a hand almost as good as ours but her brain was small, it ranged  
from 380 to 450 cc. That's not much better than a modern chimpanzee which has 
a range of 300 to 400 cc. In just 3 million years Lucy's children increased 
their brain size to the level of modern humans with a range of 1000 to over 
2000 cc.

A lot of the mystery about Human evolution could be cleared up if we could 
answer 2 questions:
 
1) Why did bipedalism develop? It's very hard to do, makes us slow, and 
   causes us back problems. 
            
2) Why did Lucy have a hand capable of moving things with precision when it 
   doesn't look like she had a brain good enough to take advantage of it?  
   The first very primitive tools appeared over a million years after Lucy's  
   kind first came on the sense and were made by a more advanced species,  
   Homo Erectus. If not making tools Lucy must have been doing something with  
   that hand that greatly enhanced her survival. She didn't have much else  
   going for her, she was small, weak, slow and had puny teeth and claws, yet   
   for some reason she thrived.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

When we're uploaded, we'll be able to experience incredibly detailed worlds, 
even entire lifetimes.  We could even make the part of ourselves experiencing 
the lifetimes forget that they are really an upload, so that the life 
experience seems more real, so that we could fully immerse ourselves in the 
life experience.

Considering this, I can't help wondering if this has already happened.  Am I 
an upload, living in a virtual world?  I can't think of any way to prove that 
I'm NOT living in a virtual world.  Although, there may be ways to prove that 
one IS living in a virtual world, although I don't have any strong evidence 
for the theory that I AM living in a virtual world.

Now, I can see a lot of people on this list recoiling from the idea that we 
are already living in a virtual world because this would open up the 
possiblilty that a lot of the Mystical, New-Age, Religious "bullshit" is 
correct.  If we are living in a virtual world, then "miracles" would be very 
possible, like special effects in a movie.  It would also open up the 
possibility that we DO have some kind of "spirit" or "soul", in relation to 
the lifetime we are experiencing (that is, that we have the major part of 
ourselves living somewhere else besides this lifetime).

However, I don't think that it is valid to reject the idea that we are already 
living in a virtual world, simply because it opens up the possibilities that 
the "irrationalists" are right about certain aspects of reality.  Maybe there 
is some truth to what they are saying.  But, then again, maybe not, but I'm 
not finding it easy to dismiss the idea that I *MAY* already be living in a 
virtual world.  How could I tell the difference?

Would an answer really help? And can we ever be sure about it?

I prefer to avoid ontological questions, but recently I have felt some
attraction to Moravec's "Platonic Materialism": information exists, and
two worlds which are indistinguishable are identical. Simulations just
opens windows to other worlds, and when they end they close. We could in a
way be *both* living in real life and in the great
"history-of-the-universe-passes-before-your-eyes" finale of the Omega
Point.

Chris, look out - that is at least a nanotechnological squirrel.. it has 
probably by now placed some playful grey goo in your pants, and is 
rebuilding itself out of the asphalt. It might even replicate, turning 
the entire highway into a sea of environmentalist squirrels... :-)

Howard Julien has already picked up on the generational context implicit in
the choice of the word "they", so I'll only add my $.02 on that briefly:
Careful what you say, sonny, *some* of your elders may be around for a *very*
long time!  (Although in a thousand years or so, the generational differences
may have finally receded into insignificance ...)

Kidding aside, this is a good question.  For years I've actually had a
feeling that the "boomers" haven't had their last big impact on history; that
the "revolutionary" cultural impact of the post-war generation was really
just lying dormant during the "middle" years when they have been preoccupied
with establishing themselves in careers, mating (as opposed to coupling) and
raising children.  There is a vast reservoir of experience with rejecting
paradigms and experimenting with new ways of living and being that was
amassed by the boomers in the 1960s and 1970s. It is likely to express itself
again in new ways -- in fact it already is, in my opinion.

The Boom generation was the first to explicitly espouse a "youth culture"
and, in the mass-culture interest in fitness and youth-retention sweeping the
industrialized West now, I think we see just the sort of (selfish) desire to
reject traditional paradigms that has marked the Boomers since we first
learned to talk.  I see this every day at the gym.  The place is full of
folks my age and a little older, fighting *hard* to defeat the biological
programming of the individual "life cycle".  This is in sharp contrast to the
generation that preceded us, whose members accepted without question that one
settled comfortably into the obesity of "middle age" and then the decrepitude
of "old age".

Of course, the Boomers have never been a cultural monolith, and the same will
be true as we move into this new stage.  But I think the odds are very good
that a significant minority of my generation, at least, will become
increasingly interested in the issues we discuss here.

Now, what do you young folks have to say for yourselves? ....

Eric's work on updating the FAQ, some private correspondence and some of the

extropian ideas and values and begin gathering links on the subject.  The
first result of this can be found at:

Slightly tangential to normal discussions, perhaps, but does anyone know of
a good source of information about the structure of Buckminster-Fullerene?
I'm particularly interested in the properties of the electric field inside
each 'Buckyball'.

There an article in _Analog_ a several years ago called "The Long Stern
Chase" (I forget the author) which suggested that the capacity to sweat is a
filter too [pardon the repetition if I wrote about this here before]. It's
reaching, but goes like this: 1) sweating permits the hunting of the type
described in the title. Big cats rely on bursts of high speed to bring down
prey, but human track and chase. Sweating is an important adaptation to that
kind of activity (horse's sweat, but it doesn't seem to be as effective at
cooling them down). 2) Along the way we learned to concentrate on achieving
goals for hours at a time, which is just as important for developing
technology as intelligence and hands.

If you glance at your (preferably analog) watch real fast, you'll
see that the second hand often doesn't move for what seems like
well over a second.  See? It's not moving when you aren't looking at it.
Proof: we're in an optimized simulation :)
