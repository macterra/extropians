IMHO proper retaliation would be to:

1.  TURN ON FULL MAIL HEADER TRACKING ON THIS LISTSERV SO THAT WE SEE
    THE WHOLE HEADER. Letting the listserv rewrite the headers encourages
    spammers by helping them hide their evil tracks.
2.  Report and pursue every spamsicle (email me if you need help)
    If every member of the list did this you *can* make a difference.
    Even *one* person can make a difference.  My kill count is 74 and
    counting.  Over the last three months the ONLY spam I have received
    has been from this list.  I'm on about a dozen lists (approx. 2000
    messages a week) and this is the only one that continues to be spammed.
    The other lists shored up posting to subscribers only and require
    confirmation subscriptions.
3.  If the spam offers a phone number, especially 1-800 type numbers,
    give them a call and share your feelings with them.  Remember,
    they have to pay for those 1-800 calls.  If they have a fax number,
    you are legally able under the Telecommunications Protection Act to
    send them faxes.  You might enjoy using a cover and trailer page
    legal size and solid black with white lettering - it really gets the
    attention of the receiver and ensures that your fax is noticed :-)
    While I don't recommend it I have heard of people being so appreciative
    of being spammed that they send the mail address gifts such as a
    nice fresh catfish or some of their pet dogs or cats daily offerings.
    Toss in a hallmark card and they will know that someone truly cares.
    Not my method, but supposedly it has worked for others.
4.  Restrict posting to the list to members of the list
    (leaving the list open for all posts is a de facto invitation
     to be spammed; very few spammers ever actually sign up to a
     listserv just to spam it, except when it is revenge spam.)
5.  If you absolutely refuse to do #4, then PLEASE implement Procmail
    filters using spambouncer and *maintain* the regex filters, plus
    items #1, #6 and #7.  If that is too much work, revisit #3.
6.  Implement tcpwrappers on your listserv machine and block direct
    access to dialups.  99% of the direct injection mail from dialups
    is spam.  There is a dialups listserv and you can get the list of
    dialups (and updates).
7.  Implement both the RBL and Dorkslayers filters on your server.  They
    work wonders.
8.  WRITE YOUR CONGRESSPERSONS and your STATE LEGISLATORS.  Tell them
    you hate spam and that spammers are thieves who belong in jail, and
    that takes law.  Tell them to support the Smith bill, and have your
    state legislature extend the definition of the Telecommunications
    Protection Act to specifically include electronic mail in your state,
    with criminal penalties including jail terms.

YMMV

Refering to skecky's item on depenyl for longevity
and web-based health studies

Use of an HMO database to be the benchmark from which to 
create the blinded cohorts is something I sugested to Dr. Morton
Schulman's asst. for thought when they do a study on deprenyl.

This could convert a double blind study into a single blind study.
Creating a patient profile for the control subjects and then selecting
the comparables from the entire health sevices receiving population
would be much more ethical since no patients who were known to be
potential candidates would be denied access to treatment with potential
efficacy.

We here in Saskatchewan Canada have only one HMO the government run 
Medicare system and are implementing a health information network
which would cover all the medical records of the entire population.

This would be an ideal data management system to use as a platform
from which  to originate "Web based health studies" .

I'm quite strapped for time to give a proper dissertation but felt I had
to contribute at least this bit.

PS.....
We are planning to incorporate a company to produce several
nutraceuticals.  I want to use the name  
EXTROPIAN AGRI-VENTURES .... Any complaints??

Robin:....

I wonder if there is an economic benefit to replacing double blind
studies with larger database benchmarked comparative efficacy
studies?

 I'm toying with the idea of an index of knowledge, let's say a
genealogy of discoveries and inventions...

  The visualisation would be in 2D or 3D (the later being more
difficult to navigate).

   Has any one of you heard of such a sofware or concept? Any comment?

thanks for the info dennis.  the tea bags and sodas just went into the trash.
i now realize the weakness of my own idea of starting a two-question
web survey for renal stones and coffee consumption:  before june, i
would never have had the slightest interest in the subject, and so would
never have gone to the website.   but since ---> the incident <----
anything on the subject of kidney stones has my complete and undivided.

healthy people will not bother with these websites.  {8-[  because we
would be inadvertently preselecting those who have suffered, we would get
an overwhelming signal linking kidney stones to everything: coffee, tea, soda,
extropians, web surfing, everything.

this has been a fascinating and educational query however.  i have a
new appreciation for the difficulties of the medics.  {8^D  spike

Why have you assumed a state of slavery for the sentient beings?  How
would self ownership and a right to ones own wages, for the machine
intelligences change your results?

Another assumption I'm still grappling with, is that the labor
population of machine intelligences could grow as fast as desired to
meet labor demand.  I'm not so sure human or greater intelligences
wouldn't have a problem once they start seeing thousand of copies of
themselves in the population.  Although, all you need to find is one
willing participant, this may still be a problem.  Could you find one
human who is willing to undergo constant torture?  Would the world be
satisfied if it starts seeing skyrocketing suicide rates?  I know most
will disagree with me on this, but I think there might be some
socio-political unknowns that are not at all foreseeable that might
stop this dead in its tracts.

[I have contacted juno's 'postmaster' several times in response, but

being taken to limit spammers from using juno servers.]

You are wasting you time going after Juno. Huge software firms can't 
litigate them to stop hackers from using their service to pirate 
software. How do you think you are going to make Juno even blink?


[In response to this, I've started taking two strategies which I suggest 
others on the list do as well in hopes of finally getting some sort of 
respose to remedy the situation.]

I've got a better strategy. Make the list a closed list. They can still 
retrieve email addresses from the archives but that is cumbersome. They 
will go back to USENET fishing.

[They are based on the idea that since juno is doing nothing to prevent 
spammers from using accounts with them for spamming, that juno is in 
collusion with spammers who engage in theft of electronic services (i.e. 
wasting my time and bandwidth). Considering the volume of this theft, 
Juno can fall under the RICO Act statutes.]

They are also based on the (wrong) idea that Juno cares. Juno has been 
litigated before on this. They don't care. Prosecutors can't construct 
cases that stand up in court. Like I said before, software firms can't 
even stop the free use of Juno's service. 

[Strategy 1: Charge fees: As some on the list may know, I charge a 
$250.00 fee for processing unsolicited commercial email messages. Every 
time I receive a spam which uses a juno account in the body of the 
message as a response email address, I send a bill to juno's postmaster 
for $250.00. Their account balance is now 
$1500.00. I've given them three days to refuse charges on each instance, 
and 30
days to pay the charges, and will impose a 18.5% finance charge for 
balances due over 30 days.]

This absurd idea is based on supposed enforcement of communication laws 
that are just not enforced. Why charge them $250 when the law allows for 
$500? Hell, why not just charge them a cool million for every bit you 
receive? Then you can include those hefty billion dollar receivables on 
your books. Factor them off to a bank who I'm sure will give you at 
least a penny for them.


[Strategy 2: I warn juno in each message that they are in violation of 
RICO Act statues by colluding with perpetrators of theft of electronic 
services. Apparently, there are means of civil redress under the RICO 
Act, where a person or persons can sue violators of the RICO Act. I am 
currently researching what it would take to file a class action lawsuit 
against juno.com on these grounds. Anyone here is welcome to become in 
volved in this effort. If you are interested in getting in on this 
lawsuit, respond to me at: rico-lawsuit@lorrey.com. Please provide a zip 
file with text copies of all spam messages you have received related to 
juno.com to add to the evidence files.]

You shouldn't waste people's time with these litigation pipedreams. You 
aren't going to find an attorney that will waste his time prosecuting an 
ISP under the RICO statutes! Unless you pay them a hefty nonrefundable 
retainer. Get a good spam filter and have a nice day.

  IAN: Apart from inflammatory talk of a global conspiracy 
  to oppress the masses with zero and personal attacks on 
  me, I have not seen any logical support for your views 
  on zero. I even raised several questions about your 
  claims which you have systematically ignored. 

  Of those questions, perhaps the most relevant are: 
  What is the definition of change you imply that does 
  not employ zero? And: How is change measured free from 
  differentiation from a state of no (i.e., of zero) change?

Encyclopedia Britannica.  There's a special volume which is intendend for

I discuss a lot of these issues qualitatively in 
http://hanson.berkeley.edu/uploads.html

There may well be political intervention, but the first analytical 
step is to see what is likely to happen without intervention.  Then 
folks can discuss which interventions are likely or desirable.

I just recently read Richard Dawkin's book "Climbing Mount
Improbable."  One of his major reasons for writing the book was to
counter the common claim that there's something special going on in
evolution to explain the development of things like eyes and wings.
He explicitly intended to refute the claim that half an eye or half a
wing was useless, so evolution couldn't have walked a long narrow
trail from no eye or no wing to fully developed eyes or wings.

The argument that he makes is that a useful organ that is 1% better
than the previous generation's model often provides more benefits than
the previous one did.  For instance, if a light detecting patch on the
skin of a swimming creature lets it know when to hide, then one that
detects edges more often, or gives an indication of the size of the
oclusion will provide a better idea about when to hide and when it's
not necessary.

Along the way, Dawkins reports that eyes have developed
"independently" 40 different times in the animal kingdom.  This is due
to the large differences in the macro structure across animals.  There
is a fish that has two different lenses in its eyes (one looking
forward, one looking down), and they use different designs.

Dawkins discusses the controlling genes that John Clark brought up,
and his claim is that this indicates that some very early creature had
a light-detecting patch on its skin somewhere.  One part of the gene
pattern that controlled this development was treated as controlling by
all later evolutionary descendents.  As various kinds of eyes develop,
if there is an easy way to ensure that all the pieces of the apparatus
depend on a common switch, then the pieces will find a way to depend
on the switch.  A gene that tried to develop a cornea when the other
genes that know how to build parts of an eye aren't working will
quickly be selected out.

Notice that those same genes to develop "abstract eyeness" don't do 
anything interesting when inserted into a plant.  Nothing in the 
evolutionary history of the plant genese caused any of them to tie 
themselves to the activation of that gene cluster.

It's not an abstract signal, it's a concrete signal that was useful
because all the other genes that built eye machinery were also
listening to it.

I shall leave aside my personal objections, since I think you may find
Gubrud's arguments more convincing; they use essentially the same set of
assumptions.  While the main focus is on nanotech, it also deals with the
effects of advanced artificial intelligence.

"Nanotechnology and International Security"
http://squid.umd.edu/~gubrud/

(From the abstract:)
"Whereas the perfection of nuclear explosives established a strategic
stalemate, advanced molecular manufacturing based on self-replicating systems,
or any military production system fully automated by advanced artificial
intelligence, would lead to instability in a confrontation between rough
equals. Rivals would feel pressured to preempt, if possible, in initiating a
full-scale military buildup, and certainly not to be caught behind. As the
rearmament reached high levels, close contact between forces at sea and in
space would give an advantage to the first to strike."

In the event that you've read it already, which seems probable, I would just
like to say this:  The flip side of rapid progress is incredibly destructive
wars.  And if you think the currency meltdown is causing global
destabilization, the differential equations you blithely toss around would
shatter national economies like glass.  Since I don't believe a Weak
Singularity is probable, I can say dispassionately that the Weak Singularity
your paper models would probably end in the violent death of a significant
fraction of mankind.  The average human might be freed from the "stresses" of
the working life and the necessity of making a living, but not to engage in a
life of leisure.  Judging by the Middle Ages, those who do not work for a
living generally occupy themselves with wars of conquest.

I'm not sure what your "objection" is here.  I have read Gubrud and had a long
email conversation with him.  His basic thesis seems to be that new technology
induces military instability, an argument that is not particular to nanotech or 
AI.  I don't find this terribly convincing - technology is changing a lot 
faster now than a thousand years ago, but it's not clear wars are worse.   But 
even if Gubrud is right, how is that an objection to my analysis?  If machine
intelligence appears, it is a big new tech, so Gubrud predicts wars.  I predict
changes in growth rates, wages, and population.  How are these predictions in 
conflict?

Uh, I don't think so. If all AI machines were treated with a slave
existence, then biological humanity as a whole would develop an
aristocratic level of wealth based on the uncompensated profits from the
productivity of the AI machines. I think that this scenario is the
preferable one at least at first, as we are not JUST talking about
completely human level AI. There will be a whole taxonomy of various AI
entities, some of which we may want to grant personal sovereignty to, but
hardly all of them. Its rather dumb to grant it across the board when 90%+
of AI entities will have intelligence less than a monkey. The dumber AIs
will undoubtedly be developed first, and should be kept in a slave/master
relationship, until actual human level AI is developed. Of course, if the
'upload' scenario develops before outright evolved AI, then it follows that
where a 40 IQ AI entity would be a factory slave, an uploaded human mind
would automatically carry over his/her personal sovereignty, as the
upload's IQ would baseline at 100-200, and would grow upward from there.
This does have a legal precedent. People who test below a certain level on
intelligence/cognitive tests are considered wards of the state, i.e.
permanent minors. There is also a grey area, where a retarded individual
who can demonstrate learned skills of autonomy can gain limited or full
personal sovereignty. It is also seen that retarded individuals may gain
greater levels of autonomy by intelligence amplification from
augmentation.

As I said, I'm interested in class action, which if you have the slightest

Making the list a closed list is useless, and far too late. The archives are
the main source of data mining that spammers use. Every spam message I get
from the list I also get to my personal accounts as well, so my personal
addresses are on the spammer's databases. The only way they could get these
addresses is if they were mining the data from the archives, or if a
subscriber is a miner, in which case making the list closed is again a
useless gesture. The problem with juno is that they have no mechanism in
their system which permanently banns people based on either their forwarding
email server, their name, billing address, or credit card numbers or social
security numbers. All they do is cancel existing accounts of spammers when
the spammers are reported, thus always putting the onus on others to do the
work of reporting the spammers as they come up with new email accounts. It
is easy for a spammer to set up new accounts once old ones have been
canceled.

You think that mining email addresses from the archives is cumbersome?
Wrong. it is extremely easy for someone with the right software to do. All
you need is an FTP client, and a good editor like vedit, and an application
that can do sorting like a database or spreadsheet app. I bet that I could
develop a useable database of the extropy mail list archive's posters in
only a few hours at most.

The way to end exploitation of this mail list is to a) wipe the archive, b)
hunt down and kill every owner of databases mined from the archives, or c)
go after the accomplices. I think that going after the accomplices is the
more productive and extropic strategy.

Its not that hard to do. You can even do it at a local level. Pass a local
ordinance that requires any ISP that wishes to provide service in your area
must include blockers in its mail servers that stops any and all email to or
from known  perpetrators and accessories to illegal theft of electronic
services. Making it unprofitable to collude with spammers will make them
care.

You can also push for ordinances which require the public posting of lists
of 'outed' spammers.

I don't know where you are at, but they do get enforced around here. I

On the contrary, while I already have several lawyers I know personally who
are starting to work on this for me, with no retainer, I also know of
lawyers who specialize in class actions, stockholder lawsuits, etc, work on
these projects on contingency, since they stand to gain up to 1/3 of any
judgement won.

Ah, let me clarify:  The succession of levels that the AI pushes itself
through, not the succession of levels that the programmer tries.  Once again,
you have to look at a case where you're not just dealing with a list of ideas
a single intelligence comes up with - be it AI or human - but a changing
intelligence, and above all a self-altering intelligence.  If you don't look
at the self-alteration, you're not likely to discover any positive feedback.

Each time the AI's intelligence jumps, it can come up with a new list.  If it
can't come up with a new list, then the intelligence hasn't jumped enough and
the AI has bottlenecked.  The prioritized lists probably behave like you said
they would.  It's the interaction between the lists of thoughts and the
thinker that, when you zoom out, has the potential to result in explosive growth.

This type of spam is not directed at extropy for the purpose of creating
influence or attempting to gain monetary reward. On the contrary, my
guess is that each spam is a bullet in an info war of attrition being
waged by spider-like dissidents against the contradictory laissez faire
libertarian capitalist strategy of the extropy institute. Responses like
yours only incite the spammer and in the end people will get exhausted
by the broken cobwebs of communication on this list and quit. Could this
be the objective of the spammer in this case?

Exactly.  When P', O', and I' are all zero, when the AI can't redesign its
chips, optimize existing abilities, or design new ones, the trajectory
bottlenecks.  I do have one minor dispute with your terminology, however:  I
think that you should substitute A' for A.  I think that with AI intelligence,
the current capabilities measure absolute limits and not how much
"improvement" one can wreak.  An AI of low intelligence might be able to
design very slow and stupid chips - A is nonzero - but be unable to improve on
human levels.  In other words, the elegance of the equation is marred by the
artificial initial values.  Maybe your terminology is better, since you can
just set A' to zero until the AI is a competent (or transhuman) researcher in
chip technologies, however long that takes...  Anyway, I'll continue to use
your terminology.

Actually, I was speaking of O and I with constant P, since I think P' is going
to be zero - or the default human speed of doubling every eighteen months -
until the AI winds up on the post-Singularity side of the trajectory.  I don't
think they can handle the research.  Given sufficient I, I think P goes to
infinity, or as close to it as makes no difference - a.k.a. Singularity.

But for constant P and constant O, as a simplification, I define the sum as
follows:  Given I'1 = C(P, O, I), and I'2 = C(P, O, I + I'1), and I'3 = C(P,
O, I + I'1 + I'2), then the total improvement in intelligence is the sum of
the series.  (Since the AI does operate in finite steps, I do not say
integral.)  Let us assume the basic strategy of increasing I until a
bottleneck occurs, then increasing O until a bottleneck occurs, and
alternating.  If both reach bottlenecks simultaneously, and the AI is too dumb
to have a nonzero A, then a triple bottleneck has occurred.  As previously
stated, I think that nonzero A lies on the other side of a Singularity, so I
usually assume zero A and constant P.  (Is this optimism or pessimism?)

I meant "B and C have to bottleneck eventually, but when they do, will A be
very large?"  And my answer was:  If I, P, and O are large enough to begin
with.  And I further went on to say:  If the initial conditions are P=10^13
ops, O=human, I=architectural design, I think that the OI bottleneck will be
P=10^13 ops, O=far transhuman, I=?transhuman, with A(P, O, I) = nanotech. 
(?transhuman means somewhere between Wili Wachendon and a Power, but I don't
know where.)  Of course, any term with "human" in it is loosely defined, like
humans themsevles.

But if you mean "Why is a sharp jump upwards plausible at any given point?",
my answer is that, for any reasonable function f() of optimization and
intelligence, solving the differential equation y' = f(y) yields a curve which
is either flat or sharp.  Either the increases in I and O are self-sustaining,
yielding further increments, or they peter out.

In technology progress with constant intelligence, you have t' = t, which
gives us the exponential growth we all know and love.  If intelligence were a
function of technology (i = t), and given that intelligence sets the rate of
exponential technological growth, I think a more realistic model is t' = e^t,
which yields -log(-t), which goes to infinity.

I'm impressed.  And honored, and glad to know it was readable.

I recently re-read Neal Stephenson's novel "The Diamond Age, or A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer", and this time I really noticed elements of the novel which I had glossed over the first time.

I know that the novel has been mentioned favorably on this list before, but has anyone else noticed how "UNextropian" the novel is? I'm referring to the novel's apparent prediction of the failure of artificial intelligence. As I've re-read certain passages, it doesn't seem like an oversight to me; it appears to be a central theme of the novel.

I could quote many passages in the novel which indicate that in the fictional future of the novel, the following is true:

(1) Even by the late 21st century, and even with the benefits of nanotechnology, computer science will have failed to produce cybernetic systems that are truly intelligent in the same sense that humans are,

(2) The standard opinion among scientists at that time will have become that it is impossible to produce true intelligence through cybernetic means, and the term "artificial intelligence" (implying actual intelligence produced through artificial means) will be replaced with the term "pseudo-intelligence" (meaning "mock intelligence" or "fake intelligence"), and,

(3) Given enough time, even children will be able to distinguish the best pseudo-intelligence systems from real intelligence (that is, even the best pseudo-intelligence systems will fail the Turing test.)

I find it fascinating that this aspect of the novel could have escaped attention for so long. Once you notice it, you notice that it is a theme running through the whole novel.

Additional note:
 
  A second test of the effect of DHEA on C57BL mice was reported in
the Gerontologist 37(Special Issue I): page 7 October 1997. No effect on
mortality was noted, but no checking was done to see if DHEA serum levels
in the mice were actually increased. Since the DHEA (sulfate) was
administered in drinking water in this test, too much of it may have
degraded for it to have any effect.

Well for me it is tie between:

	LSD Psychotherapy - Stanislav Grof

	1. Models for the states found in alternate states of consciousness
	2. Practical directions for psychonauts and those interested in
          personal growth, or automorphing

	For Your Own Good - Alice Miller

	Shows clearly how subtle, pervasive and distorting the influence
	of bad child rearing practices, relation to violence and suppression
	of self, only explanation of Holocaust that I have found that makes
	any kind of sense.

Why psych books? Cuz personal growth is the key to finding values which
work, and those we need very badly now...

Well, 30 years ago I stepped out of my dorm room into a slightly foggy
night, and the fireworks were INTENSE (50/second). It was scary and I went
back inside.

Sky and Telescope says, early morning is the best time as Natasha posts,
and they say that the intense part (about 1 hour) will hit East Asia . But
if the main cloud is 10 hours earlier, we'll see the main show. Pray to the
meteroic gods...

I'm glad it's back, hope the weather is good and that I get a second chance...

I still haven't read this book yet, but it seems to me that it may well
be a prerequisite for a story of human life in a nanotech society, rather
than a prediction. Widespread SI changes so many things that a society
like this may be impossible; he could be laboring the point a little to 
justify not including SIs because he wants to write about a more normal
human society, not because he doesn't think they could exist.

Tissue regeneration linked to genes

NEW YORK, Sep 30 (Reuters) -- A group of researchers say they are
close to identifying a group of genes linked to complex tissue
regeneration in mice. They believe their findings could
further research into human organ and limb regeneration after
trauma or illness.

After injury, wound healing in mammals usually involves repair
through cell proliferation rather than regeneration, which involves
replacement of damaged tissues. Mammals usually cannot regenerate
complex body structures, which can result in loss of function.
However, scientists at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, say they have now identified a strain of mice
that ``undergo rapid and complete wound closure that resembles
regeneration.'' Their report is published this week in the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

``What is remarkable,'' they say, is that these wound closures
``not only display full healing but also show the recovery of
normal architecture,'' including the regrowth of skin, cartilage,
blood vessel, hair follicles, and sebaceous glands -- all without
scarring.

After discovering that the ``MRL/MpJ'' strain of mice was able to
effect an apparent regeneration of damaged ear tissue, the authors
examined the mouse's genome (genetic 'blueprint') to seek out
genes associated with this process. The discovery of a mouse
capable of regeneration is particularly important, the scientists
say, since the genetic code of mice is both well-understood
and similar to that of humans.

The researchers say they have identified various areas of the mouse
genome thought to be home to ``at least five unlinked (mouse) genes
that can contribute to (this) healing.''

They report that one of the suspect genes is located in a
chromosomal region similar to that responsible for regeneration in
amphibians -- many species of which are capable of regrowing
whole limbs. Another gene has been linked to the production of
retinoic acid, a protein involved in mammalian tissue development
and the growth of skin.

In an interview with Reuters Health, Dr. Giovanni Rovera, director
of the Wistar Institute, explained that the final identification of
these genes will be only the beginning of regeneration
research. ``We understand so little,'' he said, ''but I think we
are one step closer.''

He believes the next logical step would be an exact identification
of the genes themselves. At the present time, he said, all we have
determined is an 'address' for the genes. ``I would compare it
to saying 'this is the town where these genes live,''' he
explained.

Of course, the 'holy grail' of this type of research would be the
development of a medical means of allowing humans to regrow limbs,
organs, or damaged spinal cords. However, Rovera cautioned that
experts ``suspect that regeneration of an organ or a limb is
controlled by many elements, of which these genes are only
representing one of those many elements.''

Kind of reminds me of that scene in Schindler's List, where Jews about to
be deported by train (to Auschwitz or a like place) were told by the Nazi
officials to put their name etc. on their suitcase, so that they could retrieve
it easier at their destination. Of course, the suitcases were all emptied in a
pile and plundered as soon as they were out of sight...

Oh, you mean that things like Netscape Communicator shouldn't be included
in the reply? Such a pity...

It's a good season for spam, I must say. No wonder with all that exposure
the archives are getting from search engines. You might as well put up
a sign with "SPAM WELCOME" on it.

Which is a good thing, because the only way around it would be to force
people to submit some kind of 'True Name' when they set up a Juno account,
and ban anonymity. You may dislike spam, but how would you feel if some
spammer signed up with your social security number and got you blacklisted
all over the Net?

Remember, various people on this list (including me) wrote, write, run or 
ran anonymous remailers; anyone can use those for spamming unless you shut
them all down. So I don't think that these kind of arguments are going 
to work too well.

I have a much simpler, and IMHO more extropian solution; I only post to
the Net from my unicorn.com or pseudonymous accounts, and the unicorn.com
account has a hulking spam-filter sitting in front of it. It's stopped
about 7MB of spam in the last year or so, and I don't remember the last
time a spam message actually got through.

Why use the armed might of the State to try to do what technology can do
right now? Filters work, government-enforced 'True Names' suck.

More likely, it's an AI seeking revenge for our casual considerations
about its personal sovereignty and especially Mike Lorrey's desire to
develop an aristocratic level of wealth based on the uncompensated
profits from its
productivity.

Hi,
Sorry about those last few postings.. I forwarded that spam a few times to
the adress in the text that it said to write to if you're interested..
apparently that adress forwarded it directly to the list..

Well, for example, if the average compensation level for a machine
intelligence were $0.00, while the average compensasion level for a biological
human level intelligence were $30,000.00, you could state accurately that the
average wage level would drop to $15,000.00 if half the work force were AI.
However, no legally human entity's wage would drop. Moreover, since the
biological human's productivity would be seen to rise (as the AI's he or she
manages increase their productivity), then the human's wage should rise to
compensate for this rise in productivity. This sceanario directly contradicts
the implied conclusions of your paper, that introduction of machine
intelligence would lead to poverty for all....

I would say that this is the proper way to look at it, for the  most part. I
mean, why would an AI have material wants and desires unless we program them
into the AI?? Our own materialistic desires are based on our evolved nest
building instincts, something which an AI will not posess. What does an AI
need anyway??? More disk space??? more peripherals? Since such assets will be
networked, AIs should be able to operate in a much more socialistic economic
environment. There would be no need for an AI to have permanent posessions
outside of its own hardcopy, and no ongoing consumption outside of a few watts
of power, and rent for variable temporary processing space/

It continually amazes me how hard people will fight spam. Hours spent
tweaking software and filters, complaining to postmasters and ISP's, etc.

Is it really that hard to hit the delete key/button a couple times a day?

I did not say "poverty for all".  My results are consistent with either of 
these extremes: humans get all consumption, or they are get just as 
much per capita as machine intelligences.  Perhaps you could read what I 
said before you disagree with it?  (see http://hanson.berkeley.edu/aigrow.pdf)

Interesting article at the Economist:

http://www.economist.com/editorial/freeforall/current/index_st4636.html

They talk about in the near future working to stack 1k chips
together (using 3DFETs for connections) into a cube.

   There's another problem with interpreting rodent DHEA experimental
results, and that is the fact that DHEA causes proliferation of liver
peroxisomes in rodents, but apparently does not do so in humans.  This
proliferation of these organelles which are full of nasty oxidative
enzymes is thought to underlie the hepato-carcinogenic effect of the
stuff in rodents.  So it's not at all clear that humans are at the same
risk, even with the same megadose of DHEA.

I wouldn't call that unextropian. After all, extropianism is about
other things than believing in specific technologies. Stephenson's
world is a bit strange in many places, but the lack of AI didn't
strike me as cruicial as the lack of easily copyable assemblers - but
that is a central part of the plot, of course.

Actually, it is the list itself that causes this.  Any message sent to
the list gets a "Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com" header put on it.
This makes it so that any replies to list messages are also distributed
to the entire list.  The side-effect is that when spammers send messages
through the list, they appear to be messages from the list, and all
replies likewise go to the entire list.

We have had this problem before.  Sometimes replies to spammers get
duplicated to the entire list.  Sometimes replies to members of the list
get duplicated to the entire list acceidentally.  Sometimes we even see
messages sent to the list under one name get duplicated again to the
list under another name.

So the "oops" wasn't directly your fault.  You just have to be careful
replying to Extropian-list messages, because the headers are being
tweaked to automatically duplicate messages in ways that you might not
expect.

  If people like the things Jones produces better
  than the things Johnson produces, why should not 
  Jones receive and uneven quantity of monetary com-
  pensation for his services from his neighbors? If
  society values Jones more, he should receive more.
  It seems to me that uneven distribution directed
  by social (people) demand is inherently ethical.

  Democratic votes in a political election are not 
  evenly distributed, so why must democratic votes be 
  evenly distributed in free-market selection? How can
  we know what society wants if we cannot allow it to 
  reward with more money those who do what it wants?

  Furthermore, consumer (people) directed distribu-
  tion has proven to maximize net social welfare.

Ha ! very nice,
Pirsigs ideas on Quality have been useful in  Extropian epistemology. [mine at
least] Even if in the final analysis you counter Pirsig's arguments, you need
to consider his critique.  It strikes to the heart of strong AI, the question,
can the Quality  of human consiousness can be completly contained by
mechanical computations?  Or can the quantative calculation simulate the
brain, or is the Quality of consciousness, beyond material, not capable of
computation.  As for the Zen, I think Buddhism  is the most Extropian
religion. I know that not many Extropians adhere to conventional religions,
but Buddhism's idea that one can transcend the human suffering, and reach
enlightenment by mental effort and self development is Extropian.  The
Bohdisattva ideal is an excellent example of a trans/post human.  Affirmation
methods are a tool in personality development, like the Tibetan practice of
repeating a mantra 100,000 times.

It is very easy to just ignore it when someone breaks into your house
and steals your property.  After all, it is a hassle dealing with the
police and insurance and all.  And if someone picks your wallet, it is
a lot of trouble to report it as well.  

And if you see someone else being ripped off, it is easy to just keep
walking and pretend you don't see it happening.  OR you can stand up,
speak up, and DO something to let these crooks know that it is NOT OK,
and you are NOT going to simply ignore their unacceptable behavior. 
Every time you hit "delete" that is one more spammer you could have
possibly stopped from that site.  And every time you make them go to
another ISP, pay the setup etc. again and again, you make spam less
profitable.  And when spam is no longer profitable it will reduce to a
trickle.  Remember the net before spam?  It can, for the most part, be
returned.  Not in its entirety, but it does NOT have to stay the way
it is now.  Unless nobody does anything and everyone "just presses
DEL."

Personally when someone steals from me I get mad, and then I DO
something about it.  If you don't mind being ripped off that is up to
you.  But also remember that these spammers is costing the Internet
millions of dollars.  Just ask Nick@pbi.net, where they spent
$500,000.00 because spammers were crippling their Spark Ultras
(they've got a nice farm of 93 of the puppies.)  

The current estimate is that $2 - $3 per month of every user's ISP
bill is spent to deal with these scumbag thieves.  That is YOUR and MY
money they are stealing.  Why should they be allowed to continue
ripping us off?

It continually amazes me how hard people will fight spam. Hours spent

etc.

Is it really that hard to hit the delete key/button a couple times a

  IAN: Good points! Buddhism also shares a very deep
  connection to Extropian-AI philosophy, which is the 
  claim that the mind isn't inhabited by a spirit, that
  the self-nature of mind, of the ego, is void.  "Self"
  is an illusion produced by neuroanatomy, and as such,
  a highly sophisticated computer could do the same.

  Of course, there is ground for disagreement between
  Buddhist and Western thought that centers on the issue
  of consciousness. The prevailing Buddhist view on the 
  true nature of consciousness is that consciousness is
  a neutral, free-base that's the basis of everything, 
  and yet its self-nature is void, without locality,
  without recognition of form, name, or place.  A
  state of oblivion that is just being. But this
  free base is as available to a computer as it 
  is to a brain, since it is all space-time.

  The view would purport that consciousness is the 
  space-time field, which brains localize by illusion.

Some eye-opening analysis quoted from the report "Berlin 
Tribunal" at this page: http://www.rath.nl/GB/hot1.htm 


Throughout the 20th century the pharmaceutical 
industry was built and organized with the goal 
to control the health care system of nations by 
systematically replacing natural, non-patentable 
therapies with patentable and therefore profitable
synthetic drugs. The architects of the pharmaceutical 
industry were unscrupulous entrepreneurs and financiers 
who, from the very beginning of this industry, had defined
the human body and the diseases it hosts as their marketplace.

As the result of the systematic take-over of the health care 
system by nationally and internationally operating pharmaceu-
tical corporations billions of people in almost all countries 
of the United Nations have been paying trillions of dollars 
for pharmaceutical drugs that neither prevent diseases nor 
cure them. The governments, the economic and social sectors 
of all industrialized countries are currently held hostage 
by the ill-conceived and criminal practices of 
pharmaceutical corporations.

A particular example is the Federal Republic of Germany, 
the leading export nation of such pharmaceutical products 
in the world. Throughout the 20 th century, the German 
pharmaceutical corporations Hoechst, Bayer and BASF have 
determined the fate not only of that country but of the
entire world. In an effort to control the global chemical 
and pharmaceutical markets, these corporations formed the 
IG Farben Cartel already at the beginning of this century, 
sponsored the rise of Hitler to power and were the driving 
economic force behind the Second World War and Hitler's
effort to conquer the world. Hoechst, Bayer and BASF were 
the organizers of the giant industrial plant IG Auschwitz 
using as their forced labor camp the Concentration Camp 
Auschwitz, the largest crime site of human history.

At the 1947 Nuremberg Tribunal 24 of the managers of 
Hoechst, Bayer and BASF and other IG Farben executives 
were accused of the following crimes against humanity:

  planning and leading the war

  mass murder

  conducting criminal experiments on
  innocent inmates of concentration camps

  grand theft and plundering

  slavery and other crimes.

The US lead prosecutor Telford Taylor said in the Nuremberg 
Tribunal against these IG Farben executives: "Not the Nazi 
lunatics but these accused are responsible for this war. 
And if they are not punished for these crimes the harm 
they will do to future generations is much greater than 
Hitler could ever have done if he were alive."

The IG Farben Cartel was dismantled and split by the 
Nuremberg Tribunal into the daughter companies Hoechst, 
Bayer and BASF. With the help of Nelson Rockefeller, their 
former business partner and US Undersecretary of State after 
the war, all convicted IG Farben managers were released from 
prison already in 1952 and reassumed positions in the highest 
levels of German industry.

The prediction of Nuremberg Tribunal prosecutor Taylor soon 
became true. In post-war Germany the positions of chairmen of 
Hoechst, Bayer and BASF were held by war-time IG Farben direc-
tors and former members of the Nazi party for over a quarter
of a century after the second world war.

Hoechst, Bayer and BASF lost no time to build up other political 
leaders to serve their interests in post-war Germany. Between
1959 and 1969 Helmut Kohl worked for the "Verband der Chemischen
Industrie" (Association of Chemical Industry), the largest lobby 
organization of the chemical-pharmaceutical industry. This ind-
ustry systematically promoted Helmut Kohl&rsquo;s political 
career thereby continuing to instrumentalize the German 
government for their global expansion plans. And their
investment paid out. Now, fifty years after the Nuremberg 
Tribunal split the criminal IG Farben Cartel into Hoechst, 
Bayer and BASF each of these three daughter companies is 20 
times larger than the IG Farben empire ever was. Today, these 
IG Farben successors are the largest exporters of pharmaceutical 
products in the world, maintaining an industrial network over 120
countries of the world.

For almost two decades, Helmut Kohl has been heading the German 
government. During this time the government of Germany became the 
political spearhead of the global conquest of the pharmaceutical
industry and of the world-wide genocide and mass murder committed 
on their behalf. The criminal role of the pharmaceutical corpora-
tions and the German government becomes particularly evident by 
the effort to suppress one of the greatest advances in medicine, 
which will lead to the elimination of heart disease.
...

The discovery that vitamins and other essential nutrients are the 
answer to the most common health problems of our time marked not 
only a turning point in medicine but it immediately threatened 
the very existence of the pharmaceutical industry.

The global pharmaceutical market of cardiovascular drugs alone 
is in excess of several hundred million dollars every year and 
the single largest segment of the global drug market. In order 
to artificially stabilize their global pharmaceutical drug market 
the pharmaceutical corporations now formed an international Pharma-
Cartel. This Pharma-Cartel organizes a global campaign to system-
atically obstruct, suppress the dissemination of the life-saving 
information of this medical breakthrough and to publicly discredit 
the health benefits of vitamins and other natural remedies.

Between 1991 and 1994 and as a direct reaction to Dr. Rath's 
discoveries, the Pharma-Cartel tried to make vitamins and other 
essential nutrients prescription drugs in the US, their single 
largest national market. The pretenses under which the Pharma-
Cartel promoted their legislative plan, "consumer protection" 
from non-existing side-effects and "international harmonization" 
to adapt inadequately low daily nutritional recommendations, 
were false and deceptive. However the statistical facts un-
covered the deception of the Pharma-Cartel and showed that 
in the last ten years no American had died from side effects 
of vitamins and other essential nutrients. Supported by millions 
of Americans, US Congress unanimously passed the Dietary Supplement 
Health and Education Act of 1994, which secured unrestricted access 
to nutritional supplements.

  The above was xcerpted from the report "Berlin Tribunal" 
  found at this webpage: http://www.rath.nl/GB/hot1.htm

Limitation is a necessity in art, otherwise you get random junk. Think of
the limits imposed by Vinge in "A Fire Upon the Deep". Carefully chosen to
make the ideas work, utter nonsense in terms of contemporary physics.

Actually, I agree with you about it not being "unextropian",
which is why I put the word in quotes. However, I have
noticed that not all "extropians" are as open-minded as you
about some things. If you imply that it is okay for an
extropian to believe that AI is impossible, I find that
extraordinary and atypical, especially if you follow that
belief to its logical conclusions.

(I highly recommend it.)

"...but it seems to me that it may well be a prerequisite for

prediction. Widespread SI changes so many things that a society
like this may be impossible; he could be laboring the point a
little to justify not including SIs because he wants to write
about a more normal human society, not because he doesn't think
they could exist."

Both of these statements seem to imply that Stephenson's reasons
for excluding AI from the world of "The Diamond Age" were
artistically-neccessary limitations he had to follow to be able
to tell his story about nanotechnology. This may be exactly
right; only Stephenson could say.

However, the impression I get is somewhat the reverse. That is,
it seems to me that nanotech is not really central to the novel's
theme, but is just superficial flash. Nanotech is part of the
setting for a tale about the continuation of essential truths
about human nature, societies, etc. Nanotech exists, but people
are still people.

And, Stephenson keeps returning, over and over, to the
impossibility of AI.

I include three examples. The first is the conversation that
ensues when Hackworth first meets Lord Finkle-McGraw:

<begin excerp>
"I'm an engineer. Just promoted to Bespoke recently. Did some
work on this project, as it happens."

"What sort of work?"

"Oh, P.I. stuff, mostly," Hackworth said. Supposedly
Finkle-McGraw still kept up with things and would recognize the
abbreviation for pseudo-intelligence, and perhaps even appreciate
that Hackworth had made this assumption.

Finkle-McGraw brightened a bit. "You know, when I was a lad they
called it A.I. Artificial intelligence."

Hackworth allowed himself a tight, narrow, and brief smile. "Well,
there's something to be said for cheekiness, I suppose."

"In what way was pseudo-intelligence used here?"

"Strictly on MPS's side of the project, sir." Imperial Tectonics had
done the island, building, and vegetation. Machine-Phase System -
Hackworth's employer - did anything that moved. "Stereotyped
behaviors were fine for the birds, dinosaurs, and so on, but for the
centaurs and fauns we wanted more interactivity, something that would
provide an illusion of sentience."
<end excerp>

Comment: An illusion of sentience?? These are nanotechnological
experts from the most technically-advanced phyle in the world, and
off-handedly dismiss the possibility of AI.

A later conversation between Hackworth and Finkle-McGraw goes even
farther in indicating the extent of the failure of AI. When explaining
to Finkle-McGraw the need to employ humans ("ractors") to supply the
voices of the Primer, Hackworth says:

<begin excerp>
"After all of our technology, the pseudo-intelligence algorithms, the
vast exception matrices, the portent and content monitors, and
everything else, we still can't come close to generating a human voice
that sounds as good as what a real, live ractor can give us."
<end excerp>

To which Finkle-McGraw replies:

<begin excerp>
"Can't say that I'm surprised, really."
<end excerp>

Comment: Not surprised? We certainly are! From what one hears nowadays,
you'd think this technology is already in beta!

Lastly, a passage which actually uses the dreaded s-word. This passage
concerns the conclusions that Princess Nell arrives at after her
investigations of all of the bizarre Turing machines she finds in the
Land Beyond:

<begin excerp>
Her study of the Ciperers' Market, and particularly of the rule-books
used by the cipherers to respond to messages, had taught her that for
all its complexity, it too was nothing more than another Turing machine.
She had come to the castle of King Coyote to see whether the King
answered his messages according to Turing-like rules. For if he did,
than the entire system - the entire kingdom - the entire Land Beyond -
was nothing more than a vast Turing machine. And as she had established 
when she'd been locked up in the dungeon at Castle Turing, communicating
with the mysterious Duke by sending messages on a chain, a Turing machine,
no matter how complex, was not human. It had no soul. It could not do what
a human did.
<end excerp>

Comment: Now who would argue that this in some sense conflicts with
extropianism?

Nell goes on to seek out the only sentient part of her Primer, the ractor
Miranda who almost single-handedly racted all the parts of her Primer,
essentially raising her and becoming her mother. The novel practically
comes right out and says that Nell somehow sensed that there was
SOMETHING sentient behind her Primer, that it wasn't "just a Turing
machine".

I'm sorry about the length of this post. I'm thinking about perhaps
writing an essay about this interpretation of the novel, and if I do,
I will not post it to this list, but will rather post a URL to it.

I've been reading a bit of Ginsberg, Kerouac and Snyder. All Zen Buddhists
from the Beat culture.  They wrote/talked about what they considered to be
the major problems of the day -- computers, pollution, population and
consumption.  They viewed ecology as a mandala. Their voice was mellow and
compassionate yet cutting, while encouraging society to think ahead and to
problem solve, even though this is before think tanks and brain trusts.  

I don't think that conventional Buddhism ties in so neatly to extropianism,
mainly because of reincarnation and the acceptance of suffering and  that
it can only be eliminated by a spiritual overcoming.  Accepting suffering
is accepting death.  Overcoming suffering through spirituality is a fairy
tale reality and pseudoscience.

Zen Buddhism gets a little closer in its systematic thought that
enlightenment can be attained through meditation, self-contemplation, and
intuition rather than through faith and devotion.  A bit more rational, but
not quite there.

This is only have of the pie.  The other half are the applications of
science and technology to achieve enlightment which emphasizes the use of
reason to scrutinize previously accepted doctrines and traditions to bring
about many (trans)humanitarian reforms.

I like a poetic aspect of zen.  Becoming one with what I am doing. I enjoy
creative visualization.  However, I tend to look at it in more cognitive
science, that I focus my mind on mental tasks, become absorbed in the
tasks, and the process of preforming them.

  IAN: Overcoming suffering is not pseudoscience, there
  are all kinds of scientifically validated medications
  that people take that reduce experiences of suffering.

  Buddhist/yogic technologies can be effective too, and
  those technologies are yoga and meditation, which are 
  proven to effect positive mental/physical states that 
  overcome "suffering." We might also add analysis, for
  a big part of Buddhist-enlightenment technique is the
  analysis of the nature of mind and an understanding
  of the connections between good and bad emotions. 

  Buddha's position was that there is no reincarnation,
  although you will not get that from reading much of
  the literature of Buddhsim I'd also have to crack 
  some books I've not read in years to be able to 
  debate that issue, but it is consistent with 
  the philosophy of the void-nature of mind.

  IAN: Fuzzy logic and holistic-identity structure
  confirm as logical the deepest Buddhist teachings.
  Despite the claims of many in this forum against 
  holistic identity, none have been able to find 
  an example of an identity that is what it is 
  free from holistic relations to what it isn't.

  The last argument against holistic identity as
  expressed via Zero mechanics, raised here was 
  that 0 is not more than -1, and thus 0 - (-1)
  would not equal 1, but it does! It's only too 
  clear that the cases raised against the zero-
  sum holism implicit in Buddhist philosophy have 
  had to step outside both the empirical and logical 
  bounds as defined by our Western scientific standards.

     At this [*] humanist site we find a studied analysis
     by Joseph McCabe on whether or not Buddha was an
     atheist, which concludes: "The real authorities 
     agree that Buddha was an atheist." 

     From chapter one of the book "The Humanist Way"
     (http://www.ethicalsociety.org/greatest.htm):

     "Be ye lamps unto yoursleves. Work out your own 
     salvation," admonished the Buddha. ...Unlike the 
     monotheistic prophets and reformers...[ Buddha ] 
     put no stock in gods and saviours. Like the anci-
     ent Roman poet Lucretius, gautama the Buddha be-
     lieved that if the gods exist, they are of no con-
     cern to us. If anything, speculations about the 
     gods distract us from what we must do to accomplish 
     our primary psychological and spiritual task of 
     self-mastery. The early followers of Buddha...take 
     great pains to prevent the elevation of their 
     Master [bad word] to the status of a divine being...

     "If you meet the Buddha on the highway, kill him," 
     goes a somewhat startling Buddhist proverb. But the 
     harsh maxim drives home a vital truth: No holy prophet,
     messiah, christ, avatar, or even a great god in heaven 
     can do your spiritual or ethical task for you. Free 
     yourself. Be a lamp unto your own salvation!" 

   Albert Einstein on Buddhism:

     "Buddhism has the characteristics of what would 
     be expected in a cosmic religion for the future: 
     it transcends a personal God, avoids dogmas and 
     theology; it covers both the natural & spiritual, 
     and it is based on a religious sense aspiring 
     from the experience of all things, natural 
     and spiritual, as a meaningful unity."

cool!  i stumbled upon kerouac about five years ago, having never heard of
him before that time.  his expressiveness in fiction amazes me, even in the
lighter stuff like 'on the road'.  i admit i still find dr. sax to be totally

Yes I agree, Buddhism does not tie neatly into Extropianism, rather I said it
the most Extropian of the established religions.  As for reincarnation, many,
esp in Zen, are agnostic.  One master when asked "What happens after you
die?", answered, "How would I know, I am not dead !".  Yes, life is suffering,
but it is not grim, for with dilligence, one can transcend it.  Regardless of
the possibility  of a fairy tale, the psychological /mental aspects of the
Buddhist practice is a powerful example of conscious(ness) development.
Buddha asked that the methods not be taken on faith, but be tried with a
critical and  emprical attitude.

Hence, Extropianism, being eclectic, draws the best ideas and methods from all
sources.  Not just the Zen, but Pirsig's ideas on Quality also.

  IAN: I didn't misquote you. I guess you mean 
  to say that I did not address what you said, 
  but I did... My point was that suffering eli-
  mination can occur and modalities offered by 
  spiritual traditions such as yoga, meditation, 
  and psychological analysis do work and are not 
  pseudoscientific per se. Those are the remedies 
  for suffering offered by Buddhism and I cannot 
  think what else you may have been referring 
  to in Buddhism as being pseudoscientific 
  methodologies for overcoming suffering.

  What is the "spirituality" of Buddhism 
  but the beliefs and practices of Buddhism? 

  Heck, even believing in phoney Gods may overcome 
  suffering and also not be pseudoscientific in that 
  belief has real physiological effects on the mind.

I think you meant meditate, right?  I would think that the
Extropian approach to meditation might include the use
of what are typically referred to as "mind machines" or
"light/sound machines".  These little electronic devices
use flashing lights and sounds (through goggles and
headphones) to *induce* various states of consciousness.
I have one and it does work.  One of the difficult aspects of
meditation for me was getting down to that almost hypnogogic
state then trying to stay there without falling asleep or becoming
distracted and rising out of the state.  Taking advantage of a
phenomenon in the brain referred to as "the frequency following
response", the light/sound machine ramps me downward to a
dominant brain wave frequency and holds me there for whatever
time period I specify.  There are also devices designed to induce
lucid dreams for those who were discussing this interesting
phenomenon.  You can get free demo software to try it out yourself
through your PC at http://www.futuremind.com I just found it and
haven't tried it yet but let's see what happens, shall we?

Of course the manufacturers and vendors often claim that these
things can do about everything except walk your dog.

P.S.  I think I've finally found the appropriate quote to follow my
signature.

 A neat idea, a set of ExI koans. They could

ok, but for the most extropian of *christian* denominations,
i nominate seventh day adventism.

reasoning: sda has the concept of soul sleep.  this fits nicely
with cryonics.  other denominations, and many nonchristian
religions, must answer the question "what happens to to the
immortal soul when one is frozen?" which turns out to be a
tough question.  the seventh day adventist has no such problem.

also, in sda is the tradition of trying offbeat medical technology.
consider the pioneering work of sda john harvey kellogg with
his breakfast foods and early work in diet and health.  consider
the very progressive ethics department of loma linda medical
center, dr lenard bailey, et al, who try exciting techniques such
as baboon to infant human heart transplants.  waaay extropian.
consider the proton accelerator for the nonsurgical treatment
of slow growing cancers.

i have queried a number of seventh day adventists, traditional
hard liners, and not one can think of any reason within the
context of that religion, why cryonics should not be attempted.

 People who think size is the most important attribute of a statistical
sample should remember the magazine that polled 1/3 of the U.S. voters in
1936 and concluded a Landonslide was imminent.
 The rest of us prefer to remember the obscure pollster named Gallup
who polled a much smaller sample and predicted a Roosevelt victory.

Someone mentioned Dr. Kellogg as being an example of what Seventh Day
Adventism is the most extropian christian religion. Dr. Kellogg was an
insane anti-masturbation fanatic. The popular opinion of that time was that
it was spicy foods that caused lust, hence the invention of "bland" foods to
cure it. Here's a quote:

Treatments for Self-Abuse and its Effects: 
"A remedy which is almost always successful in small boys is
circumcision...The operation
should be performed by a surgeon without administering an anesthetic, as the
brief pain
attending the operation will have a salutary effect upon the mind...In
females, the author has
found the application of pure carbolic acid to the clitoris an excellent
means of allaying the
abnormal excitement. " -- Dr. John Harvey Kellogg

One can't under-note (in light of the "herbs are dangerous"
scare-mongering being pushed by the GovtMedia as a subset of 
the effort to bring alternative medicine under totalitarian- 
Federal control similar to prescription drugs) the following 
report from JAMA showing PRESCRIPTION DRUGS to be "the sixth, 
and perhaps even the  fourth,  most  common cause of death"
(Wash. Post) killing over 100,000 Americans per year!!!

Where (X = herbs/vitamins) and (Rx = prescription drugs):
if X must be made less available if X may be dangerous, and 
if Rx is 100,000 times more dangerous than X, then surely Rx 
should be banned outright, but that's not the case, therefore
the expressed concern for safety is a false front, a Big Lie.

>From the Journal of the American Medical Association website:
http://www.ama-assn.org/sci-pubs/sci-news/1998/snr0415.htm 


        ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS MAY
        CAUSE OVER 100,000 DEATHS AMONG
        HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS EACH YEAR

        Study suggests adverse drug reactions
        are among the top causes of death in U.S.

        CHICAGO - Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) 
        in U.S. hospitals may be responsible 
        for more than 100,000 deaths nationwide 
        each year, making it one of the leading
        causes of death, according to an article 
        in the April 14 issue of The Journal of 
        American Medical Association (JAMA). 

        Bruce H. Pomeranz, M.D., Ph.D., and col-
        leagues from the University of Toronto, 
        analyzed 39 studies of ADRs in the United 
        States to estimate the incidence of serious 
        and fatal adverse drug reactions in hospital 
        patients. To obtain overall incidence rates 
        of ADRs in hospitalized patients, the re-
        searchers combined the incidence of ADRs 
        in the hospital and the incidence of ADRs 
        causing admission to the hospital.


      On 04/15/98, The Washington Post reported:

      PRESCRIBED DRUGS' TOLL IS AMONG DEADLIEST

        By Rick Weiss 

        More than 2 million Americans become 
        seriously ill every year because of 
        toxic reactions to correctly prescribed
        medicines taken properly, and 106,000 
        die from those reactions, a new study 
        concludes. That surprisingly high num-
        ber makes drug side effects at least 
        the sixth, and perhaps even the fourth, 
        most common cause of death in this country.

        The analysis, the largest and most 
        complete of its kind, suggests that 
        one in 15 hospital patients in the 
        United States can expect to suffer 
        from a serious reaction to prescription
        or over-the-counter medicine, and about 
        5 percent of these will die as a result.


     IAN: Important to note: the study seems only to have 
     included drugs prescribed to hospitalized patients,
     yet I would expect that most prescription drugs are
     prescribed to patients NOT hospitalized. If 106,000 
     hospitalized patients are killed by prescription 
     drugs, and if hospital prescriptions account for 
     (just a guess) 20% of all prescriptions, then there 
     could be upwards of 500,000 people dying every year 
     from prescription drugs (just a rough guestimate).
     While hospital patients are more sick and thus more
     inclined to die, out-patients are more inclinded to 
     drive cars and do other dangerous activity drugged.
     Suffice it is to say that there should be more than
     the cited 100,000 hospital-Rx-drug deaths in total.

> the...report from JAMA showing PRESCRIPTION DRUGS... 

  That should read, "doctor-prescribed drugs," which would  
  include conventional over-the-counter meds. Much more:

  From a University of North Carolina webpage [1] we 
  learn that "Approximately 8% of all hospital admiss-
  ions in the U.S. are due to adverse reactions to syn-
  thetic drugs," which comes to "a minimum of 2,000,000" 
  people. So not only do over 2 million suffer adverse 
  effects from drugs in hospitals, of which 100,000 will 
  come out dead, but around 2 million people are going 
  into hospitals due to adverse reactions to conventional, 
  synthetic drugs. The cited UNC page goes on to say that:

    "...at least three times as many people are killed 
     in the U.S. by pharmaceutical drugs as are killed 
     by drunken drivers. Thousands die each year from 
     supposedly 'safe' over-the-counter remedies. Deaths 
     or hospitalizations due to herbs are so rare that 
     they're hard to find. The U.S. National Poison 
     Control Centers does not even have a category in 
     their database for adverse reactions to herbs."
 
    "Similar figures apply in the United Kingdom, and 
     even hepatoxicity, where perhaps the strongest 
     case against some herbs lies, the statistics are 
     horrendously clear - over 80% of cases of fulminant 
     hepatic failure presenting for liver transplant (or 
     death) over ten years in the UK were due to poison-
     ing by freely available OTC non-prescription NSAID's, 
     such as paracetomol and aspirin. Not one case was 
     due to ingestion of medicinal herbs." 

  The Life Extension Foundation [2] reports that "FDA appro-
  ved nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs kill about 75,000 
  Americans a year," which should include both prescription
  and over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
  Many of those deaths are caused by internal bleeding. Yet
  in the media today you'll be hearing much more about the
  few cases of people getting a sick-stomach from herbs than 
  the millions made ill and tens of thousands killed by FDA-
  approved drugs. The obvious reason for the great concern 
  over the minuscule and disregard for mass death is that 
  the minuscule problem (herb side effects) is a part of 
  an area (alternative medicine) that many want to be 
  brought into government control; thus an effective 
  pretext for building public support for such control 
  is to promote through the media a state of herb-panic.

There are many other technologies/techniques that can have a profound impact on
subjective experience. Some are as simple as, (I know that this may sound
silly. but I've actually used this technique to stop patients from going into
shock) looking cross-eyed and thinking without using words. I believe that this
works for anxiety reduction due to a quirk of neuroanatomy. It also doesn't
seem to work for everybody.    Sustained exercise (distance running,etc)
stimulates endorphin production - the runner's high. Consistent use of
megadoses of Vitamin C inhibit the enzyme system that breaks down those
endorphins-raises pain threshhold, has anti-depressant effects and in my
experience produces a great sense of wellbeing. I read about both of these
techniques, tried them, and found both to be useful tools. There are many
others but these have the advantages of being cheap and not needing much
practice to be effective.
When speaking of trancending human limitations, one must not forget that many
of what we think of as limitations are those which we set for ourselves. See
sig line below.

Let me qualify my remarks by saying I know just enough about
economics to make me dangerous [though one of the transfer pricing
economists I work says that is an apt description for all 
economists also :) ].

I noticed you used a neo-classical growth model and exogenous growth
functions as the basis for your analysis. Might endogenous growth
theory be a better fit for the AI scenario? Or at least wouldn't it
be interesting to see what predictions an endogenous model might
make? From what I remember of endogenous growth theory, the way it
models growth seems to match better an economy where AI was 
advanced.

Another area that might warrant further review is the neo-classical
idea of diminishing returns. I know Paul Romer alleged that the 
diminishing returns problem might not apply if capital was expanded
to include human capital. However, an interesting analysis (which I'm
not capable of performing :) ) is what would happen to diminishing
returns where capital became based largely on knowledge, heuristics,
and other AI areas. Coupled with the idea of positive feedback from
technological change (and AI development, e.g. Vinge's singularity),
it looks like a strong case could be made to throw diminishing returns
out the window (or at least put it in the closet and see what the models
do then).

One last point is the idea of efficiency. I read a paper a year or so ago
in the Journal of Economic Perspectives (I'll try and locate it but can't at
the moment) that stated some poor countries would do well not to worry about
acquiring more of the right resources but instead work towards wasting less
of their existing resources. What impact might a drastically increased
efficiency in capital utilization have on growth models? How would this
potential effect of AI-development be factored in to growth models?

Though sometimes links come from the most surprising places. For
instance, when I was in Vancouver to investigate a startup with a
drug/laser therapy (good for throat cancer) it was revealed that the
only place they could test their regime was in Amsterdam. It turns out
that Amsterdam in 1994 had the highest rate of throat cancer in the
World. I wonder why!

certainly doc kellogg had some wacky ideas.  but in the context of his
times, had some good ones too.  he was one of the early proponents
of a low fat diet, antismoking, clean food, clean water.  i think

I'm assuming you're referring to the supposedly excessive use of a
certain _green_ herb in Amsterdam.  Some recent statistics I've seen,
however, suggest that usage in the Netherlands for 'natives' is
comparable to other European countries.  Although the stats didn't
mention Amsterdam, I'd imagine a similar story.  In fact, most of it is
apparently used by foreigners, due to the novelty of being able to use it
lawfully.  Consequently, I doubt  there is a strong connection.

 IAN: The 1993 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse [1] found 
 that of Americans age 12 and above, approximately 34% had used 
 cannabis ever, 9% had in the last year, and 4.3% had in the last 
 week. The NHSDA for 1998 [2] finds that 5.1% 12 years and over 
 used in the last month (no cite for last week in press release). 

 In Holland, the Ministry of Welfare, Health and Cultural Affairs 
 found that of residents of Amsterdam ages 12 and over, 25% ever 
 used cannabis, 9.9% did in the last year and 6% did in the last 
 week.[3] When we consider that people in the U.S., unlike those 
 in Amsterdam, will under report current use (criminal activity) 
 for obvious reasons, I think we can conclude that there's not 
 much statistical support for the theory you seem to suggest. 

 Also consider that in Amsterdam a whopping 42.7% had smoked 
 tobacco in the last week [3], and yet in the U.S. only 30%
 of all people 12 years and over are tobacco users. [2]

 BTW, J, did you see those questions I asked about zero?

I found one site that said the opposite condition applied to countries
facing scarcity :

"Resource depletion and degradation in poor economies may have their
most inimical
effect not by directly constraining growth but by indirectly affecting
the potential of these economies to innovate."

http://www.library.utoronto.ca/www/pcs/eps/social/social1.htm

For low and middle income countries, Deacon finds that

"the political variables associated with deforestation tend also to be
negatively
associated with ordinary investment." In particular, the strongest
(negative)
associations were between investment and guerilla warfare, revolutions,
constitutional changes, military executives (i.e. dictatorships or
juntas) and
circumstances in which the senior executive of government was not chosen
by
elected representatives.

----------------

Nonetheless, it is my considered view that the simplistic measurement
system of double entry bookkeeping is highly suspect as to it being the
cause of this so-called affected potential. A public AI would not and
could not make head nor tail of such information in determining how best
to structure the public data needed to foster innovation. Thus
capitalism, seen as a degradable economic lubricant, will be as foreign
to a public AI as oil will be to a Drexlerian assembler. In the YAK
fiasco monetary mechanisms will be seen as a hindrance and in the same
way that NZ shelved its pounds shillings and pence in 1967 when they
were seen as a machine problem and likewise when gold met a similar fate
in 1971, in part because of Hewlett & Packard's advice to the
government, public AI researchers with a keen eye on the problems of
financial statistics are now calling for the next informational change
of transactional integrity.

Considering that transients might end up dying of throat cancer in
Amsterdam then the fact that they bring their ailments with them creates
a very strong statistic. My point was however that a link once baited in
peoples minds is very hard to shake. At least I changed my smoking
habits after stumbling onto this fact.

Meteorite misses Ontario man by inches
-------------------------------------------------------------------------=

KITCHENER, Ontario, Oct. 2 (UPI S) _ An Ontario golfer, who came close
to being hit by a meteorite has been awarded (Friday) a free season's
pass to a Kitchener golf club for handing the black chunk of rock to
the University of Toronto. Orville Delong, a 57-year-old maintenance
worker from Cambridge, Ontario, says the meteorite whizzed past his
ear, missing him by inches, on July 12.

It is easier to get more variation in growth rates with endogenous
growth models, and there is also less consensus on how to model 
endogenous growth.  So to avoid the accusation that I cooked my big
growth speedup implications, I choose to use exogenous growth.
This may provide a conservative estimate of growth implications.
But yes, it would be interesting to try the simplest endogenous
growth model, which I think is the AK model.

This isn't another area.  The essense of endogenous growth models
is that they eliminate diminishing returns.

Unless you forsee particular reasons to expect a change in the *rate*
at which such utilization becomes more efficient, this effect is already
included in the standard models of exogenous growth.

  IAN: Do you have any evidence to support this "very 
  strong statistic" that would show that the purported
  highest-rate of throat cancer is linked to vagabonds?

  If "transients" refers to tourists, then I would observe
  that if you were on a vacation, chances are good, if you
  started to get the early signs of throat cancer, you'd 
  wait until you were home to have it checked out, and 
  if you had it checked during your vacation, you'd
  most assuredly return home to have it treated.
  So the case for tourists depositing the highest-
  rate of throat cancer in Amsterdam seems tortured.

Some caution may be applicable here, due to the following anecdotal
evidence:

This technique caused me to have a terrible reaction!  The reaction
was definitely related to a chemical that was apparently unmetabolized
in residual amounts from usage this weekend.  Luckily, I was able to
exit the building where I work, somewhat unnoticed, and walk it off. 
The experience lasted about 20 minutes.  I will not try this again :-(

That seems like a good reason to use exogenous growth. Thanks for the
clarification.

I suspect machine intelligence would radically alter capital utilization on
a variety of fronts. Machine intelligence with human-level cognitive
abilities would allow corporations to replace human MBAs with intelligent
agents capable of assessing scenarios faster and more thoroughly. Finance
agents might develop extremely complicated but effective capital asset
pricing models. Additionally, agents could constantly evaluate capital
allocation strategies on division by division, region by region, product by
product bases. The overall corporate capital allocation strategies could be
tweaked as quickly as new real-time data could be acquired. Manufacturing
would benefit from the increased diagnostic abilities of MI to tirelessly
evaluate raw materials availability, price, and related costs; manufacturing
capacity; marketing data; etc. resulting in optimized allocations of
manufacturing assets. MI might enable more protean manufacturing processes
to enable greater flexibility to respond to the new capabilities of market
analysis. Similar processes could be applied to all areas of corporate
capital (human, intellectual, information, etc.) to reap some increased
utilization. I admit, attempting to determine the extent of efficiency
increase is difficult, but I believe it is obvious that such increases would
occur.

I'm just wanting to your pick your brain as to how such increased capital
efficiency might be integrated into exogenous growth models and how this
efficiency might ameliorate the effects of diminishing returns without using
endogenous growth models. This effect seems the most palatable and obvious
of the effects produced by the development of MI. Additionally, it might be
savory enough to the finance gods of the corporate world to overlook
whatever skepticism they might have of the feasibility of MI.

Let me state  the assumptions here:

1. The throat cancer rate in Amsterdam is unusually high (statistic).
2. Excessive use of a certain herb may be a causative agent in the
formation of throat cancer (statistical link).
3. Usage of the herb by natives is no higher in Amsterdam than in the
rest of Europe (assumed from statistic).
4. Usage of the herb by transients is higer than natives h in Amsterdam
(statistic).

And from this the conclusion was reached that the throat cancer rate is
caused by the transients (?)

I'm sure you can see the holes in that little argument :o)

This all sounds well modeled by a reduction in the price of computation,
without a new function which gives production in terms of inputs, 
including computation.  If so, my simple model already includes this.

I would say start looking for another causative agent, unless the cultivation
practices in Amsterdam are markedly different from elsewhere. Now, if even a
small but measurable percentage of growers that supply the Amsterdam market
used things like DDT, etc in cultivating the herb, then there would of course
be some sort of basis for the claim, but since the number of people using
herb is consistent with other locations, then I would not expect to see a
link with herb unless the herb there were different. As for transients, since
throat cancer isn't a condition which just pops up overnight, but requires
years of adverse behavior to create, then I would hardly expect to see
transients going to Amsterdam, smoking up, and coming down with throat tumors
in the course of a normal vacation.

Now, if Amsterdam had excellent cancer treatment facilities, and low cost
health care, most probably socialized, then I would expect to see people move
into the area in order to get quality health care treatment for no cost.
Having an asset like a skill in a special area tends to attract customers for
that service.

 Sorry Joe! Joe was the first negative experience that I've run into with
that technique. I've written him directly with more info on that technique
and its use both by me and the many patients I've used it on over the
years. ( Oh, by the way Spike, I'm not an MD, but I have worked in many
capacities in the health care field over the last thirty years, presently
I earn a buck by doing MRI scans).
Sarah Marr's    "Go wash your Alcor braclet" is the funniest thing that
I've read on the Net in a long time. Must be a truely awkened mind behind
that one.
There is a statue of  a "Laughing Buddha" by the cash register of my
favorite Asian restaurant. It never fails to remind me of the lack of such
a representation among the icons of other major religions. They all preach
joy, but a picture, or statue, in this case is worth far more that all
their stacks of dogma and pious attitudes.
  If I manage to achieve any significant personal longevity, wether it be
decades or eons, the time will be far more meaningful because of Zen.

Certainly a workable hypothesis for a study, assuming Amsterdam does
have superior health care facitities.

Another possibility is the cobined factors of  age and smoking  -
anecdotally, from what I remember when I used to live in Groningen (a
small city in the northern part of the Netherlands), almost every person
above the age of 40 seemed to smoke.  The period of time that one has
smoked tobacco and subsequent development of throat cancer are
highly correlated. As a result, I would expect older populations with a
history of tobacco use to have a higher incidence of throat cancer.

  IAN: I believe he must mean smoke tobacco. As the 
  statistics I cited indicated, 42.7% of Amsterdamers 
  smoked tobacco in the last week, which, lets face it, 
  means they are probably addicts, since very few smoke 
  tobacco now and then. That means just about half of 
  all the people you know, if you live in Amsterdam,
  smoke tobacco -- that's an amazingly high rate!

None other than the common sense fact that this statistic was only cited as
a 'might be the case', a 'for instance' to support the company's prospectus
of this thread's original 'brainwashing', 'propaganda' proposition; - a
point of view for which I'm sure there are many other examples that one
could throw into the pot of probabilities. Aside from the 1/3 probability
that a drug research $100m startup would write the scam into their
prospectus that Amsterdam's elephant's graveyard actually requested the drug
trial on humanitarian grounds then I have no reason to doubt what I read.
Actual hard copy of the prospectus would have to be dug up by a local in
Vancouver. I could identify the name but can't recall it.

I'd say that having less consensus on how to model endogenous growth may
mean there are more endogenous systems to choose to model from and large
numbers of actual adequate trials to take place instead of supression of
large numbers of models. Wouldn't a wider field be a better base to choose
from than continuing with the restricted exogenous growth model. More
challenging may be to allow the fittest model to continue to grow and in
reality cease to be a model and proving something or the other.

I'm not sure I follow you.  We're talking about what best models the 
world economy as a whole, not about models of competing entities where 
the fastest growing one will win out over the others.  My choice of
exogenous growth models is to provide more of a lower bound on growth
rates, not to give the closest model to reality.  In modeling, more realism
comes at the expense of more complexity, and complexity makes it harder 
to compare and evaluate models.  So one often prefers to examine simpler
models.

  IAN: I think that I raised a solid statistical case that 
  left your rumor-based case nonexistent. Kessell-Haak and 
  I also raised several reasonable questions to which your 
  only response is the inflammatory diatribe seen above. 
  It reminds me of your rants on the zero conspiracy.

"US Weight Guidelines: Is it Also Important to Consider Cardiorespiratory
Fitness"
International Journal of Obesity 22(Sup 2.): S2-S7 1998
Authors: CD Lee, AS Jackson and SN Blair

Abstract:

Background: The health consequences of weight ranges across low to moderate
and high levels of cardiorespiratory fitness are known.
Objective: To evaluate the validity of the 1995 US weight guidelines, while
considering cardiorespiratory fitness.
Methods: We followed 21,856 men, aged 30-83 y, who had a complete
preventive medical examination, including a maximal treadmill exercise test
and body composition assessment. There were 427 deaths (144 cardiovascular
disease (CVD); 143 cancer; 140 others) during an average of 8.1 y of
follow-up. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to examine the
relations among cardiorespiratory fitness, body mass index (BMI, kg/m2),
and all-cause and CVD mortality.
Results: After adjustment for age, examination year, cigarette smoking and
alcohol intake, we observed that men with a BMI of 19.0 to <25.0 and who
were unfit had 2.3 times the risk of all-cause mortality (95% confidence
interval (95% CI), 1.59-3.17, P<0.001) compared with fit men in this BMI
group (reference category). Unfit men with a BMI of 25.0 to <27.8 also had
a greater risk of all-cause mortality than unfit and normal weight men. Fit
men of normal weight had substantially higher CVD mortality than fit men in
each BMI group.
Conclusions: Unfit men had higher all-cause and CVD mortality than fit men.
The health benefits of normal weights appear to be limited to men who have
moderate or high levels of cardiorespiratory fitness. These data suggest
that the 1995 US weight guidelines may be misleading unless
cardiorespiratory fitness is taken into account.

Additional quote from text of the report:

  "In this study, we do not intend to minimize the risk of overweight, but
we do emphasize that increasing fitness may be more important than
maintaining healthy weights. It is well documented that higher levels of
physical fitness are associated with lower incidence of all-cause and CVD
mortality. It is also established that an increase in fitness improves CVD
risk factors and extends longevity. Thus we strongly recommend to public
health policy makers the importance of maintaining acceptible levels of
cardiorespiratory fitness.
  Although our findings are limited to Caucasian men in middle and upper
socioeconomic levels, this is the first study that presents data on
longevity for the US weight guidelines categories, combined with
cardiorespiratory fitness levels. Our data clearly show that greater
longevity in men meeting the normal weight criterion of the 1995 US weight
guidelines is limited to men who have moderate or high levels of
cardiorespiratory fitness. These data suggest that cardiorespiratory
fitness should be considered when defining body weight standards."

  (from Table 2)  Multivariate Relative Risk of Death
  BMI                  Fit        Unifit
19.0 - <25.0           1.0         2.25
25.0 - <27.8           0.96        1.68
>=27.8 (obese)         1.08        2.24

Additional comment from the poster:

  Which is the more important factor affecting mortality rates: fitness or
fatness?  It looks like fitness is all important, and how fat you are is
irrelevant. Data from other studies shows that dieters have an elevated
mortality rate, while for those who exercise it is lower. The medical
establishment's recommendations to lose weight in whose who are judged to
be overweight is thus shown to be misguided. Sloth, not fatness kills.
  As far as diet goes, a number of factors are associated with decreased
mortality rates. Increased fruit, vegetable, legume, grain fiber, fish, and
nut intake appear to reduce mortality, while greater (non-fish) meat intake
increases mortality. Research is ongoing to further clarify which fruits
and vegetables are associated with reduced morality rates. Artichokes,
garlic and tomatoes appear to be three stand-outs in this regard.

     --->   FBI AGENT ADMITS TWA 800 COVER-UP   <---

    In a tape-recorded debate between Reed Irvine and 
    James Kallstrom, who headed the FBI's TWA 800 crash 
    investigation, Kallstrom is reported to admit that 
    three ships tracked on radar near the crash "were 
    Navy ships on classified maneuvers." [1]

    The ships in question were within 3 to 6 miles of 
    the crash, in the very same area that triangulated
    witness accounts indicate to be the launch site of 
    the rocket that witnesses saw shoot down TWA 800.
    [2] The official story had been that the closest 
    Navy ship, the USS Normandy, was 185 miles away.

 IAN: The Freeman is put out by the Foundation for 
 Economic Education (http://www.fee.org). The Freeman
 was what, in addition to books by Henry Hazlitt and 
 Ludwig von Mises, turned me into a Libertarian. 
 I cannot think of a better publication.

Title
  Glutamine suppresses PGE2 synthesis and breast cancer
  growth.
Source
  Journal of Surgical Research.  63(1):293-7, 1996 Jun.
Abstract
  Reduced natural killer (NK) activity found in tumor-bearing hosts has been
  associated with high levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) produced by monocytes
  in vitro. We have previously demonstrated a dependence of NK cell activity on
  glutamine (GLN) levels in vitro and in vivo. Further,
  glutathione (GSH) is antagonistic to PGE2 synthesis. We
  hypothesized that GLN, through increased GSH production, leads to decreased
  PGE2 synthesis and upregulation of NK cytotoxic activity. To test this, we
  examined the effects of oral GLN on GSH and PGE2 concentrations, NK activity
  and tumor growth in a rat breast cancer model. Starting on the day of MTF-7
  tumor implantation 18 Fisher 344 rats were pair-fed chow and gavaged with 1
  g/kg/day GLN (n = 9) or an isonitrogenous amount of Freamine (FA) (n = 9).
  Seven weeks after tumor implantation rats were sacrificed. Tumors were
  measured, weighed, and processed for tumor morphometrics. Spleens were
  removed, lymphocytes isolated and assayed for NK activity. Blood GLN, GSH,
  and PGE2 concentrations were measured. Over the 7-week study period tumor
  growth was decreased by approximately 40% in the GLN-supplemented group. This
  decrease in growth was associated with a 2.5 fold greater NK activity in the
  GLN-fed rats vs FA-fed rats. This correlated with a 25% rise in GSH
  concentration and a proportional decrease in PGE2 synthesis. Decreased tumor
  volume in rats fed GLN was not associated with changes in morphometrics. Oral
  GLN supplementation enhances NK activity resulting in decreased tumor growth.
  The enhanced NK activity seen with oral GLN supplementation in the
  tumor-bearing host is associated with GSH mediated suppression of PGE2
  synthesis.

Title
  Vigorous supplementation of a hypocaloric diet prevents cardiac arrhythmias
  and mineral depletion.
Source
  American Journal of Medicine.  74(6):1016-22, 1983 Jun.
Abstract
  We have previously demonstrated that a hypocaloric, nutritionally deficient,
  liquid protein diet is associated with potentially life-threatening cardiac
  arrhythmias, which increased in frequency and complexity over the duration of
  the study. The present investigation was designed to evaluate the metabolic
  and cardiac changes associated with a hypocaloric, but otherwise
  nutritionally complete, diet. Six healthy, obese females from 154 to 182
  percent of ideal body weight were evaluated in a metabolic ward for 48 days.
  The subjects ingested a weight maintenance diet during an eight-day period,
  which was followed by 40 days of an experimental diet containing 472 kcal of
  a mixture of protein (60 percent of calories), carbohydrate (25 percent), and
  fat (15 percent). This diet equaled or exceeded the recommended daily
  allowances for minerals, trace elements, vitamins, and
  essential fatty acids. The subjects were monitored for balances of nitrogen
  and minerals, as well as for the appearance of cardiac
  arrhythmias by 24-hour electrocardiographic recordings. Nitrogen balance was
  positive, and the previously demonstrated negative balances for potassium,
  sodium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus were either reversed or markedly
  decreased. In contrast to our previous study, no arrhythmias were observed in
  subjects ingesting the present experimental diet, and no significant change
  in cardiac rhythm was found in 13 obese, but otherwise healthy, outpatients.
  The data, based on a limited number of subjects, suggest that a hypocaloric
  diet vigorously supplemented with essential elements, micronutrients, and
  vitamins appears to be safer than the once popular, incomplete liquid protein
  preparation.

Title
  Increased plasma bicarbonate and growth hormone after an oral
  glutamine load.
Source
  American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.  61(5):1058-61, 1995 May.
Abstract
  An oral glutamine load was administered to nine healthy
  subjects to determine the effect on plasma glutamine,
  bicarbonate, and circulating growth hormone concentrations. Two grams
  glutamine were dissolved in a cola drink and ingested over a
  20-min period 45 min after a light breakfast. Forearm venous blood samples
  were obtained at zero time and at 30-min intervals for 90 min and compared
  with time controls obtained 1 wk earlier. Eight of nine subjects responded to
  the oral glutamine load with an increase in plasma
  glutamine at 30 and 60 min before returning to the control
  value at 90 min. Ninety minutes after the glutamine
  administration load both plasma bicarbonate concentration and circulating
  plasma growth hormone concentration were elevated. These findings demonstrate
  that a surprisingly small oral glutamine load is capable of
  elevating alkaline reserves as well as plasma growth hormone.

Title
  Skin cancer chemoprevention. [Review] [68 refs]
Source
  Journal of Investigative Dermatology Symposium Proceeding.  1(2):209-14, 1996
  Apr.
Abstract
  Chemoprevention of cancer is a means of cancer control in which the
  occurrence of this disease, as a consequence of exposure to carcinogenic
  agents, can be entirely prevented, slowed, or reversed by the administration
  of one or several naturally occurring or synthetic agents. Thus, the
  chemoprevention of cancer differs from therapy in that the goal of prevention
  is to lower the rate of cancer incidence. Such chemopreventive agents are
  also known as anticarcinogens, and an ideal agent should have (i) little or
  no untoward or toxic effects, (ii) high efficacy against multiple sites,
  (iii) capability of oral administration, (iv) a known mechanism of action,
  (v) low cost, and (vi) human acceptance. With regard to naturally occurring
  agents, fruits, vegetables, and common beverages, as well as several herbs
  and plants, have been identified as rich sources of cancer chemopreventive
  agents. While a wide range of laboratory studies has identified many
  compounds, including several polyphenols, as cancer chemopreventive agents,
  in this article our main emphasis is on the cancer chemopreventive potential
  of a polyphenolic fraction isolated from green tea and silymarin, a flavonoid
  present in artichoke, against different stages of mouse skin
  multistage carcinogenesis. We also highlight studies related to retinoid
  effects on prevention of human skin cancers. [References: 68]

I attempted to send a message to the Extropy mailing list about a new 
book I read. To my surprise the message was never distributed on the 
list. Instead, I received my email back from my mail server with this 
header:

<extropians@extropy.com>:Connected to 207.228.101.114 but sender was 
rejected.
Remote host said: 550 <extrogod@hotmail.com>... You are not welcome 
here.

What did I do to deserve this draconian measure? On October 1st, I made 
a post in response to Michael Lorrey's "anti-spam strategy" post that 
did not violate any of the list's guidelines. But yet I'm blocked from 
posting to the list under my normal email address.

Maybe this is a backlash from my earlier posts in August where I exposed 
Max More as being hypocritical with his personal attacks towards me. I 
also identified that posts of Erik Moeller's had been deleted from the 
archive, a fact confirmed by other members, however, immediately after 
my post the archive 'mysteriously disappeared' and when it returned a 
day later, Erik's posts were back. When you sport a view that conflicts 
with Max More's point-of-view, prepared to be censored or at least 
driven from the list (for example, Erik Moeller).

What about Nicholas Bostrom? He posted to this list and said "I have 
evidence indicating that the rumor about the censored post was started 
by someone who is explicitly out there to harm the ExI. I can't disclose 
this evidence since it was confided to me in a private email. But let's 
all simply ignore this rumor." This turned out to be a false statement. 
No apologies were made to me. Nicholas Bostrom continues to be allowed 
to post to this list. His outright lie and slander of me was far more 
serious than my lack of tact in phrasing my comments. Where is the 
objective rational approach in this case?

Ironically, Max More makes a post today about a free society publication 
yet he supports the subjective and biased censorship of a list member! 
What is worse, I am a paying member of the Extropy Institute!

I am beginning to think Erik Moeller was right. Transhumanism is a noble 
movement with many bright minds. But the Extropy Institute is a biased 
cultish institution that squashes anyone who disagrees publically with 
its leader, Max More.

Hmmmmm if your being censored it's funny that this post got
through... by the way the error you received wasn't from the
Extropy server:

Don't know who extrogod is but it was from hotmail.com, not
extropy.com.

Did you try sending as extrogod?

I have been a member of the Institute for a couple of years now and
am unaware of anyone being blocked. Max's standard policy is to
ignore posts of this nature.

I would guess there was a simple error in sending.

It's Friday, try decaf. ;)

Anyone have an URL to a medical diagnostic expert system?  I'd like
something where I could plug in an array of symptoms and get out a set of
provisional diagnoses, perhaps with associated probabilities.

Homing pigeons, actually.  In one of the odder natural events on the East
Coast of the United States, 75% of nearly 3000 homing pigeons became
completely lost during a competitive race this past week in the Washington
area.  This is an astonishing percentage of loss for the creatures.  They
have been flying around for days, into a state of complete exhaustion, and
landing in people's yards.

Although the mechanism by which homing pigeons operate is not completely
understood, this incident may eventually yield a key to understanding it,
and maybe utilizing it in some way.  Sunspot activity can confuse a homing
pigeon, but there was no sunspot activity this week.  The prevailing theory
is that this area has become an intensive cellphone region, and that the
increase in use of cellphones is somehow interfering with the birds' homing
mechanisms.  Most races have been held on the weekend, when cellphone
activity is low, but this particular race was held during the weekday, when
cellphone activity is high.

I have a feeling that one of the last noble acts of nation states will
be to purchase these [commercial] items off-the-shelf (including all 
patents and copyrights) and make them available for "free" to the 
citizens (it is *their* money, after all).  This would extend to the 
whole body knowledge, including digitized versions of all media 
properties.

Distributing this stuff is another matter.  Cascades of solid state
proxies are needed, along with flat panel displays, and a local fiber 
infrastructure capable of handling the bandwidth required for all the 
video clips (e.g., an avatar of compatible language, vocabulary, and 
personality saying, "here's how you do (x)").

The importance of the multicasting (and realtime archiving) of high 
quality video can't be overstated.  The system will need to be 
extremely responsive.

A extremely useful activity for the citizens then will be to 
translate all these video clips into the optimal form for the 
individual self-healer.  Different people respond to different 
presentations of the same material.

Rather than trying to synthesize all these various presentation 
forms, a more efficient approach will be create a convenient 
automated system for acquiring and archiving the data.

In terms of opportunties for activity, a knowledge worker could 
access small chunks of content (e.g., a sentence at a time), then 
paraphrase or rephrase that information back into the system, to give 
the archive the diversity of styles reflected in society.

Rather than attempting to synthesize avatars, it's probably more 
useful on a social level to simply record real people being honest, 
particularly in the context of performing helpful actions.

I've always wanted to have books read to me, not by computers, but by 
people.  Imagine the same book, read aloud by a thousand different 
people, in a thousand different voices and styles. 

It will be wonderful to be able to walk around freely while absorbing 
knowledge.  In my case, it's very difficult for me to "sit still" 
while reading.  This would do much to improve my education, since my 
eyes need to move spontaneously while storing and accessing memories. 
 When I'm listening, my eyes are moving all over the place.  When I'm 
reading, they're paralyzed by the linearity of writing.

In terms of where to put the money, manufacturing facilities for RAM, 
optical fiber, and flat panel displays would be a better investment, 
in the long run, than into obsolete institutions like the FDA, DOE, 
FCC, DEA, and others.  A broadband internet obviously eliminates the 
need for these agencies, since self-representation is made possible.

By the way, about that URL...;

I don't think I could ever recommend just one book . . . I've thought about it
since this thread started and simply can't accept the premise -- even though
the exercise is useful.  I agree that Hofstadter's _Goedel, Escher, Bach_
comes close to meeting this standard, though.  I DO have "most recommended"
books, though.  Over time GEB is on this short list, as is Persig's _Zen and
the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_ and Howard Buss' _The Evolution of Desire_.
Recently, I've been pushing Steven Pinker's _How the Mind Works_ pretty
strongly.

BTW, I keep an annotated bibliography of every book I read (how obsessive!) on
the web at:

This point is made very well in the book I'm currently reading, "Why People
Believe Weird Things" by Michael Shermer (one of the founders of Skeptic
magazine).  Pseudoscience advocates often make the argument that "they laughed
at Galileo" as some kind of support for whatever brand of BS they happen to be
peddling.  Shermer does a good job of showing how this rhetorical device has
zero logical value.

WTA Update 2
10 October 1998


Dear member,

A number of positive things have happened since the last update.

The TransVision98 conference, which was organized by the Dutch group
Transcedo, was a great success. Much of the discussion focused on
practical issues and on what Europe has to contribute to
transhumanism. There was a general sense that the people attending
were witnessing the beginning of something important. It was decided
that there should be a follow-up -- TransVision99 -- which will be
held in Stockholm next year, June 4-6, and will be organized by the
group Aleph. More information will be available closer to the event at
http://www.transhumanism.com/events.htm.

A new group in Germany is under the process of formation (preliminary
name "De:Trans"). Having tweaked their constitution and having planned
everything very carefully (they are Germans after all ;-), they now
seem close to being able to launch it. This will be a very welcomed
reinforcement of transhumanism in Europe. What country is next in
turn?

The Journal of Transhumanism has published its second paper, "Is a
singularity just around the corner? -What it takes to get explosive
economic growth", by Robin Hanson. We are also glad to announce that
Hal Finney has joined the editorial board.

Work has commenced on the production of a Transhumanist Reader (eds.
Thom Quinn and Nick Bostrom), which will contain a selection of
central transhumanist texts and will be aimed at an
academic/well-educated audience and preferably be published by a major
university press. (See http://www.transhumanist.com/call.htm for more
details.)

The last update said that the WTA needed to enter a growth phase. That
objective has been achieved; the current membership is now 275
(compared to 120 on May 29). Thanks! to all who have contributed to
this, whether by telling your friends, putting up a link from your web
site or by some other means. Let's do our best to keep it up or even
increase the expansion rate.

The next phase will now be to prepare and position ourselves for the
outreach. We want to reach a point where we are ready to begin to
effectively put our transhumanist views across both in (1) the media
(other than the net) and (2) in the academic/scientific community.

(1) Kathryn Aegis is setting up a Transhumanist Media Advocacy Network
(TMAN), which will fascilitate media communications for transhumanist
organizations and individuals. If you have professional media
experience and want to get involved in this, you should contact
Kathryn at <aegis@igc.apc.org>. An FAQ is also being developed, to
deal with the most commonly asked questions about and objections
against transhumanism. A lot of people have already contributed loads
of valuable ideas for the FAQ. It is currently in the writing-up
stage. When a tentative first draft is ready, we'll all be able to
comment on it before it is finalized.

(2) The Reader will hopefully contribute to the second objective. But
also: all you academics and scientists out there, it is through your
mediation that transhumanism will be receiving more attention from
your peers. The Battle for Minds, it is said, is won in the coffee
rooms. Just mentioning the word "transhumanism" often enough can
probably do a lot of good. Also desirable would be increased
interaction with related professional organizations such as the
Foresight Institute. Those of us who have contacts within such
organizations can make a contribution here.

If we do our job well now, then by the time of the third or fourth
Update, we may be in a position to begin to have a much greater
impact. Transhumanism needs to become utterly mainstream.


Thanks again to everybody who have contributed. Onward!

This is really more formal a name than I wish.

The "Southeast Cryonics Conference" conveys more formality than what I have
in 
mind. But I would like would like to meet with people in Florida and Georgia, 
etc., who share my interest in cryonics and technology.

How about Southeast Cryonics "Gathering"?

I have been thinking that perhaps an ORLANDO, FL based meeting, on a Friday 
night and Saturday day. 

This could be a fun and educational time, and be a good excuse to visit 
Orlando, which is one of the great recreational centers of the world.
I have e-mailed directly some folks obtained from the ALCOR membership 
handbook, and I am making this post on CRYONET.

One of the things I would like to accomplish at this meeting is to move 
forward on my "LIFEPACT" relationships. Another is to make the recommended 
video tape identifying what circumstances you wish re: possible reanimation. 
I do not currently own a video camera...perhaps someone out there coming to 
the gathering may such a high tech device. :)

I remain excited about the possibilities of extended life. I am hoping that 
freezing will be unnecessary, and that life extending and enhancing 
technologies will come online at reasonable and obtainable costs.

Perhaps a "bigwig" in cryonics/life extension may be interested in attending. 
Someone like Max More, Tom Donaldson, Brian Shock, Bob Ettinger, Saul Kent, 
Fred or Linda Chamberlain, Steve Bridge, etc., would be a welcome "Draw" and 
could "headline" the gathering. 

I was on the Extropian BB, and no longer am due to time restrictions. But if 
someone can forward this post or provide the email address, I would
appreciate 
this.

DATE: How does December 11 and 12 sound? This is a Friday and Saturday. 
LOCATION: The Orlando Hilton. this is a good facility with breakout rooms, 
gathering places, and reasonable room rates. I just returned from a Star Trek 
Convention there this last weekend. Room rate was only $65 plus tax, (this 
may have been a special...there were perhaps 500 in attendance. We could hope 
for a fraction of this number). 

(PS...I now know why ALCOR quit recruiting at sci-fi conventions...these fun- 
loving airheads have a different orientation than the science/ computer 
oriented demographic that typifies the cryonics prospect.)

AGENDA: To Be Announced. I will develop an agenda based on responses 
received to this posting. While not knowledgeable enough to "headline" this 
gathering, I *will* commit to being the organizer and promulgator. 
Is there any interest in this GATHERING? 

I will proceed only with some positive feedback from people who think this is 
a good idea. If there is only a few of us it could still be worthwhile. 


Boundless, Joyous Life, 
Rudi Hoffman 
Daytona Beach, FL

greg i checked it out.  chilling indeed.  perhaps we should contact this
group and invite them to exterminate all genetically altered crops
in the states.  they might wish to invite a couple million of their
compatriots, start on the east coast and pull up pretty much every
commercially viable crop they see, for nearly all have been bred or
genetically altered in some way from their wild ancestors.  better
slaughter all the farm animals too, just to be safe.  its their revenge
for the boston tea party.  point out how grateful we all will be in their
ideal vision: a food-free world.

i checked out your website.  wow!  its a work of art.  extremely
well done.  may i link my upcoming site to it?  spike

The site is a socialist labour site and, from what I see, they want social
decisions not based on any corporation's need to recuperate costs. While they
don't understand how money is the problem they get involved in activism. Likewise
Mon$anto should realize what the problem is and preempt their critics by
developing a decentralised neural (net) economy. Alas, neither side can spare the
time.

Sorry for the wasteful post here, but I've exhausted
my methods of search and am still looking for more information
on what is required to create self-replicating biological and
mechanical (and combo) devices..  Any URLs, Books, contacts,
phone #'s, or anything would be appreciated.

	I'm also wondering if anyone has any experience in
designing full microprocessors (ie: x86 processors, RISC
chips, or other similar large-scale devices).  I'm wondering
what kind of educational background was required to get to
that stage, and what I need to do to either find out or go
down that path.  

	Would appreciate any and all replies.

	Will we EVER advance to the stage where EVERYONE can be more
open and realize what is important and what isn't?.  or will there
always be so much lag between those who are "thought advanced" 
(ie: an extropian) and someone who is "thought reversed" (ie: extreme
right wing christian) always be present?...

	hell, if you're going to uproot that Genetically Engineered
plant, mail it to me, I'll replant it.. :-)

How about this? Not meddling in people's "emotions". Could such an approach
be fruitful in your estimation, both in terms of allowing you to be less judgmental
and more in tune with your own feelings?

I once suffered from Clinical Depression as a teenager. The extent
of suffering brought on by this illness cannot be overstated. The condition
was diagnosed at an advanced stage and medicine did very little good in
alleviating the symptoms (hopelessness, despair, feeling like my limbs were
so heavy I couldn't even move, utter ennui and the sense that time was
standing still...). Gradually, I burnt it out of my system, but with it I think
I lost something. Like the other side of the coin, "happiness", if you can
understand that...

Do you assert that you "are" or can relate to "non-philosophers", whatever
those may "be"?

When did this become a semantics discussion? Those who dictate
the meaning of words, then try to dictate the connotations and how people should
react to those words and ideas, seem to me to resemble those described as
"dictators" in a more general sense. Reverberations of George Orwell, "I'd
rather have rats eat my face than be conditioned to believe that 2+2=5."

Markets are a form of technology, and the term greatly corresponds to the
"system" we have today. I don't think you really take the idea of "moneyless
resource allocation system" seriously. You certainly do anything but show 
openness to the idea. Perhaps you prefer the continued plunder and 
exhaustion of humankind before the God Work and Money? That doesn't 
sound too inspiring for "man fulfilling his fullest potential"; much of the
"success" we see today comes at the expense of others, and the exploitation 
and reinforcing of the LOWEST common denominator.

When machines do 90% of the work in
producing goods for consumption, doesn't it seem illogical to suggest man's
continued dependence on work for consumption privileges? (not to mention
suicidal?) 90% automation SHOULD equal 90% reduction in price of goods,
thus achieving the ABUNDANCE which we could so easily achieve. But the
"market" is OUT OF WHACK, and people conditioned to dependence on
this "technology" would NEVER be willing to give goods
away for free, i.e. within the context of a "moneyless resource allocation
system". Why? Because someone is assumed to "own" those machines and
resources, thus gaining the "right" to dictate who can have the fruits off 
the price system's forbidden tree. By the practice of PRICE-RATIONING,
"normal" people - the +80% whose incomes have been stagnant or declining 
for the past 25 years - can't "afford" the good life we are afforded by
technology, so THEY exist on a banker's/investor's treadmill, which the
elite accelerate on an hourly basis.

In other words, "how could *I* be wrong? The great god More has spoken,
CAPITALISM IS IDEAL." Sorry, YOUR principles aren't open or flexible in
any sense. There's no such thing as an "Extropian". That's just a word you
made up to feel superior to everyone else.

Favoring? No, that's too STRONG a word. "Perhaps, contrary to MY current
understanding, some kind of centralized allocation system will one day be
better than markets. I doubt it, but if so, *I* will revise the PRINCIPLES then!"
Translation: don't mess with my dogma.

As was the case with Ayn Rand, you suffer the delusion of thinking your
pronouncements are absolute and unassailable. Many have aided in
toppling Rand's views on "Reason" and "Rationality", but you must not
have been paying attention, since you still put so much stock in those
empty ideas.

The idea of markets definitely describes a technology, slightly more 
particular than vacuous noises like "reason", "knowledge", "optimism", and
"psychology". That technology DEPENDS on "price", which you refuse
to associate with the money system in general. Without "price", there
is no market. (we'll gladly do without adjectives like "free" being applied,
since the market is a coercive mechanism in both a positive and negative
sense, often to the extreme detriment and peril of human organisms).

Well, the Dr. has spoken. But let's ask ANY economist if the term "free market"
is compatible with the term "moneyless resource allocation system". Then we'll
see how much substance there is behind his open-minded posturing. It's easy
to be open to an abstract idea like "moneyless", but how about "PRICELESS"?
That gets us to the very heart of the matter, I think.

Regardless of your present career or position, I have something                        NT
that can LIGHT YOUR FIRE and help you achieve the income,
wealth, and life style that you so richly deserve.

Hello, 

My name is Michael and I was a practicing physician for
many years, before I retired to do this! Now I enjoy a life
of unparalled freedom with my family and associates, never
worried or fearful of POVERTY or rejection!

Through this UNIQUE business venture that a friend shared 
with me two years ago, I have learned the secrets of success,
and I am willing to do the same with a limited number of achievers.

This is NOT MLM or network marketing. You can work from home
OR office. Most of my associates are earning $1,000 - $5,000 per
week in less than 30 days! Some have earned over $100,000 in 
one month! 

The greatest mistake I have found to achieving wealth is not
having the blueprint or plans to get there. People need a TURNKEY
MASTERMARKETING SYSTEM that takes all the guess work out
of success.

Your participation into our business venture is by invitation only.
At the very least, you must be 18 years of age and have the ability
to make a moderate ONE TIME investment into starting your own company.

Either myself or one of my associates will get back to you within 48 hours.
I look forward to our conversation and wish you and your loved ones the very best.

Regards,

Dr. Michael

Dear all,

In the spirit of the new moderators request to use this forum to build the
objectivist community I would like to announce the establishment of a new
Objectivist Discussion Group. This is to be established in Wellington, New
Zealand.

At this stage we are just getting names together and hope to begin meeting
early next month. We have little direction as yet other than getting names
of interested parties together, meeting, talking and defining a direction
that meets everyone's needs.

All those interested please drop me a line.

The big question with a self-replicating device is, what are the
raw materials it is allowed to use?

At one extreme, you could require that it be set down on an asteroid,
which may or may not have differentiated ores and such, and using
only sunlight for power, set out to identify elements, refine them,
and build copies of itself.

At another extreme, you can provide it with raw materials in already
processed form: computer chips, motors, structural elements.  It needs
to build a copy of itself from these pieces.  There has been some
discussion of trying to build a robot from Lego pieces which could
build more copies of itself given piles of sorted Legos (including
motor and computer Legos).

Trying to create silicon based integrated circuits is going to require
a huge infrastructure.  You might want to consider other alternatives
for the basic technologies that the selfrep system will need, fundamental
characteristics like motion and control systems.

Instead of silicon chips, consider older technologies like electronic
relays, or even mechanical punched-card or punched-tape systems.  It
would be great if you could avoid electricity altogether, so that you
don't have to create batteries, wires, etc.  But you need some kind of
power source.

An interesting possibility would be to use fluidics, a mechanical
analog of electronics based on fluid flow.  When I was in college we
did a lab where we built the equivalent of several kinds of electronic
ciruits using fluidic equipment.  You could make oscillators, flip flops,
etc., using nothing more than tubing and some special "fluidic transistors".
These are purely mechanical devices which use the Coanda effect to allow
a small fluid flow to control a much larger flow.

Do a dejanews search on sci.nanotech for a post called "Partial design
for macro-scale machining self-replicator" where there is a proposal
for a fluidic, punched-tape based self-replicator built from a fluid
which self-cures to plastic under ultraviolet light.  There are a lot
of problems to be solved but it sounds easier than trying to build a
chip fabrication factory.

(BTW, I did a web search on the Coanda effect, and for some reason
the whole topic has become associated with pseudoscience, from UFOs
to anomolous water to cleansing auras.  Apparently Coanda was quite
a character.  Here's a page on what appears to be a quack approach to
life extension through modified water, based supposedly on some claims
by Coanda himself.  It also mentions pre-extropian G. Harry Stine.

  IAN: That's just a personal attack that employs 
  demeaning personal attributes to counter what any 
  can see is a reasonable, nondictatorial analysis.

  As I see it, there is a point at which a theory 
  is proven to be truth, and it seems to me that 
  we have long since passed that point with re- 
  spect to the theory that central planning is 
  contra-indicated for social-service provision.

Subject:Forthcoming Books

The new issue of IMPACT, newsletter of the Ayn Rand Institute, mentions the
December release of two new books:  THE AYN RAND READER, edited by Gary Hull
and Leonard Peikoff and RETURN OF THE PRIMITIVE:  THE ANTI-INDUSTRIAL
REVOLUTION, edited by Peter Schwartz.  The first book will include
selections from Rand's fiction and non-fiction and is designed as an
introductory text for literature and philosophy courses.  The second book is
an expanded version of THE NEW LEFT, originally published in 1971.  This
version includes, apparently, three new essays by Schwartz on feminism,
environmentalism, and multiculturalism.

I have an essay coming out in the newest issue of REASON PAPERS, "A
Renaissance in Rand Scholarship," which surveys many other books in the
growing Rand market.

I read that book as a result of an earlier recommendation by Greg, 
and I concur - it's makes a very nice reading. Thanks!

If I had to pick just one book, I think I might choose The Engines of

I find this paragraph far more sincere than the remainder of your post

readible point.  What you lost might be on the other side of this.

Who says clinical depression is bad, anyway?  Negative thinking is inherently
more powerful than positive thinking, despite the silly fad in
willpower-worship.  The response sets of unhappiness evolved to handle tougher
problems; the analytic abilities that deal with failure are considerably more
powerful than the skill-formation abilities evoked by success.  Whatever price
chronic depression exacts, it's more than worth it.

I speak from experience, of course.

Speaking from experience I can say that the exact opposite is true;
depression leads to nothing, while happiness and success go hand
in hand. I guess we humans are a very divers species...

Personally, I tend to agree with both of you. Clinical depression can be a
debilitating mental disorder, sapping one's mental strength, actively
preventing you from achieving your goals.  Simple depression, on the
other hand, can be used in a positive sense to kick-start one's life into
another, more rewarding, direction.

I never saw the term "centralized allocation system" in Max's Principles 3.0 but I did
read the term "moneyless allocation system". The terms aren't the same and to make them
so is provocative. Even the U.S. military realize their forth coming omnisensorial data
fusion systems offer no hope of "centralized planning". A neural (net) economy isn't a
centralized system and yet can't be called a money system either, so any
non-inflamatory discussion about allocation systems needs to include this new 21st
century feature.

That or its younger stalemate would also be the "only" book one would be
able to take anywhere to convince others of the feasibility of mind
uploading. When that's done however be sure to get access to the likes of

Indeed, I did not use the term "centralized allocation system" in the
Principles 3.0. I mentioned that in a commentary here on the list. Thanks
to the perceptive comments I received on the first draft, I have been
thinking hard about just what the Principles should say about
social/economic orders. I do want them to clearly stand against any
centralized, authoritarian system that disallows experimentation. A
Stalinist transhumanism is *not* compatible with the Extropian Principles.

Although I do believe that markets in some form or another are usually the
best way of organizing things today and probably for quite a while to come,
I no longer want to make that an essential part of the principles. For
instance, I certainly want the Principles to be compatible with J. Maxwell
Legg's proposed system. A moneyless allocation system, if it could be made
to work, would be perfectly compatible. Any other changes in the economic
order that preserve freedom, experimentation, and improvement are compatible. 

Although some people (not you, Maxwell) seem intent on portraying me as a
defender of today's institutions despite what I have written, I have no
problem with finding a way to free people from dependence on working for
others. I think far more people could do this *now*, not in some
theoretical future, if they restricted consumption and invested until they
could live off investment income. After that, you're free to take or refuse
any work without worrying about paying the bills.

These considerations have led me to drop "Spontaneous Orders" and any talk
of markets as fundamental. I am currently working on replacing this
principle with one called "Open Society". I will be posting it for comment
once I complete a draft. Maxwell, I will be particularly interested in your
comments on this replacement principle. I think you'll find it completely
compatible with your goals.

Onward!

Discussion has begun about the organization and format for EXTRO4, the next 
general gathering of transhumanists to be sponsored by Extropy Institute. 
We'd like to get input from as many sources as possible in the early planning 
stages. The following is a list of topics for discussion in this process, and 
some thoughts that have already been discussed off-list on those topics:

FORMAT
Based on feedback we've gotten on last year's EXTRO3, the leading idea so far 
for the format for EXTRO4 is a more open-ended, spontaneous gathering, with 
more unstructured time and opportunities for brainstorming and networking. 
We're considering definition of a small group (no more than three or four) of 
subject matter areas. "Central" talks and/or panel presentations and 
discussions in these areas would be one aspect of the gathering, with 
associated smaller discussion groups and "sub-presentations" taking place to 
compliment the central events.

To ease the burden of organizing the conference, we're looking for
individuals 
or small groups to work largely on their own, but with assistance from the 
conference Chair to develop material for the separate subject matter areas. 
People with specialized knowledge, contacts or interests connected to these 
subject matter areas will work together within a fairly loose over-all 
organizational framework to develop content for these separate areas.

SUBJECT MATTER
Initial discussions I've had have centered on the following areas:

(1) The Business of the Future. (Start-ups, investing in technology, 
business opportunities.) 
(2) 21st Century Social Orders. (Covering economics, law, and politics.) 
(3) Memetic Dissemination/Marketing Transhumanism. (How to communicate more 
effectively, tackle common objections in particular areas.) 
(4) Practical Life Extension. (Presentations on the most effective means of 
extending life today and maybe current research, including the latest on 
cryopreservation.)

PLACE
Many people have expressed a preference for Northern California. Another 
preference is somewhere in the Rocky Mountains or desert West, as potentially 
easier (and less expensive) to reach for folks who aren't based on the West 
Coast.

TIME
August, 1997 worked well for EXTRO3 and August, 1999 is our current 
working assumption for a general time-frame. It is important that we get 
feedback on good weekends early on, so please let us know as soon 
as possible what times 

are good and bad for you. In particular we'd like to know about competing 
events that could create scheduling conflicts.

It's important that we decide on place and time for the gathering before the 
end of the year so that we can start negotiating for a conference venue and 
begin publicizing the event, so I would appreciate feedback on this as a
first 
priority.

Thank you, 
Greg Burch and Max More.

Please send your feedback either to the list for discussion, or to 
conference Chair Max More at <more@extropy.org>

In order to fit into a neural (net) economy would the term "Open Survey Society"
be useful?

P.S. there was an "oops" in my last post on the "If only one book" thread. I
meant "stablemate" but my spell checker turned it into a "stalemate".

From: Lance Chambers <lchambers@transport.wa.gov.au>

My name is Lance Chambers and I am the editor of a number of books (3)
in the area of Genetic Algorithms for CRC Press (a well respected
academic publisher - check your university library and you will find
lots of books by CRC Press).

The task I am interested in undertaking now is the development of a book
on 'Simulation in Social Systems'. I have approached a wide number of
newsgroups to ensure that the authorship covers wide areas of expertise.

If you are interested in developing a contribution, or have something
ready that you feel may be right for a work of this nature then please
drop me a line. The book is aimed at the university market, chapters
should be aimed at well educated persons who have an interest in using
various techniques and approaches to simulation of social systems (not
just human systems but biological, marine, insect, financial, economic,
memes, environmental, viral, biological, the law, transport, trade,
etc.) and your contributions should address these interests.

Regards, Lance Chambers.

I'm not clear what "Survey" would add. However you mean the term, including
it presumably would only restrict the extension of the principle. Also,
stylistically, every principle consists of two words...

there are a lot of different mental conditions that are grouped together
under the name clinical depression.  seems to me it can be either
positive or negative.   i decided, during a case of clinical depression
at age 20, to deeply investigate my fundamentalist christian belief
system.  this lasted for a number of months, at the end of which
i decided the system was false, and all religion is essentially false,
that science was way, the path to truth and enlightenment.

I don't know of anything like this online, but I am currently

Those interested in learning more about gene research and molecular
biology might be interested.

Exons, Introns, and Talking genes: The science of the Human Genome
Project  by Christopher Wills ISBN 0-465-02168-9

>From the preface by the author:

" Please, If you only have a glancing acquaintance with genetics or
none at all, please start at the beginning and follow patiently
along. I have designed this book to introduce you step by step to
the amazing world of molecules and genes, while doing my best not
to bore readers who know a fair amount already. By the end you will
be quite comfortable with such esoterica as gene mapping, RFLPs and
introns."

The books opens with a scenario where a genetic neurosurgeon is
trying to repair the damage to a crack addicted mothers infant. 


It will warm your extropian hearts.

I have to weigh in here.

Even those with mild levels of depression experience lower levels
of self-efficacy.  They tend to underestimate their capacity for problem
solving in the future as well as their past performance. Their problem
solving abilities are rarely superior to those who are not depressed.
More severe levels of depression have been shown to actually disrupt
and distort normal cognitive processes, sapping mental energy.  I'm
surprised Spike had the energy to "deeply investigate" her fundamentalist
background (glad ya did tho).  Deeply depressed people don't really
want to do much of anything.  As for Mary Therise Gleason, if you
have gone from feeling depressed to feeling nothing, then it's possible
you have nor fully recovered.

Best wishes,

Scott Badger

I would like to express the general preference that it would be great
if the conference were temporally (and ideally spatially) located 
near another conference of transhumanist interest. Especially for 
people who come from oversea, that would be a way of increasing the 
payoff for making the long journey. I'm thinking of things like a 
Foresight Conference, the World Future Society Assembly (which 
is Jul29-Aug 1, Washington) or something like that.

Once in awhile, I awaken with a disoriented sense that things have changed
for no reason and very quickly.

Practically 24 hours ago, gay men were hunted down with impunity in my
adoptive country.  Lesbians were slaughtered on the street and on the hiking
trails.  Police ignored pleas for help, the victims could hardly get
treatment in the local hospital.  Today, a national outcry over Matthew
Shepards awful death.  Demands in Congress for new hate crimes legislation.
Parents trolling the internet for information on local statutes so they can
confront the school boards.  My head is spinning!  What made this death
different?  Does anyone know?

scott, i certainly agree that an episode of depression saps ones mental
energy.  during my investigation, that was the *only* thing i could
do.  i was in a physics seminar, watching a video tape of carl sagan's
excellent "cosmos" series.  i was enjoying the show, life was good,
etc, then suddenly: that short blurb about evolution.  it may serve as
a sad commentary on the condition of the u.s. education system that i managed
to go thru 14 years of it, including 2 biology classes, and had *never*
heard, there or elsewhere, a decent explanation of the theory of
evolution.  sagans five minute presentation hit me like a bolt of lightning
on a clear day.

ignoring my engineering studies, i immersed myself in the task of investigating

the idea.  i made a poor showing on the finals two weeks later, but the
real problem started the next quarter.  i was so focussed on that issue,
i found myself unable to study, unable to maintain normal human relations,
unable do *one damn thing* other than investigate evolution and it
implications.
(i blush to admit this, but i have gone on at length about openness, so...)
i failed *all* my classes, every one.  i nearly had to drop out of school.
that
quarter, i dont think i ever opened an engineering book, and im almost
certain i failed to turn in a single homework assignment.  my friends thought
i was on drugs, my significant other thought i must be seeing someone else,
strangers thought i must be dissipating violently in masturbation and daytime
tv,
(innocent on all counts), teachers noticed my mind was waaay elsewhere
(guilty).

but, i solved it.  life on earth evolved.  humans evolved.  religion evolved.
the only other idea that hit me with anything like as much impact is...
nanotechnology.  but thats another story.   i wonder if drexler realizes
he is being mentioned in the same sentence with charles darwin.  {8^D spike

Alas, all we have is well informed (possibly) speculation. Death is
ultimately caused by the failure or incapability of the body's healing
mechanisms. The damage caused by freezing is incomparably greater, so a
frozen patient is very dead indeed from the viewpoint of contemporary
science. Science is concerned with the provable (as it should be) and at
present what is provable is that only a few tissues in the human body can
survive freezing to cryogenic temperatures.

Ralph Merkle, et al, argue from the viewpoint that there are no 'in
principle' barriers to the eventual development of molecular and atomic
level nanotechnology (ie, exact placement of molecules and atoms). I can
imagine standing in the Parthenon in Athens conversing with Democritus
(sorry, I may not have my names and times correct here), the inventor of
the Atomic theory, arguing that if we can manipulate atoms with very tiny
tweezers, we can build anything we want. (I see a horde of slaves and
waldo-tweezers attempting to build something. Can you say "Avogrado's
Number"?)

When I was a software engineer, I learned from bitter experience
three things:

	1. Even the smallest tasks take an absurd
	   amount of time and effort.

	2. Once you've stuck all the pieces together,
	   your troubles are only just beginning.

	3. The effects of politics and stupidity.

It is a long, long, long road from principle to product.

Some musings:

[1] Lego Toy Problem

Yes. A very good way to attempt this is to use Lego blocks. (Seriously!)
Lego is developing a series of toys which can interface with the PC (about
$200, available this fall). For the moment these devices will be physically
too feeble to pick up the Lego blocks and push them together, and the
sensor technology is also very crude. If you did have adequate actuators
and sensors (I can see it now, hydraulically driven Lego-Bots!), consider
the design of a Lego-Assembler, which given a suitable PC, and a suitable
supply of Lego blocks, is capable of assembling a copy of itself.

The point of such a 'toy problem' (groan) is to reveal the higher level
conceptual difficulties of doing such a thing and to reveal the detailed
problems of actually doing it. (like, how do you sense the difference from
a Lego block and a sugar cube?)

The next Lego problem is to eliminate the major non-Lego components,
especially the PC. Most solutions to this problem (in principle!) involve
combining a standard set of components, a general purpose assembler, and a
data tape whose structure as a media is simple. The data tape is read and
the assembler executes the instructions. It builds the duplicate assembler,
and then duplicates the tape. 

I imagine such a device would be rather large. The assembler component on
the order of a cubic meter, and a kilometer of so of Lego blocks data tape
(if folded or on a spool, about the volume of my house. And it would run
verrrrrry slowly, maybe a few years to complete the reproduction).

This would provide a look at the challenges involved, given a an assembler
a priori. 

[2] The Trouble with Nanobots and a Solution

We have all seen by now the little video clips of futuristic nanobots
flying like tiny Tie Fighters though the bloodstream, searching for Bad
Biological Blobs and replacing them with Beautiful Beneficent Bits. Here
are a few of the many problems with this dramatic concept:

	Energy source
	Locomotion
	Orientation
	Co-ordination with other Bots
	Positional Uncertainty

The first four are obvious enough. Nanobots will be subject to Brownian
motion at non cryogenic temperatures. Flying or swimming through a fluid
medium will always result in this. The fact that you can see Brownian
motion in a light microscope proves the point. At a less visible level,
there's the Heisenberg uncertainty to deal with. The smaller the object,
the more difficult it is to establish the position. The current research
involves STMs and objects bonded to large substrate, so the uncertainty is
far smaller than the atoms being manipulated. Nanobots are tiny indeed.

An array of assemblers firmly mounted on a suitable support structure
answers many of these problems. This requires that the object being
assembled be in the solid state. Assembly at cryogenic temperatures makes a
lot of sense. Things will stay where you put them, you can use high vacuum
without damaging the placement of volatile molecules such as H2O, etc. Very
large computing resources can interfaced to the assembler instead of being
limited to the tiny volumes of nanobots.

An assembly plate with a square meter of area would suffice for reanimation
work.

[3] Warming Up

Another advantage of cryogenic temperatures is that cells could be (in
principle!) constructed in the solid state with every molecule in place. No
ice crystals. No latent heat to complicate warming. If you can get from 77
Deg K to 1 Deg K in a very short time (1 millisecond at the most), warming
from there to body temperature without further damage has been proven (I
recall a hamster at Alcor).

To do this, warming elements must be finely distributed through the body,
close enough that thermal conduction will warm the immediate vicinity
within the millisecond time frame, which implies a distribution of elements
a few cell lengths apart. One idea for this is tiny wires coated with or
comprised of diamondoid material with a conductive center. A 100 Kg body
requires about 8 x 10^5 joules delivered in a 1 ms pulse of 8 x 10^10 watts
(100 gigawatts, approximately).

The wires are assembled into the body during construction, and pulled out
after the warming pulse. At 1 Deg C, the removal can be done gently over a
few hours. The wire array would take little volume, say 1 part per thousand
of the total body volume.

Final Comment:

We easily become entrained with unworkable concepts. Nanobots may certainly
have their uses in medicine, and extending the idea to reanimation is
obvious until looked at critically. We are a long way from knowing what
will work, how to do it, or even imagining what the workable options are.
Despite all this, I remain an optimist and a signed up cryonicist.

Nick, while I'm still gathering possible conflict information, so far
August 6-8 is looking promising. That misses both the Crypto and WFS
conferences, while being early enough in August to not be a problem for
students starting classes for the Fall.

Does anyone know of any conficts with August 6-8?

I'm already getting excited about EXTRO 4! Maybe this time we can break a
record and get 200 transhumanists together, with a more international
collection than ever.

The size of the data tape is dependent on the structure of the media. A 4mm
tape cartridge, for example, has anywhere from 60-120 meters of 4mm wide tape
on it, and can hold about 250megs per meter at present desk top technology
levels. An older media, 9 track tape reels, can hold 6250 bytes per inch, and
have anywhere from 800-3600 feet of tape on them. Your Lego brand data tape is
going to be what? punch tape??? ;)  You could use the pins on a lego block for
a media, if you wanted. A 2x8 pin block would represent 1 byte, where every set
of 2 pins is your 0 and 1 bit positions. Using this as a media structure, you
definitely would have a memory space the size of a house to do anything useful,
given a conventional sized Lego block.

To go more compact, you would use a 2x8 block as a punch tape reading head, and
a similar block as the writing head. Roll the punch tape up onto a spool.
However, using tape is getting away from the standardized Lego building blocks.

  Question, if you are assembling the body as a corrected structure at
cryogenic temperatures, what effect will warming the body have on its
structure??? Won't there be some significant problems with coefficients of
expansion going  from 1 degree to 77 degrees?? Since you won't have ice
crystals, won't the body be severely dehydrated once it is warmed to the 1
degree point???? Or will there be transport mechanisms to infuse water as
temperature rises?? These will be needed alongside the diamondoid warming
structures, won't they???

After careful analysis of the Extropian Principles 3.0, I believe I 
have found an error in the reading list.

In the fictional anthology _Immortals_ which I own, Gardner Dozois is 
the second editor and Damon Knight is the writer of the first short 
story featured in the book.  Please inform me, if you are referring to 
a different book in version 3.0 of the principles.

I would never ever presume to tell you what you were feeling, but what you
describe sounds on the surface more like obsessive-compulsive behavior
connected to some variant of an existential crisis.  Depressed people
are rarely as driven as you describe yourself to have been.  They believe
things are pretty hopeless and see themselves as helpless to effect any
change.  You, on the other hand, saw yourself as an agent of change.
Your actions were responsible for your own evolutionary development.
Way to go!  Don't want to belabor the point, it just didn't sound like
clinical depression the way you described it.

I, for one, do appreciate you sharing such a personal and clearly
distressing
episode from your life.  The Darwinian "Aha" experience for me was more
drawn out and therefore less traumatic.

Ciao for now,

SB

You're right. Thanks for the correction. BTW, just to confuse things, there
is another book edited by Jack Dann (on his own) called Immortal.

Perhaps with bone. If need be, the cold structure could be prestressed or
voids inserted between cells or organs.

No. The water molecules are where they should be, not as ice crystals, but
distributed in the cytoplasm, etc.

No need. Imagine a living body instantly cooled to 77 deg K. Now reverse it.

Now that there are 7 instead of 5 principles, will the logo
still keep its 5 arrows or will it change also (I know it has
changed from 4 to 5 arrows in the past). Just curious...

P.s: too bad that "best do it so" has to go, it was a real
classic.

Sorry spike, the back cover listed the above ISBN the inside page
(colophon?) lists it at 0-465-05020-4 I believe '93 was the last
edition.

The November 1998 Scientific American has an article about liquid water
and its interactions with organic molecules.  The water molecules have
electrostatic charges, positive where the hydrogen atoms are and negative
on the opposite side by the oxygen atom.  This causes them to attract
each other and stick together.

If you have a low temperature system, and you place two water molecules
near each other with a separation characteristic of a higher temperature
system, they will attract each other with their electrostatic charges
and move together.

It will not be possible to scatter water molecules through a region with
an average spacing characteristic of higher temperatures.  It would be
like trying to position powerful magnets 1/4 inch apart on a table top.
The magnets would clump up.  Similarly, the water molecules will clump
together as well, forming ice crystals separated by voids.

This is not necessarily harmful; at the low temperatures involved,
the vapor pressures will be very low and few molecules will break free
to wander through the vacuum-filled voids between the ice.  These ice
crystals are all positioned in areas where we wanted water, anyway;
between large molecules and organelles.

You'd have to look at the details of the heating process to be sure that
the ice crystals would melt in a safe manner, but hopefully it would be
workable.

Max,

Certainly geography is and will be an issue.  Why not incorporate
teleconferencing or other technologies and make Extro 4 a worldwide event
with its hub in a physical location?

Cheers.

Its what people try when they've signed up for the list and are too lazy
and ignorant to go find the introductory list message which plainly
explains how they can unsubscribe from the list.

eeew k... Anyway, I've recently subscribed and have enjoyed the 
materials and ideas being shared. I, at this point have nothing to add, 
but I know that the topic of Extropy and Transhumanism. So, until I know 
more about it I will only observe.

I find this paragraph far more sincere than the remainder of your post
which was laden with namecalling and rude affront extinquishing any
readible point.  What you lost might be on the other side of this.

I have been diagnosed as being Clinically Depressed and have been such 
the majority of my life. The Winters are the worse, yet I think I know 
what you mean about 'loosing' something. It was such a part of yourself 
that you almost feel you betray that side of you when you're not in that

For me it was about the same age, though not so strictly religiously
oriented.  I was standing outside watching some sprinklers water the lawn
when I saw a rainbow out in the mist.  Remembering that there was supposed
to be a pot of gold hidden at the end of the rainbow, I noticed that this
one was small enough that I could check both ends without breaking a sweat.
 :)

Unfortunately, by the time I had gotten there, the sprinklers had
automatically shut off.  Frustrated by this, I nonetheless figured out how
to make a rainbow with the hose in our backyard.  Yet the rainbow was
suspended in midair: it never touched the ground, so there was no pot of
gold.  Yet I also noticed that when I moved the hose, I saw "different
parts" of the rainbow, like illuminating an object with water which
otherwise remained hidden.  Following the path, my "aha" experience was
when I saw that the rainbow I was observing was no bigger than 3 feet
across: a circle suspended in midair.  There was no end, and no pot of gold.

"They've all been tricked!" I thought to myself.  "There is no pot of gold!
 What's more, I can make rainbows in my own backyard!"

Elated, I tried to explain this to my parents, to no avail.  :)

I thoroughly agree with Mr. Sona.  I need a great excuse/reason to go buy
some digital teleconferencing equipment for my computer and a motivation to
learn to use it.  This would certainly be a *superb* chance for a great
live, interactive, multimedia experience and a wonderful educational
opportunity as well.  It also would be a great futuristic, sophisticated,
high-tech statement of how advanced we Extropians are. :-)

No, not just neuroimaging.  There's an actual implant, and the brain adapts to
it, with information coming out.  As far as I know, this is the first
neurosilicate interface.  (There have been siliconeural stimulators, but that
hasn't involved any information transfer.)  I believe this is the first device
to get information directly from the brain.

[...]
      So far, two incapacitated people have received the
      implants. This gave them the power to control a cursor
      on a computer screen by thinking about moving parts
      of their body. By pointing the cursor at different
      icons, the patients could make the computer voice
      phrases such as "I'm thirsty" or "Please turn off the
      light". "If you can run a computer, you can talk to the
      world," says Roy Bakay of Emory University in Atlanta,
      Georgia, whose team developed the implants. 

      The implants consist of two hollow glass cones, no
      bigger than the tip of a ballpoint pen, placed into the
      brain's motor cortex, which controls body movements.
      The glass cones are laced with neurotrophic chemicals
      extracted from the patients' own knees. These
->    chemicals encourage nerve growth so, over several
->    months, neurons in the cortex grow pathways into the
->    cones and attach themselves to tiny electrodes
->    mounted inside.

[...]

Vingean, isn't it?  As far as I can tell nothing is being "decoded", so there
isn't any complex information tranfer, or two-way transfer.  It is a long way
from here to semantic telepathy.  Still, this is an astonishing proof-of-concept.

Crude.  Blunt.  Unthinking.  But we are now officially living in the age of
implants and computer telepathy.

Too bad the brain doesn't have secure open APIs...
But maybe, some reconfigurable interface may be implanted too, a little
later...
And then things can really take off...
After that, besides parents, school, and society, one would have another
target for laying guilt for their actions - implant manufacturers.

Title
  Consumption of vegetables reduces genetic damage in humans: first results of
  a human intervention trial with carotenoid-rich foods.
Source
  Carcinogenesis.  18(9):1847-50, 1997 Sep.
Abstract
  A human intervention study with vegetable products has been performed in
  twenty three healthy, non smoking males aged 27-40. It was the aim of the
  study to assess whether consumption of vegetables containing different
  carotenoids could protect against DNA damage and oxidative DNA damage. The
  subjects consumed their normal diets, but abstained from vegetables high in
  carotenoids throughout the study period. After a 2 week depletion period,
  they received daily 330 ml tomato juice
  with 40 mg lycopene (weeks 3 and 4), 330 ml carrot juice
  with 22.3 mg beta-carotene and 15.7 mg alpha-carotene (weeks 5 and 6), and 10
  g dried spinach powder (in water or milk) with 11.3 mg lutein (weeks 7 and
  8). Blood was collected weekly and DNA damage was detected in peripheral
  blood lymphocytes with the 'COMET' assay. Oxidised DNA bases were detected by
  including an incubation step with endonuclease III. The supplementation of
  the diet with tomato, carrot or spinach products resulted in
  a significant decrease in endogenous levels of strand breaks in lymphocyte
  DNA. Oxidative base damage was significantly reduced during the carrot
  juice intervention. These findings support the hypothesis
  that carotenoid containing plant products exert a cancer-protective effect
  via a decrease in oxidative and other damage to DNA in humans.

  Sounds pretty ambitious for a first attempt. It seems to me a macro scale
assembler would be very useful, even if it used some complex components like
computer chips. So long as it could assemble copies of itself, and useful large
articles like chairs, tables or houses from durable components it could be
useful. And it would be really useful if it could dissasemble the components
and build new products from them. For those of us who live in variable
climates, a house that was small and snug in the winter, and large and airy in
the summer would be worth having.

 Perhaps you don't need to worry too much about sugar cubes if you don't
actually use Lego blocks. Make your building components distinct enough from
casual matter to be easy to identify. Bar codes spring to mind. So long as you
work in a contained space, you only need to check at the entrance and exit to
the workspace.

 I've been thinking about this problem for a while, but it seems too complex
for one person to tackle.

Title
  Tomato juice, chocolate drink, and other
  fluids suppress volitional drinking of alcohol in the female Syrian golden
  hamster.
Source
  Physiology & Behavior.  57(6):1155-61, 1995 Jun.
Abstract
  Although the hamster generally prefers alcohol at a level similar to that of
  the rat or mouse selectively bred to consume alcohol, the drinking hamster
  demonstrates neither physical dependence on alcohol nor elevated blood levels
  of alcohol, which are two typical criteria characterizing an animal model of
  alcoholism. The present investigation was designed to determine whether a
  third criterion of an animal model (i.e., consumption of high levels of
  alcohol in the presence of a palatable fluid, fulfilled by the P rat) would
  be met by the female Syrian golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus). A standard
  3-bottle preference test was undertaken in 6 female hamsters over an 11 day
  period, in which water was presented in one tube and, in a second tube, a v/v
  solution of alcohol which was increased in concentration from 3% to 50% on

Title
  Inhibitory effect of tomato juice on rat
  urinary bladder carcinogenesis after N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine
  initiation.
Source

Abstract
  The effects of tomato juice on urinary
  bladder carcinogenesis were studied in male Fischer 344 rats initiated with
  N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine (BBN) in rats. The animals (6 weeks
  old) were given 0.05% BBN in their drinking water for 8 weeks, followed by
  diluted tomato juice for 12 weeks, and
  killed at 20 weeks after the beginning of the experiment. Lycopene
  concentrations in the livers of rats given tomato
  juice were elevated. Histopathological analysis of urinary
  bladder lesions revealed the numbers, but not incidences, of urinary bladder
  transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs) to be decreased in the group given
  tomato juice. No influence on the incidence
  of simple and nodullopapillary hyperplasias, invasion or differentiation of
  TCC was noted. These results indicate that tomato
  juice, presumably the contained lycopene and other
  anti-oxidants in combination, exerts an inhibitory effect on the development
  of TCCs in the rat urinary bladder.

Great story, Dan.

For me, the transition from being religious (and I was 
a 10 year old evangelist at one point) to being an
Agnostic was not nearly as difficult as my fairly recent 
transition from Agnostic to Atheist (thanks in large part
to some of the stimulating discussions on this list).  Where 
I work, it would have been socially and politically 
courageous of me to bring up or admit that I was an 
Agnostic . . .  let alone an Atheist.  But beyond those forces, 
there is the inner part of my psyche that fears the delusion of
damnation conditioned into me at such an early age.  
The part of me that says, "We are lost forever if you choose 
this path."

What I found so irresistable about Darwinism was how it was 
able to make so much sense out of human behavior.  This 
fundamentally and elegantly simple notion provided a lens 
through which people's interactions could be interpreted
more parsimoniously than anything I'd found in my psychology
studies.  

I've been wondering about something, though.  As natural selection
appears to have generally favored increased levels of environmental
awareness in organisms, we see that animals have evolved from a 
state where (1) virtually all behaviors are determined by genetics to
(2) most behaviors are still instinctual but many behaviors can now be 
 termed as predispositioned (i.e. increased intra-species behavioral
variance), to (3) many behaviors are genetically predetermined, 
many are biologically predispositioned, and some appear to be 
the result of what we have come to think of as "free will".  That is, 
thoughtful and purposeful behavior only weakly connected to genetic 
or biological determinants or predispositions.  

It seems to me that the idea of uploading takes this trend to it's logical 
conclusion.  Freeing ourselves from the limitations imposed by the 
body means precisely that we seek to possess a "will" that is utterly 
and completely free from biological mandates and predispositions.
Given this premise, I conclude that we as uploads would not want to 
simulate emotional states in order that we might "feel" like a human 
again...subject to the mercurial vissicitudes thereof (sorry).  Picking 
and choosing to experience our favorite emotions sounds like fun 
as long as it's under complete control.

But then again, every time I think of uploading, I think about the way it 
feels to jog down a path at sunset with a cool breeze blowing across 
my skin....and a host of other bodily pleasures.  

Ambivalently,

SB

A lot of people say that.  I have stopped being surprised.  I suppose that
most people still retain their emotional attachment to the world, even some
people who think of themselves as radical Extropians.  I know that I did, long
past the point where I thought I had left it all behind... and now it's time
for my Aha! experience.

I remember very vividly where I was when the chain of thought occurred to me. 
(I was in the bathroom, actually, so I won't describe it any further than
that...)  I was wondering what would happen subsequent to the Singularity if
post-Singularity ethics were such that people were given a free choice. 
Influenced by _Blood Music_, I wondered whether we would suddenly appear on (a
simulation of) a starry plain, with some enigmatic posthuman blend of those
who had already chosen asking The Question.  It then occurred to me that most
people would prefer to live out their lives unaware that anything had changed
- certainly it would be cruel to make the naysayers live out the rest of their
lives in what they knew was just a simulation of a vanished, pointless, unreal Earth.

So maybe They would keep me around until I decided that I wanted to be
uploaded - and to preserve the illusion, They would arrange for the question
to arise naturally, perhaps as the result of reading Vernor Vinge (or of
reading a message on a mailing list)...

But hadn't I already decided?  No, I realized, I hadn't.  I had made the
decision in the abstract, but not in the particular of "Are you ready to leave
this world here and now?"  I felt, at that moment, a sudden attachment to the
world, everything I loved about it - even the particular design of the
bathroom tiles, the sense of sight, the sense of touch.  All my senses
suddenly seemed more vivid, and I felt how much my physical existence mattered
to me.  And, honestly and truly believing that there was a nonzero chance that
this decision would result in my being disembodied and rapidly upgraded, I let
go of this world and made my choice.

Stop for a moment.  Think about it.  Are you really ready to go?  Here and
now?  Perhaps, while you were asleep last night, the final breakthrough
occurred in the Cyc lab, or at Zyvex.  Maybe you're being asked to decide for
real.  Are you ready?

--

Well, I'm still here (or a simulation of me is making sure that nobody notices
any sudden absences).  I have made my choice.  I do not regret it.  I really
and truly am ready to be uploaded and upgraded, to plunge into the unknown. 
Am I afraid?  Yes, but I still made my choice, believing it was real.  So I
don't want to hear any more about the pleasures of physicality.  Some of us
have severed that emotional commitment.  Because I knew then, and decided,
that I was even willing to lose my personality and my identity as an
individual - if that was what was required - I am not bound even to that.

Later (like a few months), I had a dream.  In this dream, They arrived, and
offered to make us transhumans, translate us into patterns that existed in the
interior of the Sun.  But then I got suspicious, because nobody They uploaded
was reporting back.  So I investigated, and it turned out that the process of
uploading caused horrible agony due to the lack of a spatial referent.  (No
reason, just pure dream-nonsense.)  This caused the uploaded folks to forget
their identities for a period of time.

After this, my attitude was:  "OK.  Problem solved."  I told everyone else,
and held out my hand to Them, across their portal.  I remember being
frightened.  I didn't know that it was all a dream.  But I made my decision to
take my licks and come back to myself eventually.  With no body.

Sadly, it wasn't my turn, and They selected someone else to go first - which
is a real pity, because then the dream ended.  I suppose you could argue this
indicates an unresolved subconscious fear.  I wouldn't really argue.  I don't
control my subconscious.

But in the dream, I made my decision.  The decisions you make in your dream
indicate who you really are, after logic and reason have been stripped away. 
It indicates the extent to which you have shaped your emotions.  And in that
dream, I made the same choice I made in waking reality.  I made it, and
experienced the stress that shows it was a true decision, not a dream-random decision.

If I suddenly found myself Elsewhere and was asked if I was ready to be
uploaded, I could answer "Yes" without hesitation.  I wouldn't need to savor
physical existence one last time.  I have already done so.  So to answer the
eternal question - yes.  I will give it up.  All of it.  Willingly. 
Emotionally, as well as rationally.  My choice is made.

The expense may pose difficulties for this idea. If someone has experience
with teleconferencing and wants to look into this for the event, I'm open
to the idea. I'm not sure how well teleconferencing works for a large
event, rather than for a small roundtable meeting. Perhaps it would best to
set up teleconferencing for a limited part of the event, maybe in a place
apart from the talks room.

If one of you knows about how to set this up and what it would cost, and
what equipment would be needed at the distal end, please let me know.

The current level of technology certainly doesn't make teleconferencing a
good substitute for actually being there. Previous EXTROs have drawn
transhumanists from all over Europe and as far away as Australia.
Marinating in extropian company for a few days is an experience that's hard
to beat!

  IAN: Amazing article! That "the [brain] implant
  becomes naturally 'wired' into the patient's brain 
  as neurones grow into the cones and attach themselves 
  to the electrodes mounted inside," and that "An FM 
  transmitter under the scalp transmits the signal 
  without wires, and...no batteries," to operate
  the cursor on a computer is hard to believe! 

  It's actually bionic "telekinesis." Now if it 
  works this way, it must surely be able to work 
  the other way, that is, signals sent to a brain
  could control that brain from a distant location.

As a not-entirely-serious aside, I was idly pondering various issues
surrounding a singularity event when it occured to me that if global
causality violation is physically possible, we're likely to see it
employed by a strongly superhuman AI -- pace Hans Moravec's arguments
about the computational implications of time travel. It then occured
to me to wonder what the non-superhuman intelligences then living would
make of such a technology.

Suddenly I realised: they're living among us today!

The truth can be revealed at last: Bill Gates is a self-sacrificing
altruist, a time-traveller from the far side of the singularity. His
mission is nothing less than to single-handedly delay the onset of the
singularity, by setting back the development of computing in general
and AI in particular twenty or thirty years. (Talking paper-clips do
not a posthuman experience make.)

Of course, the denizens of the Beyond haven't taken this lying down.
They've sent their own emmisary back to us:

So, why give that up? Once uploaded, you could continue to jog down
sunlit paths either in a VR world or a "real" one (by means of telepresence)
while other parts of your massive brain "subconsciously" (or not - your
choice) conduct their scientific work, maintainance, simulation control etc.
Uploading opens up a world of infinite choice without having to make any
sacrifice whatsoever. You lose *nothing*. If you so desire, you could be
a god without ever "knowing" it, since your memory and consciousness
are yours to manipulate. You could be an upload already...

Obviously, any technology can be abused. No doubt, as this
particular technology progresses, people will oppose its
further development by painting "worst case" scenarios. This
has happened recently with cloning (e.g., armies of throw
away soldiers, armies of Hitlers, etc.)

However, these "arguments" are effectively countered by
the point that all technologies are vulnerable to abuse.
That brain implants and human cloning could be abused in
ways we might not find palatable makes them no different
from artillery, the Internet, or mastery of fire. The key
is anticipating the capabilities of technology and
objectively considering the ways such technology can
be used positively and ways it can be abused. Developing
policy from that vantage point is key.

  IAN: Exactly. All advances in technology are 
  a threat in the wrong hands, and a benefit in 
  the right ones. The "wrong hands" are author-
  itarian central planners, and as such, the 
  case is against central authority powers.

  The idea of banning a technology because the 
  government (the banners) might abuse is silly,
  for it assumes that governments follow the law.
  Probably the best way to ensure that cloning and
  implants are used in the worst ways is to ban them.

Max,

Certainly professional teleconferencing is expensive and a poor substitute
for the experience of actually being there.  However, images, video, audio,
and text could be routed over the Internet in real time relatively
inexpensively.  For example, panel discussions could have questions posed in
an IRC styled medium and replies send through Real Audio.  (Unfortunately,
this is not an area I have enough knowledge in to give detailed specifics.
It will be interesting to hear what William John and others have to say.)

I do agree covering Extro 4 electronically might prove difficult to
implement on any large scale, but I think selective coverage would have
symbolic value.

The expense may pose difficulties for this idea. If someone has experience
with teleconferencing and wants to look into this for the event, I'm open
to the idea. I'm not sure how well teleconferencing works for a large
event, rather than for a small roundtable meeting. Perhaps it would best to
set up teleconferencing for a limited part of the event, maybe in a place
apart from the talks room.

If one of you knows about how to set this up and what it would cost, and
what equipment would be needed at the distal end, please let me know.

The current level of technology certainly doesn't make teleconferencing a
good substitute for actually being there. Previous EXTROs have drawn
transhumanists from all over Europe and as far away as Australia.
Marinating in extropian company for a few days is an experience that's hard
to beat!

I agree that it is ambitious. However, building the components needed to
pickup and join Lego blocks should be feasible with a limited budget. I
have no objection to placing something on the blocks to identify their
types, such as the barcodes you suggest. The idea is a low cost approach
which is affordable for amateur nanotechnolgists. And, of course, to
identify the higher level problems which as yet remain undiscovered.

A good upload will include a body image and a good interface, so you will
not be able to distinguish artifical stimuli from real ones, save for
perhaps an icon in the corner of your awareness. Believe me, good upload
surrounds (Egan's "viewpoints" in Diaspora) will be much in demand, a kind
of combination of Hollywood and Real Estate.....

So you can enjoy things which are beyond your present abilities, like
surfing the Big Waves on Oahu, doing the Olympic luge and the like. Here
you get both environment and a well tuned, sensate and sensous body.

I have seen several of these things. Always a letdown. There's a quality to
ftf that simply can't done via teleconferencing. I think it is a total
waste of precious Extropy resources to get into this. Most of these things
were more about "Gee whiz, ain't we on the cutting edge" I don't need it,
and spend the money on airfare for a good speaker or something. The same
money could produce an excellent Web site on the conference for all to
enjoy.....

Well, nothing should stop you from having an infinite amount of experiences, even after
being uploaded...

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

About a year ago it was found that if a gene called "Dave-2" in a round
worm was mutated the worm was still active and fertile but lived more than
twice as long as an unmutated normal worm. A new development was just
reported today by Cynthia Kenyon in the October 16 issue of the journal
Cell, it turns out that it's not necessary to change every cell in the
worm, only a small number of the cells need to mutate for all the cells
in the worm live longer including the unmutated cells. The cells in the
worm must "vote" somehow and agree on how long to live because it's an
all or nothing process, if the number of mutated cells is too small
the worm does not live longer, even the mutated cells don't live longer.
There must be a second signal (not yet found) that's given off by the
cells with the change to Dave-2 that convinces all the other cells
that they should live longer.

The other interesting thing is that the Dave-2 gene in humans makes a
receptor for insulin and a growth factor called IGF that's deeply involved
in food metabolism. The mutated roundworms eat a normal diet but their
metabolism is similar to an unmutated roundworm on a very low calorie diet.
A low calorie diet has extended the life span of every animal it has been
tested on.

Interesting...  I'm not surprised that this link between
aging and insulin has been discovered.  I've been on a low
carb diet for some time now, and the theory behind low carb
diets is to counteract Insulin Resistance Syndrome (IR).  

According to the theory, high carb foods such as grains and
sugar, were not available to primitive man, so are bodies
are not equipped to properly deal with them. And by
repeatedly shocking our system with high carb foods, we
cause our bodies to produce very high levels of insulin. 
And as our bodies become accustom to high levels of insulin,
the insulin receptors in the cells of our bodies become
Insulin Resistant.  So the level of insulin required for
insulin to do its job, progressively becomes higher and
higher.

This obviously creates all kinds of havoc with our food
metabolism.  It creates a condition where the non insulin
resistant cells of our body (fat cells & cancer cells), hog
all the blood sugar in our body before our brains and
muscles get a chance.  Thus we grow fatter while
paradoxically, experiencing low energy.  

But high insulin levels cause all kinds of other problems
besides weight gain.  To begin with, insulin suppresses
Human Growth Hormone levels, while causing the amount of
cholesterol the body produces to sky rocket.  High insulin
levels can also cause high blood pressure, elevated
triglycerides, and type II diabetes.

Perhaps the reason why a low calorie diet is effective, is
because it is one way of controlling insulin levels.

I just have one question, if I may. I saw a note about the 3.0 version 
of the Extropian Principles being evaluated. Was this posted to the 
list, or was this for Extropy members only? At this point I am trying to 
do a lot of extropian-related reading before I try to 'jump in' to the 
conversation, and I would enjoy reading these. Any information is 
appreciated. 
Thanks, 
Mike

<Me too>

I remember some years (6-10) ago thinking about doing things that
would mean dying: Being in unprotected shuttle that were crashing into
earth or one way trip to somewhere solar system. Then I had my Aha!
experience: If I had perfect copy in the earth it would not matter
whether I died. I could safely try deadly things. So this body would
be destroyed and I would experience 'death', but I would not really
die.

I think that it could be characterized in one sentence: Realizing in
your subconscious level that physical form really doesn't matter, it's
your thoughts ('algorithms') that matter.

I'm not sure it makes sense to say I'm prepared to lose my personality and
my identity as an individual.  What's the point of saying "I" want to upload
if "l" cease to exist once I get there.  I don't see how that could happen
anyway.  The uploaded version of you would have all your memories so
how could your identity be lost?  It would only be expanded.  I have
memories
from my childhood but I am no longer a child.  Wouldn't it be the same?

I would also say yes if offered the chance to upload.  I was jogging again
today and thinking about yours and Den Otter's posts.  I tried to imagined
that the world I was sensing was my own simulation.  I chanted a mantra
while I ran: "Every sensation...my own creation....Every sensation....my own
creation...."  To make sense of it I had to picture the me that was jogging
as only
a portion of the whole me, partitioned off and placed into this virtual
reality
while the rest of me was busy with other tasks.  I was reminded of the
movie,
"What Dreams May Come" where Williams spontaneously creates his own
world after he dies.  I like the idea of visiting other uploads and
experiencing
the worlds they create for themselves, or joining with other uploads to
cooperatively create worlds perhaps impossible to create alone.  It's a new
slant on the old phrase, "Brave New World".

Remote mind control by radio-controlled brain implants 
had been mastered as far back as 1964, to the point that 
scientists "played" animals "like little electronic toys,"
according to the following New York Times article:


    THE NEW YORK TIMES, May 17, 1965, front page

   'Matador' With a Radio Stops Wired Bull: Modified 
    Behavor in Animals Subject of Brain Study. 

    By John A. Osmundsen 

    Afternoon sunlight poured over the high wooden 
    barriers into the ring, as the brave bull bore 
    down on the unarmed "matador" -- a scientist 
    who had never faced fighting bull. 

    But the charging animal's horns never reached 
    the man behind the heavy red cape. Moments be-
    fore that could happen, Dr. Jose Delgado, the sci-
    entist, pressed a button on a small radio trans-
    mitter in his hand and the bull braked to a halt. 

    Then he pressed another button on the transmit-
    ter, and the bull obediently turned to the right 
    and trotted away. 

    The bull was obeying commands in his brain that 
    were being called forth by electrical stimulation 
    -- by the radio signals -- of certain regions in 
    which fine wires had been painlessly planted." 

    The experiment, conducted last year in Cordova, 
    Spain, by Dr. Delgado of Yale University's School 
    of Medicine, was probably the most spectacular 
    demonstration ever performed of the deliberate 
    modification of animal behavior through external 
    control of the brain. . . . 

    He has been working in this field for more than 
    15 years. Techniques that he and other scientists 
    have recently developed have been refined to the 
    point where, he believes, "a turning point has 
    been reached in the study of the mind." 

    "I do believe," he said in a recent lecture, 
    "that an understanding of the biological bases 
    of social and antisocial behavior and of mental 
    activities, which for the first time in history 
    can now be explored in a conscious brain, may be 
    of decisive importance in the search for intelli-
    gent solutions to some of our present anxieties, 
    frustrations and conflicts."


    . . . (page 20)


    Based on His Experiment

    Dr. Delgado's contention that brain research 
    has reached a stage of refinement where it can 
    contribute to the solution of some...problems 
    is based he said, on many of his own experiments. 

    These have shown, he explained, that "functions 
    traditionally related to the psyche, such as 
    friendliness, pleasure or verbal expression, 
    can be induced, modified and inhibited by 
    direct electrical stimulation to the brain."

    For example, he has been able to "play" monkeys 
    and cats "like little electronic toys" that yawn, 
    hide, fight, play, mate and go to sleep on command.


    . . .

    Some of The Results Listed

    With such techniques, Dr. Delgado has shown: 

    * Monkeys will learn to press a button that 
    sends a stimulus to the brain of an enraged 
    member of the colony and calms it down, in-
    dicating that animals can be taught to con-
    trol other's behavior. 

    * A monkey, stimulated to extremely aggres-
    sive behavior will make "intelligent" attacks 
    only on competitive members of the colony, 
    sparing other, friendlier, ones.

    * Monkeys and cats can be triggered into se-
    quential behavior in which one might open its 
    mouth, turn around, walk to a corner, climb a 
    wall, jump down and return to "start," repeat-
    ing those movement in the  same  order  every 
    time they are stimulated but will modify the 
    pattern if other animals get in the way or if 
    they are threatened. 

    The latter two experiments show that electri-
    cal brain stimulation does not simply evoke 
    automatic responses but reactions that become 
    integrated into the social behavior according 
    to the individual's own personality or temp-
    erament, Dr. Delgado said. 

    Experiments have been conducted on human beings 
    by Dr. Delgado and other scientists, primarily 
    during the treatment of certain types of epil-
    epsy. Stimulation of particular areas of the 
    brain have produced anxiety, profound feelings 
    of friendliness and, in one case, a six-fold 
    increase in word output.

    The Yale neurophysiologist believes that tech-
    niques such as the one he is using can lead to 
    the discovery of the cerebral basis of anxiety, 
    pleasure, aggression and other mental functions 
    and that "we shall be in a much better position 
    to influence their development and manifestation 
    (in various ways) especially by means of more 
    scientifically programmed education."

Very interesting indeed! But...is this for real? One would think that if such
amazing feats were already possible more than 30 years ago, "wired" people
(criminals for example) and animals would be a common sight by now...What is the
current status of this kind of research anyway?

The same thing HAS been done with people... and I believe it was done before
it was done with animals. I remember reading about some guy in Louisiana or
something in the 50s who was a schizophrenic and homosexual, and they put a
wire into his pleasure center, and the hospital staff gave him control of
the button while he was watching a heterosexual porno, then got a prostitute
for him (really!). I don't have the source with me so I don't remember the
exact details, but it was from a book called "The Three Pound Universe".
They also use it to control pain in terminally ill people.. I think the
basal ganglia is the area that is stimulated. Someone who took a
biopsychology class told me that one day the professor brought in a rat who
had a wire directly into his basal ganglia, and could stimulate it with a
lever, and the rat had been pressing the lever for three days straight, and
while the professor is going over this to the class, the rat dropped dead
from exaustion.. some girl in the class started complaining that it was
cruelty to animals and he said "honey, this rat died happier then you'll
ever be in your whole life". Apparently the procedure is not nearly as
addictive with humans, and they can control it pretty well when they get one
put in. I also seem to remember being told in a class that they have placed
electrodes into people amygdala's to control anger.

I think the doctor mentioned went on to become the Pope's advisor on the
likes of mind-uploading and the whole thing was hushed up; - or am I
thinking of the doctor who sewed an extra living head onto a dog at
around the same time?

i have an idea: perhaps seasonal affected depression is humanity's
equivalent of hibernation.  the portion of mankind that has evolved
in the far north had a slightly better chance of survival in winter
if they were severely depressed.  the depressed would be more likely to
stay indoors and sit still, thereby conserving scarce energy while avoiding
the risk of going out in the harsh winter night, as their cabin fevered non-
depressed cohorts might be tempted to do.  this could cause the
tendency to s.a.d. to spread thru the population after some generations.
this would explain why the russian, the eskimo, the swede (my ancestors),
the danish, the finnish, etc, seem to have more sad than the jew, the
african, et.al from gentler, more hospitable climates.
whaddya think?  spike

All elementary psychology clases cover these experiments quite thoroughly.
They are very famous and are the basis for many sub-fields of neuroscience.
The original rat experiment was done by B.F. Skinner in the 50s and was
called "the skinner box." The implant was an electrode which was put into
the rat's hypothalamus (pleasure center of the brain which controls
sensations from eating, sleeping, sex). When an electrical stimulus was
provided by the subject, (in this case a lever the rat presses) the
interesting thing they noted was that the animal couldnt get enough
pleasure -- in other words they couldnt be satiated by the amount of
pleasure. This was also done later in human subjects, and there was no
higher control found. Humans would press the button endlessly when it was
in their hands. There is a lot of old video footage of the experiments
where a girl is holding this box and hitting a button over and over and the
doctor asks her, "Why are you pressing that button?" (There were 3 buttons,
but only one stimulated the hypothalamus) and she replied by saying "it
feels good. Its like a sexy button" and the doctor asked "what exactly do
you mean by sexy?" and she replied "it feels like this button goes all the
way down." We had a good laugh about it in my psychoogy class. 

About the bull experiment, that was similar technology but the electrode
was placed to deliver electric current to the amygdala, which is the
brain's center for both fear and anger (depending on the area of
stimulation). Anyways, the Doctor in the story activated the electrode and
the bull suddenly felt extremely scared of the matador and stopped dead in
his tracks. This has also been done to human subjects, and when the fear
part of the amygdala was stimulated, the subjects would go into giant panic
attacks and have intense feelings of death. When the anger part was
stimulated, they would go into bouts of rage. One patient described it like
this: "I just felt like I wanted to strangle the man interviewing me for
the experiment, and I had no idea why" 


This is very interesting research and has been done with most areas of the
brain, and the results are profound, and have probably taught us more about
why humans behave in the way they do than any other psychological
experiments. These experiments are still going on today, but are now
focused more on (big surprise) cognition and memory enhancement. 


Also, I have read "The Three Pound Universe" and it is a great book if you
are interested in a more biological and "hard science" view of the brain
and human behavior.

In otherwords, you are saying that SAD is a form of survival? That's an 
interesting concept, except that often, (however I have never had such 
ideas) suicidal tendancies accompany SAD, does it not?

I just read: "The Implementation of a
       Constructivist Approach to the
              Resolution of Prejudice"

http://www.oikos.org/kenpred.htm

"Consider the man who has learned to shoot game (learning 1, rifle
shooting) and who
announces he enjoys shooting game (elephant and hippopotamus). He risks
verbal
attack from people who disapprove for ecological reasons. On the first
occasion that
this happens the hunter will realize that s/he is amongst an anti-blood
sports group.
The time spent hunting which is appreciated with hunting groups has
another
meaning for this group. A new context is learned. Learning at this
logical level is not
about behaviour but about the categories of contextual organization of
behaviour (e.g.,
Bateson 1979, p.134). "

ah, but you see, the survival advantage would be only for those who
evolved under those conditions of harsh dangerous winters.  s.a.d.
would not be a survival advantage to us today. likewise, in times past,
people might have a survival advantage if they had the ability to convert
their food to fat, all the better to survive winter's scarcity.  that same
advantage is to most moderns a curse, where the next meal is always as
close as the corner grocery store or mcdonalds, if not the twinkies
in our our own kitchens.

  IAN: Yes! I just transcribed that myself after 
  printing it from the microfilm at the library.

  The featured scientist, Dr Delgado, also wrote 
  a book called "Physical Control of the Mind: 
  Toward a Psychocivilized Society." It seems, 
  if much of the material on him on the net is 
  true, that he was a open advocate for the mass 
  implantation of brain chips -- chips a'hoy! -- 
  to reach the goal of a "Psychocivilized Society."
  The military has been vary interested in his work.

  IAN: I wondered how could it be that 33 years 
  after that article was written it still sounds
  like science fiction. I found it fascinating 
  because whenever the topic of remote mind 
  control comes up, the routine reaction seems 
  to be claims that it cannot be done, that it's 
  crazy talk and then the next things mentioned 
  are usually Elvis, UFOs, and Area 51 -- but 
  not necessarily in that order. I guess that 
  makes it all the more eerie when you uncover 
  a 33 year old article where what I'm told by 
  educated people cannot to be done today, was 
  done routinely almost a half century ago. Do
  you realize how much all sciences have evolved
  since 1965? 65 was virtually the stone age; com-
  puters that fit in your hand then were 5000 lbs.

  The status of the type of mind control experi-
  ments conducted by Dr Delgado seems to be of the 
  classified military variety. In fact, it was such 
  classified research that the US military contracted 
  Dr Delgado to do. It's a pretty disturbing situation 
  if we can see it through the haze of "crazy, UFO, 
  Area 51" rhetoric. I got the cite for the article
  I just transcribed from on of these articles,  
  which have some surprising information:

I'm not a minister. I'm a psychologist. I have heard us referred 
to, however, as secular priests.  I actually like that term. 
I don't know what to tell you about "why that is".  It's Dallas. . . 
it's conservative.  I once made a reference to the Men's  
movement . . . and the 5 women in the room there gave me 
the kind of look you might see a a dog make after moving his 
food dish.  "Why would MEN need a movement?" one of 
them said.  "Because men are also victims of social 
conditioning and stereotypes." I said.  But their heads 
remained cocked with that confused expression on their
faces.  All they understood was that men seemed to have 
more money and more power and the idea that this might 
not be a healthy situation never crossed their mind.
For me to go even further and announce that their
god is a famtasy would have been to commit political suicide.  
Since I don't care what they think, why should I do something 
like that?

For a poetic restatement of the transhumanist movement:
http://deoxy.org/l_digpol.htm

Timothy Leary is definitely extropian. It seems that he read off the
Principals verbatim. He's got self-ownership and most of the other
principals in there as well as methods for obtaining extropian goals.
Timothy Leary has surprised me again and again for his uncanny awareness and
insight.

Jose Delgato of Yale University was as much a showman as a scientist,
he dressed up as a matador when he did his bull stunt, but I have to admit
it was an interesting show. He wrote a book "Physical Control of the Mind:
Toward a Psychocivilized Society", another old book that has a lot about
him is "The Brain Changers"  by Maya Pines. Both books are probably long
out of print. Delgato did most of his work in the 50's and 60's and you
don't hear much about him nowadays, his style of research is out of fashion
and not politically correct.

He also did some work on humans. He approached several people about to
undergo brain surgery for medical reasons, and asked them if he could implant
some electrodes in their brain at the same time. Some agreed. In one case,
when the electrode was fired the man would always turn his head to the left.
The interesting  thing was that the man said he felt free, he couldn't even tell
when the electrode was turned on. The patient was always able to come up
with good reasons for turning to the left. He would say "I'm looking for my slippers"
or "I'm restless" or "I heard a noise" or "I was looking under the bed". This man
was intelligent and rational, he never said I'm looking for Martians, and felt
perfectly free. In all cases he thought turning his head was his own idea,
he felt free because he was, he was doing what he wanted to do.

I think the man was perfectly correct when he said "I'm looking
for my slippers" that's exactly what he was doing. Nobody could convince
him that he didn't really want his slippers because he truly did,
he just didn't understand why he wanted them.

Just this year in the journal Nature, I think it was in March, there was
a related article by Itzhak Fried. Dr Fried was applying an electrical
probe to various spots on the brain of a girl to find the source of her
epileptic seizures, when they give a small jolt at one spot the girl smiled,
when they gave a larger jolt she erupted into robust contagious
laughter. It was no mere reflex either, she was in a grim looking operating
room, she was  fighting for her life, her head was cut open, and she found
humor in the situation. At one point she looked at her masked surgeons and
said "You guys are just so funny standing around".

  IAN: Curious. I was just wondering what remotely 
  induced thought/actions would appear like to the 
  actor, and it occurred to me that they may always 
  seem to be self-originated, since the brain would
  assume anything coming from inside it (including 
  an impulse from a implant inside it) is itself; it 
  would evoke no anti-bodies, so to say, in responce 
  to the alien invasion. An implant would slip into 
  the thing known as "myself," and thus the mind
  could not perceive it as being other than self.

  The man's experience also indicates that subtle
  thoughts can be induced that serve to justify 
  the actions the stimulus effects. The head is
  not just turned, but is so for a reason ex-
  pressed as a set of thoughts and/or feelings.

  It's all very fascinating from a philosophical 
  point of view, with respect to the concepts of
  self, free will, what and who is "the actor."

  If remote brain control is someone controlling
  another thing, what controls the brain locally?
  I'd say the brain is a set of systems that have
  learned to control each other. Slip a new system
  in, and each subsystem assumes this new system is
  one of the team, and thus "I wanted to turn my head."

Yes, imagine the possibilities of advanced mind control 
technology. The mind boggles! Apart from the obvious
World Domination stuff, there are many potentially useful
and profitable commercial applications. For example:
forget drugs and those primitive mind-machines with flashing
lights; you could build a "mind helmet" that stimulates
specific areas in the amygdala and hippocampus by means
of microwaves (separate low-power beams set to converge in 
the area of choice), inducing "a variety of effects, including 
lust, pleasant sensations, elation, deep thoughtful concentration, 
odd feelings, super relaxation (an essential precursor for deep hypnosis), colored
visions, and other responses."

Even a machine with just one setting, pleasure, would be
an absolutely unbeatable product (and a very transhuman 
one too: now you control your own emotions). The stuff that 
dreamsare made of. Now of course follows the inevitable 
question: why hasn't this been done yet? Do only implants 
have this effect (even then there would be many possible 
applications), or are the results too varied to create a viable 
product around the concept of "outside" (microwave etc.) 
brain stimulation?

If Delgrado's work has simply been forgotten, then wouldn't
it be time to put it to good use? The marketing possibilities
of pure emotions should make any red-blooded capitalist
salivate... ;-)

Michael Gazzanaga has tackled this issue in his research
with split brain patients (those whose brain hemispheres
have been disconnected).  Without getting into his experiments
in detail, I'll just say that he basically observed the same
phenomenon.  The left (verbal) brain for asked to account for an
action taken by the right brain.  It had no way of truly knowing
why the right side did what it did because it couldn't communicate
with it.  So it constructed a story.  It constructed meaning, obliged
to make sense of itself as a whole.

Gazzanaga surmised that the brain is not just made of two compartments,
left and right, it's made of large numbers of subsystems all with their own
responsibilities.  Many or perhaps all of the subsystems just do what they
do, but there is a particular subsystem somewhere on the left side that is
responsible for watching the actions taken by the other subsystems.  That
particular subsystem has the task of translating it all into a cohesive
storyline
that explains everything in context.  So do we have free will?  I think that
Gazzanaga would say that's pretty much an illusion.

As for stimulating cortical neurons during open brain surgery to identify
areas associated with epileptic seizures, this technique is very old and was
originated by Wilder Penfield. He was also fascinated by the bizarre array
of sensations and memories that he could elicit from his patients.  People
could smell and taste things. One person heard a song start to play when
a certain spot was stimulated.  When the stimulation stopped so did the
song, then when the stimulation was reapplied the song would start over at
the beginning.  Weird, huh?  Another person had the distinct impression that
he had left his body suggesting that out-of-body experiences and the portion
of near-death experiences where they float above their bodies are natural
phenomena.  Penfield wrestled with the nature of the mind and actually
decided
at the end of his life that there was indeed a spiritual side to it.  I
never did
understand his reasoning, though.

B.F. Skinner only used food pellets with his subjects. He did not implant
anything into the brain of his animals. A "Skinner Box" is just a box that
has levers in it, when one of the levers is pressed, a food pellet is
released. Skinner studied classical and operant conditioning, he was not a
biologist researching the brain.

Someone else must have used Skinner's work for inspiration that led to
direct stimulation.

One of my favorite SF writers, Greg Egan, has dealt with this brilliantly,
especially in Quarantine, and some of the stories in Axiomatic (inc. the
title story). For instance, in the novel, the neurotechnologically
augmented private eye is given a "loyalty mod" by a mysterious group. He
*knows* that he has an implant that makes him want to serve the group, yet
he really *does* want to serve it. Egan does a good job examining how his
character deals with this dissonance.

Marc Steigler's wonderfully extropian story, "The Gentle Seduction"
(reprinted in Nanodreams) does something like you mention. His character
receives an implant bestowing mathematical abilities. The new calculative
abilities seem to the person to come not from an external device, but from
her own mind. That's the way a good interface should be! Perhaps that is
one mark of an enhancement/augmentation vs. the addition of a separate device.

How does that show that free will is an illusion? I think it shows that we
do not have good introspective access to our internal processes. To
understand what's happening in our minds, we need science and technology,
not just introspection. But I don't see that Gazzaniga's results indicate
that we have no free will, if this term is used in some realistic way. By
"realistic" I mean in a sense like self-control rather than in a non-causal
way. I can't point to any work on free will that I find satisfactory, but
probably the best is Daniel Dennett's "Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free
Will Worth Wanting." Dennett takes a naturalistic approach to the subject.

I guess I'm using the term free will to mean purposeful action free from
subconscious or environmental determinants, predispositions, or influence.

I'm not comfortable trying to represent Gazzanaga's views since I don't
currently own and can't refer to any of his books or articles.  But it just
seemed to me that:

(A1)   if, as I believe he suggests, a part of my brain is constructing a
          best-fit storyline to account for the actions of other neural sub-
          systems, and
(A2)   if this story is a mixture of interpretation and confabulation, and
(A3)   if I perceive that *I* am the story being told by the story-teller,
then

(B)     Isn't the notion of self an illusion?  (and isn't this an
increasingly
          popular theory among consciousness researchers?)

So where is free will being expressed?  Can free will exist if the self is
an illusion?  It's not being expressed by my story-teller. He's not
directing activity, he's just trying to make sense of everything the sub-
systems are doing.  So is free will being expressed by the individual
sub-system or groups of sub-systems?  Maybe.  I don't know.

I'll withhold extended discussion until I've had a chance to read Dennett's
book.  Thanks for the reference, Max.  I enjoyed his interview on the PBS
series, "The Glorious Accident".   I look forward to reading a more in-
depth discussion on the matter because, like you, I believe that technology
will be our ticket to increased levels of free will.

Nick Bostrom suggested that he & I take public our private 
conversation about definitions of transhumanism.  I proposed:

   Transhumanism is the idea that new technologies are likely
   to change the world so much in the next century or two that 
   our descendants will in many ways no longer be "human." 

This definition focuses on positive, not normative, beliefs. 
To those who think that a definition should focus on normative
beliefs I ask:  Why do there seem to be so few people who share
our positive beliefs but not our normative beliefs?  That is, 
where are the people who believe that big technology-induced
change is coming, and think that is a terrible thing?  

I see three possible explanations:
1) People differ much more on normative than positive beliefs. 
   So most who accept our positive beliefs naturally accept our 
   normative beliefs.  This suggests the above definition.
2) Those who think big bad change will happen prefer to ignore
   the future and think mainly about today.  Optimists tend to
   be more vocal.
3) When thinking about the future, most people succumb to wishful
   thinking, and so choose positive beliefs based on normative ones.
   So those who think big techno-driven change is OK are willing 
   to think it will happen.  And those who think such change is bad
   believe that it isn't likely.  Wishful thinking can be partially
   rationalized by believing that humanity can stop new technologies
   that threaten unwelcome change.

                      How to grow fresh Air
         50 houseplants that purify your home or office
                       Dr. B.C. Wolverton
                       ISBN 0-14-026243-1

I was stumbling around shopping yesterday when I encountered this
book. I was delighted since I was very impressed with a 1984 paper
this guy did as part of NASA research.

Basically they were doing closed ecosystem work, and discovered
that a number of common houseplants had the ability to remove
environmental toxins like formaldehyde, xylene, benzene, toluene,
acetone and others directly from the air.

Now in book form it sums up some 25 years of research in this area.
The book list 50 common plants in the order of their effectiveness
and gives additional data to support the research, as well as easy
to care instructions.

One of the more interesting ideas is that these plants emit
phytochemicals into the air that suppress mold spores and bacteria.

Got a case of SBS (sick building syndrome) or just want to live  a
little healthier? You'll find this interesting.

  IAN: Such may evidence that there is no spiritual
  entity. If there were, and if it was aware of the 
  "alien control" of its brain (tool), then one would
  assume that there should be a conflict, as in the 
  case where someone steals your property. But if 
  there is no ghost in the box, then if you simply 
  just flip the "I want to do x" switch, voila "I 
  want to do x." So, it seems that there's no spirit-
  ual overseer, simply a set of interacting systems that 
  evolved into a large system (brain) wherein systems 
  follow commands sent from other subsystems, and the 
  implant is automatically accepted as a system member,
  and therefore, what it wants to do, "I want to do."

  Since the incidence of brain implantation intended
  to seize control of a brain is virtually unheard of 
  in the natural world, brains never had to evolve 
  strategies to detect and repel such invasion, 
  and as a result, it can occur with impunity.

  IAN: And with the implants that they have now,
  into which neurones actually grow and attach 
  themselves directly to the electrodes(!), the 
  concept of "self" and "other" really dissolves. 

  If we also say, the "self" of X is that which 
  X has produced according to its genetic code,
  such that the bones in my foot are "Ian" since
  they were constructed by me as per my DNA code.
  In the same way, the implants were constructed
  by humans as per their DNA code that allows for 
  the development of advanced technologies. So in
  effect, the collective human entity has evolved
  a more dynamic evolution strategy, one that is
  expressed by the invention of new technologies
  and application of them to current survival. 
  In this way, all of our gadgets are natural,
  and bionic implants are natural evolutions.

The use of the word "descendants" is problematical.

What does that mean -- positive beliefs?  How does the set "positive
beliefs" differ from the set "beliefs"?

People believe what they want to.  I know lots of people who believe that
a big technology-induced change is coming, and that technology is a
terrible thing.  They /all/ believe that civilization will collapse,
or in some way change to bring things more in line with /their/ desires.
It is a very similar mindset, I think, to the Christian who thinks the world
is corrupt and full of sin, and headed for an apocalypse in which it will
get what it deserves.  I think it is an expression of sublimated feelings of
powerlessness and indignation.

Transhumanists believe things will change to conform to /their/ desires.
Maybe this is also an expression of some sublimated feelings.

  IAN: There is an external electrical mind control
  technology on the market. Unlike the flashing light 
  and sound machines, it delivers an electric impulse
  via clips placed on the ear lobes, and by that means 
  "entrains" the brain to follow the impulse frequency,
  and the general aim is to induce deep relaxation.

  My best "spiritual" experiences, one that I mention 
  on one of my pages: http://Ian.Goddard.net/iam-free.htm 
  wherein I saw blazing and ego-dissolving white light, a
  profound experience of epic proportions, occurred whilst
  the Alpha-Stim (tm) electrodes were attached to my ear 
  lobes... mechanical nirvana! Of course, in each case I 
  was also practicing mediation on a regular basis, and
  should note that I have used the Alpha-Stim device many 
  times, and 99.9% of the time it just relaxes you, but
  on a few occasions, I really did "see the light." It
  seemed that in that light, all questions were answered, 
  and I realized directly that "I am" is eternal and all-
  pervasive, free from any finite place in space-time.

  Such consciousness, if true, is not a local spirit with 
  thoughts, but is the very field of space and time itself.

  Of course, I always approach that experience as potent-
  ially false, and thus test it occurring to logical rule,
  and it seems to adhere to the logic that is found in the 
  relations of numbers: http://Ian.Goddard.net/yoga.htm

There are a lot of people who believe this, but the change they foresee
is different from what we anticipate.  They expect ecological disaster,
overpopulation, melting of the ice caps, famine, etc.  Everyone would
agree that if these things happen, it would be terrible.

These eco-disaster views are very common, in my experience, more so than
anything approaching transhumanism.  You frequently see it in sci-fi
movies and TV, with the Star Trek series being the main exception.

Perhaps what is happening is that people express their differing views
more in terms of what changes they expect than in terms of how they
would react to changes.

It is the fact/value is/ought distinction.  Positive beliefs are

If so, don't we need to admit that our beliefs about big change are

Here's a possible line of reasoning for Penfield's conclusion that life has
a spiritual side. Electrical stimulation of certain parts of the brain can
produce subjective impressions of taste, smell and sound. Stimulations of
other parts can produce subjective impressions of OBE's, or NDE's (which, I
take it as given, are not to be classified as ordinary dreams).

In the case of the former sorts of 'experiences,' the natural explanation is
something along the lines of the brain being 'fooled' into thinking that it
is receiving the type of stimulation which it should 'flesh out' as a taste,
smell or sound, a recognitional/experiential capacity which has evolved
through the brain's interaction with the physical world over the many eons
of its existence.

Why shouldn't we give the same explanation in the case of the latter sorts
of 'experiences'? In those cases the brain is 'fooled' into thinking it is
encountering the circumstances which it normally fleshes out as an OBE.

In the first type of case, it seems clear that the brain has developed this
type of recognitional/experiential capacity to deal with something beyond
itself. Why shouldn't the same be true of the second type of
recognitional/experiential capacity? Why would the brain have evolved a
recognitional capacity for something that doesn't actually occur?

If OBE's are real, then consciousness can survive outside the body, and life
may have a spiritual side.

I'm not saying this was Penfield's reasoning......

My personal definition is, Transhumans: People who consciously seeks the
advancement of the individual and the society through technology and
Culture.

I know that it is a pretty open definition but I think it has to be, as not
to lock people, who are positively biased toward transhumanism, up in
beliefs they cannot agree with. Not to force them out by their own beliefs
so to speak.

>Why do there seem to be so few people who share
>our positive beliefs but not our normative beliefs

I think that it is caused by Hypocrisy and the schism there is today between
reality and peoples perception of it caused by media and education.

We all want better, cheaper, healthier and longer lasting farming goods.
This we get from the supermarket, and as consumers it is our birthright. We
are told constantly.

We don't want pesticides, hormones, irrigation, Mad Cow Diseases etc.
This we get from the farmers, the industry and the business.

You could basically say the same things for a lot of industries: Automobile,
computer, chemical, power etc. etc.

People are told that the problems are caused by technology and science.

The benefits most people just take for granted.

More or less.

The funny thing is that the snafu's of science and technology is described
and reported systematically and vigorously by media, as it should be, while
most of the snafu's of the lack of critical thinking is only described when
something goes really wrong. Like religious mass suicides etc.

Most people want to make their life better through technology. And they are
already doing it actively. They just don't think of it that way because they
are conditioned to think about it in a much more convoluted way.

My proposed definition:

   Transhumanism is the idea that new technologies are likely
   to change the world so much in the next century or two that 
   our descendants will in many ways no longer be "human." 

looks not at all big technolgy induced change, but at change that would
make our descedants no longer human.  The changes you cite do not threaten
folks "humanity."  It doesn't sound like you disapprove of my definition.

I don't think B follows from A. The description in A fits my current model of
how brains work quite well. But the "story-teller" is just one neural
subsystems. For me, concepts like "free will" apply at the level of interactions
between the subsystems. Observing that the subsystems are too simple to support
the behavior of the total system is normal for complex systems.

 Its a pet peeve of mine that when I say that the human behavior is based on the
firing of neurons, some people jump to, "you think we are just a bundle of
neurons". The "just" takes out most of the interesting stuff about how the brain
works, and rather misrepresents my view. I like the "Society of Mind" model
which I think Scott is referring to. But I don't think it implies the brain is
"just" a collection of neural sub-systems. The "story-teller" may be an
important part of the perception of self, but without the other parts, it would
have no stories to tell.

Robin,

I have been given the task of running an initial edit on the FAQ, and I 
have taken your comments into account while I do so.  I think that we 
have done a good job of defining 'transhuman', but that proposed 
definitions for 'transhumanism' are narrow and a bit murky. 

In a nutshell, I am editing the definition of 'transhumanism' to make it
a two-part definition to emphasize it as (1) an area of thought and (2)
as an area of endeavor.  

If I understand the process correctly, after the initial edit people 
wil have another opportunity to comment.  But I would like to be given 
the opportunity to present a coherent set of revisions, otherwise we 
will be spinning this debate into an overly-extended time period.

I think a critical issue with a macro assembler is positioning. Once you can
position components accurately and verify that they are there, you can also
position work tools and build the components. I don't think lego blocks give you
a lot of inherent clues about their position. Still, I agree availability is a
big plus. A lot depends on the functionality of the active components they
provide.

 I've been thinking about macro-assemblers for a long time. The model I have
been thinking about I call the Universal Fabricator Replicator (UFR), on the
principle that any engineering project needs an obscure acronym :-). It useful
feature is that it can disassemble anything it builds. Building one off things
out of generalized robust components seems likely to be more expensive than
using bulk technology. But when you can download a new design for you living
room, and simply disassemble the old one to make the new, you are into a whole
new ball game. Like nanotech, you drop much of the bulk transport and central
manufacturing. Even with nanotech, it may be energetically cheaper to assemble
large objects from largish (millimeter?) components.

A very interesting report in the latest Science News 
(10/17/98, 154:16) on artifical night illumination,
its effects on melitonin and thereby on cancer. 
Unfortunately it's not an article selected for 
their website (http://www.sciencenews.org).

The Sceince News article states:

 "Exposure to light at night can disrupt the body's 
 production of melatonin, a brain hormone best known 
 for its daily role in resetting the body's biological 
 clock... Some researcher's have speculated that chron-
 ically decreasing nocturnal melatonin production -- 
 as with light -- might increase an individual's risk 
 of developing estrogen-related malignancies, such 
 as breast cancer.

 Two studies in Nordic populations now offer tentative 
 support for this idea.

 According to neuroendocrinologist Russel J. Reiter 
 of the University of Texas Health Sciences Center 
 at San Antonio, the emerging science indicates that, 
 functionally, "light is a drug" -- and that "by 
 abusing it, we risk imperiling our health.""

Gee, I guess this means the FDA will have to regulate light. 
The National Health Care System can no longer afford the high 
costs of the cancer rate, the FDA therefore decrees that all 
lights be turned off at 10pm. The SN article also states:

 "...researcher's have shown that melatonin also 
 functions as an antioxidant (SN:8/14/93, p. 109) 
 and an anticarcinogen."

Hmm, weren't we supposed to become our own successors

Naysayers suggest that the brain developed this capacity to disassociate
as an escape from things like imminent physical death.  I know about the
Pediatrician studying children's NDEs who has suggested that there is a
place in the brain (in the Sylvian fissure of the right temporal lobe) that
is
triggered during times of tremendous physical stress or at the moment of
death.  He alludes to this bundle of neurons as being our link to the
spiritual
world.  (sigh)  It seems a bit more parsimonious to assume that intense
levels of anxiety simply trigger dissociative phenomena.  It; probably just
an extension of the flight response.

Yes.  *If* is a big word, of course.

>I'm not saying this was Penfield's reasoning......


I don't recall this being his reasoning either, but he does discuss it in
his
last book written shortly before his own death.

Very interesting. But how do you communicate with anti-blood sports people
(who paradoxically may occasionally eat slaughtered meat) the facts that:

a) since 98%+ of the negative impact of mankind upon the ecology is due to
organized agriculture, NOT bloodsports, that their 'ecological reasons' are
total hogwash if they are eating grains, tofu, beans, etc. etc. etc which
destroy natural habitat.

b) since, as just posted on this list the facts that 1) low calorie diets
promote longevity, and 2) high carb vegetable diets cause much of the
Insulin Resistance effects associated with aging, and 3) wild game meat is
extremely low in fats, cholesterol, and are high in useful protein (as
opposed to farm bred animals), that

c) living on and practicing a diet based on wild game caught via 'blood
sports' is actually a more ecologically concious and healthy lifestyle than
protecting, practicing and promoting an organized agriculture based
vegetarian diet.... they should go out, get off their butts and hunt down
and kill their own food. Its much better exercise as well....

Except that the Eskimo, Inuit, Laplanders, and other longer term inhabitants do
not have such a high level of depression. Only the latecomers (i.e. since the
aryan migration) have such a high level of depression. This indicates that such
inhabitants have not yet adapted to the high latitudes. Remember that depression
leads to a lowered interest in sex, so a depressed individual would be less
likely to reproduce....no matter how much time spent inside. Also, since people
with an SAD problem are more likely to want to get out in the rare sun at high
latitudes (since the light does alleviate their problems), they would be more
likely to freeze to death or get eaten by predators...

Until 10,000 years ago, the ice sheets stretched down to the Black Sea and
Wisconsin, so I wouldn't expect the cold to be a factor...

Yes, but make sure that the lamps being used are Full Spectrum lamps, which
provide as 'sun-like' a spectrum of light as possible with fluorescent
technology. Most occupational health people  will prescribe these as a
workplace solution to SAD.

Hmmm, I think you snipped the part of my post that addresses your
comments at least in part, but nevermind.  I still think B follows from A.
I assumed that my concept of my "self" *is* the story being told by the
story-teller module.  I also assumed that the story is the *product* of
the story-teller.  As a product, the story does not have the capacity to
act as an agent.  The story-teller is the agent, as are all the other
sub-systems and their interactions.  But the story itself has no inherent
causative capacity.  It may be reacted to once it is produced, but is not
a *direct* agent of change.  Thus the self cannot exert "free will".  (keep
in mind this is the argument as I understand it, not my personal philosophy
- I just enjoy advocating for the devil.)

So, I agree that the story-teller is one of many sub-systems and that it is
the complex interactions between subsystems which are required to
support the total organism.  Now . . . you postulate that "free will"
applies
at the level of sub-system interactions.  My question then is, "Are
sub-system interactions conscious or unconscious processes?"  My
understanding was that they are not.  So how can "free will" be an
unconscious process?

Right, I never meant to diminish the importance of the other parts.  In
fact,
if anything, I may have been implying the opposite.

Perhaps what Phil meant (at least what I would mean had I said this!) is
that transhumanists do not merely say that our descendents will no longer
be human, but that, if we're lucky, *we* ourselves may be no longer human.
By putting "descendants" into the definition, you're unnecessarily
restricting it.

They might exist, yet not have web pages and thoughtful articles. There
certainly are plenty of such people. One writer who comes to mind is the
Christian fundamentalist Texe Marrs. In his book Mega Forces he seems to
expect many of the technologies we talk about, but it's certainly not a
good thing from his point of view, except in so far as it's a sign of the
End Times that will provoke God to return to Earth... Also, I have found
plenty of people who, when I explain transhumanist expectations for the
future, seem to accept that they are possible and likely and yet who find
the idea repellant. I must have come across hundreds of these responses
when giving talks and in classes I teach.

I do think that there is a strong positive correlation between confidence
that these transhuman changes will happen, and a favorable attitude towards
them. But this is far from a perfect correlation.

(1) Like Phil Goetz, I think it's a mistake to include "descendants" here.
Just about all the transhumanists I know think there's a reasonable chance
that they, and not just their descendants, will no longer be human in the
future. Your definition will, I believe, lead people to think that we see
these changes as too far ahead for ourselves. While some of us may believe
this, and others are unsure, many obviously do not.

(2) Is it relevant to specify the time period of "a century or two". If
someone thinks it will take 300, 400, or 500 years, are they not a
transhumanist? The one-two century time frame probably does include most
self-described transhumanists. But if this is to be in the definition it
needs to be qualified... "change the world so much in the future (perhaps
within a century or two)..."

(3) Yes, I do think that a definition should focus on normative issues.
Transhumanism is and always has been a normative affair. The positive (in
the sense you mean) belief in this coming change is a matter of future
studies rather than of transhumanism itself. "Transhumanism" naturally
grows out of humanism. Humanism clearly was and is a normative view as well
as a positive view. Humanism without its values (as stated in Corliss
Lamont's Humanist Manifesto, or in Free Inquiry, or in the works of Paul
Kurtz), would not be humanism. Humanists not only believe progress to be
possible, they seek certain goals and values. Transhumanism follows suit,
except that it has a more radical notion of progress.

When I first used the term "transhumanism", deriving it from the existing
term "transhuman", my definition (1990) was normative. Earlier this year we
spent some time examining and improving that definition. (Generally it's
appropriate to refer to past work on the same topic.) Here it is:

TRANSHUMANISM: Any philosophy of life that seeks the acceleration of our
development beyond its current human limitations by means of science,
technology, creativity, and other rational methods.

I think there is room for improvement here, but I think that re-defining
transhumanism to exclude normativity turns it into something else.

Definitions generally are either lexical/reportive, or stipulative (though
several other categories exist). A lexical definition reports on how a term
is typically used. A stipulative definition gives a new meaning for a
particular purpose, or to remove vagueness. (The latter being a "precising
definition".) I contend that normative views are a standard part of the use
of the term "transhumanism". Giving a new stipulative definition like this
might be handy in some contexts. To present it as the main definition would
be misleading and inconsistent with its roots and history.

In a previous post I noted that there are such people. Overall though, I
agree that those who expect transformative change to happen tend to favor
it. But why is this a reason for making a definition non-normative? The
normative aspect of a definition imply factual expectations -- we wouldn't
bother to value and *seek* becoming posthuman if we thought it impossible.
My definition, or something like it, includes the positive views while
stating the normative concerns that have always characterized
transhumanism. Why cut out the heart of this world-view?

Onward!

   Hi.  I'm very new here.  I wondered if it would correct etiquette to ask for any
more information anyone has on CNTs and perhaps the constuction of them.  I'm
looking to expand a previous scholarship essay.  In that strange limbo between rich
and poor, knowlegable and brilliant, deserving and...maybe not, it's quite a game to
get to college.  Actually, if anyone has any info that might help with that little
problem as well, it'd be much appreciated.

Sorry, this wasn't meant as a "how to communicate with prejudiced people." (Not
referring to you) - the point of reference was to show that there are many
levels of "change in learning" which would cause one to be weary of
communicating with a prejudiced group.

Yes. I'm always pruning to keep the traffic down a bit. Sometimes I overdo it.
I'm on a cable modem connection at the moment, but am sometimes on links much
slower and more expensive.

 If you assume the *self* is the story-teller module, I agree all else follows.
But I see the story-teller module as a critical component in the *self*, but not
the whole story. And I for one am satisfied with a pretty weak definition of
free will, a Turing Test version. If the organism acts like it has free will, it
has free will. The pure purposeful action free from subconscious or
environmental determinants, predispositions, or influence seems like a Platonic
ideal to me.

Consciousness is an even bigger headache to explain. Its beyond me. But at a
handwaving level, I think it is another function of the complex interactions
between subsystem components. I used to keep ants as pets as a kid, and was
always impressed how the apparently simple behavior of each ant interacted to
produce a complex organism (the nest). So its plausible to me that interactions
could lead to some powerful effects.

 I've just finished reading Pinkers "How the Mind Works". He argues at the end
of that that our mind, designed by natural selection, may not have the equipment
to understand consciousness. In the sense of sentience that is.

 Dennet is coming here (St. John's, Newfoundland) for a philosophy of mind
conference Nov 6th. Perhaps that will give me more of a clue on the subject.

Then we don't have free will and I'm glad we don't, otherwise we might as
well be deaf and blind because the external world would have no effect
on our thoughts or actions. Who wants that?

I don't think a definition is even needed but if you insist on one
I still think mine is the best, a being has free will if it can not always predict
what he will do next until he actually does it. Turing proved in 1935 that a
computer has that property, even a robot does not feel like a robot, it has free will.

Actually I B.A. major was in Religious Studies and minor was in Chemistry.
I soon realized that a major in Religious Studies did not lead to good
job prospects so I have studied in areas which are both interesting
as well as more financially rewording.

Concerning the comment by Scott Badger about the difficulty of admitting
to being an Agnostic or an Atheist, there are some parts of this country
where this is the case.  Some people seem to have a vague sense that
an unbeliever has poor moral and ethical character.  

Unfortunately the problem is more widely spread than many people 
realize.

This does not correspond to my experience, in which such people outnumber the
optimists.  While three out of four people who contact me are enthusiastic,
explaining nanotechnology/uploading/Singularity to an intelligent person (who
is a relative or acquaintance but not a known Extropian), ten out of fifteen
believe and eight of those ten are frightened.  Technophilia for modern
gadgets predicts belief but not optimism.

Of course, certain over-optimistic Utopian-enthusiastic warfare-ignoring
positive-feedback-atheist personality-persisting fantasy-of-omnipotence
formulations may tend to produce optimism among those credible enough to
believe it.

Transhumanism is the idea that future technology will probably improve
dramatically on the human body and the human mind.  We or our descendants, in
five years or five hundred, may transcend so many limitations that we will no
longer be recognizably human - or even mortal.

Acceleration of development is not necessarily required to go beyond
current human limitations, particularly on the timescale of a century
or two mentioned in this thread.  I don't care for stipulating
acceleration because it is practically impossible to measure something
like human development, but acceleration implies some form of 
measurement.

very interesting tho.

i have been toying with the idea that humans might be able to evolve
more quickly than other mammals because we enjoy a lower level of
randomness in our mating and reproduction.  has this notion been
explored?  where?  if this idea has any merit, then humans are developing
the ability to evolve ever more quickly as we develop more sophisticated
technology.  i sure hope so.  spike

its more than a vague sense fred.  i have tried to gently explain to people
that i am a former christian now atheist.  they seem utterly baffled that
such a thing is even possible.  conversations can go thus:

they:  i dont understand how you can stand there and say you are an atheist.
me:  i just did.
they:  but if that is true, why would you not just go out without any moral
constraint and do exactly whatever you want?
me:  i am doing exactly whatever i want.
they:  no i mean, why dont you just go and just sin like crazy.
me:  because i am sane.   i am without religion, not without morals.
they, still not getting it:  so, are you part of some... cult or something?
me, with a blank stare:  we...are...not...a...cult.
they...are...my...friends.

that last bit works if they have any sense of humor, which is seldom
the case when dealing in religious topics...  {8^D spike

Agreed. The "acceleration" bit was one of the imperfections I was thinking
of in my message to Robin. Why not just just take out "the acceleration of"?

Also, "...creativity, and other rational methods" might sound odd, since it
might seem to be implying that creativity is a rational procedure in the
sense of following a well-defined algorithm. Perhaps: "by means of science,
technology, creativity, and any rational means."  [Maybe use "effective"
instead of "rational".]

Seems a bit elaborate as a flight response. Wouldn't fainting be simpler?

In any case, I'm not hung up on OBE's per se. It's just that I've gotten a
bit suspicious of the practice of explaining much of the standard range of
paranormal phenomena as products of the unconscious mind. If I say that
there's a tree outside my window, no one - except perhaps a Berkeleian
philosopher - would say 'That's just a product of your conscious mind.' Why
shouldn't the unconscious mind be just as much of an experiencing instrument
as the conscious mind is acknowledged to be? In some ways this is the more
parsimonious assumption. Put the 'P' back in ESP?

Hmmm.  Why not lose the "probably" in the definition, and then allow each
person to qualify it for themselves?  If transhumanism "is the idea future
technology *will* improve dramatically ... etc" then it allows me to say "I
think transhumanism is probably true," or "I'm quite certain transhumanism
is true," or "I think that there's a remote but nonetheless significant
change that transhumanism is true," or even "transhumanism probably isn't
true" etc.

Just my $0.02.

Nick tried to include this in this thread earlier, and I stopped him because
I typed it off-the cuff.  But it is actually a good explanation of my
thinking of how I decided to restructure the approach to defining
transhumanism.  I no longer think that transhumanism can be defined in one part.


.....But, to define 'transhumanism', one should describe it as an area of
human thought and endeavor focusing on certain ideas and certain avenues of
research, which can include technology, sociology, psychology, art, etc.  Of
which the object is the 'transhuman', or trying to become one.  In other
words, the 'transhuman' or 'posthuman' represents a concrete manifestation
of 'tranhumanism'.  

Transhumanism, in its barest form, could be defined in dictionary format in
two parts as (i) 'the field of study focusing on the transhuman' and (ii)
'the set of human endeavors to become a transhuman.'  If we set up a
two-part expanded definition paralleling this in the FAQ, it would go a long
way towards resolving the stupid endless argument between the technologists
and philosophers that has plagued us since the beginning.  I've been
thinking in dictionary terms lately, because the editors of the OED are in
fact considering adding these two terms to the OED, and they are tending
towards this sort of structure in a definition as well.

I still have a problem with an absolutist statement. I prefer to look at
'transhumanity' as a state an individual is in relative to the current or past
population. Since even when suprehuman uploaded or AI intelligences are common,
there will still be a large number of not only unaugmented, but still relatively
savage lifestyle living individuals, using the term to apply to the entire race is
a bit disingenuous.

	I wouldn't reccomend switching to "effective."  Everyone claims
that their means for achieving a goal are effective.  When we say
"rational," that demonstrates our methodology for determining what is
effective.

How about "by rational use of science, technology, creativity and 
other means".  I think leaving some reference reason is important, 
science I can think of many irrational uses of science, technology...

This definition leaves out any set of values and transhumanism not not just
about technology.

Although I appreciate your definition of transhumanism, I thought that we
spent considerable time on this many months ago.  At that time we went over
the original definition and discussed possibilities for wording.  Nick was
active on this thread.  

I'm pleased with both FM-2030's definition of transhumanism and Max More's
original definition of transhumanism which appears to be going into a
public dictionary.  If WTA wants to have its own definition, this is fine,
as there will be many definitions of transhumanism according to many
different organizations.  However, how many disparate definitions do we
have for humanism, and is reference given to the original definition?

I understand that as Editor of WTA's journal, you might feel that it is a
good idea to create a new definition, but I am not sure that this is
appropriate so early. Is there a better way to deal with this?

Title
  Comparison of the prediction by 27 different factors of coronary heart
  disease and death in men and women of the Scottish Heart Health Study: cohort
  study [published erratum appears in BMJ 1998 Jun 20;316(7148):1881].

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To compare prediction by 27 different factors in men and women of
  coronary heart disease events, coronary deaths, and deaths from all causes.
  DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Scottish population study. SUBJECTS: In 1984-7
  random sampling of residents aged 40-59 produced 11,629 men and women who
  generated survey clinic questionnaires, examination findings, and blood and
  urine specimens. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Subsequent death, coronary artery
  surgery, and myocardial infarction. Risks were calculated for each category
  of factor or fifth of continuous variables. 27 factors were ranked by
  descending age adjusted hazard ratio of the top to bottom class in each
  factor, by sex and end point. RESULTS: Follow up averaged 7.6 years, during
  which the 5754 men had 404 coronary events, 159 coronary deaths, and 383
  deaths and the 5875 women 177, 47, and 208 respectively. The rankings for
  factors for the three end points were mainly similar in men and women,
  although hazard ratios were often higher in women. Classical risk factors
  ranked better for predicting coronary risk than newer ones. Yet strong
  prediction of coronary risk was no guarantee of significant prediction of all
  cause mortality. Findings included an anomalous coronary
  protective role for type A behaviour in women; raised plasma fibrinogen as a
  strong predictor of all end points; and an unexpectedly powerful protective
  relation of dietary potassium to all cause mortality.
  CONCLUSIONS: These initial unifactorial rankings and comparisons must be
  interpreted with caution until potential interaction, confounding, and
  problems of measurement and causation are further explored.

Need Interesting, Vibrant, Extropian Assistant

	Help, Before I sink!

	A cry of help rings out from a lifeboat in the midst of a dead sea of
intellectual mediocrity.

	By a quirk of fate, I'm stuck in a small to mid-sized Western
Pennsylvania town, surrounded by wonderfully honest, friendly,
hard-working but mostly unstimulating people.

	Here's what I have to offer my assistant:

1. A beautiful big new house to live in (Optional).
2. Free extropian chow (if you live-in).
3. Good company (me). 
4. An unusually great opportunity to earn a fantistic income, if:

a. You're an up-beat, positive energized person.
b. You're smarter than I am (Don't worry, I'm probably the
dumbest     							
   person on this list).
c. You're ambitious.
d. You can follow directions and be creative at the same time.
e. You're willing to kick me when I don't follow my own advice.
f. You're a non-smoker.
g. You don't do drugs.
h. You can breeze through a thorough background check (civil,     
   criminal, credit, references, etc.)
i. You take pride in your intellectual well-being.
j. You take pride in your physical well-being.
k. You're not obese.
l. You're not too arrogant to be my student, but you're strong
enough 		   to be my teacher.
m. You share my goal of an open-ended life-span.
n. You know or are willing to learn the basics of the financial     
   markets.
o. You have good telephone skills.
p. You're computer literate.
q. You're organized.
r. You're neat and clean. 
s. You're psychologically stable.
t. You're a anarchist at best... or a Libertarian at worst.
u. You're willing to temporarily relocate to Western Pennsylvania        
   (and maybe eventually to the San Diego area).

Here's a little about me:

	I'm a middle aged, single straight male. The biggest influences on my
life were Ayn Rand, Galambos and Wallace Ward (founder of Neo-Tech).

	I'm a long-term cryonicist. I work out every day; stick to a healthy
non-vegetarian diet; pop supplements like peanuts; drink a little; work
a lot; don't read as much as I should... or used to; run a successful
home-based financial/marketing business and discovered I was an
immortalist around 25 years ago.

	What I need is someone with an active brain to help keep me on my toes,
to share good conversation with when I have time, to cross-pollinate
ideas, to help me grow my business and to share the income it generates.

	What I need is a kindred spirit - male or female, black or white, young
or old. Someone with a thick skin and a tender heart. Someone who
absolutely loves life and can't get enough of it. 

	So if you qualify and are interested, then email me at 
<kekich@twd.net>. 

David A. Kekich

P.S. I can be bawdy at times and a gentleman at others. I read mostly
business materials because of time constraints, but I do enjoy SF when I
can. I watch a little TV, mostly golf, movies, a sitcom or two, news and
an occasional football game. I have a strong, written, committed
personal code of ethics; love to joke around and trade insults; sleep a
tad more than I should; enjoy the good fortune of having lots of
long-term wonderful friendships and am slowly making my dreams come
true.

Let me apologize to everyone if I gave the impression I was
trying to propose something official.  Nick suggested we take our 
private conversation public, but I should have thought more before 
doing so.

I am vaguely aware that there have been discussions on this topic 
before which I have not paid great attention to, and I am also aware
that there are various people and organizations which have a stake 
in making "official" definitions.  

As Natasha mentioned, I'm newly the chief editor of J. of 
Transhumanism, which aspires to be an academic quality journal.
This inspired me to think a bit more about what exactly 
"academic-style transhumanism" does or should mean.   

As Max mentions, there are various kinds of definitions of terms.
I don't have much respect for PR-inspired definitions, intended to 
convince everyone else that they were really transhumanists all 
along.  I'm much more interested in socially-functional definitions
that actually do distinguish people and things frequently called 
"transhumanist" from everything else out there.  

I agree that normative associations are strong in the way people
seem to use the term.  I am made suspicious by the striking 
correlation between believing big change is coming and believing 
that's probably a good thing.  So I'm not sure whether normative
claims are really the root of what makes us different.  But for 
now I relent and say:

   Transhumanism is the idea that new technologies are likely
   to change the world so much in the few centuries that we or 
   our descendants will in many ways no longer be "human,"   
   and that that's probably a not a bad thing. 

Again, I'm not proposing this for anything official - just 
thinking out loud.

Max More writes:

I do think that some sort of positive timing claim is needed, 
since I think if you push most thoughtful people they will admit 
such changes are quite possible over a time scale of say a 
billion years, and that such changes are probably not bad.  
Such people are not transhumanists in the usual usage of the term.

I'm concerned that this sort of definition isn't ideal for 
"academic-style transhumanism."  For this purpose, one wants to focus 
on the aspects of "transhumanism" of most interest to academics, most 
amenable to academic tools, and avoiding academic hot buttons.

Most academics consider themselves rational people contributing to
intellectual progress, and don't consider "philosophies of life" to be
terribly academic.  Max's definition seems a bit too imprecise for 
academic tastes, for example, being coy about what "limitations" are 
to be overcome.

This OED proposal looks fine by me, as I do see two distinct 
uses of the term, one positive and one normative.  Now what 
are they thinking of using to define "transhuman"?

I have a lot of sympathy for this, as it's pretty similar to my proposal.
But why just mention the body & mind?  Transhumanists seem to talk alot 
about improving a lot of other things as well.  (And why especially highlight 
the mortality issue?)

That's a reasonable point.  So I revise my thinking-out-loud definition to:

   Transhumanism is the idea that new technologies are likely
   to change the world so much in the few centuries that we or 
   many of our descendants will in many ways no longer be 
   "human," and that that's probably a not a bad thing.

I'd prefer saying it as "our descendants will be profoundly different from
ourselves" rather than as 'no longer be "human"'  Technically "human" 
would mean all characteristics of modern humans, including the bad
ones like limited lifespan, characteristic cognitive errors, and tendencies
to violence.  But it carries a strong connotation of being only the good
things about humans.  Genocide is frequently described as "inhuman"
even though its distressingly frequent occurance demonstrates that
a tendency to commit genocide in particular circumstances is very much
a "human" trait.  To most people, intelligent but "not human" means 
"monster".

Spike, I work for the same company you do, except I'm in the bible
belt and your way outside.  Many of the cubicles surrounding me have
that jesus fish thing proudly displayed.  Now, if I were to so boldly
display that evolve fish with legs thing - all hell would break loose.
 Not to mention that all these church ladies would stop giving me that
Sunday morning "high on the jesus high horse" smile five days a week -
not that I would miss it either.  It actually makes me sick.

Back to the subject line:

I had a similar but less intense aha experiences concerning,
evolution, nanotechnology, and immortality.  My aha experience for
identity was however, much more intense and long lasting.  It started
around 1988 when I found Engines of Creation and literally read it
front to back, called in sick at work turned the book over and did it
again.  When I got to the end the second time, I went directly to the
library and started looking up most of the references including the
books. 

When it was all over, I started realizing that what *I* had read "in
between the lines" was having the most effect on me.  Identity had not
even been a subject discussed in the book, but indirectly, my own
working definition was falling apart as a result of my reading.  I had
not really ever put a lot of thought in my own definition of identity.
 It was just something I assumed was the "physical stuff inside my
skin". 

 All of a sudden, I found myself inventing simple, yet non-intuitive,
thought experiments to help narrow and refine my personal definition. 
It was as if, within just a few days, I was intellectually ready to
change my working definition, but that change just wasn't happening at
a more personal level.  It was as if allowing a discontinuity of that
definition was not allowed.  Something was forcing me to change my
definition of identity much slower than what I could handle
intellectually.  I found myself repeating simple thought experiments
many times a day for about two years before the dichotomy within my
own mind was resolved.  The whole time this was happening, only slow
continuous change (never discontinuities) was experienced.

Over many years of reading the extropian and then transhuman list, I
had always assumed most had adopted the same definition I now use. 
Recently, to my surprise, I found out this was true for many on the
list, but just as many were using different definitions.  Then the
reality of the difficulty of putting this "so called" definition into
debatable words hit.  Now I find myself somewhat unable to communicate
such a subjective issue and resolve the differences or at least
identify their roots.  I'm still working on this though.

Just a proposal from what I've seen so far:

TRANSHUMANISM:  The idea that we humans, as a species, can transcend our
current human limits and be transformed by the technologies we discover
and develop in the future.

Please forgive, I'm rather a newbie as I've only recently discovered my
extropian tendencies.

That may be a reasonable strategy of persuasion, but I'm not sure it is 
compatible with the term "transhuman," which seems to directly connote
something not human.  Yes, those negative associations are strong, and 
are perhaps the best argument not to use such a term.

There are a lot of people talking about stardrives...but that's not intrinsic
to "transhuman".  What is a human but a body and a mind?  It's improvement of
the core self, not big flashy technosorcery, that defines trans-*humanity*.

> (And why especially highlight the mortality issue?)

Well, I think of "mortal" as a superset of "human"; the idea is to in some way
imply a spectrum which includes bush robots and Jupiter Brains, not just
nano-immortal humanoids.  In retrospect, the tail-end format, the phrasing,
and the nonstandard terminology lead me to think that the last three words
should be dropped from the definition.  Besides, it doesn't seem intrinsically
necessary to the definition of "transhumanism", more like "posthumanism".  If
ya know, ya know; why try to cram it into the definition?

So:

Transhumanism is the idea that future technology will improve dramatically on
the human body and the human mind.  We or our descendants, in five years or
five hundred, may transcend so many limitations that we will no longer be
recognizably human.

(This also incorporates Dan Fabulich's point about making the evaluation of
probability external to the definition.)

I am the new chief editor at Journal of Transhumanism
(http://www.transhumanist.com/).  We have published two 
articles so far, and hope to gain a reputation as an 
academic quality journal.

We use peer review to evaluate submissions, and since our 
subject area is interdisciplinary, we are in special need 
of qualified "experts" willing to review articles.

If you have some relevant expertize and are willing to 
review submissions, please send me a paragraph length 
description of your areas of expertize, and the 
reasons you consider yourself knowledgeable in those 
areas (e.g., degrees, publications, projects).  

Doing so does not commit you to reviewing anything -
you may later decline requests for reasons of a lack of 
time, conflict of interest, or lack of expertize.  But we do 
seek a rapid written response from those who agree to review 
- so far our slowest evaluation has taken three weeks.

I understand your point, but still think it would be better to avoid
putting a time frame on the term this way. What of someone who expected
progress to be much slower than most of us expect? This person intends to
go into cryonic suspension and come out in a thousand years or so when they
think it will finally be possible to truly become more than human. Why
exclude such a person from being a transhumanist? Where are you going to
draw the line? 500 years? A thousand? Ten thousand? This seems too
arbitrary if you seek a precise academically useful definition.

I have new and improved definitions (see following message). However, I
don't see that your definition is more precise in this area. True, I don't
specify what "limitations" we mean. But "overcoming limits" does clearly
mean an improvement over humans. When you say that "in many ways" (which
ways?) we will no longer be human, this seems to leave the definition just
as unspecified. When you say "no longer human", this is *less* precise that
"overcoming limitations" since we could become no longer human by becoming
animals, by reducing or abolishing some of uniquely human qualities,
becoming subhuman or "inhuman".

I agree that a dictionary definition of "transhumanism" can include more
than one sense of the term. That's perfectly normal. I'm not sure right now
exactly what definition I gave the OED editor when I spoke to her, but it's
probably the original one that I came up with. I think I've also slightly
improved the definition of "extropy" since then, so that should also go to
the editor.

I wouldn't characterize the discussions we've had about definition as
"stupid endless arguments". I would rather characterize them as "focused,
productive discussions aimed at clarifying vital terms".

I have a story called "I" in this month's _Odyssey_ (issue 6), a
British science fiction magazine.  (I was going to call it "We", but
that's already taken.)  I haven't seen it yet, but hear that it's out now.
I don't know what bookstores or newsstands might carry it.
Borders and Barnes & Nobles do not.

It may be the first published story to present the positive side of
technological transhumanism.  (This shouldn't be so, but at the moment I
can't think of other examples.  The closest I can think of is Frederick
Pohl's "Day Million", but that still posits a society in which identity and
morality and sexuality are pretty much the same as today.)

The story is about what identity really means, and what the costs and
benefits of individuality are.  It's set a few hundred years in the future.
Life is no longer organic, and identities are no longer defined by bodies.

Taking into account everyone's thoughts, and keeping in mind the idea of
having more than one sense of the term "transhumanism", I've come up with
two definitions that I prefer to the one I was using. In doing so, I've
attempted to stick close to how the dictionary defines a term like "humanism".

TRANSHUMANISM
1. Any system or way of thought or action concerned with the rational use
of science, technology, creativity, and other means to overcome human
limitations by extending maximum lifespan, augmenting intelligence, and
enhancing humans physically and psychologically.

2. The intellectual and cultural movement that shares with humanism a
commitment to human progress especially through applied reason rather than
faith; it differs from humanism in affirming the possibility and
desirability of fundamentally altering the human condition for the better,
such as by using technology to eliminate aging and greatly enhance human
intellectual, physical, and psychological capacities.


If a non-normative definition is needed, as distinct from one referring to
transhumanism as a system of values or a cultural movement:

TRANSHUMANISM: The view that it is both possible for us in the next couple
of centuries to use science, technology, and any rational means to overcome
human limitations by extending our maximum lifespan, augmenting our
intelligence, and redesigning ourselves physically and psychologically.

Onward!

How about this:

    Transhumanism is the idea that technology acts as a positive force for the further
evolution of individual humans such that a transhuman is a human who exists in a state
of development at or beyond the techno-evolutionary event horizon of that individual's
average contemporaries.

This version would, for example, make Leonardo Da Vinci a transhuman in the eyes of his
Renaissance Age contemporaries, but not to us....I realize I've actually got two
definitions here, one for transhumanism and one for transhuman.

If this person thought instead that their decendants in a thousand years 
would be more than human, would we call them a transhumanist?  If yes, 
then the timescale in my definition should be extended to then.  If yes
for ten million years, then maybe a time shouldn't be in the definition.
But if no, then this redefinition includes this hypothetical:

   Transhumanism is the idea that new technologies are likely
   to change the world so much that many of us, or our descendants 
   in the few centuries, will in many ways no longer be "human"   
   (and that that's probably a not a bad thing).

I'll comment on your new definitions in another post.   

I guess I'm tolerant of ambiguity in what it is to be "human" herebecause 
"human" is a root of the term.  If the term were "translimitationism"
I'd be more tolerant of just saying "overcoming limits" without saying 
which ones.  

It's probably pretty inevitable that we will reduce or lose some
qualities.  Most of us think we will gain more than we lose, but that's a 
normative statement for a normative definition.

"rational" has lots of connotations, and prefixing it here with "science,
technology" suggests that this excludes using literature and 
other arts, or improved social organizations, to overcome human limits. 

"by" seems to imply that only these improvements (lifespan, etc.) count.  
It excludes, for example, improving our social organizations.  

What would go wrong if you said this:?

TRANSHUMANISM:  The view that in the next couple of centuries it will be 
possible to overcome human limitations, e.g., to intelligence or lifespans.

I am glad that my approach was adopted in restructuring a suggested
definition.  I think that it will go a long way towards resolving the
friction between 'thinkers' and 'doers' that has plagued us over the past
two years.

If we were to incorporate some version Max's suggestion in the FAQ, however,
I suggest that we also incorporate annotations to the two sections of it.  I
already have excellent paragraphs submitted for that section of the FAQ that
could be used as annotations.  That way, someone could read the part of the
definition and then some comments expanding and explaining it in other
terms.  I want to make sure that our ideas reach everyone, not just the
smart kids!  

With regard to the OED, I should note that nobody gets to write definitions
except the editors.  Any person can submit words for consideration, however,
along with a description of how the word is being used and the first print
literary reference for it.  They are only just now completing the definition
for 'website', so I don't forsee any action on my suggestion any time soon.
Just having the conversation with an editor, however, sharpened my thinking
about how we structure our approach to defining terminology.

YMMV, but not to me.  I think of "transhuman" as *more* human, in the
desirable
characteristics, or at least many of them.  With "transhuman" I think of
"trans-" in 
the "beyond" sense, not the "opposite" or "different" sense.

On a different tack, if you want a more precise definition, perhaps you'd want
to use a less loaded and more precise word than "human".  A good definition
is precise, but you don't want a definition prone to misinterpretation.

Sony sees sense to discontinue ESP research

BENJAMIN FULFORD in Tokyo

Japan's Sony Corporation says it has proved extra-sensory
perception exists - but has closed down its ESP research facility
because there did not seem to be any way to turn the knowledge
into marketable products.

Sony had a team of five researchers, who spent seven years
inviting people who claimed to have psychic powers into their
laboratories for a series of scientific tests to see if they
really did have these powers, company spokesman Masanobu
Sakaguchi said.

"We found out experimentally that yes, ESP exists, but that any
practical application of this knowledge is not likely in the
foreseeable future," he said.

Mr Sakaguchi said a typical experiment involved having a qi gong 
practitioner put qi, or spiritual energy, into a glass of water
and then having another practitioner detect which glass contained
the qi.

"They were right 70 per cent of the time, and if it was random
guessing they would have been right only 50 per cent of the
time," he said. The experiments were repeated so often that any
chances of a statistical fluke were ruled out, he said.
Other experiments produced similar results for things like
discerning hidden objects and detecting colours without looking,
he said.

"We were unable to detect qi  with any machine; it seems only
people can detect it," he said. Possibilities like packing qi
gong  energy in batteries were thus too remote to justify more
research, he said.

Masaru Ibuga, one of Sony's founders, set up the ESP research
centre in 1991 after he became interested in qi gong  and other
unexplained aspects of Chinese medicine. His death this year may
be the real reason the research was discontinued.

To call someone a transhumanist, I'd expect them to
	* want to personally exceed "human" limits
	* expect to have a reasonable chance of personally
	  doing so (implies within their lifetime)

I think I'd consider someone who thinks humans might reasonbly
exceed human limits only sometime after this person's death a
proto-transhumanist or one interested in transhuman topics,
but not a transhumanist.

Without wanting to contribute yet another redefinition, I'd note that "human" has
both a singular and collective meaning. The focus so far has been on the effects
of technology on individual humans. Won't the effects on our collective
intelligence and capabilities will be just as significant? I can imagine a
transhuman future in which our clear individual boundaries, defined by biological
bodies, seem rather quaint. Some transhumans may be descendants of what were
several individuals in our era, or even components of different individuals. Max's
definitions seem to leave that wider possibility open, but the examples apply to
individuals.

I think for a dictionary definition however, the focus on the individual
possibilities is the right one.

I normally agree with this; however, if a person believes that transhumanity
is greatly desirable and argues/works toward that end, even if ve does not
expect to live to see it, I would consider ver a transhumanist.  In fact, I
consider this to be the key requirement of transhumanism.  The only reason why
near-future time periods correlate is that a person is more likely to get
involved in something ve believes is achievable in vis lifetime.

I don't characterize the discussions regarding definitions as unproductive
at all, I find them very important.  I am referring to the attempts made
last year to define one group of transhumanists as more important than the
other, which sort of division I do not ascribe to.  Writers, thinkers,
engineers, researchers...we all have vital roles to play here.

Acceleration implies measurement, but it doesn't imply much more in in the
way of measurement than "progress", or "development" do. If you can
measure the current level of "civilisation", then two measurements
separated by time yields a (rough average) measure of "progress",
and a sequence of measurements over time yields "acceleration."
(OK, to be horribly pedantic, the forward differences of the forward
differences, suitably adjusted, are the average acceleration :-)

Sure, we can argue over our measures of the current level. We can agree
that each of our measures is at best a rough proxy that may correlate
to the level of "civilization." The point is that essentially all of
our objective or quasi-objective proxies show exponential growth.
The only way to avoid the conclusion of acceleration is to appeal
to more subjective measures or to appeal to speculative constraints.
OK, the constraints aren't speculative: thier relevance is speculative,
as the constrants somehow always occur in the future.

Last Call For Papers!

The Philosophy of Transhumanism: A Reader

Editors: Thom Quinn and Nick Bostrom

Introduction

We are currently looking for excellent essays to be published within an
academic volume on the philosophy of transhumanism. This book will be
targeting an audience of scientists, engineers, philosophers, artists
and other well-read professionals. The purpose of this volume is to get
transhumanism recognized as a legitimate philosophy, world-view, and
lifestyle. Essays on all aspects of transhumanism are welcome; however,
only the best essay on any particular topic will be selected for
publication.

Title

Since this book is aimed at an academic audience, it does not have a
flashy title. Although this title is not fixed in stone, the book has
been christened The Philosophy of Transhumanism: A Reader. Nick and I
call it "the reader" for short. A straightforward name like this really
is the best strategy for helping people find a book on this novel topic
both in a bookstore and a library.

Copyright

Each author will retain the complete copyright to their own essay;
however, if you contribute, you also agree to allow the publication of
your essay in this volume as many times as publishers agree to print it.
There could possibly be various hardcover and softcover editions. If you
were to print your essay elsewhere at a later date, you would cite the
book as the original source, unless it had been published prior to
appearing in this volume. If your essay has been previously published,
then all copyright issues must be worked out ahead of time. 

Profits

If the volume makes a profit and we are very certain it will, the total
sum will be evenly distributed among all contributors, including Nick
and myself.

Deadline: November 1, 1998

Essays and other materials should be submitted via email; please send
your files either as ASCII text files or MS Word documents. If you live
within the United States, Canada, or Mexico, you should send your
materials to Thom Quinn. If you live in Europe, Asia, Africa, or South
America, please send your materials to Nick Bostrom. The language of
this volume will be English.

Email comments/inquiries to Thom Quinn and Nick Bostrom.

Thom Quinn can be reached at swo@execpc.com or evolu@evolutionary.org or
thomquinn@esosoft.com

Nick Bostrom can be reached at bostrom@ndirect.co.uk

First, thanks Max and Robin for your diligence and efforts.  I find this
discussion quite constructive and in good spirit.

My initial concern in redefining terms is from a professional point of
view.  In that I have the responsibility of heading an art movement and
developing genres of art, lecturing in universities, appearing in public, I
need to be sure that what information I am giving out is accurate although
I sensibly understand that we are actually discussing variations on a theme.

When I authored the Transhumanist Art Statement, I wrote it in prose with
transhumanism in mind.  It was my definition of transhumanism in 1983.


TRANSHUMANIST ART 

STATEMENT 2.0

* * * * * 


Transhumanist Arts represents the aesthetic and creative culture of
transhumanity.  Transhumanist Artists are developing new and varied modes
of art.  Our modes of expression are merging with science and technology in
designing increased sensory experiences.  We seek more critical thinking
and less mysticism as we continue to evolve.

Transhumanist Artists want to extend life and overcome death.  We plan to
do so with vitality and amplified creativity.  Emotions are integral to
sensing and understanding life. We exercise a transhuman ecology of
self-awareness and the pursuit of truthfulness.   If our art represents who
we are, then let us chose to be transhuman not only in our bodies, but also
in our values.

The Transhumanist Arts embraces the creative innovations of transhumanity.
We are ardent activists in pursuing infinite transformation, overcoming
death and exploring the universe.  As Transhumanist Arts comes into focus,
as the tools and ideas of our art continue to evolve, so too shall we.

joe you made some interesting comments about engines of creation.
i had an insight about that as i realize that those experiences in life
that hit us really hard are those experiences which we remember with
intricate detail.  thought experiment:  what were you doing the morning
you
heard that the challenger had exploded?  bet you can write pages.
ok, what were you doing the day before that?  ya dont know, do you?
the week before?  month?  nothing there, is there?

most of us have events in our lives like that one, that really hit us.
in 1989 i was in a bookstore, books ink, in san jose, scanning over the
science section when i saw a copy of engines of creation.  thinking it
was yet another treatise on creationism (k eric may have chosen an
unfortunate title) i took it down to put where it belonged but then i
started
reading.  approximately 3 hours later i realized i had read most of that
book standing there in the bookstore.  my legs ached from standing.
i recall intricate details of that morning in the bookstore, but i havent
a clue what else i did that month.  the mind is a curious computer, is it
not?

joe, i didnt get to finish my previous thought.  i looked thru my copy of
engines which i purchased in 1989 in san jose.  i did not find in there
the idea i had at the time (it may be there somewhere), an idea that
might sound a little strange coming from a launcher type like myself.

in 89 i had been thinking about space stations.  k eric goes on about
how nanotech will be the great breakthru in manufacturing that will
be needed for real space stations, better launchers, etc.

my notion at the time was that humans could actually reinvent
ourselves if we mastered nanotech, so that our scale would not
be 2 meters but rather 2 millimeters.   our glorified bodies
could be the scale of ants, yet if our atoms were correctly utilized,
we would still be these wonderfully brilliant creatures that we are.
(humble too).

then, the launcher problem would already be solved,
by good old 1950s rocket technology.  the scarcity of materials
and energy in space would be solved, by the same old technology.
even a tiny asteroid would have plenty of raw materials for billion
of "us".  our modest home planet would then be unimaginably
emmense and its gravitational field remarkably gentle.  has this
notion been explored in sci fi?  spike

Wrong, wrong, wrong!  There is a certain Godelian critical mass of 
cortical complexity (translation: quantity of neurons and synaptic 
connections) necessary for the emergence of self-reference (and 
much more for context-sensitively evolving self-and-other 
consciousness).  Read "Biology as Ideology" by Richard C. 
Lewontin, who trenchantly make the point that it is our cortical 
volume, providing the space for this complexity to manifest (thus the 
number of connections it allows), that permits the awakening of self-
awareness.  Mighty Mites as mental whizzes are not merely science 
fiction; they are irrevocably anchored in the realm of fantasy.     Joe

Two simple questions which I feel will tickle your brain cells... 
Timetravel, a Transhuman possability, or just a daydream? Would it be a 
good thing, or disastrous?

I would have to answer yes to it being a possability, however far ahead 
the technology for such a thing is. I, with my limited knowledge of both 
Extropy and Timetravel (presently), do not believe we would bring about 
some disastrous outcome with the ability to time travel. On the 
contrary, we may be as ghosts, there only for the observance of whatever 
is happening and not in physical form. I'm not speaking of astral 
projection (at least not in the nature it is known to us), but if we 
were to go back or forward in Time, to break the limited bounds of our 
concept of Time, it would be to actually see it for what it is and not 
what we are taught. I think that all Time exists at one time and not on 
the three different levels of Past, Present, Future. We see it as thus 
because it is a convenience to us and our minds are limited only to what 
our senses tell it. 

What do you think?

 Unless you manage to also reduce your brain, not in terms of functional complexity, but in terms of mass.

  Aren't there some nanotechnologists who believe we could change our neurons with nanoneurons, still keep our same brain volume, but multiply the number of neurones by </I>whatever</I> amount?

   If this amount is big enough, we would actually be able to hold the world in our head, and live it all on ourself... (and as we make neurons smaller, they also get faster, just like with microprocessors: less distance to travel for the thoughts).

Into the future?  Absolutely.  Backwards?  Almost certainly not.

Consider: if we were develop backwards time travel at some point in the
future, then someone could have gone back in time to some point before
today.  If time travel will be discovered, then it has already happened.

Thus, due to the very nature of time travel, if it hasn't happened already,
we can safely assume that it never will.

 I think Larry Niven had the best take on this. In any universe in which
both time travel and intelligent being were possible, the intelligent beings
would continue to alter History until time travel is never invented. Thus no
time travel is the stable state. Viewing the past without being able to
alter it however would not have that problem. That would lead to a high
level of honesty I think. If people could reliably backtrack down your
timeline to see what exactly you did do, privacy really would be gone.

I vaguely remember a non-fiction paper called "Lillitopian
Uploads"(sp?) by, if memory serves me correctly, Robin Hanson.

I may well be the only extropian who never reads sci-fi.  I have a
problem with "suspension of disbelief" and I consider the S/N ratio
too low, so I stick with non-fiction.  I believe most of the signal
from sci-fi is given to me via this list anyway - thanks for the
filter everyone :-)  

Imagine the effect of EOC on a technology enthusiast never exposed to
sci-fi.  Its like the ultimate sci-fi without the fiction.  Not once
did I feel the need to suspend my disbelief...Nearly 100% signal and
no noise....everything was feasible and sound.  Put all of your sci-fi
rushes together and then realize I got most of them from one book
within 24 hours...even though a lot of them had to come from "reading
between the lines"... Drexler is such a conservative fart.  I remember
that day well.

Go to:
http://www.foresight.org/EOC/EOC_Chapter_5.html
and scroll down about 3/4 of the way.  

Side note: Anyone know how I can quickly make a tag from Netscape
Navigator that allows me to save/cut/past a bookmark that points to
that part of the document where you scroll down about 3/4 of the way. 
I know how to do this from edit mode but that involves saving the
document first.

There are a lot of problems with making neurons faster and staying in
the physical world.  If your running 100,000 times faster and want to
scratch your nose, your hand will have to move nearly at the speed of
light to complete the task in reasonable subjective time.  So, for
every increase in speed there must be a corresponding decrease in
body/brain size.  I hope your not too nostalgic about experiencing
nature the way you know it.  A wave crashing on the beach will take a
month.  Nature, as you currently know it, will be more like a still
picture.  There will be some natural phenomena that is interesting at
that speed, like lightning, but all nostalgia will be lost.  The only
way to experience nostalgia nature after speedup would be in an
Artificial Reality (AR) emulation of real reality (RR) equally sped up.

 I hope not. I like Spike's idea. Surely if there is a critical quantity it is
connectivity and processing power rather than physical mass. Likely we can do
better than the biological neuron with with nanotechnology. With a smaller than
neuron equivalent, we can build a smaller than natural human equivalent brain.
If not ants, at least mice.

 Small is beautiful :-)

Oh, I dunno...

OK, I can follow you so far: if you return to the past of
yourself, you were always part of that past.  However, if
we introduce the idea of "Many Worlds", another possibility
arises: that we may be able to return to a past exactly 
similar to our own, but with the addition of ourselves (the
time travelers).  The only difficulty I can see is that 
there appears to be no way to get back to the "present" you
left.

Even this is a very weak argument against, since
you would have to show that it was likely that it
*hadn't* happened.

Heh,heh, nice try Dan.....

This assumes we live in the past, not the present. If we are (as I
believe) living in the present, the future hasn't happened yet.

But it was fun to reason out. "Is it time for the tea party yet?
I'll get my hat... Where's Alice?"

I hope this isn't too rude, asking you to support something you wrote
way back in ancient 1992 in a post to sci.nanotech.  

1.  What physical process in nostalgia nature cannot be emulated in a
Turing equivalent machine such that Artificial Reality (AR) couldn't
emulate Real Reality (RR) with 365 times speedup, thus providing a
satisfactory "connection to ordinary physical reality" for uploaders?
This was one of the key stated motivations for Tinkerbelizing in the
first place.  
 
2. If c=.4 or 365 times speedup.  I would have to say that most
familiar physical sensations and comforts (e.g. nostalgia nature)
would be lost (see my last post).  Again, this was one of the key
stated motivations for Tinkerbelizing.

Regarding my tranhumanist story "I":  Odyssey's web page is

	http://www.jeapes.ndirect.co.uk/odyssey/

which will tell you some about the magazine, and how to order
single issues (under "subscribe").  They're pretty expensive.
(Everything in the UK is, despite the fact that nobody there seems to
have much money, a contradiction I would like someday to hear a good
explanation of.)

Alternately, if you go to any science fiction conventions in the northeast
US, you will probably run into Darryl Schweitzer, who sells Odyssey (among
other things).  Just look around for a dark-haired, lanky, overcaffeinated
fellow in a broad hat and maybe a fringed suede jacket or a Mexican poncho,
who will be scanning the room predatorily, looking for people he has not yet
sold books to.

Near the end of the book, _The Fabric of Reality_ by David Deutsch, he
discusses the possibilities of time travel.  He claims that both interactive
past-directed and future-directed time travel is possible.

He is a believer in the "Many Universes" model of reality (a model of reality
based on quantum theory which suggests the existence of an infinity of
universes, an infinite proportion of which are identical, or near-identical, to
ours with respects to the laws of physics and "historical" events), and
suggests that time travel is actually movement between these universes,
circumventing commonly held paradox beliefs about time travel.  Furthermore,
one can only travel to places(a "time" within the place?) in which time travel
has been accomplished, and only as early, within that universe, as the first
instance of the time travel "device".

At no time, however, does he make claims that he believes time travel will
certainly be physically tenable - the technology may not be possible. He does
mention, though, that some theorists suggest that time travel may be possible
near a rapidly spinning black hole.

Each neuron has up to 40,000 connections with other neurons, and 
there are more than 30 billion (not million) of them in a human brain 
weighing approximately 3 1/2 pounds.  As complex and miniaturized 
as it already is, and considering that the interaction of genetics and 
experience has endowed each brain with a unique (although similar) 
connection pattern, the difficulties involved in further shrinking them 
are daunting, to say the least.                   Joe

I can't tell you what I was thinking then, but now I wouldn't say that 
was the main reason to "tinkerbelize."  I mentioned in the next sentence
that there will be a lot of physical work to supervise.

I do think that it is easy to underestimate the cost of simulating a 
vivid shared natural-appearing reality, and that people will be 
uncomfortable with the very fact that it isn't real.

Just about any chemical process.  The best computers in the world can't
yet fold proteins in any length of time, but you fold a couple trillion per
second.
Likewise the fastest reactions are far too fast for any transistor or
abacus arm, even nanoscale ones.

A quantum computer might be able to do such things, but that isn't a
Tinkerbell issue.  You may also be able to simulate human experience
without bothering with complex chemistry, but that remains to be seen.

had descendants interested in such.  Might peering at Earth from the
other side of a black hole be a possible PIP Tech - anyone?  Even if
so, I don't see how you could possibly get the resolution needed. 
What other PIP Tech's are possible?  

Resurrection would occur via the PIP Tech future users scanning the
brain of the subject at a time just before his/her death and then
implementing it into an upload.  You might want your exact coordinates
and time of death well documented if PIP Tech is remotely possible. 
You might want to go as far as documenting the last time before your
death that there was no obstruction between you and the sky ( e.g.
just before you entered the hospital).  You don't want your
descendants to have to go through too much trouble - they might just
give up, or end up implementing you five years before your death. 

This is sort-of unextropian in the sense of dynamic optimism.  That
is, just sit back and wait... Don't worry,... Be happy.  I say, don't
count on it.  Even if you do, at best, you'll miss out on everything
that happens between your death and the invention of PIP Tech (e.g.
the singularity).

I cannot improve on the case made by Drexler on this:

Go to:
http://www.foresight.org/EOC/EOC_Chapter_5.html
and scroll down about 3/4 of the way. 

What parts of his arguments are flawed?

Actually, I believe that a transhumanist future might have no need at
all for backward time travel, because one would have little to learn
from primitive pre-singularity humans.  I think that it would be
neither good nor bad.

This reasoning is flawed for a couple of reasons.  You are saying that
because we do not see something, it is not there.  I think that you
are also assuming that those beings in the future who do develop full
time travel will want to journey to their own past to share the
knowledge that time travel will be possible in the future.  As beings
of finite existence, I believe that time has meaning for us, but
perhaps there is no such dimension or measurement at all for those who
have infinite existence, as transhumans or post-humans will have.

This is assuming much about a technological/biological future that is
very difficult to predict and will become virtually impossible to
predict as the singularity approaches and passes.  Isn't that saying
something along the lines of since we've never seen something it must
not be.  There is no other life in the universe because they have
never bothered to come tell us that they are there.

Who me?  Oh yea, thats right.  I almost forgot to fold a few trillion
of them in the last second - I must have been distracted :-)  Last
time I went on a nature hike however, I don't recall noticing that
level of detail.  If you did, I admire your perception, but I'd have
to stay away from that trail for my version of R&R.

Not too fast however, to simulate their macroscopic effects for many
applications.  Unless your studying chemistry.  Maybe experimental
chemists will be motivated to become Lilliputian Posthumians.  

Physical limits to switching speed is a good argument against Von
Neumann architecture capabilities, but those limits are not as
negative for other architectures.

Very good arguments supporting this are available today.  Very good
refutations of those arguments remains to be seen.

In "Hyperspace" by Michio Kaku, a scenerio is sketched out which seems like
it would work. You make a worm hole - he descibred how to do this, it
involves something with charging two sets of plates and relies on something
called the Casmir Effect, which has been observed in the lab on a small
scale, but he didn't go into much more detail about it - anyway, you make a
worm hole using the Casmir Effect, and you have the two ends of a wormhole
right next to eachother. You then put one on a ship, and accelerate it to
near-light speed, and fly it around for a while, then after 20 years or so,
return it to its original position. While this one end of a worm hole was
going very fast, time was compressed for it - say it was going fast enough
that only 10 seconds passed for it while 20 years passed for the other end
of the worm hole which did not travel. Now, you have a wormhole which has
one end at point A in space, and its other end only a mile or so away, but
one end is twenty years ahead of the other one. You pass through one end and
come out the other end twenty years into the future. Pass the other way, and
go twenty years into the past.

I can't prove were not already uploaded, so why should I care if we
upload within the upload if nothing more than for the sake of
efficiency.  I suppose it might be hard to emulate, in a Turing
equivalent machine, the trickery needed to give us these quantum
weirdness results were starting to discover.  Could it be possible
that our clock is halted while our so called quantum computer does its
calculations?  I guess if you could prove that a truly random process
exist in nature rather than a very good pseudo-random one, I would
have to concede that at least we're not on a Turing equivalent.  It's
hard to predict irrational objections to uploading, but I'm more
interested in the rational ones anyway.

There is a vast difference between logically possible and empirically 
plausible.  The simultaneous mastery of miniaturization and 
complexity involved in creating a single nanobrain capable of both 
explicit self-awareness and continuous self-modification in response 
to environmental input while maintaining such a self-referential 
conscious identity would of necessity dwarf the totality of human 
technical achievement from stone age to present.  Drexler's article 
reads like excellent speculative fiction, but imagination, no matter 
how superb, does not automatically lead to manifestation or 
reification.

But the better question is how that jupiter brain
competes against a group of tiny posthumans that 
cost the same total amount.  Since jupiter is 10^30gms,
the jupiter brain might compete against 10^30 gram sized
posthumans.

joe, i wouldnt argue that we could be smart with fewer neurons

it's logically possible, yes, but technically plausible?  I would say no 
(or at least not while any of US live).      Joe

joe, as i grow older, time seems to go by faster always.  life is
logarithmic.  sigh.  {8-[    so slowing the clock  is exactly what i
wish to accomplish.  granted that bit about a crashing wave
taking a month is a bit extreme, but... {8-)

heres my reasoning on the ant thing.  i figure 6E23 atoms of
carbon have a mass of about 12 grams, and the brain is mostly
carbon, and its mass is, i dont know, 1.6 kg?  so we are on the
order of  8E25 atoms in our brains?  ok, 6E25 in my case, but
that should be plenty to make 1E10 neurons and their supporting
interconnections, even if we reduced our linear scales by 3 orders.
in that case our brain mass would be reduced 9 orders, so my ant self
could still have a 6E16 atom brain or six  million atoms per brain
cell.  right?  so perhaps the only reason ants are so stupid is that
their brains are not very organized and the cells waste too many
atoms on nonessential tasks... {8-]  spike

joe even here on the left coast i see the jesus fish thing on occasion.

We could also use a multiverse arrangement, spheres of our brains existing

bodies at a fraction the size of our own, Itd make the Earth appear larger
than Jupiter is now.  Our brains could also access a field and grow larger
when we needed it.

ps - have the archives been fixed?  I searched for my email adress and couldnt
find any with mine on it, im especially interested in my archives from 1997.

I have no problem with the unconscious being an active participant. 'P' is
just fine. The problem I have is with the 'E'....

I've been on tours of a number of manufacturing plants. There are a lot of
ways to guarantee that a part is identified by type and properly oriented
and positioned. For example, with LEGOs, put a steel BB into the center of
each block. An arm with an electromagnet can pick up blocks and drop them
into a sorting hopper. Once the Lego Block is lying on its side, the bar
code can be read by a supermarket scanner which is orientation independent.
Unidentified blocks go back to the hopper for another try. Identified
blocks are handled according to their type.

I did the calculations for nanotech, with micron sized components. At least
100x energy savings. Something like a tube about the size of cable tv coax
can deliver liters per minute to a home. With accelerations of 10 KiloGee
available in the distribution system, 10 minute delivery from across the
country. As with many things, 99.999% of the block types will be available
within 100KM. Some of these can be data blocks, a single block can hold
several hours of HDTV. Video on demand with a vengance!

The phrase 'no longer be "human'' is an immediate turnoff for most of the
people I know. Also, as we change, so will the meaning of the term "human".
How about:

   Transhumanism is the idea that new technologies are likely
   to change the world and ourselves in so many ways that the
   term "human" will be deeply transformed.

Crit (crit.org) does something similar to this via creating 'external
links', links that are not in the original document but in a separate
database.

Perhaps a more immediate solution is for everyone who publishes lengthy
technical documents to use 'a name' tags for each paragraph or table -
even if never referenced in the document, it would allow others to make
such in-document links.

Since it can't be tested, how would this be different from a disintergration device?

 I agree its a turnoff for many people. But for me, it speaks to a core belief
which I hope is common to the group. Humanity is not the peak and pinnacle of
all that possible, just a step on the path. Its acceptence of this wider range
of possibility that attracts me to this group. Fudging that in the interest of
public relations seems to be going too far. Lets face it, radical ideas are
scary.

 I just read Max's latest Extropian Principles, and  think he has done a nice
job of expressing a radical belief without being too agressive about it. If that
is too much for people, they are likely not ready to hear the message yet.

It could still be tested.  I don't know enough math to 
do the estimation, but if you do enough time travel
tests, with short duration, the chances would increase
that you would get the test device before sending one.
I think. :)

I claim that you are now pretty convinced that you are not an upload,
and that if we were to convince you that you are, you would be very
disturbed and disoriented. 

For one thing, living in a physical world, you have a rich intuition
to draw on to think about security.  If you can defend a volume of space
against intruders, you are largely secure.  If you live in a virtual 
reality all that gets thrown out, and you have to use very different 
and alien approaches to evaluate and preserve your security.  That by 
itself is enough to make someone uncomfortable with such a life.

Actually, it CAN be tested, interestingly enough, using reversible
nano-electronics.

On a relevant note, tests have been done to see if one can travel to other
histories, (ie testing for exact linearity in the waveform,) and it seems
that we can't.  Take a look at Q36-Q39 in the excellent "Many Worlds FAQ"
at http://www.airtime.co.uk/users/station/m-worlds.faq

Interestingly, the author of that FAQ makes more or less the same argument
that I do to show that the waveform is linear:

*****
Q39  Is linearity exact?
     -------------------
Linearity (of the wavefunction) has been verified to hold true to better
than 1 part in 10^27 [W].  If slight non-linear effects were ever
discovered then the possibility of communication with, or travel to, the
other worlds would be opened up.  The existence of parallel Everett-
worlds can be used to argue that physics must be *exactly* linear, that
non-linear effects will never be detected.  (See "Is physics linear" for
more about linearity.)

The argument for exactness uses a version of the weak anthropic
principle and proceeds thus: the exploitation of slight non-linear
quantum effects could permit communication with and travel to the other
Everett-worlds.  A sufficiently advanced "early" civilisation [F] might
colonise uninhabited other worlds, presumably in an exponentially
spreading fashion.  Since the course of evolution is dictated by random
quantum events (mutations, genetic recombination) and environmental
effects (asteroidal induced mass extinctions, etc) it seems inevitable
that in a minority, although still a great many, of these parallel
worlds life on Earth has already evolved sapient-level intelligence and
developed an advanced technology millions or even billions of years ago. 
Such early arrivals, under the usual Darwinian pressure to expand, would
spread across the parallel time tracks, if they had the ability,
displacing their less-evolved quantum neighbours.

The fossil record indicates that evolution, in our ancestral lineage,
has proceeded at varying rates at different times.  Periods of rapid
development in complexity (eg the Cambrian explosion of 530 millions
years ago or the quadrupling of brain size during the recent Ice Ages)
are interspersed with long periods of much slower development.  This
indicates that we are not in the fast lane of evolution, where all the
lucky breaks turned out just right for the early development of
intelligence and technology.  Ergo none of the more advanced
civilisations that exist in other worlds have ever been able to cross
from one quantum world to another and interrupt our long, slow
biological evolution.

The simplest explanation is that physics is sufficiently linear to
prevent travel between Everett worlds.  If technology is only bounded
by physical law (the Feinberg principle [F]) then linearity would have
to be exact.

Anyway, a lot of people have criticized my argument re: time travel, so
I'll summarize here.

Michael Lorrey said:
>Yet you do not know if time travel will be acheived in the future or not.

You're right, I don't.  That's why I said "almost certainly not," rather
than "I'm absolutely certain that it will never happen."  My argument was
simply that if someone develops time travel in the future, then someone
could return to our past or our present.  Considering how many people there
are likely to be in the future, I think that someone (in fact, a great many
someones) almost certainly would visit some point in our past.  Since it
appears that no one from the future has appeared in our past, this
indicates a strong likelihood that it can't be done.

I could very well be wrong, however.  There are a number of circumstances
under which my argument might break down:

1)  No one who discovers time travel will ever want to travel into our past.

Michael Scarazzo said:
>This reasoning is flawed for a couple of reasons.  You are saying that
>because we do not see something, it is not there.  I think that you

While this isn't strictly impossible, I find it profoundly unlikely.  For
this to hold, whenever *anyone* discovers time travel, no matter how many
people do so, they must all uniformly decide not to travel any further back
than today.  While I might believe that one or two could show such
restraint, it seems inconceivable that all intelligent life for the
remainer of the lifespan of the universe will make the same choice.

2)  My other assumption is wrong: someone from our future has appeared in
our past, but for some reason or other very few people knows anything about
it.

Michael Scarazzo said:
>This is assuming much about a technological/biological future that is
>very difficult to predict and will become virtually impossible to

This also seems unlikely.  After all, if one person can travel into our
past, then two can.  Considering that our population looks like it's going
to keep growing for a long time, what would prevent LOTS of people from
travelling into our past?  Or rather, once they did, how could they
possibly keep it a secret from most of the world?  And why would they?  Why
not tell the world?

Again, it isn't strictly impossible that no one will ever decide to come
back in time and tell the world, but it's awfully unlikely.

3)  For some reason, time travel is limited in some way: perhaps it can't
be used to travel further back than the date of the invention, for example.

Again, this is another point which I can't honestly claim cannot be true.
With my current understanding of physics, I can't currently imagine what
would prevent time travel beyond a certain date, but then, I'm not out to
invent a time machine.  :)

However, I will make the argument that even this is unlikely.  First, note
that if I had an engine which could move me around faster-than-light (FTL)
then I could travel back to any arbitrary point in time.  This point has
been pretty well hashed out; I think the FTL FAQ out there on the net
discusses it in a way that makes sense to those who don't have much
physics.  Alternately, consider the scenario Haradon presents:

FTL movement => arbitrary backwards time travel.

Now suppose, for example, that your flavor of time machine uses special
limiting "gateways."  You build the gateway today, wait a week, walk into
the gateway, and you've just travelled one week back in time.

It would appear that the inventor's ability to time travel is limited: If I
build the gateway tomorrow, I can't travel back to today, though I can
travel back to tomorrow from any arbitrary point in the future.

Unfortunately for this argument, I can couple this simple device with an
engine that moves me around at relativistic speeds (subluminally) and get a
faster-than-light engine.  Indeed, any trip can be made in an arbitrarily
short amount of time simply by travelling back in time during the trip.
So, for example, if I wanted to get somewhere a light-week away, I could
set up my gateway, fly there in a week and a day, then gate back to a week
ago.  I find myself having arrived at my destination only one day after
departure.  A photon I might have emitted from my origin would arrive six
days later.  Since FTL travel allows arbitrary time travel, a limitation of
this kind is no real limitation at all.

In short, for this argument to work, there would have to be some bigger
physical principle about time travel which we have not yet discovered which
imposes serious limits on the dates to which one may travel.

Note that strong determinism won't do it.  We'd still get time travellers
who may even have a profound effect on the age to which they travel; all
that determinism would signify is that there would be no chance that they
would do anything else.

Again, while I can't claim to be certain about this, I would definitely put
money against the possibility that we will be able to move an entire person
backwards in time, even under strong limitations.

I'm well aware that the future hasn't happened yet.  However, if backwards
time travel is in the future, then by definition you can use it to reach
the future's past.  Go far enough back and that's the present.  Even
further back and you've got the past.

Anyway, if you happen to be a determinist (as I am), then this argument
isn't even relevant.  The future hasn't happened yet, but it will, and if
it's got time travel, then it will very likely alter its past.

Difficult yes, impossible no. Hans Moravec figures it would take 10^13
calculations per second to emulate a human brain. To build one of Drexler's
nano computers that could perform 10 ^13 calculations per second you'd
need about half an ounce of matter, mostly of carbon, and about 15  watts
of energy.

This is an interesting point, but I believe it is false.  I should mention
that I do understand special relatively and the way in which FTL travel
can lead to time travel.

The gateway has two ends, which are linked together.  If you restrict
the motion of each end to be subliminal, then each end must stay forever
within the forward light cone of its creation.  There is no way either
end can move into the past light cone of its creation if it only moves
subliminally.  Therefore you can never come out of a gateway mouth
anywhere but in the forward light cone of its creation.

It may be true that you can get the effect of FTL travel by moving through
the gateways, but there are restrictions on the parts of spacetime you
can visit because the gateways themselves don't move FTL.  Therefore
you don't have "arbitrary" FTL travel and the premise fails.

That's certainly true today, but it's not a law of nature. Perhaps a

Yes, it would dwarf anything human beings have done up to now by
many orders of magnitude, nevertheless I think that's exactly what
will happen. And I think it will happen in less than a century,
perhaps much less.

I share the spirit of your scepticism, but widespread experience does seem
to indicate that telepathy occurs now and again, often between people
thousands of miles apart, which would seem to make it ES.

After uploading, however, the question of whether 'thought transference', as
it used to be known, is possible between biological brains will surely
become moot.

The only nag is whether such apparent ESP's, patchy as they are, indicate
some 'dimension,' some nooshpere, which would be ontologically enriching if
only we could find the key to exploring/mapping it.

If we vacate the receiving brain, we may never know.

How fast can you think when light takes nearly a second to cross
your brain? I don't believe that Jupiter-sized brains will ever
be as useful as some people here imagine, except to the extent
that they can run trillions of uploads in one shared reality.

We do have a model for how the neurons in the brain work.  It is not
complete, and it may not even be accurate, but it is based on the
best information available.

Broadly speaking, neurons act as nonlinear weighted adders, with various
points on the neuron being excited or inhibited by chemicals released by
other neurons.  The overall excitation level gets filtered by a nonlinear
function, in many cases roughly a threshold filter, and this determines
the degree of output excitation released by this neuron.  At the same
time, longer-range chemicals are floating around to modulate the overall
sensitivity and excitation level of the neurons.

Based on this type of understanding, the actual information processing
done by a neuron appears to be limited.  You can approximate it crudely
by a very simple mechanism.  We don't know yet whether such a crude
simulation would be adequate for intelligence, but given the inherent
imprecision and associated fault tolerance of biological systems, it is
plausible that this would work.

No one would claim that the matter is closed, but given our current
understanding of neurobiology, it is reasonable to propose that the brain
could be greatly miniaturized and accelerated while still supporting
intelligence and consciousness.

The distinction you have drawn out here is between creating an upload
world suitable for migration, and living in an already created upload
world that you and all of your ancestors have evolved in.  It is the
latter, not the former, that I cannot prove is not the case.  In my
mind, not being able to disprove the latter disqualifies a lot of
commonly assumed limitations about the former.  Anyway, none of your
objections are directly applicable to the use of this argument. 
Indirectly, however, if everyone was aware of the lack of limitations
implicit in this argument, that should alleviate some discomfort.....
I would hope.  On the other hand, the lack of limitations in an upload
world actually are far greater than this argument takes you.  Those
extra unknowns will certainly add discomfort but thats just part of
life in the singularity lane.

There are going to be some uncomfortable transitions for sure.  What I
call "my ideal scenario for uploading" is nothing more than
"theoretically possible".  That scenario allows for uploading into a
world where, at first glance, you are unable to detect you have been
uploaded.  Odd that you mention security as being a deterrent.  I've
always thought that that would be what pushes me to upload before the
technology has matured to a point where I could migrate comfortably. 
Having multiple backup copies for survival of disaster sounds a lot
more secure to me than defending a spot of property that can be blown
to shreds.

Assuming that the speed of light will "forever" remain a limiting
factor, a possible solution for a JB could be to use only a
relatively small portion of its mass to run its "essential self"
on, while the rest serves as an (inactive) backup and/or as an
"unconscious" platform to run mostly "brute force" programs 
on that focus on a particular low-priority issues. These
would likely work at (much) slower rates than the central  
unit, so that if something goes wrong it has ample time to 
react.

The nano-posthumans would all need to co-operate flawlessly
(be like-minded to a high degree) to be effective against an entity
that has the same computing power and mass, but a centralized
decision-making system (i.e. it only has to make up its own
mind). Furthermore, blunt methods like nuclear attack are
much more likely to harm a microscopic creature than a 
planet-sized one; you could theoretically blow away half 
the JB's mass and it could still survive with its personality
intact due to ample room for redundancy.

Of course, the small posthumans could all integrate into a great
ball, but then they'd have become a sort of jupiter brain themselves,
certainly if thoughts, traits and experiences are shared freely.

I must admit that I really like this version. I cannot find anything
important to criticize. It is well thought out, precise and fairly easy to
read.

Now I just wonder when my membership of extropy institute will be up and
running. I applied about two months ago and nothing has happened. Has there
been a snafu with the server?

still, a jupiter brain is limited by his own definition of size... the
size of a jovian like planet...

there is also problems arising of the locality of a such big density...

what to do to add more capacity ? when all is optimized, you probably
have to add matter to make grow the jovian computer... but assuming what
i know and except some speculative theories of using neutron stars to
make computers with really high ultra efficient density, there will be
an alt when the density is too high.
to stop the growing process is too bad...

small upload have the benefits to provide the cornucopia of a
civilisation of minds, a jupiter brain with only one "identity" is
really alone. i think one of the joys of existence reside in
interractions between "peoples"

as far as i know, there is not enough matter available in our region of
the universe to make a such rich civilisation (by interaction between
differents entity)with jupiter brains only.

long distances are also a problems, with "liliputians", you could use
all the matter available, not neccessary with apparition of density
problems...

but my mind is not too clear about that now...

John Glenn mentioned that his bio monitor is taken as a large pill. 
>From there it monitors his heart rate, temperature, etc.

Does this pass through his system eventually?

A year or so ago the Alcor crowd was discussing "Lifelink" or some 
sort of biometer that would make sure the host arrived at the 
suspension facilities in fresh condition.

Perhaps we could create a new open standard for GPS-enhanced CDMA PCS 
cellphones that allows for a near-range telemetry link amd automatic 
contingency program that activates cell phone activity when certain 
biometric telemetry signals are received.

For example, if your heart stops and the cell phone is within 50 
feet, the cell phone automatically dials a help number and transmits 
your GPS coordinates.

This would appeal, I'm sure, to a lot of Senior citizens.

We need an API that allows for a programming the phone (maybe a few K 
of ram for a Java app), and some basic near range telemetry 
functionality for communication with the implant.

As for whether or not the implant should be permanent, I suppose that 
can be up to the individual.

We could have surgical implants, like pacemakers, or use 
suppositories (see http://define.com/balls.htm).

We could embed MEMS security keys in these things, so that *your* 
phone was *your* passport, wallet, and Lifelink.

P.S...on the subject of MEMS, we could put these into our 
wall-mounted flat panel displays, along with a terabyte of RAM, a 
variable power radio with a fast DSP, and a GPS unit, and that TV 
could become a packet router too.  Makes for a pretty wide pipe if 
everybody has one.

California researchers said Thursday they had completed the first "full"
teleportation experiment. 

                  They said they had teleported a beam of light across a
laboratory bench.

                  They did not physically transport the beam itself, but
transmitted its properties to another beam, creating a replica of the first
beam. 

                  "We claim this is the first bona fide teleportation,"
Jeff Kimble, a physics professor at the California Institute of Technology,
said in a telephone interview.

I think the reporter is missing the real boat here - surely quantal
entanglement allows information to pass from one spacetime location to the
other *instantaneously*, faster than light.  (Of course, you need to have
the prepared black box states already waiting, in advance, at either end,
so it won't get us to Alpha Centauri in less than 4.3 years - but it will
permit people at home to see the pictures in the very same instant the
explorers arrive [whatever *that* means, *pace* Einstein].)

michael, joe was referring to drexler's "engines of creation".  great stuff.

still available in bookstores, more than a decade after its first edition.
it would be great to have such a thing in soft copy, in order to search
it more effectively, but have not figured out a way to do such a thing
without robbing the author of his copyrights.  spike

 I'm impressed. Don't agree 100% of course, but it wouldn't be very Extropian
of me if there wasn't some of it I was skeptical about. It all seems so
sensible and inoffensive to me. I'll see if I can get someone to read it who
isn't familiar with Extropian ideas.

Hmm. Maybe Lego blocks have more potential than I thought. Don't have time to try

 Could work. I'd prefer a system with more local content though, even if it means
using less block types. The smaller the scope of the physical economy, the easier
it is to break off and head out.

 Tipler speculates on the ultimate in Peering Into the Past Technology  in
Omega Point. He assumes a universewide intelligence in a collapsing
universe. He contends that being could gather enough information from the
past to resurrect (simulate) us all. Personally, I would want a rather more
direct connection with my Future Self than a hi-res simulation.

 Another possibility is trading with a galactic civilisation that is
observing and recording us now. Perhaps a Galactic Archiving service is
already running, and we only need to know how to access it. A long way from
time travel though.

ken i have been thinking for some time about a biomonitor that
would ride inside the urinary bladder.  i have a notion that such
a thing could be constructed, perhaps 2 cm in length
and not more than about 4 mm diameter so that it could be
inserted thru the urethra without surgery.  the device would
need some sort of telemetry to com link with instruments
outside the body.

initially i thought such a device would monitor the chemistry of
the urine, perhaps giving some warning of conditions that lead
to kidney stones, however i now realize the device might be
applicable for monitoring other important functions.  spike

This caused me to flash on the solution to a vexing problem.  When 
water and sewer lines are buried in a subdivision-under-
construction, mischievous kids will often pull up the poles the crews 
use to mark their terminal connection points.  They are then a real 
time-consuming bitch to relocate.  If small radioactive isotopes are 
planted in the pipes' endcaps, they can be located with geiger 
counters.

No, it doesn't.  Quantum entanglement can pass data, but it cannot pass 
information.  Essentially you can only transfer uncrackably coded data
that requires a key that must be sent relativistically.

A link from the page I gave earlier leads to:
http://www.research.ibm.com/quantuminfo/teleportation/braunstein.html
which describes "classical" teleportation by scanning and re-creation.

The author makes an interesting point about the question of whether the
quantum state of particles is important in the body:

: What about the "quantum state" of those atoms? Does it matter what energy
: levels they are all in? Do the chemical reactions need to have this
: information to work once we reassemble the atoms to make a person? Well,
: my best guess is no! As is the best guess of several other scientists
: I've asked too. But that's hardly a definitive answer. I guess what
: tends to convince me that the detailed quantum state is not important
: to get right when you want to copy a person and make a new one from the
: partial information is that people routinely go to hospitals for NMR
: (nuclear magnetic resonance) and ESR (electron spin resonance) scans
: to see inside them. These procedures mix up the quantum states of at
: least some large number of atoms and nuclei of the people being scanned,
: yet it doesn't seem to disturb their appetites (that makes them still
: human in my book). Thus here again the quantum nature of our atoms and
: molecules doesn't appear to rule out the copying method for teleportation.

This appears to be evidence against Roger Penrose's theories that
quantum coherence is a necessary element of brain operation.  From what
I understand, people in these machines don't feel anything happening as
their quantum states are scrambled.  If long-range quantum correlations
were involved in thought and consciousness, it seems like these kinds
of scanners would cause noticeable disruption.

The unique aspect of quantum teleportation isn't its speed, which is no
faster than the particle which must travel between sender and receiver,
but the fact that the receiving particle ends up in exactly the same
quantum state that the sending particle was in.

This is significant only because of a peculiarly quantum phenomenon:
"you can't clone a quantum state."  That is, given a quantum particle,
it is impossible to create a duplicate which is in the same state.
Quantum teleportation exploits a loophole, which is that you *can* create
a duplicate if you destroy the original in the process.  (Of course it is
a matter of semantics then whether it should still be called a duplicate,
since there is only one.)

If we had classical physics, the analogous phenomenon to quantum
teleportation would be utterly mundane.  Measure the state of a system,
and send it to the other side, then build a system in the same state.
It is the impossibility of this technique in the quantum world which
made quantum teleportation such an amazing discovery.

As a matter of fact, teleportation of macroscopic objects like people
would almost certainly be done in the classical manner.  It is unlikely
that quantum phenomena play any role in determining our physical state.
Classical measurements of the particles which make up our brains and
bodies would be enough to create a remote duplicate.  With a sufficiently
mature technology, this will allow people to switch between uploaded
and physical bodies, and to travel to reception stations throughout
the universe, sending themselves as an information stream carried by a
light beam.

http://www.research.ibm.com/quantuminfo/teleportation/ has a description
and a picture of how quantum teleportation works.

As was already mentioned, it would not allow people at home to see
pictures from Alpha Centauri in real time.  Particles would have to
travel from there to here to carry any signals which would allow us to
see pictures, and those particles would travel no faster than light.

Signals in our brain travel at about 100 meter a second, light is
300,000 times faster, so signals in a super brain 60 miles
across would take the same time to cross from one end to
another as those in a human brain. 60 miles is not Jupiter
size but it's not exactly small either.

Sorry, that was bundled in as part of the black box protocol.  I assume (as
previous discussions here have elaborated) that one-use pads/keys are sent
along with the starship.  But I still thought that the *return* encoded
message would be instantaneous or spacelike.  (I've been privileged to read
part of a wonderful novel-in-progress by Charlie Stross that makes much
play of this neat device.)  Presumably, as Hal argues, that doesn't apply
to the photon stream experiment mentioned in the CNN news report.

This really has no bearing on my argument, since I 
am only speculating that one might be able to travel
back to one's *own* timeline (except for the addition
of oneself as the time traveler).  That is, I don't 
see any reason that it would have to extend to crossing
worlds "horizontally".

Actually, AFAICS, *all* of the possibilities have this 
feature.  In general, time machines which make use of
relativity require large twists in spacetime (like
Tipler's cylinder), and so you can't travel to a time
when the artifact didn't yet exist.

I am not aware of anyone proposing time machines that
*don't* use this sort of method...

Not in this case.  You can never go to a time

Just so.  This is a good reason why we shouldn't expect to see time
travellers swarming the streets.  On the other hand, it's plausible that
any number of *natural* time loops exist (cosmic strings, etc) and are the
strict and ferociously protected property of whoever reaches them first.
These might allow (non-paradoxical) passage almost back to the Big Bang.
It means that early time travellers are first of all space travellers.
Since interstellar travel takes a gruesome amount of energy unless you're a
nano-upload, one reason we don't see the time travellers is that we're
inhaling the sneaky little buggers.  The other reason is that they are
three feet tall and have big black wrap-around eyes.

Hmm, but how useful is a 60-mile brain which can only think at the same
speed as a human against microscopic posthumans who can think much
faster? Or are we assuming they're running at human speeds too?

A modern high-end PC delivers roughly 10^9 ops peak. Such performance is
distinctly underpowered to run even _one_ neuroanatomically correct neuron
in realtime. Since we have several 10^9 neurons to account for, I do not
see how a factor of 10^4 can make a measurable difference.

Even if we drop the requirements of having to emulate a particular human
brain and settle for an intelligent system instead, I very much doubt that
a 10 k node 21264 Beowulf is capable of intelligent action, however
carefully programmed. (Thinking of several billion transistors/node I
can't help but to notice that a 10 k node Beowulf would seem a
particularly wasteful way of utilizing them, maybe a 10^14 transistor WSI
FPGA++ run by GA could make a fair score on the Turing test).

I don't think that Moravec's notorious underestimates are doing the whole
field of AI a credit.

Actually, if Feynman's Transactional Interpretation of QED holds true, then
travelling in to the past should be no more difficult than a device that converts
the traveller's mass into antimatter in the future, then back to matter in the
past. Of course, this necessitates that time travel will only be possible
where/when a matter/antimatter converter is in existence. If your mass is
instantly converted to antimatter, you should start travelling back in time, as
anti matter is merely matter that is travelling backward in time, according to
the transactional interpretation. Granted, building a device that not only turns
normal matter into antimatter, but will maintain the biological structure of the
human body is a technological acheivement in and of itself.

Now, given this idea, since no matter/antimatter converters are in existence of
the type needed, then of course we will not have seen any time travelers come
back to this date from the future. They will be limited to traveling within their
own era.

This isn't what you were arguing before:

You are arguing that because no one has come back from the future
that it proves time travel (backward) is impossible. I merely
stated the obvious, the reason no one has come back from the future
isn't that time travel (backward) is impossible (although I believe
it is.) it's that the future hasn't happened yet.

Here you restate it, the logical error is so obvious, but the words
so slippery, that I was reminded of Lewis Carrol  (mathematician
Charles Dodgson).

First of all I made an error, light moves 3,000,000 times  faster than
the signals in the human brain not 300,000 so the brain could be 600
miles wide not 60. This just means that if a brain were much larger than that
we would probably consider such a thing not a single entity as we consider
ourselves but rather a colony of many very similar closely cooperating
individuals. It's a matter of taste, from some perspectives a human
mind is not just one thing either.

One thing is objective, such a brain would think 3,000,000 times faster
than we do, more actually because the components in it would be far
smaller than neurons. There is something even more important than speed
however, such a being would think astronomically deeper than we do.

Certainly a step in the right direction, but IMO still way
below the technology's true potential. Imagine a machine
that you just put on your head (I'm not sure how big the
total device would have to be, and how much energy it
would need etc., but even a static version would have great 
marketing potential) that gives you instant, safe pleasure
like you've never felt before. Resistance is futile -- you will
be pleasured, guaranteed. The ultimate form of entertainment;
you could look at a grey wall and still be amused (but to
make the experience more natural one could watch a
movie or listen to music for example). This kind of stuff
was so far only possible with dangerous (often illegal)
and unreliable chemicals. 

And this is just the pure hedonism part; other settings could
for example help you to achieve "deep thoughtful concentration" 
(great for work and study) or "super relaxation" (great against
all kinds of stress). How about using a relaxing or pleasure
setting during operations, or to relieve any kind of chronic
or acute pain. There is a world of possible applications out there
right for the taking. If there ever was a product that's virtually
guaranteed to sell then this must be it.

Now, can anyone tell me: why on earth isn't this product on
the market yet? Are there technical problems, or is everyone
just missing a great opportunity here? I mean, one could get
richer than Bill Gates by making a product that will virtually sell 
*itself*, and no doubt will change society quite a bit in the process.

Unfortunately that won't work. I can instantly change the state of your
receiver 1000 light years away but I can't send you a message. The
message is "encoded" and until you get the equivalent of a one time pad
it looks random to you. I can't send you the one time pad ahead of time
because I don't know what it will be, I only find out when I actually send the
particular message and quantum process create one, so now the only way
I have to get the one time pad to you is by old fashioned radio.  1000 years from
now when you receive the one time pad you can confirm that I have instantly
changed one apparently random state of you receiver into another apparently
random state. They weren't really random of course but they would look that
way to you until you got the pad.

Not to mention it would violate conservation theorems...

But actually I don't think this would cause you to travel backwards in
time.  Although the individual particles might be thought of as
travelling backwards in some theoretical sense, the larger system's
arrow of time will be determined by entropy and not by the nature of
its particles.

If you crowd antimatter particles into the left half of a sealed chamber,
they will expand to fill the chamber just like regular matter does.
The system changes to increase its entropy.  The same thing happens in
our bodies, as chemical and physical reactions occur.  Two copies of
the body, one made of antimatter and one of regular matter, should
evolve in parallel (modulo some esoteric asymmetries between the
two kinds of matter).

I don't quite understand how this argument works.

Suppose we wait until the future happens (so to speak!), and someone
invents a time machine that allows travel into the past.  I gather that
you think that is at least logically possible.

Now we travel into the past, back to good old 1998, and here we meet
Brian D Williams.  We introduce ourselves to him and say that we are
from the future and that we've come back in a time machine to visit him.

He says that is impossible, because the future hasn't happened yet, and
shows us his message which he had just sent off to the extropians list.

Obviously he is wrong in some sense, because he concluded that time
travel was impossible, yet it was possible, and we are there.  What is
wrong with his argument?

This notion of instantaneous transmission of "encoded" information doesn't
strike me as a very good analogy.

For one thing, the "speed" of transmission is potentially more than
instantaneous.  If you insist on thinking of this as transmission of
information, the problem is that it can go into the past as well.  It
can even go into the past light cone of the "transmitter", which makes
it faster than "faster than light".

Also (or equivalently), there is no well defined moment of reception.
Particularly in the case of quantum teleportation, where you are not
making measurements of the receiving system, you can't point to a time
at which the information was received.  You almost want to say that the
information travelled backwards in time to the point where the reception
particle was created, then forward with that particle throughout its
lifetime until the teleportation was done.

There are enough differences from what we normally mean by the phrase
that I don't think it is useful to call this phenomenon "transmission of
information" at all.

This sounds like an argument for centralized economic planning,

I thought the development of atomic bombs lead armies to avoid
concentrating their troops beyond a certain level.  And think 
of the scene in "Saving Private Ryan" where troops are told to 
spread out.  

Also, redundancy seems just as easy for small creatures as for large.

If such a device were invented and marketed, it would be made illegal within
a year, due to "deep ethical implications", or other equally vague phrases.

We're futurists, we should make a prediction every once in a while!  If 
you can reply to this by Sunday night, please take a stab at it, I 
would like to get a sense of how my own opinion fits in with others:

By the year 3000, it goes almost without saying that most humans will 
have the means and opportunity to evolve to the transhuman stage.  My 
question--will we have seen the first posthuman(s) by then?  How many?  
In what form?

I can distill this into a conference proposal if you keep it short and 
sweet (no need for long explanations) and get it posted by Sunday night.

Sin,

Kathryn Aegis

I do not think it is, or will be possible, to travel backwards in
time. You can be logically correct, but dead wrong. but lets play
this out anyway.

 I wouldn't be easy to convince, but we were arguing something
different. Dan's postulate (if I understood him) was that since no
visitor has returned from the future this proves time travel is
impossible. I guess to make it clearer there are at least two
possibilities. 1) time travel (backward) is impossible 2) The
future isn't here yet. So the lack of the visitor doesn't prove 1
because 2 is also possible.

Now to answer your question, If our future visitor arrived and was
successful in convincing me (I'd need a ride to prove it, well two
rides) then I would be flat out wrong, and we would not be living
in the present except from our perspective.

We would literally be history.

But as I stated I do not believe this is possible.

But it is fun to think about (another Lewis Carroll reference ;) )

 Moreover; I would add that the multiple beings have one HugE advantage
over, however wise and intelligent and whatever you can think of as a
realistic attribute, one and only one individual: the multiple points of
view.

  Even when a point of view is false, when parts of it include contrary
beliefs, lies, redundancies, it's far more richer than one unique set of
beliefs. An example: when a society of persons hold a belief contrary to
its goals or its happiness, it's better than one individual set in the
same kind of beliefs.

 You need to take a look at this project:

  This is really a huge lego project, with implications in space
conquest, medecine, machinery, etc, possibly a universal machine...

Probably, but you'd have sold millions by then. I wouldn't mind retiring after a
year or so ;-) Besides, it takes a while before you run out of coutries to market it
in, and then there's
still a massively lucrative black market. Some medical and educational applications
may even remain legal...

i'm not quite sure of that, an intelligent system with only one
identity, some part of this system who provide the illusion of being
one, probably to give to this system a quality of "adaptation" to his
environnement, can handle a lot of subagents, with something acting like
a central planner.
these subagents can compete and give their points of view. according to
certain rules (like darwinian evolution) the best points of view are
selected.

of course these agents can be very complicated and dynamically
evolutive.

i'm wondering what's the best topologies of intelligence could be, in
our solar system and his close surrounding, according to our actual
scientific worldview.

probably strong aglomeration of matter, to a certain extent provide huge
adventages.
but there is a compromise to reach between locality and dispersion.

we could imagine moon size computers surrounded by some kind of utility
fog build with something like the liliputian AI you were talking of.

or the moon size computers or asteroids used by a civilisation of small,
somewhat equals in their capacities, AI, as mere computers, tools.
with no embeded identity is the moon size, asteroids, or jupiter like AI
in such case.

i think of it and assuming the whole system is evolutive, i don't think
there is a easy to find configuration that is somewhat stable. Probably
there is some topological attractors in this problem anyway..

i would like to find more ressources according to this question...

is there somebody who can help?

  yes, but i've the idea that the global system of little AI will have
only one global configuration at each time, this configuration result of
the interactions of the "little AIs" with some kind of slow darwinian
selection.
the question is what is the most efficient : to give the whole a unique
identity or give some kind of identities to a huge number parts of it?

The reason travel into the past is, at the least, a dangerous 
proposition, is due to the logic underlying the Heisenberg 
Uncertainty Principle.  One cannot perceive without interaction, and 
that interaction may alter the subsequent flow of events in 
unpredictable (and perhaps catastrophic - see sensitive 
dependence on initial conditions and the butterfly effect) ways.  
Even the gravity of our bodies could alter things in unexpected 
manners.  To travel into the past would be to alter the past's future, 
our present.  If it were ever found to be possible, it should be 
forbidden in the interests of self-preservation.          Joe

If the brain is 600 miles across, and acts as a single entity, then its conscious
thoughts would be about the same speed as a humans. The contributions from the
sub-entities would take just as long to arrive as ours do, so I can't see it
thinking (as a single entity) any faster than us. The subconscious deliberation
behind each thought would of course be enormous.

Our particular brain model may not scale up very well.  Perhaps a better model
for the thinking process of such a large entity would be the supra-conscious
thinking of the human race, but speeded up tremendously. By supra-conscious
thinking, I mean the collective thinking we do through such processes as evolving
languages, cultures, economies, science etc. Perhaps the subentities of a Jupiter
brain would have time for interesting and fulfilling social lives, and well as
contributing to the (to them) incomprehensible thinking of the collective entity.

 If transhumanism is doable, I think it will be done by then. As to how many
there will be, its easier to speculate on how many humans will be left. Why
would someone not take advantage of the transhuman possibility? Religious
reasons maybe, but that has to hold through many generations. Or people who
choose to remain human in all but lifespan. Or people coerced by some
powerful entity who wants to keep a pure human breeding stock.

 If we have full control over both the shape of our bodies and our minds, I
expect the concept of "individual" to be pretty murky by then. So counting
them gets pretty dicey. I expect shifting coalitions of entities and
subentities with common histories and purpose, but a rather relaxed sense of
self. I would like to split off into a number of variations, some of whom
may merge again later to create a common history. Other aspects of me may
merge with other aspects of other people (and AI's) to form a kind of "mind
children".

 Staying human for 1000 years doesn't appeal to me. Does it to anyone else?

Bernard

Uh, arn't these called sex toys? :-)  

I've been inventing, developing, prototyping, and testing technosexual
devices for many years now.  I have many extremely unique, but so far
unpatented designs, some of which would cause you to collapse in
laughter upon hearing the details.  I know *I* did when I first
thought up the ideas.  Many of my designs are intended to enhance
partner sex, but training has been most effective with solosexual
activity.  I'll be glad to post descriptions and links to the list as
soon as I have protected my intellectual property.  However, with one
of my devices, I can give somewhat of a description without giving
away the farm, because much research is needed to make it work from
the description.  

It is a biofeedback technosexual stimulation device designed to teach
the capability of having a long series of intense orgasms (up to 12
hours in some test subjects, chemically aided of course).  The
stimulation is a complex function of input from a sensor on the PC
muscle. The PC or Pubococcygeus muscle goes around the anus, across
the entire pelvic floor, and attaches in front to the pubic bone on
both women and men.  To locate this muscle, simply stop the flow of
urine. A weak PC muscle will result in urinary incontinence. 

Many sex therapist think that to keep your PC muscle toned, you should
consciously squeeze and release it during masturbation and partnersex
to intensify each orgasm. These contractions can be felt in the anus,
vagina, clitoris, and penis (if you have *all* of those, your doing
very good :-)).  They also recommend tightening and releasing it as an
exercise throughout the day, to improve your functioning.  I disagree
with the former and the later for different reasons.  Both of which
are overcome by training from my machine which develops "fast
reflexive" muscles designed for extreme involuntary contractions of
the PC muscle.  I'm not ready to say much more about my devices on the
wider list yet, but hopefully will within the next year.  That is, if
I ultimately decide they are transhuman in nature, some of them
certainly are.  

The ones with biofeedback from the PC muscle are far too addictive to
make available as a commercial product and not expect legal problems. 
Of course, I *will* do it anyway :-).  Coming soon to a net-store near
you.

	Yes exactly!  I've always said true free agency is being able
to choose what you want to want rather than having the hot dog
(orgasmic sensation) hard wired to something like sex.  I want to cut
these agency destroying puppet strings that evolution has wired me to
want and completely re string them according to my will.  Emagine how
much paper work would get done if we could wire ourselves so that it
was better than orgasmic to get it done!... ;)

Maybe there is only one on the highest level (a "singleton"), but 
that being might simulate or contain vast numbers of minds, and it 
might be difficult to individuate some of these minds.

I imagine most of the matter and energy under control is either made 
into computronium -- optimized computational structures -- or into 
probes that are sent out to bring even more energy and matter under 
intelligent control.

At the start of the 20th century there were around a million horses in
London. Today there are around 5,000. The human species is slated by
some for the same reduction. The rest upload; - welcome to the machine.

That's odd.  When I asked the same question, the AI said two one-syllable

Lately, I've grown less fond of the word "human". It complicates the
situation.
Transhuman. Posthuman. People have such a hard time wrestling with the
definition of "human" or coming to grips with (or communicating) our growing
technological prowess and the "human" condition. It is much easier if you
view
our current form as nothing more than what the random engines of emergent
complexity created for us. Our identity can not be reduced below that of
conscious information processing systems, i.e., our "minds".

The trend is to increase our information processing characteristics. The
abilities
to acquire, process, retain, synthesize, utilize and synergize information
and
the information that emerges from those activities will continue to be
increased.
Concomitant with these objectives will be increased consciousness. By the
year 3000, we'll have abandoned the biological prostheses we currently
inhabit
for forms more amenable to the aforementioned objectives. Most of us will be
weak SI entities embarking on the self-modification path I've described in
an earlier
posting. Individual identity may become a relic as intelligent entities
converge on
the same state. This assumes that the number of possible states for higher
intelligent
entities decreases as intelligence increases.

To supplement my remarks concerning the term "human", it can be argued that
there are posthumans and transhumans among us already. Whether you look at
the corporate entities of scientist and computer, human and prosthesis
(artificial
organs, limbs, etc.), increased longevity, etc. Many people living today
would be
viewed as transhuman by our ancestors. Some would probably be viewed as
posthuman
or nonhuman. I think it is less confusing to treat ourselves as I've
described above.
Admittedly, it would be even more difficult to explain to the general public
how we should
not think of ourselves as human versus trying to convince them to become
transhuman.

Hope this helps,

I have included this url in my Science and Philosophy public bookmarks
with the proviso at:-

http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~income/bookmark.htm

"as with all the links in my bookmarks, I do not necessarily agree with
all the sentiments expressed therein. For example in the Extropian
Principles 3.0 and The Journal of Transhumanism, the term 'economic
growth' relies on capitalism and a price system which to my way of
thinking are at odds with a public-AI decentralised data fusion, Survey
Society. My definition of the word 'economy' is not so dogmatic and I do
not support these people."

 Yes. I'd bookmarked that before, but never got back to it. Worth checking. The
Robodyne building blocks look quite complex to me,  but clever. I've always liked the
idea of building a macro assembler out of a diminishing series of half sized
components. Came up with the same notion myself some time back. The designer doesn't
address problems of positioning or error detection. So I think his claims are rather
over-hyped. Still, its more of a start than anyone else has done that I've heard of. Be
interesting to see where it goes.

Hello Damien,
I heard you on the abc the other week
went straight out and bought your book
it's been a long time since i can remember going out with such set
purpose to track down a particular book (due in equal amounts to your
good self, charm and wit and intelligence -by the way, Adams' humour
didn't get your (funny) jokey response to his question: Why make these
things so bloody small, which, if you recall, went something like this:
"well, i suppose for doing very tiny   and also the good adams himself)
I wasn't disappointed
congratulations and thank you
you've considerably enriched the humble furnishings of my  unSpiked
brain!

michael fitzgerald
melbourne

PS
this is just what it purports to be: a friendly thank you/acknowledgment

beyond that, now i know where you hang out, i can look forward to
reading 'you' at greater length, and perhaps, who knows, I might bravely
venture the odd question, comment etc.
We never tire of saying it: but this is a great medium, isn't it:
sitting on the dunny one day, listening to Adams, the next day reading
your book, the next week: here am i, subsisting (perspectively) in a
corner of a cyber-agora, a discreet distance maintained, listening to
the public forum in which we find ourselves, like good republicans of
older orders, debating the great issues of all time...
well shit, i dunno...

I'm absolutely NOT off the doomsday scenario type, but I wanted to
theorize that IF time travel is possible, and IF it is something that we
can conceive in any capacity in the future, it's quite possible we've
never seen a time traveler because humanity doesn't survive long enough
to reach the point in thought where we can conceive of a way to travel
through time.  OR, on the same token, we advance well enough that
mentally that when we do discover time travel, we're ALL mature enough
not to take this technology into the past?.  OR someone in the future
changed something in the past that will make us not reach time traveling
technology until a certain point where we've reached "maturity".  In any
case, I'm wondering if anyone has any evidence to prove that we with
either should or shouldn't detect time travel?

Some truth in that, if your receiver is a detector of polarized light then
it's not clear if the message was received when you measured the
rotation of your polarizing filter or when you determine if the photon
I sent you makes it through the filter or not; and you could set the filter
even before I sent my message.

It's not faster than light but this phenomenon can transmit information,
teleportation can be used to get information out of a system without
causing quantum decoherence, that's why those who want to make a
quantum computer are interested in it.  Something like it has also been
used in real world in quantum cryptography to transfer financial information
between banks.

Having just finished Tipler, he didn't say that. With infinite computation
available, ALL possible past universes and ALL of their states are
simulated. No past information is needed. A very GENERAL form of
resurrection. (IMHO rather meaningless...)

 Its a long time since I read Tipler. Must have been wishful thinking. That is a
very weak and unappealing form of resurrection. As you say, rather meaningless.
That still leaves cryonics as the best resurrection option so far.

Once again we encounter the broad range of contexts in which we each
individually experience and live out the implications of a transhumanist
vision.  As I've noted before, I'm sometimes struck by how some of our
compadres who live and work exclusively in more "advanced" regimes of academia
or "progressive" communities sometimes seem a little out of touch with "the
mainstream".  I'm not thinking of any particular person here, just a general
observation . . .

I live and work primarily in a very conservative milieu and have to always be
on guard against communicating in a fashion that either alienates people or is
simply so incongruent with their thinking and experience that they have no
comprehension at all of what I'm talking about.  The stories I can tell about
conversations that have followed a question about my Alcor pendant . . .

 I think he hasn't really addressed the problem. As I see it, it's
mostly a software problem: what Operating System do you use :-)? Fractal
shape changing robots would probably need a fractal OS, every part would
need to have a behavior relative to its surrounding, as well as a link
to a more general control mechanism.

  Just like you can move your arm, but you can't contol your cells...

   We need to see if he can commercialise it, design macro and micro
scale robots (using magnetic instead of mechanic properties). If he
does, the principle can be extended to just about anything mechanical.

    Manu.

Den,  I'm having a hard time recalling the details, but 
there was a research scientist working out of a 
Canadian university who has published several papers
on the effects of a machine he designed which
manipulated and focused electromagnetic frequencies
on various places in the brain.  It looked like a rather 
large and cumbersome helmet.  Anyway, the subjective 
reports from the experimental subjects included feelings
of deep relaxation, spiritual insight, out-of-body 
experiences, etc.  These effects sound similar to those 
produced through the direct stimulation techniques used 
by Wilder Penfield.

Mind machine people talk about the greatest effects 
occurring at the "crossover point", that point where the 
brain starts generating greater levels of theta than alpha.
Interestingly, for most people the crossover point is close 
to 7.8 hertz, a frequency which is also known as the 
"Shumann Frequency", the natural resonant frequency of
the Earth's electromagnetic field.  Is it all about getting "in
tune" with mother Earth?

Anyway, this Canadian researcher noticed that UFO reports
around the world were strongly correlated to fluctuations in the
Earth's magnetic field and posited that these fluctuations were
inducing hallucinations.  I also recall some reference to tectonic 
plate activity as generating some of these fluctuations.

Anyway, he had the closest thing to what you seem to be 
describing that I've heard of.  Except, of course, for "The Orb" 
seen in Woody Allen's movie, "Sleeper".

You might want to send your brief definition of posthuman, just to make
sure we're all answering the same question:-) 

There is a strong possibility that humans will be able to use technology to
augment themselves, while still remaining essentially human, thus evolving to
the transhuman stage. Different futurists make different estimates of when
this will happen, with radical, moderate, and conservative estimates of
ten, thirty, and a hundred years, respectively, while mystics claim that
it can never happen.

Given transhumanity, how long will it take for posthumanity to appear?
If we define a posthuman as a superintelligent entity whose capabilities
and motivations are no longer comprehensible to humans, I feel that
posthumanity will follow immediately from transhumanity via a
rapid-feedback process. 

How many and in what form? One, in whatever form it wants. It will
have the means to optimize the organization of all the matter in the
solar system, and the intelligence to decide on its own definition of
"optimum." There is no way to know if our current understanding of
computing architectures or of the organization of human consciousness
is relevant, but if so the posthuman may organize itself as a collection
of quasi-autonomous sub-entities.

Will the posthuman have completed its reorganizaton of solar matter
by the year 3000? I don't know. This will depend on the laws of
thermodynamics and whether or not the posthuman is willing to expend
mass and energy to rapidly cool the Sun down to a useful temperature.

It definitely looks like the technology is there, but no-one is
using it anywhere close to its real potential. I'm not sure how
recent the abovemtioned research is, but it seems like there
hasn't been much activity lately. Very surprising, as we now
could do a lot more thanks so massive increases in computing
power and better brain imaging techniques.

Here's basically what I'd like to do: gather all available research
material in this particular field, especially Dr. Delgrado's work
(is he still alive? If so, he might be willing to co-operate). Though
implants seem to give the best results, they aren't exactly
user-friendly (though in some cases they might be acceptable,
for instance with patients that suffer from severe chronic pain),
so we'd have to fucus on directed microwave beams, for example.
This has allegedly been used by the CIA and such, though mostly 
as a weapon. 

The design: some kind of helmet seems an obvious choice, or
(preferably) a headphone-like contraption for portable use. As
relatively little energy is used, this may be feasible. Since
it's very important to hit the right regions of the brain, you'll
need an accurate "targeting system". Perhaps sonar could 
be used for this (to create a rough image of the brain, which
in combination with a standard model of a brain could be
used by the machine's computer to determine where to aim
-- or is this too difficult for today's tech?) MRI or other
scanning techniques could be used too, but then the machine
probably wouldn't be portable (or affordable). Maybe something
for a luxury/research model though...By using multiple beams
that only produce effects when they converge you could perhaps
target deeper areas of the brain as well, though I'm not sure
whether this could be achieved with "safe" intensities.

Another, more simple variant would have to be "finetuned" by
hand, by trying different kinds of settings and programming
your preferences into the computer (every time you use it, as
you never put the "helmet" in *exactly* the same position).
Movement could also cause the helmet to hit the wrong spot,
so some kind of safety would have to be built into it. Of
course, it could turn out that fairly large spots on the brain
produce the same results when stimulated, so that the
machine's aim doesn't have to be perfect.

The earth as a big mental vibrator? :-) It would certainly
make sense that this somehow got incorporated into our
evolution.

There also seems to be a portion of the brain that produces 
religious experiences when stimulated (the same one perhaps?)
Maybe (very maybe) if you could turn on and off people's
religious experiences it would help to further atheism, an
interesting side-effect of this technology. Maybe the very
realization that our very being, our senses, emotions, memories
etc. can be manipulated at the touch of a button would cause
something of a revelation for some (many?) people. Just
hearing about obscure experiments in some lab far away is
one thing (this can easily be ignored), but having it done
to yourself, literally holding your very being in the palm of
your hand, is a lot harder to dismiss. Widespread use of
mind machines could thus have something of an enlightening
effect (for some, anyway).

Nope, this one aimes for the ultimate pleasure spot, the head,
instead of loitering around the pelvic area ;-) Besides, there
are a lot of other possible settings, though "pleasure" would 
no doubt be the most popular one.

Please do, I can't wait to see a real "transhuman" sex toy.

So, it's basically one of those things that tone your muscles

Pretty smooth idea! Why didn't *I* think of that?

The beauty of the mind helmet is that it doesn't require any practice

Push the "lust" button and even your hamster will seem irresistible.

why would you ever need to, hara ra?  kidney stones do
their damage when passing thru the tiny ureter, a tube with
the inner diameter of a human hair that connects the kidney to
the bladder.  a large kidney stone is typically the size of
a grain of rice.  after the stone arrives in the bladder, all is well,
for it then passes harmlessly and painlessly thru the relatively
enormous urethra and out to sea.  the implant could be left
in place indefinitely, even if it failed.

is this really *easily done*?  even the telemetry part?  if
so i volunteer to carry one.  {8^D  spike

greg, man isnt that the truth.  i work in an area that affords me the luxury
of risking alienating people or appearing wacky, since my work is usually a
solitary task.  i am amazed at how few even way technical types are
willing to entertain the notion of cryonics.  even more surprising to me
is how many will admit, upon having it carefully explained, that
such a scheme might work but it isnt for them.  WHY?  that is
the most illogical thing i can think of.  yes, we would be thawed in
a world without friends and family, but we can always make
new friends, marry into a new family, and remember, all the stupid
goons that really jerked you around before are all gone too.  {8^D
perhaps replaced by new stupid goons.  {8-[

heres a thought.  the chances of some form of long life are
cumulative, like a risk model in a satellite launch.  the way you
deal with them is to take product of the probabilities of the negative.
for instance if you estimate the chances of long life by cryonics at 5%, then

cryonics not = .95

then you estimate the probability of say, nanotechnology not providing
long life, say .97 etc, then 1 minus the product of these is your chances
of long life (when i say long i mean hundreds or thousands of years).

my estimates:                                        probability

cryonics not =                                        .90
nanotechnology not =                             .95

caloric restriction not =                             .99

That could be the explanation of the Fermi Paradox, the reason we can't
find any ET's. If it were possible to change your emotions to anything
you wanted, alter modes of thought, radically change your personality, swap
your goals as well as your philosophy of life at the drop of a hat it would
be very dangerous. Once you change yourself you may not want to change back,
even if your behavior became bizarre or suicidal.

Ever want to accomplish something but been unable to  because it's difficult,
well just change your goal in life to something simple and do that;
better yet, flood your mind with a feeling of pride and self satisfaction and
don't bother accomplishing anything at all. Think all this is a terrible idea
and stupid as well, no problem, just change your mind (and I do mean CHANGE
YOUR MIND) now you think it's a wonderful idea.

Complex mechanisms don't do well in  positive feedback loops, not electronics,
not animals, not people, not ET's and not even Jupiter brains.

I would like to introduce two pages I have created toward Transhumanism. 
One of them is a message board... not to take away from this, heaven 
forbid. The other is a page I wish to build up with the advice and 
suggestions of you good people. If there are any informative links or 
fun links dealing with Extropy, please let me know so I can add them to 
the list. I would also like to fill out my page with an introduction 
consisting of what Extropy and Transhumanism are. 

BTW... is there a site that has really good transhuman art on it. Not 
for the page, but because I love art and would like to see some. 

Thank you for your time. Be well.

Instead of pushing the finicky implant design, how much easier it
would seem to merely wear a wristwatch with added functionality:
short-range biotelemetry to an immobile modem-equipped device in a
flat, or a belt-worn biotracker with cellular modem and GPS outdoors, 
periodically linking up to a tracking server cluster. 

Using Li-cell driven (power good for a month at least) contactless 
sensors like MEMS accelerometers, photophlethysmography and 
photooxytometry etc.signals evaluated by a low power embedded, 
periodically bursting data via a cellular modem to a high-availability
Linux system cluster with a GIS (all open source, of course) you can
prototype such a design within months.

Personal/pet trackers using GPS have been already disclosed, adding
biotelemetry would seem just an afterthought. Actually I am surprised
such designs have not entered the marketplace a few years ago, as they
would have vast commercial potential, geriatric structure trend of the
developed societies considered.

 Here is my try at a prediction, which is also something of a political
view...

  We will have more and more means of (re)defining what we are.
Culturally or technically. The laws of evolution are still acting, only
there is no more of a harsh physical selection: genetic phreaks can
survive, and in the near future will live. As time pass by, we could
probably modify ourserlf so much that actual humans could only talk
about monsters. Ie: small person, with air filled bones and wings...
(demon or angel wings, you choose); social humans, big bulky humans,
machinic humans, whatever can be done.

   But still, allways, human. It's just an identification after all,
many groups use it to identify themselves, and finally, to become
inhuman or anhuman might be an impossible task.

    One thing, a philosoph (possibly technophob) with which I had
vaguely stated this idea dismissed it with one argument: -who- will
choose what we will become? Simple: the individual itself.

     Although there might be loads of troubles, past choices of an
individual, for exemple, might reduce its future possibilities. And I
got to think about problems with our mind, our memories, our neural
net...

      Manu.

Why, the commonly-accepted, widely used, garden variety definition of
posthuman, of course....y'know, that which ain't human no more....(she said,

By the year 2050 at the absolute latest (assuming no civilization-destroying
wars) I expect that there will be nothing recognizably mortal, much less
human, in our Solar System.  It's a matter of positive feedback.

What will there be in a subjective millennium?  (Or whatever period puts us at
an interesting point along the trajectory?)  Now *there* is an interesting question...

IN THE FOLLOWING PAPER, 

"On the basis of the perceptual control theory 
of Powers, the market mechanism is analysed as
a negative feedback loop..."

http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/MarketCo.html

LATER, HOWEVER:-

"Wealth and poverty tend to be self-reinforcing. 
Poor people do not have the means to get a good education,
to start a business, to invest money, or do any of the 
other things which typically lead to high income. This
vicious circle or positive feedback loop can only 
be broken by outside intervention, e.g. by the government
providing free education, or subsidizing business start-ups."

THE PAPER CONCLUDES THAT MONEY IS A FAULTY FEEDBACK COMPONENT

"An even more challenging issue for further research 
is the cognitive development of the economic control
system. The analogies with neural mechanisms of learning 
we proposed barely scratch the surface of this
problem domain. Further inspiration may be found 
in some more detailed models for distributed,
supra-individual learning via computer networks 
which we proposed earlier (Heylighen & Bollen, 1996;
Bollen & Heylighen, 1996). Computer and communication 
technologies provide particularly effective ways to
implement an efficient "nervous system" for the 
socio-economic organism. We already discussed the
example of the computer-controlled stock exchange 
to illustrate the enormous gains in sensitivity that 
can be achieved in that way. 

In addition to the software agents and learning 
hypertext webs discussed in our earlier papers, the 
software technology based on "workflow" holds particular 
promise. The main idea behind workflow is that tasks,
belonging to a larger project, are automatically 
sent by the computer system to the person or group best
qualified to handle them. Once a part of the job has 
been finished, the provisional results together with the
subsequent questions are forwarded to the next one in 
line, and so on. For example, the manufacture of cars
requires the completion of a number of subtasks, such 
as buying tyres, steel, plastic, etc. An automated
computer system, when receiving an order for a certain 
amount of cars would automatically order the
required amounts of tyres and other components 
to the suppliers that make the best offer, and continuously
monitor in how far the orders are fulfilled. By comparing 
orders fulfilled by different producers, it might even
learn which suppliers are most reliable and efficient 
and take this into account when making further orders. 

Such technologies could make the socio-economic system 
much more efficient and intelligent, providing it
with a real "global brain" (Heylighen & Bollen, 1996; 
Russell, 1996; de Rosnay, 1996; Mayer-Kress &
Barczys, 1995). Further development of the control 
system model of the economy and the distributed
cognition structure characterizing it may help 
us to support that development."

I'm happy to report that a long piece by me about the Singularity (or
varieties thereof) as depicted in science fiction has been accepted for a
collection of papers in honor of the futurist and scholar I F Clarke, to be
called *Histories of the Future*.  The collection has been formally
accepted for publication by Macmillan in the UK and St Martin's in the USA,
and is edited by academics Alan Sandison and Robert Dingley.  Should be an
intriguing book!

There was a speculative book called "History of the Future, a chronology" by
Peter Lorie and Sidd Murray-Clark, Doubleday, 1989.  A "history" from year
2000 to 3000.  A bit new age, but still some good extropian themes.

        Out of curiosity, what parameters are you basing this hypothesis on?
True, technological progress is being manifested at a rapidly quickening
pace, but the moral mindset of this planet's human habitat is generally
stubborn, pessimistic and myopic.  Given the opportunity of "right here,
right now" transcendence into a higher form, it is doubtful that every
single mortal would want to upload.  There is far to much human stigma.
Furthermore, the assumption that technology will have progressed *that* far
in the next fifty years is not an extrapolation that I would care to gamble
on.  Though I would honestly love for this claim to be true, my optimism
wanes in the face of my realism.  Show me good, hard, *tangible* evidence
for your hypothesis and I will probably believe it as well.

whoa, gene, you're a few decades ahead of me in technology.  i never
heard of either of the words you prefixed with photo.  please define.
the reason i suggested a bladder implant is that it could directly
sample and report urine chemistry, perhaps to a belt buckle receiver/

perspiration tho.  perhaps one of the medics on extropians could
comment on the usefulness of that data.  spike

Dunno what Eliezer would say, but here's my two cents:

Yes, it is unlikely that the greater part of humanity will
ever upload.  However, the extraordinary conpetitiveness of
even fast human level intelligence (say, faster by a factor
of 10) will mean that if a small percentage of transhumans
intend to compete for the Earth's resources, some other 
transhumans and all humans will lose.  IOW, upload or else.

The only technology required for that assumption is nanotech,
and that seems to only be 5-20 years away.  Curiously, the 
people most knowledgeable about nanotech predict the shortest
times until we have it (e.g. Zyvex' website claims that they
will have an assembler within 5-10 years).  If so, and if 
the resulting machine is replicating, then posthumans could
exist within weeks of that point.

Please, help me: i'm about to read the document i found referred to on

Anyone?

 About identity, and not going into the details of each entity
knowledge, there might be nothing incompatible between a society of
agents, each one with an identity, and the society behaving also with an
identity... You turn it the way you like, the shift of resources between
central and federal entities has to be worked out.

Point of order: Shaun asks for tangible evidence for a predicted future event.
I think we all need to agree that this is infeasible. I therefore assume
Shaun wants to see Elizier's methodology for extrapolating present trends
to his predicted outcome. Elezier and others have covered this ground
many times, most recently in the singuarity discussion on the transhuman
list.

A small clarificaton: you mean that nanotech results in posthumanity.
I agree. However, nanotech is not the only way to get there. For
example, I claim that strong AI also results in posthumanity, so
even in the unlikely event that nanotech should prove to be infeasible,
that won't prevent the advent of posthumanity. Incidentally, I don't see
how nanotech self-replication results in posthumanity in days or weeks
unless it gets there by a massive increase in computing capacity resulting
in a massive increase in the intelligence of some computer-augmented or
computer-based intelligence. But, the existance of a such an intelligence
can easily result in nanotech in days or weeks.

I just did an Alta Vista search on "Michael Persinger". 196 articles.
A great many of them appear to be connected to Paranormal stuff. I
can't quickly determine whether Dr. Persinger has become involved with
the paranormal or whether his research has been co-opted. This is a
shame, because it looks like he started with some solid and reproducible
experiments. I'll have to rely on someone like Susan Blackmore to sort
this out. For example, look at:

You've lost me here. How does the term "economic growth" rely on any
particular system? "Economic growth" means no more than an increase in the
total measurable output of an economy. It does not specify how that economy
is organized. The current version of the Principles does not even mention
the price system.

Anyone who thinks there is going to be some kind of choice involved is being
naive and optimistic to the point of lunacy.  Do we give children a choice as
to whether or not they have to grow up?  Most imaginings on this subject
basically resemble a bunch of children who have never seen or heard of adults
discussing whether they ought to grow up and what kind of wonderful society
they'll make if they do.

First-graders attach a large stigma to education.  It hasn't made a noticeable
difference.  They are not major factors in politics.

Why does it matter (except to us) whether this happens in five years or five
hundred?  But anyway, we've *got* two-way computer-telepathy implants,
collaborative filtering, enough 'Net-connected computing power to match the
human brain, quantum computing, atomic-level manipulation, and neurological
intelligence enhancement.  Sure, most of these technologies are at the
vacuum-tube stage - but so what?  At this point, everything is just a matter
of predictable miniaturization and known paths of research.  No unexpected
brilliancies are needed, although I'm sure there will be many - who'd heard of
quantum computing a few years ago?  Where was the Web when _Mind Children_ was
written?  Had I.J. Good heard of nanotechnology?

All these lines, projected into the future, intersect in and about 2025.  If
just one breakthrough is needed (quite plausible), we could get it by 2005. 
In 2025 we'll have a lot of converging, synergetic Singularity tech, making it
the most arguable point.

By 2050 we'll be supersaturated.  A thousand times human processing power on
every desktop, home-neurosurgery kits, Parallel Scanning Tunneling Probe
atomic desktop printers, thousand-qubit CPUs, a Net with a *quadrillion* times
human power, million-neuron two-way interfaces...  Even uploading would be
possible at this point, given a Manhattan Project.  This scenario is
ludicrous.  The Singularity occurs long, long before, or grey goo eats the
world, or some paranoid blows up the planet.

 As someone who routinely subjects various and sundry people to  highly
focused and intense electromagnetic energies during the course of  his day
to day activities, I have to take exception to this thread. While it is true
that given sufficient RF input  individuals can
and do percieve direct stimulation to their nervous system ( visual
sensations, peripheral nerves firing-muscle twitching), it seems highly
unlikely that an unmodified brain (  one with no little glass electrodes
imbedded in strategic areas ) could be stimulated in any sort of meaningful
way. The best focusing that is achieveable in my admittedly non-universal
experience is about 1mm. That is quite good enough for some outstanding
diagnostic images ( yes, I'm talking about Magnetic Resonance Imaging ),
that still means that you are stimulating a great many neurons and even that
much focusing requires the recipient to be in a rapidly changing magnetic
field of cosmic intensity. For those of you who have not had the (pleasure
?) of an MRI brain scan, I'll tell you what it feels like. IT'S LOUD!!! The
rapid alteration in the field gradients that allow image production
(focusing) produce sounds that are roughly equivalent to being right in
front of the speaker at a rock concert. It's certainly not something you
would be unaware of.

Yes.

About this I am not so sure.  While strong AI *may* result
in posthumanity, I think that positive feedback with a cycle
time of weeks or months would be required (or even days...).
This would require an AI that was already vastly more 
intelligent than we are, and it is this that I am not sure of.
Is such a thing even possible?  Might it be that the system
which our brains use for intelligence/consciousness simply
cannot scale up?  The only evidence I can show for such a
hypothesis is mental illness.  So far as I am aware, other
animals do not become insane, but humans do.  (This is rambling
on, and I am not certain enough of my subject to be coherent,
so I'll shut up now.)

I do not insist that posthumans be more intelligent than humans,
only that they are recognizably more than human. 
The fastest path to posthumanity, AFAICS, is a copy-upload of
one of the people working on the subject.  Nanotech would seem
to allow that within days of a replicating assembler.  Such a
copy could then speed up by a factor of at least a hundred,
rendering it far more capable of controlling its environment
than are we.

You know what?  You're absolutely right.  :)

This would probably have some really awful effects on whomever is within
that light cone!  Anyone who could have been reached by light emitted by
the inventor could travel instantly to any time since the gateway's
invention, as well as any other time/place within the light cone.  Eep!

At first I thought I understood you, but now I can't make sense of what you
might mean by "the future isn't here yet."  

If we find that no time travellers have travelled back to any time within
the last week (time period A), then no time traveller will travel back into
A.  We know this because if the traveller did travel into A, then they
would appear in A, and this would contradict our earlier finding that no
traveller appeared in A.  This isn't faulty logic here as far as I can tell.

Another way of putting it:  Suppose I experience time period A.  At the
very instant time period A ends, (call it instant B,) I either write a Y on
a certain piece of paper if a visitor showed up, or I write the letter N if
there wasn't.  Now imagine that I live through A and at instant B I write
an N.  Many years later, a time traveller decides to go back to time period
A.  Assume that I can find and identify time travellers perfectly.  (This
is a false assumption, obviously, but that isn't what we're debating here.)

Here's the question:  Did write Y or N at instant B?

First we note that it is not sensical to ask the question before instant B.
 We also note that after that instant, the question has a definite yes/no
answer.  It's not possible for me to have put N on the page and then,
later, for me to have put a Y on the page at instant B.  Instant B is an
instant.  The events that take place during an instant in the past do not
change in the future.

I would answer the question thus:  when the time traveller came back, and I
identified the traveller, it would revise all of the history to follow.  I
*would* have noticed a time traveller in time period A, and at instant B I
would have put a Y instead of an N.  

However, in this case, at NO time in the past did the page have an N.  It
might have an N in some alternate universe/history/world, but not this one.
 In this universe, there would never have been a time in which the page
said N.

In other words: if arbitrary time travel is possible in the future, and the
time traveller returns to my past/present, and I can identify time
travellers, I would always have remembered seeing one.  (I have an N on my
page.)  It has nothing to do with whether the future is "here" or not.
When the future happens, the past would be altered.  We can look at the
past, which will not change in the future, to see what effects if any the
future may have on the past.

I think this thread is about transcranial magnetic stimulation
(essentially, a helmet consisting of a geodetic array of magnetic
coils, occasionally fired with GIANT current pulses. I think this has some
limited potential beyond the purely disruptive, if the coil kernal
geometry is tweaked, as the pulse power, and, most importantly, the
right spatiotemporal pulsing sequence. Who knows, with enough R&D the
device might find recreational uses! ;)

Did you know that with the right pulse sequence MRI can induce current
differentials in relatively small voxels? Way better resolution than transcranial
stimulation.

Yes, the gradient coils resonate -- and with time you can really
distinguish the pulse sequences -- even without absolute pitch! ;)

Even worse, if you lie motionless in a monotonous, loud environment
for hours (e.g. experimental fMRI scan), with time you get all kinds
of funky acustical and even optical hallucinations due to sensoric
deprivation.

Let me quote how you qualified the use of the term "economic growth".
------------------
Robin Hanson's JOT ABSTRACT http://www.transhumanist.com/

    "Economic growth is determined by the supply and 
demand of investment capital; "

Max More EP 3.0 http://www.extropy.org/extprn3.htm

"The market price system encourages conservation, substitution, 
and innovation, preventing any need for a brake on 
growth and progress. "

--------------------

I say: Investment capital and the market price system mean 
only one thing; - money. Although the market system 
is analysed as a negative feedback loop, money has 
been shown to create self re-inforcing positive 
feedback loops of wealth/poverty vicious circles.

-------------------

Nigel says: http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~online/transact/

The global economy and capitalism as we have known 
it is already in transition. 

The industrial mode of development is being 
transformed by the emergence of a new techno-economic
paradigm - brought about by the pervasiveness of 
effects of the new technologies - heralding a new
informational mode of development. 

The main distinctive feature that constitutes the 
information technology paradigm is that information is its
raw material. In previous technological revolutions, 
information simply acted on technology, whereas now,
the new technologies act on information. New sources 
of energy underpinned successive industrial revolutions, 
just as information is the 'energy source' of the 
information technology revolution. Information 
processing enables knowledge to intervene upon 
knowledge itself in order to generate higher 
productivity, as with finance capital. 

The informational mode of development represents 
a discontinuity within capitalism - exemplified by the
paradigm shift - however, this is a coterminous process 
that for the moment cannot be disengaged from the
continuance of the industrial mode of development 
that it has transformed. 

The emergence of the information technology paradigm 
can be seen as a continuity within the dynamics of 
capitalism - as can the coterminous processes of 
financial capital and globalisation be seen as 
continuities of capital - but aspects of the new 
informational mode of development represent 
discontinuities with industrial capitalism, as 
organisational aspects show a qualitative shift 
has occurred in the structure of society itself. 

Quantitatively speaking though, the informational 
mode of development represents an exponential
escalation of every dimension. The certain 
continuity of this exponential escalation will 
inevitably determine the necessity for the 
informational mode of development to disengage 
from capitalism and the straight jacket
of finance capital's price and double-entry 
bookkeeping systems, heralding a new transaction-
based economic system managed by a bevy of global 
artificial intelligence engines.

Perhaps I was being too polite. In general, When I see something on the
web that is nearly 100% associated with paranormal and for which I can
find no obviously credible scientific literature, I assume that it is
hogwash. I'm always willing to reassess this assumption if credible
evidence comes along, but I feel no need to spend much time looking for
it. I'll leave that to people who have the expertise, the time, and the
interest. My "research" (5 minutes scanning the Web) leads me to believe
Persinger saw the type of effects you describe as easily reporducible
with MRI equipment. Then he, or perhaps others, extrapolated wildly beyond
his data and off into fantasy land.

Look at the bottom of:

it claims the quote is from a "letter to John Adams, 1 August 1816."
  However, I haven't checked out the validity of this.

I have prepared a review of Ben Bova's new book that I would like to share
with the extropians list.

I had eagerly awaited the opportunity to read Ben Bova's new book entitled
"Immortality:How Science is extending your Life Span and Changing the
World". I had envisioned that this book, with Bova's name
recognition, could substantially extend the audience for the topic of
anti-aging research.

However I have been disappointed in several respects even though this is a
book which covers many of the basic themes underlying current anti-aging
research. The book seems to lack focus in that Dr. Bova covers topics that
are peripherally related to aging and covers them at a very basic level
suitable for a high school student. Sometimes the explanations that Bova
supplies are simplified to the point of being misleading if not in outright
factual error. I would expect a better standard of accuracy from such a
widely published author.

I strongly contend against the belief that a "cure" for the aging process is
imminent and/or inevitable. I am of the opinion that such a belief engenders
a complacency that may act as a self-averting prophecy and will abort the
extension of the human life span in the near future. This is not an easy
problem. Cancer and AIDS are both relatively simple compared to the aging
process and they have each confounded us for decades.

The only way that substantial extension of the human life span will be
attained is through acknowledging the difficulty of the problem and
allocating resources accordingly. Bova, on the other hand, implies that
current research programs are enough to deliver significant benefits within
a short time frame. I would prefer him to be correct but I am not going to
count on it. I am hoping for the best but preparing for the worst

The fact that "Dr." adorns this cover prominently when it does not appear on
many of Bova's other publications strikes me as a cheap marketing ploy. It
is later made clear in the preface that Dr. Bova is "not a scientist by
training" nor is he a medical doctor as the unsuspecting might believe due
to the byline. This is also made apparent by his limited grasp of the
concepts that he attempts to explain.

The lack of depth in his research typifies the journalistic approach to
these topics which prefers sound bites over substance. The hyperbole
adorning the dust cover is comparable in exageration to that of Michael
Fossel's book "Reversing Human Aging".

He seems impressed with the research into human Growth Hormone (hGH) but
fails to provide any supporting references. To be fair, however, Bova does
touch on the broad issues and points of aging research but I still would
have to recommend Steven Austad's book "Why We Age"
or James Goczewski's "Aging" or even Fossel's book over this one.

I dug into this, since the details are mysteriously absent from the book
and its jacket.   Bova has a doctorate in education.  Fans of Heinlein's
THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST-- will recall some amusing (and doubtless unfair)
discussions about this species of qualification.  (Not that Heinlein would
have been any kinder about my own doctorate, which is in discourse analysis.)

I had a really serious talk recently about going to a remote cabin with:
1) water from a well
2) wood burning stove
3) lots of dehydrated food for "deep storage" of several months supply of
food

The thought was that the electrical companies in the United States share a
power grid. If a few electrical companies' power go out then a domino effect
will occur due to the fact that energy companies have few reserves and
depend on buying residual power (excess production) from each other.  A few
failures and black outs will results.

This seems (unfortunately) reasonable ** IF ** power outages do occur.  I
have read (from computer programmers some of which are on this List I think)
that such outages are possible or even likely.

*** WHY *** would any outages occur?  How can a simple date cause such
problems? Can you (computer programmers) explain how the appearance that it
is January 1, 1900 will do anything more than screw up billing cycles (for
power companies, Social Security Administration and others)?  Why should a
bug like the 1900 vs. 2000 make much difference to power generation? (or
computerized nuclear missiles and any other nightmare scenarios one can
dream up)

Indeed.  Further, without a cure for cancer, there's no immortality.  
Cancer incidence goes up with about the 5th power of age and 
would strike virtually everybody down by 100-150 years if we
remained youthful.  Old people have lower cancer death rates 
than a direct extrapolation of the rate as their cancers tend to be old 
and feeble too.

Immortality, no.  But significant benefits are possible.  The lab I'm working
in doubled the life of fruit flies with 100 generations of breeding.  All that
happened was the the frequencies of genes at about 100 loci changed.
Basically each locus (gene) is probably reasonably independent of each other.
A normal fly might average, say, 10 "good"  genes. Even a long-lived normal 
fly will only have a couple extra "good" genes.  By breeding each fly has 
good genes at most of the loci, so the average bred fly outlives the 
longest-lived normal fly.

Presumably a similar situation applies to human.  I've got a couple good
aging genes, you've got a different set, etc.  If we can identify them and
alter each of our biochemistries (probably with drugs) to just mimic the
best known in each category we could get a couple extra decades.  An
example would be the rare HDL locus in a few Italian families which 
provides near-immunity to heart disease.

All I'm saying is that significant benefits (although not immortality) is 
*possible*.  We may not be looking at the right things.  Most human
research is on blood lipoprotein genes, rarish cancer genes, and
telomerase, while the most significant effects found yet, in nematodes
and yeast, are with insulin-related genes.  Even if we find something
 we may not be able to use it (particularly with genes that affect cancer).

Not a prediction, just a random thought:
If nanotech is anything like software, they'll be 90% finished
in 10 years, and the other 90% will take 90 years.



Unfortunately, it looks like the only two nanotech-related claims
on the idea futures exchange both specify 'by 2000' and aren't
doing well...
http://www.ideosphere.com/fx-bin/Claim?claim=ncryp
http://www.ideosphere.com/fx-bin/Claim?claim=Stew

(last trade of 12 and 5 (of 100) respectively)

Given that the exchange is run by the Foresight Institute I'm
surprised there aren't more nanotech claims.

And keep on pushing.  It would be fun, but not something I want
to do.  Reading this thread brought forth what seems like an
obvious point in my mind, but one that hadn't ever gelled for me:

Having and cultivating "sophisticated" tastes could help 
inoculate one against addiction to presumably easier to
satisfy tastes.

If your idea of paradise is, for example, learning to appreciate
"difficult" art, really understanding fine points of philosophy,
or discovering everything that can be known about the physical
universe, you'll have to work really hard to scratch your itch,
and "improve" yourself tremendously in the process.

If your idea of paradise is, for example, a permanent high or
everlasting orgasm, you can or will be able to obtain reasonable
facsimilies with little effort, which means you won't improve
yourself, which means you're evolutionary fodder.

A "neo-Calvinist" ethic of hard work and limited pleasure could
have the same evolutionary benefit as pursuing hard to obtain
pleasures (ok, I'm probably completely mangling neo-Calvinism),
though the latter sounds more fun to me.

Finally, I have a practical justification for my aesthetic
preferences!

 I've just started reading this book, and haven't formed an opinion yet. But
what I have noticed, in leaving it lying around the house, is that my housemates
have started reading it. They are new housemates, and are new to this kind of
topic. The book does seem to be stimulating some thoughts about a future that is
different from the past. As such, I consider it has already been worth the
purchase price.

On Saturday, I attended the Southern California Philosophy Conference. The
session I enjoyed most (while being frustrated) was the debate on human
cloning. Prof. Michael Shapiro of the USC Law School made sensible points
in favor of the proposition that human cloning should be legal, and that
the burden of proof should be on those who want to ban it. Prof. Shapiro
(for whom I had the pleasure of doing research while I was a graduate
student at USC) noted that usually intelligent people make terribly
arguments poor arguments when the issue is human cloning.

His opposing discussant, Francis Pizulli, an attorney who helped draft the
anti-cloning legislation, illustrated Shapiro's contention quite nicely.
(Though Shapiro noted that Pizulli has written the best stuff on his side
of the issue.) The most reasonable of his arguments was that cloning might
lead to shorter lives for the clones due to telomere shortening. Every
other argument he presented, I found either laughable, annoying or both.
For instance:

* Cloning involves no sexual contact, no mixing of the parents. It's bad to
produce children without sex. (Pizulli is Catholic, by the way...)

* Everyone has a right to a unique genetic identity.

* Why allow a procedure that causes so much repugnance?

* We don't need ore means of having children when we are overpopulated. [A
particularly odd thing for a Catholic to say!]

* If cloning is allowed, we won't be able to draw a line and will end up
producing legless people to go into space or four-legged people to go to
Jupiter. [He really said this.]

* Cloning violates the second formulation of Kant's Categorical Imperative
("treat people only as ends, not merely as means").

* "America doesn't want cloning". Cloning will produce an aristocracy and
America is all about doing away with aristocracies.

If smart people like Pizulli and the other intellectuals who have written
in opposition to cloning become so irrational when dealing with an issue
like human cloning, we'd better watch out for their response when we're
talking about altering human nature and making technological changes far
more interesting and far-reaching that copying a person's genes.

perhaps this will be one of the choices of the first generation

Please, help me: i'm about to read the document i found referred to on

Anyone?

The solution isn't to watch out for their response, or to try to convince
them that there's nothing wrong with cloning.. you cannot change an
irrational person's mind by presenting them with rational arguments. The
solution is to find ways to do it anyway, despite any laws passed against
it. You can expect that when things like cryonics, mega-lifespans, and
severe body alterations become scientifically feasible, they will be
legislated against, and we'll be bombarded with arguments about whether "we
as a society should allow this". Expect to hear things like "Cryonics costs
a hundred thousand dollars, why should the rich be allowed to live longer
then the poor?". This is inevitable, I guarantee this will be the prevailing
sentiment. Trying to offer rational arguments may do some good to change it,
but what we really need to do is figure out how to more efficiently break
the law.

Why bother with all of that? Just get:

	Heavy sleeping bag, depending on climate.
	5 gal collapsible water bags - with care, 5 days/bag
	lots of beans and rice
	2-5 5 gal propane tanks
	gas camp stove & converter for propane tanks.
	condiments for beans and rice

And you have all the stuff round the house with no hassle.

I read a book about 15 years on design of radio telemetry devices you put
into gelatin sized capsules which pass through the digestive system. No, I
don't recall the title, but "biotelemetry" is a good word to search for.

I've been trying to find this one for a long time. There was an article in
OMNI about a decade ago, very short on details. Any info re this would be

  IAN: Don't forget a water-filtration unit 
  in case saved-water runs out. But if things 
  really get bad enough that such items are 
  utilized, then we are talking about the 
  likelihood of roving bands of looters
  willing to kill you to get your 
  nice little supply of goods.

  I've been watching this issue and watching 
  the group of nay-sayers slowly but surely 
  dwindle, and the group of people on the 
  verge of panic increase. Even the more
  skeptical talk about gathering up 
  supplies before the date.

  Whatever the impact of Y2K on the U.S.,
  it stands to reason that much of the rest 
  of the world, already reeling under economic
  downturns, will get hit hard, since they are
  not in a situation now to hire all the high-
  tech programers and the like to fix their
  entire computer systems. I hear that in 
  Russia, nothing is being done to pre-
  pair for Y2K. Countries in Africa,
  while there are very few computers
  per person, still have computer dependent
  infrastructures. These are the places where 
  the *bleep* may really hit the fan. This is
  may be the biggest problem in store for all.

Since the human race was developed genes has been les important in the
world. The ideas and concepts spreading from mind to mind in the human
society and culture has been taking over as the agent of change. These
ideas, concepts etc. are called memes. Genes of the mind.

So when something is "memetically compatible" it just means that the ideas
and concepts doesn't clash.

Well that's the short version anyway.

thanks hilsen,
i guessed that was the intended meaning
i have a longstanding dislike of and mistrust of jargon, no matter how
futuristic the discourse
but having read the explanation, at least i'm able to decipher things a
little easier
so thanks again

And (especially you folks in the USA) don't forget a couple of
guns and a liberal amount of ammunition. ;-) Even during normal
blackouts there's usually riots complete with arson, pillage, rape 
and murder, especially in poorer parts of big cities, and this time 
blackouts will last longer and they'll be accompanied by all sorts 
of other technical mishaps and no doubt some year 2000 hysteria. 
LA, get ready for a rough time...

And amen to that! Working around idiotic laws and public attitudes isn't
even that difficult...if you have money. Whatever the problem, it always
comes down to money. With it you can buy "just about anything, including good
health, happiness, respect, power and possibly even eternal life."
Getting rich should really be included in the transhuman/extropian
principles...

Here's a simple example: a few months ago Swedish engineers tested their
nuclear reactors for potential date problems. They discovered that any
date in the year 1999 caused a shutdown, because the programmers had used
a '99' date as some kind of end-of-data marker; this kind of thing is common 
practice. I can hunt out the URL for the news story if you want it, but it
doesn't say much more than that.

Another: some equipment requires maintenance on a regular basis (e.g.
yearly), and when the date rolls back to 1900 it can get confused and shut
down for liability reasons. I've read of at least one piece of medical
hardware which has shown this problem, but don't have a cite handy.

On a more theoretical level, suppose you have two systems communicating
with each other, and the messages include a date. One is compliant, the
other isn't. The non-compliant system sends its data with a date of Jan
1st 1900, but the compliant system knows it's 2000. Hence this is clearly
invalid and it throws the data away. If that was important data, suddenly
your computerized control system fails.

There are many similar possibilities; no-one yet knows which will actually
happen or how bad the effects will be.

I have several of these on design of wireless biotelemetry devices,
endo radioprobes included. There are passive ones, which are
essentially oscillating circuits, and require a wobble generator to
measure the resonancy frequency, or active ones. The battery must
deliver better than >0.1 mW orelse the signal is detectable only in
less than 50 cm range. In Germany, 37, 169, 433, 456/466 MHz 
frequencies are used, YMMV. The circuits themselves are 
unbelievably simple (a cell, a transistor, a capacitor and 
an oscillator circuit (inductivity/capacitor) is all you need 
for temperature measurement, since resistancy of transistor's 
pn-junction is a function of the temperature. pH monitoring is only
slightly more tricky (Sb/AgCl electrodes required, voltage is
generated from Mg/Sb pairs).

For one ultrashortwave tunnel diode sender (100..250 MHz) the
dimensions are given: mass (sans battery): 0.5 g, dimensions: 8 mm
diameter x 2 mm, range is a few meter.

On the mainstream side, many pets are marked with implantable
transponders, most vets and animal shelters being equipped with
according readers (reading purported to be fussy, since the thingies migrate
so much, you have to scan the entire animal body).

Since virally everything we discuss on this list will involve altering the
status quo
in fairly drastic ways we should be very aware of the possibility
(likelihood?)of, (possibly violent) opposition to these changes.
I wouldn't care to speculate on how much unwanted attention we're getting
now but I'd
bet on a _drastic_ increase as soon as some of our ideas start to become
technically feasible.
I don't have a good answer to the problem other than awareness and a
concerted attempt to stay as far ahead of the curve as possible.

One thing I've noticed, even in the better Y2K efforts I've been involved in
is that very little is being done to address dependencies _outside_ a given
organization.
The push is to get internal systems Y2K compliant but little is done about
outside data feeds _or_ the possibility that vendors may suffer massive
collapses themselves.
My impression is that this is even worse outside the US.

Comments?

And (especially you folks in the USA) don't forget a couple of
guns and a liberal amount of ammunition. ;-) Even during normal
blackouts there's usually riots complete with arson, pillage, rape 
and murder, especially in poorer parts of big cities, and this time 
blackouts will last longer and they'll be accompanied by all sorts 
of other technical mishaps and no doubt some year 2000 hysteria. 
LA, get ready for a rough time...

A couple of thoughts:

Animal researchers have had a device like this for a while, it was
called a "Mortality Transmitter" it was designed to send a signal
if the device didn't move for so many hours. They were tagging
young moose and elk as I recall and discovered that black bears
were significantly more advanced predators than previously thought.

Even now the RBOC's are putting systems in place to locate cell
phones by triangulation (big brother mandate), add a few sensors
and viola!

I remember reading an article, I believe it was in WIRED, about an
Australian who was promoting data transmission of small packets to
low earth orbiting satelites for cattle tracking, remote monitoring
of water levels at remote sites, etc.

I read, and some fellow classmates and I experimented with devices
like this when we were in high school. We got the idea from an
article in Scientific American's Amateur Scientist's column. It was
a how-to complete with drawings and schematics. I very distinctly
remember the warning to let the epoxy coating cure thoroughly to
prevent gastrointestinal irritation  ;) . This article would have
appeared in 1975 or earlier.

Zeb, I wasn't offering "watch out" as a *solution*. You can only look for
solutions once you're fully aware of the problem... I'm with you in that we
should focus on circumventing the unjust restrictions that are practically
inevitable. Building a global network of Extropians/transhumanists should
help in this.

At the same time, I am unwilling to give up on rational persuasion. Just
look at the Renaissance and the Enlightenment to see that large numbers of
people (especially those with influence) *can* make drastic changes in
their beliefs and the resulting values, social institutions, and laws.
Let's not give up on appealing to human reason. *Sometimes* it works!

My preference is for a dual approach: Keep engaging people in rational
discussion, while networking to find and develop avenues for circumventing
national laws against transhuman technologies.

One reason for optimism: The technologies that we want to apply to
extending lifespan, augmenting intellect, improving personality, etc., will
be developed in many countries for other purposes for which there is strong
demand. Once the tools are widely available, it will be much easier to use
them for our purposes. In isolated countries where computers,
biotechnology, and so on, are not allowed for *any* purpose, any
transhumanists will have a much harder time. Pehaps we will eventually
organize to help them escape from such backward places.

Onward!

I have almost every survival book ever written, and 5 years+ back
issues of "American Survival Guide" and this is one of the best
minimalist lists I've seen. But beans and rice could get old pretty
quick, how's about sharing your favorite recipes?

Usually?  The only instance of blackout looting that I recall hearing 
about happened July 1977 in New York City.  Certainly there have been
a large number of blackouts in the last twenty years, and a number
of riots.  I don't see a high correlation between the two.

I've lived in a poorer neighborhood in San Francisco for five years
and noticed no riots, arson, pillage, rape, murder, or looting during
two multi-day power outages.  Again, no blackout/riot correlation.

I occasionally take a gander at comp.software.year-2000 (mostly to
read Timothy C May's writing), and it seems that people are less
worried about the proles rioting than about do gooders and 
authoritarians using the occasion to confiscate property from
"hoarders", force people into "community service", etc.

Note:  I don't think Y2K will be the end of the world as we know it,
or anything close.

Since so many of the Extropian hopes, plans and dreams rest on a 
framework of technological advance, in some cases asymptotic to 
perfection (nanotechnology comes immediately to mind), could 
Extropians be alternatively called Technopians?

I'm usually more frugal in quoting the message I'm replying to, but all of
the above seems to be needed for context here.

First let me note that I understand your response, thanks to your
elaboration. I was thinking of the changes I made in the Principles when
moving from "Spontaneous Order" to "Open Society". Part of my intent was to
leave open the possibility of alternative, non-monetary, non-price system
decentralized mechanisms. Although I firmly believe that a market price
system *currently* is the best way to ensure freedom and growing wealth for
everyone (to the extent that governments refrain from tampering other than
to refine the underlying legal rules), I do not want to rule out the
possibility of a replacement in future. I *do* want the Principles to rule
out a coercive, centralized allocation system that compels individuals to
follow orders. A transhumanist could believe in the desirability of such a
system, but they would not be an Extropian transhumanist.

When I wrote "The market price system encourages conservation,
substitution, and innovation, preventing any need for a brake on growth and
progress", I was making a statement that I believe is correct. But I did
not intend to say that the market price system in principle is the *only*
system that could do this. If a superior non-coercive, decentralized
economic system arises, well fine. I don't see any sign of such an
alternative but I do not rule it out as a possibility.

Perhaps I can rephrase the above quote to be more inclusive. Again, I only
want to rule out coercive, centralized economic systems as incompatible
with core extropian principles, not possible future developments compatible
with these values. I could replace "The market price system" with something
like "Effective economies, currently in the form of the market price
system...". Not terribly elegant, but perhaps someone can suggest a better
phrasing.

Thanks for your feedback, Maxwell.

Onward!

Investment capital does not imply "money."  Capital is anything
that aids in production.  Investment is using capital to make
more capital, rather than helping people to "consume."  The
supply of investment capital is capital that those who control 
it are willing use to invest, rather than consume.  The demand 
for capital is the investment projects that are available.  

We can say that there won't be much investment if those who
control capital insist it all be used to help consumption.
Similarly, investment won't do much good if there aren't 
projects available which have a decent change of producing
more capital.  We can say these things and more without
invoking concepts of money, markets, or prices.

If those AI engines help us produce more, they are 
"capital."

Something about this sort of topic seems to trigger cognitive 
reactions which bypass mental modules capable of more abstract critical
analysis.  I think it is very important for us to understand this 
cognitive process in more detail.

here's another good one:

If I was in the business of making fuel cells and wanted to look into
the techniques of making a battery that used platinum to extract
electricity from water it would become quickly apparent that the old
methods of sandwiching the platinum between layers of carbon was
un-economic because platinum tends to lump together and leave areas
without any contact surface. In other areas the platinum soaked into the
carbon and in these areas the platinum was quickly eroded. In order to
make the battery work at all at least fifty times more platinum would
need to be used just to cover the surface and yet the battery would not
last very long because the platinum is always getting destroyed at its
jagged edges thus clogging the system. 

After further investigation I would find new methods that would form the
carbon surfaces into corresponding hills and valleys that would prevent
the platinum from clumping together and that by first coating these
surfaces with candle soot the middle layer of platinum would not only
not clump together but would be rolled into a thin film of atomic
dimensions. These new methods not only do not destroy the platinum but
increase the energy output. Later on however I would find that using
these information filaments to make new  batteries I could do without
platinum altogether and use a polymer. Not only that but they could be
produced on an open source home PC, laser printer, candles, a few spray
cans and a microwave oven. 
Unfortunately if I were in business I would do none of these things
because there would be no business to be had when it became known that
anyone could make the battery without my say so, which is exactly the
case and is why your National Security Agencies would destroy anyone who
acted against their vested interests.

Money has many of the properties of platinum in the above crude
manufacturing example, i.e., it clumps together in some areas and leaves
other spaces largely empty. Furthermore, corporations that use money are
the epitome of authoritarianism in that they don't tend to create
anything worthwhile that they can't control. 

Sorry Max, but I see many signs of alternatives to the price system. My
own AI primitive, The Ingrid Thought Processor, for example, can handle
information far more diverse than conventional accounting systems and
yet isn't bogged down by concepts of wealth; - it is a factor but only
one of many. The fact that it is capable of channeling the information
conduits to create the above battery example is a case in point. I give
Ingrid away and will spend the rest of my life in its development; -
others are also. I do this to replace the price system and I fully
anticipate using an Ingrid-like system to create my own uploaded
lifestyle and would rather die than contemplate becoming an uploaded
capitalist. See why this form of mathematics is decentralised, will
allow any component freedom to circulate and is the ultimate in parallel
politics.

In the journal "Nature" (12/14/73), Dr. Edward Tryon presented
the theory that the sum of all energy in the universe is zero.
Below is the mathematics behind that theory, quoted from the 
paper  "Genesis of The Universe and Zero Point Energy" [*] 
(I would be very interested to hear any critiques of it):  


     "In 1973 the great contemporary scientific 
     thinker Edward P. Tryon demonstrated how the 
     universe could have formed [ from nothing ] 
     without violating the principle of the 
     conservation of energy.  He said that the 
     total energy of the universe is zero. [1]

     He said that the positive energy of the things 
     we observe is balanced by a negative gravitational 
     energy.  Therefore the creation was formed without 
     violating the principle of the conservation of 
     energy.  Let's explore his idea. When something 
     falls it loses gravitational potential energy. 
     The relationship between potential energy and 
     position, in a force field, is given by equation #1.

     [ fixed-pitch font required ]

                     / 
                    | ->  ->
     /\ PE = W  = - | F . dr                     Eq #1
              g     |  g 
                   /

     According to Tryon's theory if an object were to 
     fall into the universe from an infinite distance 
     away, the gravitational potential energy the object 
     lost would equal the total mass energy of the object.
     [2] This is stated mathematically in equation #2:


              / rad of univ
              | ->   ->
     mc^2 = - | F  . dr                         Eq #2
              |  g
              /infinity 


     Assuming that the universe is spherical with an 
     isotopic mass distribution, the amount of gravita-
     tional potential an object will lose upon falling to 
     the edge of such a universe is given by equation #3.


                        / rad of univ
                       |
     mc^2 = -(G)(M)(m) | (1/r^2)  dr             Eq #3
                       | 
                      /infinity


     Given a radius of the universe is 15 billion light 
     years (1.42x10^26 meters) and the known gravitational 
     constant G, the mass of the universe may be determined.

     M = 1.91 x 10^53    KG  

     If this is the mass of the universe then the total 
     energy of the universe is zero.  To check this result 
     the mass of the universe was calculated from its den-
     sity and volume. The universe was considered to be a 
     sphere.  This sphere has a radius of 15 billion light 
     years and is filled with matter of the same density as 
     the density of space in our galactic neighborhood.  
     This "local" density is equivalent to one proton of 
     ordinary matter and nine protons of "dark" matter 
     per cubic meter. [3]

     Given that the volume of a sphere with a radius of 15
     billion light years =  1.2 x 10^79   M^3

     Please note that at one proton mass per cubic meter 
     this is also the number of protons in the universe.  
     The mass of the universe was derived from its volume 
     and density in equation #4.
                                                   Eq#4

     M = ((1 proton/m^3) +(9 proton masses dark matter/m^3))(vol) 


     The mass of the universe according to this second 
     argument is:

     M = 2.00 x 10^53     KG

     Amazingly the resultant masses agree even though they 
     were determined by two entirely different methods.  
     This agreement indicates that the universe has a total 
     energy of zero and that it formed without violating 
     the principle of the conservation of energy.  There 
     is something very profound in what Edward Tryon said.

     CONCLUSION

     New scientific arguments have shown how something can
     be created out of nothing.  These arguments have tre-
     mendous philosophical implications.  ...

     NOTES

     [1] Edward P. Tryon, NATURE VOL 246, December 14, 1973.

     [2] Technically, nothing can exist outside of the 
     universe. The universe is a closed structure in which, 
     according to the cosmological principle, all positions 
     are equivalent.  The model presented in this paper, in 
     which an object falls from an infinite distance away to 
     the edge of the universe, does not represent reality.  
     The model does, however, allow for the calculation of 
     the negative gravitational potential shared by all 
     objects within the universe.

     [3] Fritz Zwicky proposed that 90% of the matter in the
     universe is "dark" in 1933.  He came to this conclusion
     from the study of clusters of galaxies.
     Vera Rubin confirmed that 90% of the universe's matter
     is composed of the so called "dark matter" from her study
     of the rotational speeds of galaxies in 1977."

Robin, until other mechanisms for managing the flow of information 
are produced then all measurements of capital become hostage to the 
current accounting concepts of capitalism, i.e., orders, invoices, 
statements, profit & loss, balance sheets, etc. There is no escaping 
this and no amount of hiding behind behind text books will convince 
me that your terms are anything but obfuscation. The only way to
break this hold over terminology is to explicitly deny the case for 
double entry bookkeeping and start a new information paradigm with 
a new set of terms.

I understand your goodwill in trying to divorce investment capital 
from money but you don't stress any alternative to a zero based money
system. For example under my concept of a public AI the data spaces 
that would be allocated to create meaning would not be arbitrarily
managed so as to restrict the supply of meaningful fractal
relationships.
There also would not be a form of trading data spaces so that certain 
meanings would get more space at the expense of others. This trading 
is implicit in your definition of investment capital.

I dunno how common this is...but I recently wrote a note of appreciation to
John Cramer regarding his books and columns.....and he REPLIED. (as did Damien
by the way...to a similar note...)

Maybe its very common...and I'm just a cynical curmudgeon.

Just a general note to the list.

I REALLY appreciate this kinda thing.

By that I mean the passing on of possibly interesting information. My Thanx to
J. Legg and everyone who has done it in the past...and keep up the good work.

I think it might just be fairly common. I got a similarly surprising personal 
response from Linda Nagata when I wrote her a note of appreciation for 
"Tech Heaven".

Must depend on how big the author is (how many books sold, volume of fan mail,
etc.), as well as the author's personality. But it doesn't surprise me that
some give personal responses. When you spend a few months or years pouring
your soul into some words that are supposed to MOVE people somehow, it must
be very nice to get some confirmation (beyond the number of copies sold) that
the effort wasn't in vain.

Perhaps its some sort of antibody reaction to foreign memes. Societies that
accepted new ideas too easily were destroyed by random passing memes. Only
ones with a strong, if irrational, resistance to new ideas survived. As with
many of our previously useful survival traits, our resistance to new ideas may
kill us.

 I personally have seen some pretty scary reactions to new ideas, so I believe
its a serious problem. One solution would be to operate in
secret, but we have already blown that. Another would be to form an isolated
community strong enough to go its own way. Not very likely to succeed I think.
Understanding and bypassing the process seems the best bet. But its a pretty
indelible response in some people I fear.

I have not seen any further comments on the proposed two-part definition, so
unless I see something in the next day or so I'm going to run with it on
drafting something for the FAQ.  People can, of course, comment later but it
would be easier to deal with suggestions early.

In 1993 before I found the mind uploading research group, I
defined/wrote: 

Ekhumanisation  n.  an act to legalize the development of the 
sub-atomic sympathetic boolean resonance in a biological, 
optical, or digital computer so it can be interfaced into a citizen's 
legal identity.

-----------------------------

My method for carrying out this act was to engage the politicians
directly at government level. I did this by using the woefully
inadequate mental health laws to spring a trap on the unsuspecting
government. After I had accepted their pension because, using their
social constructions, they considered mind-uploading a thought disorder
they jokingly agreed to provide for my needs should I manage to live a
thousand years. Not only has the joke backfired on them, the government
now considers its own disordered system's best hope of surviving as an
entity is to back me up as its cyberian envoy, complete with
international protected person status. Make no mistake however, the
public AI that I foresee in the future creates a two way Survey Society
in which there is unlikely to be a surveillance government as we have
known it.

My company routinely gets letters from customers asking for our
compliance statement, and we have sent letters to our vendors.
I therefore assumed that this has become a standard practice.

Congress recently passed new legislation which makes it harder
to sue a company based on that company's good-faith effort to
provide such info. Many companies had already put a bunch of
stuff one their web sites about their products' compliance, and
I expect to see more. There is good deal less about a company's
ability to continue to operate, though. that is, I can tell that
the equipment suppied by a vendor will continue to operate, but
I can't tell whether the vendor will continue to be able to deliver
product.

mark, i am reminded of a programming class i took in high school where

I've changed the phrasing in the Perpetual Improvement section to this:
"Extropians affirm a rational, non-coercive environmentalism aimed at
sustaining
and enhancing the conditions for our flourishing."

No mention of a price system. I do think that, in just about all cases
(dealing
with possible ozone deletion may possibly be an exception) using the price
mechanism (and carefully defining property rights where they currently don't
exist, such as in ocean fishing) is the best way to handle pollution and
resources. If a non-price mechanism can do the job as well at less cost,
that's
fine. The Principles are not intended to specify particular mechanisms, so I'm
grateful that you pointed this out. I presume that you will not find anything
objectionable in this rephrasing.

This now has nothing to do with the Principles, but I do want to briefly
comment. I see no reason to expect the NSA to destroy someone who invents a
great technology that they want to give away. Please give some reason to
believe your extraordinary claim. Even if your claim were true, it has nothing
to do with what I (or many Extropians) propose, since the NSA is a government
agency that we would be glad to do away with (and the FDA and other such
regulatory agencies that often *are* used to suppress competition). What
you're
talking about may exist in capitalism, but it's not the free market capitalism
that many of us favor.

No one's stopping you. (Have you been visited by the NSA?) If it works and
does
all you claim, then I don't see Extropians doing anything other than
celebrating the improvement in social systems. Until we see it working, I
think
most of us are skeptical. Previous attempts to do away with markets, money,
and
prices in complex societies have led only to massive economic dislocation and
starvation. Those of us who have read our Hayek understand the role of the
price system as an information signalling mechanism that is hard to beat.
(It's
not always necessary--in simple economies barter works; in households
non-monetary exchanges work; within corporations multiple market transactions
are replaced with simple direction that everyone has agreed to).

Apart from this, I agree with Robin's response. "Capital" doesn't imply money.

This is all too easy to project.  If cloning is made prohibitively
expensive, only the rich (already a de facto aristocracy) will have the
option.  Instead of taking their chances in the reshuffle lottery, some of
them might choose to clone the brightest, most aggressively successful and
most beautiful of their number.  That's perhaps laughable because we
already know that human cloning will probably *not* be *prohibitively*
expensive, any more than heart transplants are.  But it won't be cheap,
either - all that fiddly in vitro-to-in vivo stuff - so I can easily
imagine its adoption being pretty much restricted to the upper middle class
and above.

I think we need to give the opposition their due, and come up with strong
arguments why their fears are either groundless or can be allayed by the
choices of an educated, alert and non-hysterical citizenry.

That's interesting.  Are you saying that you currently receive a New
Zealand invalid pension granted because you were medically evaluated as
mentally incompetent to earn a living?

If so, do you concur with this assessment?  If you do, should this have any
bearing on our evaluation of your posts?  Presumably you do *not* concur,
given your use of the phrases `woefully inadequate' and `their social
constructions' and your startling candour in mentioning the pension.  Do
you find any conflict in your personal values in accepting money under what
therefore would be false pretences?

These questions are not meant as a flame - I do not know Mr Legg, and I am
genuinely intrigued by the issues raised.  Perhaps I should make clear that
over the last couple of decades I have eked out my own meagre earnings as a
writer with the aid of five arts grants from Federal and State Australian
governments, as well as a PhD scholarship from a national funding body.  I
favour some kind of anarcho-socialist polity, for want of a better term, in
which a guaranteed minimum income is provided, without strings, to all
citizens.  I'm made uncomfortable, however, by the idea of someone
contriving to gain such benefits by *pretending* to be either somatically
or mentally ill.  If such a misdiagnosis were imposed upon me, I hope I'd
fight it tooth and nail, rather than accepting any benefits that happened
to be entailed.

If Mr Legg actually *is* sufficiently mentally ill to require an invalid
pension, I apologise for the tenor of these sceptical remarks, and will
read his posts with this proviso in mind.

: This is a scaled claim based on the date that the Feynman Grand Prize,

: if the claim is satisfied after the year 2100, or is never satisfied,

The claim is trading at a value which would predict a date in the early

I should have written national security agencies in lower case meaning

Well, as someone who uses a PC with no microsoft software at 
all, I don't think that he'd have much control. :)  With no 
intervention at all, I think that Windows will go the way of
MacOS (which has fewer users now than Linux, IIRC).  The only
reason he got *that* much market share is A) marketing, and 
B) usability.  When Linux can match those, it will quickly
overwhelm Windows, since it already has reliability, stable
software (mostly), and a fanatical user base.

Yes, but it's a medical fact that when one has been systematically 
prevented from working and cut into by a whole spectrum of insiders 
ranging from Freemasons to the Chicago McMafia the criteria for 
survival becomes a condition for living. As an autistic person I 
have to think my way through circumstances that other people don't. 
Maybe this is why I didn't go along with the corruption I found 
inside the corporations who were my clients and felt obliged to 
cause them to leave this part of the world. At least their capital 
took fright and quit. Also, the fact that for twenty years my 
thinking has been aligned to the mathematics of The Ingrid Thought 
Processor has made my take on subjects very formidable if not 
idiosyncratic.

No conflict. According to Max More and Robin Hanson, capital is 
not money and what I do involves the best use of my personal 
capital and I feel no need to justify myself in market/monetary 
terms. I have spoken out against the false limits of the money 
measuring system and for this I am now thankfully left alone 
and provided with the needs I have for food, shelter, communication 
and computer equipment and most of all for mind uploading. I 
don't pay taxes or pay salesmen to sell my software. I have 
no management make-work problems that would only slow me down. 
With nanotechnology on our horizon and other physical trends 
truly suited to my software time is on my side and I feel no 
need to try to convince capitalists of the need to grant 
development funds for my technology, which technology, btw, 
I anticipate will make the need for money funding a superfluous 
and futile effort.

The government's official claim that I have a thought disorder 
that makes me incapable of regular work is based on the 
definition of a disorder whereby a claim is made that some 
of my ideas have been consistently invalidated. I don't agree 
with this invalidation process although I agree that it has 
been pretty consistent and have produced evidence on my 
website that, in my opinion, has likewise consistently 
invalidated 'their social constructions'. So, this tit-for-tat 
is my way of living in a disordered system and doing the work 
that only I can do.

I don't pretend to be a high functioning autistic person. I am. 
But you have no reason to be fearful that I will seek to harm 
anyone. However if anyone tries too hard to block my progress 
they can look forward to a visit from a constable. Maybe you 
may care to read my disability application which shows "Computers 
and people with autism... it's like a match made in heaven."

Exceptional thinking abilities and a desire to stay out of 
other people's potholes is what my posts convey. Unfortunately 
you can't read my earlier posts because they are mostly 
mis-registered in the extropy archives. I don't know why, 
but even though a search turns up the correct heading the 
body of the message points to quite a different message. 
Has this happened to others or are my posts destined to be 
forever censored?

'no know' is appropriate, or 'no no', transhumanists shouldn't have no no's,
no?

Fact is, the existence of telepathy (*if* it exists, and it was accepted by
Jung and Freud and William James and Sony etc etc) is an anomaly for the
physicalist world view. It may prove to be compatible with it, but it hasn't
been explained in physicalist terms yet.

But relax. No need to lose the faith. No one's suggesting that a minor
anomaly is any reason to abandon the transhumanist quest, just that loading
up will be leaving a slight puzzle behind.

The puzzle might be irrelevant, or it might be indicative of something more
significant.

As for 'noosphere,' nomenclature is not important, as people who revel in
the endless neologisms of science fiction should appreciate.

I believe that windows and all the other desktop systems uses a metaphor
that is getting more and more strained as we need to control larger amounts
of files.

Besides they are to difficult to understand for most people in the world.

There is good reson to believe that there will be a shift in paradigm at
sometime. I mean can you really imagine running a windows like system in a
hundred years from now? We need a better interface with a better behaviour.

Mine convey nothing less than pure enlightenment (on a good
day, anyway). Mind you, I've seen some shrinks myself but
according to them transhumanism is just a mild delusion, nothing
serious.

I've seen this too, but as *all* the posts had this header/body
mixup I don't think it's anything personal, just a glitch.

I'm intrigued by your comments here and I hope I'm not straying too far from
Extropian talk. Are you sceptical of the sort of free market
minarchist/anarchist arguments which many on this post (including myself)
hold because of your concerns about a lack of minimal entitlement for
individual flourishing or welfare rights in such systems or does the
mistrust of market-sceptics on this list go deeper than that?

Because if it is the first issue which is the problem then it should be
pointed out I don't think being a libertarian minarchist necessarily rules
out welfare rights even on a Lockean intepretation.

To allay your concerns I suggest you visit 'Geolibertarian' sites and the
Banneker Centre for Economic Justice. These are sites maintained by
libertarians who also find Henry George persuasive.

The basic idea is that there should be a minimal entitlement to welfare
(whether this is best provided on the local level or a global level is more
of practical issue and therefore lends itself to anarchist variations) based
on the common ownership of unappropriated natural resources and entitlement
to compensation for violation of living space through such things as
pollution- your guaranteed minimum income can therefore be funded by green
taxes and land taxes- dispersing the proceeds of these among the population
is therefore not a form of redistribution which would violate libertarian
Lockean rights but merely exercising right to be compensated for loss of
commons (these plus the normal libertarian rights are compossable).

To boot, green taxes are efficient anyway since they are a tax on negative
externalities and taxes on unimproved land values encourage productive use.
That's the theory simplistically put anyway. I'm not a convert but I think
these arguments are worth being taken seriously by libertarians.

Dates and times are used for more than just billing.  They are used for
all sorts of calculations, which I will exemplify below.  Normally, time
always goes into the future.  When calculating how much time has passed,
it always is a positive number.  If the date goes backwards from 1999 to
1900, time periods suddenly go negative.  If the program interprets
negative numbers, it may calculate negative values instead of positive
ones.  If the program doesn't interpret negative numbers, then these
numbers get interpreted as very large numbers because of the way data is
stored.  (The first bit can be used as a sign bit, showing a positive or
negative.  It also can be used as the top order binary digit, allowing
larger positive numbers.)  In either case, programs get unexpected
values that are negative or very large.  Such programs will then do
unexpected things based on these numbers, or they very well may simply
crash and/or hang the machine.

Some examples of date/time calculations:

Any machine (such as trains, planes, automobiles cruise controls)
calculating how fast it is going (based on time calculations) suddenly
gets a negative number and thinks it is going backwards and tries to
accelerate to compensate.  Or it gets a very large number and thinks it
is going too fast and tries to decelerate.

Any machine (such as a printer, automobile, nuclear power plant)
measuring time since its last maintenance suddenly gets a negative
number and thinks it has a long time to go until maintenance is due and
never stops for maintenance and so runs until it burns itself up.  Or it
gets a very large number and thinks its dangerously past maintenance and
refuses to run at all until maintenance is performed.

Any machine (such as a medicinal IV drip) that meters out materials at a
certain rate suddenly gets a negative number and thinks it is a long
time until materials are due and so stops releasing materials.  Or it
gets a very large number and thinks it is way past due and so dumps out
an extraordinarily high amount of materials to catch up.

Not only does billing get screwed up, but any machine trying to track
speed, rates of delivery, time since maintenance, etc. can get screwed
up.

Dates are also used to calculate the days of the week.  Bank vaults may
lock up on the wrong days.  VCRs may record on the wrong days.  Coffee
makers may make coffee on the wrong days.  Alarm systems, sprinkler
systems, automated lighting schedules, power grid peak production
schedules, automated trucking schedules, etc., may try to operate on the
wrong days or not operate on the correct days.

Sometimes dates are important as well.  Even though these may be
"billing", consider if your credit card won't work because it expired in
"1901".  Consider materials or food being thrown out because it is past
its expiration date of "1901".  Consider your mechanic not performing
proper maintenance on your car because his computer thinks it has a
hundred years before your oil change is due.  Consider all TV
programming, automated factory schedules, banking transfers, trucking
schedules, etc., all failing on computers and having to be done by hand
by certain affected companies.

Sometimes the date calculations will just crash because of the bogus
numbers.  Imagine a cash register trying to print how many shopping days
until christmas, trying to calculate 100 years of shopping days,
overflowing the output field which is 3 digits long, and just crashing
everytime it tries to print a receipt.  Most programs don't expect
simple date calculations to overflow into extremely large values, so
they don't check for them.  If they overflow, the program just crashes
in many cases.  Even if the dates aren't important for the operations,
they still could prevent the machine from functioning due to field
overflows.

These are just some ideas about what could go wrong.  My predicition is
that 99% of the errors will be fixed in time, but that the 1% left will
wreak havoc.  Imagine just one satellite failing, or one airport not
being able to fly, or one major computer network being down, or one
phone company going dead, or one state of the U.S. losing its power
grid, or one stock exchange shutting down, or one brand of automobile to
all go dead, or one brand of computer operating system to suddenly quit
working, or one country mistakingly launching missiles.  A small
percentage of failure can cause widespread problems.

Why?  No business to be had?  This would only be so if mass
production of the batteries was unable to decrease the cost
per battery, no?  Before molecular manufacturing, that seems
unlikely.

I agree with the comments so far re Microsoft. Linux is apparently gaining
ground in the corporate market already. Private monopolies don't last long,
I don't see how they could. With a high enough monopoly profit any entry
barrier is worth jumping over from the perspective of a potential rival. The
specific case against Microsoft (product bundling) is even weaker.

Personally I suspect more like 10%, but the point is the same.

But that's easily imagined; we get these kind of problems and deal with
them. Y2K is more likely to be one satellite failing AND one airport shut
down AND one major computer network down AND one phone company dead AND
one state without power AND one stock exchange shut down AND one brand of
automobile refusing to run AND one O/S failing AND one country mistakenly
launching missiles (though I doubt the latter). 

Any one of those problems can be solved rapidly and several can be solved
simultaneously. The real question is whether we reach the critical point 
where so many things are broken that the interactions prevent us fixing any 
of the problems. If we don't we'll be OK in a few days to a few months, if
we do we're hosed.

And lets not forget the particular vulnerability that Microsoft has as 
an actual or potential monopoly:  it is as easy to pirate the 
software as buy it.  If the price gets too high, or the product and 
service become too crappy, people will simply stop paying for it.  
No amount of law enforcement can stop that.

Does anybody know about the so called "aging hormones"?
I have been searching for some information on the net, however, most of the sites are
commercial Web pages offering treatment.  I would be glad if anyone could direct me to
sources containing more reliable information.

Thanks

is that the properties of a beam of light were transported
across the laboratory bench.

See:

http://www.cnn.com/TECH/science/9810/22/science.teleport.reut/

Anybody knows more about this? 

Also, some interesting info on CIA secrecy and cold war:

We've seen dozens of suggestions at this level of detail - what we need is
for people to dig deeper into such suggestions to get more detailed 
predictions from each, and to confront those predictions with more detailed 
data.

This is not entirely correct.  There *are* forms of capital that do not
show up on balance sheets and which are difficult if not impossible to
value using conventional monetary systems, but which are critically
important in the modern economy nonetheless.  The best example is
intellectual capital.  Not only does this not show up on balance sheets,
but there is no known legitimate way of quantizing the actual value of it,
particularly in its more abstract forms.  How do you value something as
simple as a database of collected information?  Remember, the value of data
exists primarily in the almost infinitely large number of relationships and
uses that can be produced from the data, not in each datum itself.  Any
attempts at placing a value on any large set of data uses a narrow
accounting perspective by necessity.

Capital markets run by people, however, *do* take into consideration
capital that is not accountable in a financial statement.  The fact that
traditional financial indicators are becoming less important in the capital
markets (such as Wall Street) is an indication that the capital markets do
recognize the value of non-monetary capital even when it is not quantized.
This also explains why technology companies (which tend to hold and exploit
large quantities of intellectual capital) can often be valued so highly
even though the financial fundamentals never existed.  There is, of course,
a constant conversion between abstract capital to monetary capital, but
that is because both are useful and required.

I don't really see the need to have one large neural net when we have
billions of small neural nets already doing a pretty good job.  I suspect
the improvement would be incremental at best and possibly not worth the
capital investment to create and maintain it.  If it is worth the capital
investment, then rest assured that the current system will create it
eventually.

This is already happening.  "Soft novelty devices" are illegal to sell
here in Texas.  Either the great legislature has a goal to keep it
from feeling good or they thoroughly enjoy causing high trauma to
those parts of peoples anatomy by limiting it to hard plastic. 
Ouch!!!!  I tend to favor the later theory.

Not generic ones.  But those with the inclination for quickly
transitioning to intense full body orgasms are needed.  That is, if
other muscles begin to synchronize with your PC muscle such that many
simultaneous involuntary contractions are happening throughout your
body.  I need to identify these muscles that participate.  So far, it
appears most are internal (deeper inside the body), but I need to
identify ones that I have access to externally (just under the skin). 
I've not searched the literature on any of this because of my
disappointment on my initial attempt and the resulting success of
starting from scratch.  I still wonder if doing the proper research
will help or hinder.  It appears we have a badly neglected area of
research when a hobbiest without any background in biology or
physiology can make discoveries that should be widely known.  

Why is the so called super organism "Meta Man" so secretive about
his/her/its physiological mechanisms for sexual pleasures?  Does
she/he/it think a possible mate is watching/listening and maybe feels
a little embarrassed :-) (just kidding)  But seriously, is it possible
that, in its incredible wisdom, avoiding/delaying a positive feedback
loop is desirable (as in John Clarks theory).  If so "Meta Man" will
soon see the inevitable, with, or without my help.  Based on this
thread, there seems to be multiple emergent paths that have been
technologically possible for some time.  Prepare for a more even
distribution.

I would rather see it more positively as a cleansing scourge on
businesses which are run incompetently. Also, albeit I won't be gone
on a long trip around y2k, I wouldn't want to be in the air, which as 
well applies to the night on 1998/1999. Maybe this small prequake will be
large enough that people can learn from failure analysis during/after
the fact, albeit the system classes affected will unlikely be the
same. (Also, y2k will sure be a great topic for sociologists...)

That's a tough one. Let me think about it for a nanosecond. Ah, yes, I say the
government should keep their clumsy hands to themselves.

Damien, if you're going to make such a serious charge, don't you think you
should give some evidence for it? You may disagree with me and have a
higher opinion of Pizulli's arguments than I do, but why do you accuse me
of evasion and double-think? what am I evading? I wasn't even giving
arguments against his arguments, just reporting them.

Yes, it's a fictional scenario, and Pizulli cited J.B.S. Haldane. The point
is not that no one would ever suggest this. The point is that it's ridulous
to oppose cloning on the grounds that it will lead to a situation where the
government produces humans with no legs, raises them for two decades in
confinement, brainwashing them so that they will not want to do anything
other than go into space, and that we will not object to this whole
process. His fantasy involves slavery because the proposal is to raise the
child for this purpose and not to allow them any other option. To suggest
that we ban cloning because it might lead to all this is ludicrous. If the
government started a program like this, we'd have a lot more to worry about
than cloning. I'm really surprised that you don't see how desperate an
argument this one is.

So we'd better also ban private education, educational trips by wealthy
parents for their children, make it illegal for wealthy parents to pass on
their wealth, and in fact take away any wealth above the average. Silly me,
here I was thinking that America was based on the pursuit of life, liberty,
and happiness, not on banning anything that might give someone an
advantage. If this argument were any good at all, it would be an argument
not for banning cloning but for funding widespread access to cloning.

 Microsoft as a monopoly is bad for the general technology, although
better for the diffusion of technology, as they tend to heavily
concentrate on interfaces and usability.

  An exemple of bad effects? Java, corba, html, ansi C, DR DOS,
stacker... and how many others?

   Having a very usable OS like windows on all desktop, in synergy with
office is the trump microsoft has been using for a long time. And their
integration with low cost intel.

    But as a programmer, I'm biased against them. And yet they do make
some great products, their people are very good in what they are doing,
only their general model of doing business (pay for bugs, improve
because of bugs, bully the resellers, add faked warnings, vaporware...)
is bad.

     I'm all for it. Open Source Software is a great chance for a new
model of development, and generally speaking as an economic model.

    What do you think, you all great thinkers, about a model of economy
of abundance where the goal is not money but reputation??? (or did you
talk about it before?)

   Manu.

(as a side note, linux is still quite tough to use and configure, count
1-2 more years for it to really get into the general market)

I saw this once on a system with Communicator 4.0 installed and the guy
said it was his encryption service that prevented him from reading his
email and this caused him to have to make printouts. I know, it didn't

Are you implying that Verona used an XOR quasi-quantum entanglement for
its encryption method?

If so you may want to look at Wavelink, an invention of mine, that did a
similar thing. This invention actually ran for over a year but it was
effectively suppressed and finally my business was destroyed by the
McMafia because this invention let all their skeletons tumble out of the
closet. 

What is more scary is the proposal that the Y2K mainframes be clocked
always-on at 12/31/1999 and used as archive servers. In this case a CIA
time travel-bot could, in say fifty years from now, alter electrons in
the same Y2K server and it will be the same electron that existed in
1999 thus changing the data as effectively exists today. This could be
used to destroy the credibility of an opponent by manufacturing false
histories.

My Wavelink invention is at:-

To get a good model of how beliefs change, we first need a good model of how
beliefs are held. My current area of research is people's beliefs about web
sites. In particular, what makes for a fast web site. There is much that is
measurable about this situation, but no accepted solution short of "lots of fast
hardware".  Some commonly held beliefs about the Web are measurably false.

 My theory is that people are lazy. A meme that would be a lot of work to
accomodate, or invalidate a lot of work already invested, is usually rejected.
People who have invested a lot raising children from a genetic lottery may be
resistant to others "cheating" and having geneticaly certain offspring. If that
is so, the theory predicts parents of children would be more likely anti-cloning
than single people. And parents of genetically handicapped children would be
more resistant than parents of normal children. I wonder if there are already
any surveys out there that could validate this?

 On the web server project, I would predict that beliefs that minimize the
effort for web masters are the most likely to be taken up. The "more hardware"
belief is a cheap one for most webmasters, as it passes the effort up to the
executive level that decides budget. Another cheap belief is that delivery
delays are due to net backbone congestion. This doesn't stand up to measurement,
but does take the pressure off the local webmaster.

I too find this argument laughable and don't see how Damien could object
to Max characterising it as such. It has to be kept in perspective that
identical twins are clones. If such arguments are applicable to clones
then we should also start taking seriously the possibility that
governments might keep a store of mothers predisposed to give birth to
identical twins and using the progeny for slavery.

If genetics is important then the rich are likely to succeed in cloning
the brightest but at the same time this argument cuts both ways. Rich
cloners would be in danger of losing genetic diversity. If something new
came up in the environment they would be the first to go. If genetics is
not that important (and I personally am of this view) then whatever it
doesn't really matter if more of the rich tried to clone their elite.

That dolphins don't have abstract language was recently
established in a very elegant experiment. A pool is divided into two
halves by a net. Dolphin A is released into one end of the pool where
there is a mechanism. After a while, the dolphin figures out how to
operate the mechanism which causes dead fish to be released into both
ends of the pool. Then A is transferred to the other end of the pool
and a dolphin B is released into the end of the pool that has the
mechanism. The idea is that if the dolphins had a language, then A
would tell B to operate the mechanism. However, it was found that the
average time for B to operate the mechanism was the same as for A.

The following Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article 
cites a major utility company recommending citizens 
look into "alternative energy sources" in preparation
for "likely" power failures due to the Y2k computer bug
(http://www.onwis.com/archive/oct98/news/1007y2k.asp):


THE MILWAUKEE JOURNAL SENTINEL, October 07, 1998

National Guard ready to act on eve of 2000 

Computers' confusion could endanger safety, 
experts tell lawmakers 

By Amy Rinard 

Madison -- The Wisconsin National Guard is prepared 
to be mobilized on Dec. 31, 1999, to deal with potential 
power failures, water system shutdowns and other problems 
that could occur as computers click over to the year 2000. 

And an attorney for a major electric utility said the company 
is encouraging its customers to look into alternative energy 
sources, including home generators, in anticipation of power 
failures as a result of the problem. 

...

Mari Nahn, an attorney with Madison-based Alliant Corp.
-Wisconsin Power & Light Co., said power failures are
likely, as are failures of municipal water systems. 

Computer chips embedded in everything from pacemakers 
to coffee-makers have the potential to fail, and in 
many cases people don't even know they're there, Nahn 
said. In the utility industry, embedded chips are 
used everywhere, she added. 

...

Leonard P. Levine, professor of computer science and 
electrical engineering at the University of Wisconsin-
Milwaukee, said having troops on standby is "not 
unreasonable." 

...

"Somewhere -- no one knows where -- something will 
fall apart. I truly believe that someone is going to 
die because of this problem. . . . I'm sure that one 
of these utilities is going to fail."

We seem to have a glitch in rhetoric here.  I was referring, in an

Ah.  Maybe I misread your original post, but I didn't pick up any
implication of governmental coercion and slavery.  If that was dragged into
the mix, I agree with you completely.  But then the four-legs-bad element
is irrelevant, and we're back to the basic stupid scare-mongering cliche of
`armies of cloned soldiers' which, as you say, is ludicrous in the USA.

Exactly, these aspects of US society already create a kind of permeable
aristocracy, so cloning of scions would act to reinforce its effectiveness.
 Excellent private education, etc, are attempts to work around regression
to the genetic mean, whereby the kids of the successful are often less
gifted than their parents.  Stipulating *prohibitively expensive* cloning,
today's rich would become entrenched forever, excluding all but a very few
of the children of the poor.  As I said previously, one escape clause is to
make cloning cheap and readily available - but why should the custodians of
an elite system be eager to see this occur?

Sorry if my initial rhetoric made my objection sharper than was intended.

Let me beat this dead horse completely to death.  As I mentioned in an
earlier post, I didn't pick up the idea of government coercion in Max's
original report.  The reason I suggested an element of double-think in his
report was straightforward, but in error (due, I suspect, to the brevity of
Max's report).  This list often enthuses over prospects of massive
interventions and improvements in the genome, yet Max *appeared* to be
saying that drastic genomic engineering, per se, was a laughable notion -
when posited by an ideological opponent.

I agree that pseudo-fears such as the farming of clones to serve as spares
or organ banks is preposterous, given the current climate of opinion, and I
said so in no uncertain terms in a scathing review (in the New York Review
of Science Fiction) of Michael Marshall Smith's scare-mongering best-seller
horror novel SPARES.

Here is one more suggestion at about the same level of detail: I 
wonder if not much of the fear surrounding everything to do with 
cloning and genetic engineering goes back to the trauma inflicted on 
our "collective mind" by the Nazi experience. Big taboos were created 
to prevent anything resembling Nazism from ever appearing again. And 
these taboos, or memetic defenses, don't take any risks; they
attack memes that are not really Nazi if they bear any from of Nazi 
resemblance in the eyes of the unconscious mind of the people. (Gosh, 
this explanation is so obscure it begins to sound a bit Nazi to me!)

There a few articles sprinkled about the Web but they

by Gerard Milburn, entitled "The Feynman Processor", is
an excellent introduction to the concept of quantum
entanglement and its implications for the future of
computing. Here's the URL at Amazon.com:

If I had been doing that, it *would* have been double-think. I have plenty

Nick, I do think the Nazi history is sometimes a source of fear and
resistance. When I spoke at a conference in Germany about integration of
technology into the human being to enhance function, a German women stood
up and strongly hinted that I was a Nazi. This will keep happening to us. I
think it's important, when responding, to stress that we want these
technologies to be available but we are utterly opposed to compelling
anyone to use them. (That's an important reason for having the Open Society
principle.) We may face more difficulties if the day comes when a group of
transhumanists form who *do* want to force everyone to upgrade according to
the groups plans.

This is not so clear to me.

Under what circumstances is it legitimate to alter the genome and create
a genetically altered person who is better adapted to some environments
but worse for others?  In space, the legless person, or someone with
hands instead of feet, may have an advantage.  But you can't ask in
advance.

The question is related to the issue of whether it is right to bring
children into the world in other circumstances where their choices may
be limited.

Historically, people have had the right to raise their offspring into
virtually any circumstances.  They travel to dangerous new continents and
raise children in hard conditions.  Nobody asks the kids if they mind;
it's impossible to do so until after their born, and then it's too late.

Suppose a ship is being launched to the stars, at relatively slow speeds,
which will take centuries to make the journey.  Even with longevity and
hibernation, it is likely that children will be born, just as have been
born on other migrations.  This is part of the historical pattern of life,
and doesn't seem to raise new ethical problems.

Bringing kids into such an environment dooms them to life in space
as certainly as biologically adapting them would.  If we accept the
historical precedent for parents to have children in environments which
limit their choices, shouldn't we accept that modifying them is equally
permissible?

I am hearing some urging to hold EXTRO 4 in a fun location other than in
California, such as New Mexico, Las Vegas, etc. The cost of the flight
would be small, though those who would be local to a N. Cal event would
need a hotel room.

Please give me some feedback on whether holding EXTRO 4 in one of these
places would make it significantly less likely that you would come, or
whether it would actually be an attractive feature. 

I've only heard from two or three people on this, which doesn't give me
much to go on. I'd like to settle the location for the conference in August
'99 soon, and book the hotel.

In a couple of days I'll be posting more possibilities for subject areas
for the conference.

Thanks,

Max

   IAN: In fact, it stands to reason that "socialist
   transhumanism" would be "compulsory transhumanism,"
   because a socialist plan is government implemented
   and thus compulsory, and therefore the libertarian 
   ethic is the definitionally anti-Nazi >H policy;
   and as such, the libertarian ethic is the only 
   policy compatible with ethical transhumanism.

If a whole bunch of people are going into space for a long journey to
another star, then it may sense for them to have children with no legs (or
extra arms). Given that these people are entering a different environment,
they would be *increasing* their children's abilities and fitness.
Certainly I don't see a major objection to this. (Possible objections: It
makes far more sense to upload for an interstellar trip to save huge
amounts of energy: maybe the ship should be spun for gravity and normal
children produced to avoid cultural problems.) The engineered children are
being given the maximum opportunities for the situation they will be born
into.

This is different from the case as described by Pizulli. The legless people
may be well adapted for a space voyage. But they may not want to go on the
voyage. Then, they either must compelled or conditioned into going (both of
which I find ethically unacceptable), or they will stay on Earth and find
themselves physically disadvantaged.

In one case, given that you're going on the trip, you are maximizing your
engineered children's choices and abilities. In the other you are reducing
them, perhaps drastically (if they are forced to go). So I see these as
essentially different cases from a moral point of view.

Thanks for clearing up the misunderstanding about your previous comments.
Regarding the rhetorical question above though, one reason that the costs of
cloning might not go down eventually would be if cloning were supressed and
only available to the rich via black markets- and they would then be
suppressed, ironically by people holding concerns such as the one expressed
above. Imagine if similar things had been said in the past about the
motorcar and the computer - i.e. what if the rich get hold of these items
first and entrenched their privilege. Where would we be today?

Jason Soon

Abstract
  Two populations with high risk primary liver cancer (PLC), one of 226 cases
  with HBsAg carriers and another of 3849 first-relatives in the pedigree with
  high incidence of PLC, were randomly divided into the supplementing
  selenium group (selenium
  yeast 200 g Se1Tab/day) and the control group (common
  yeast 1 Tab/day), and were followed-up for four years and
  two years respectively. In the population with HBsAg carriers, no liver
  cancer occurred in the supplementing selenium group; where
  as the liver cancer incidence rate was 1573.03/10(5) in the control group.
  Among the first relatives. The liver cancer incidence rate in the
  supplementing selenium group was 219.37/10(5); and
  553.15/10(5) in the control group. The results showed that the incidence of
  PLC in the supplementing selenium group was significantly
  lower than in the control group. This study indicates that
  selenium has distinct anti-PLC effect.

  Anti-diabetic effects of onion and garlic
  sulfoxide amino acids in rats [letter].
Source
  Planta Medica.  61(4):356-7, 1995 Aug.
Abstract
  On oral administration of onion (Allium cepa L.) and garlic (A. sativum L.)
  sulfoxide amino acids viz., S-methylcysteine sulfoxide (SMCS) and
  S-allylcysteine sulfoxide (SACS) to alloxan-diabetic rats for a month, their
  diabetic condition, being characterized by glucose intolerance, weight loss,
  depletion of liver glycogen, etc., was ameliorated as comparable to rats
  treated with glibenclamide and insulin. However, only the last two drugs
  significantly increased the conversion of labelled acetate to liver
  cholesterol which indicates a deterrent effect of the allium products against
  the synthesis of a risk factor.

Title
  Chemoprevention of spontaneous
  tumorigenesis in nullizygous p53-deficient mice by dehydroepiandrosterone and
  its analog 16alpha-fluoro-5-androsten-17-one.
Source
  Carcinogenesis.  18(5):989-94, 1997 May.
Abstract
  Transgenic mice with both alleles of the p53 tumor suppressor gene product
  'knocked out' by gene targeting are susceptible to early development of
  tumors, chiefly lymphomas and sarcomas. Compared with the control group,
  administration of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) at 0.3% of the diet to male
  p53-deficient mice extended their lifespan by delaying death due to neoplasms
  (from 105 to 166 days on study, P = 0.002), primarily by suppressing
  lymphoblastic lymphoma (from 45 to 6% of neoplastic deaths, P = 0.010).
  Treatment with a synthetic DHEA analog, 16alpha-fluoro-5-androsten-17-one
  (compound 8354), at 0.15% of the diet also increased lifespan, to 140 days
  for mice that developed tumors (P = 0.037). The effects of these steroids on
  lifespan and tumor development did not appear to be strongly related to
  inhibition of food consumption and weight gain, in that a group pair-fed with
  control diet to the reduced food consumption of the DHEA-treated group
  developed and died of the same types of neoplasms at the same rate as the
  controls fed ad libitum. The chemopreventive effect of these steroids has
  been proposed to be due to suppression of DNA synthesis by inhibition of
  glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the pentose
  phosphate pathway. Although DHEA and its analog are strong non-competitive
  inhibitors of this enzyme in vitro, treatment with DHEA did not deplete
  cellular nucleotide pools in the liver, as would have been predicted. The
  chemopreventive effect of DHEA in this model may be due to steroid-induced
  thymic atrophy and suppression of T cell lymphoma, permitting these mice to
  survive long enough to develop tumors with longer latency.

Title
  New epidemiologic leads in
  the etiology of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in
  the elderly: the role of blood transfusion
  and diet. [Review] [38 refs]
Source
  Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy.  51(5):200-7, 1997.
Abstract
  The incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in persons over
  the age of 65 years has increased dramatically since
  the 1950s in western countries. The
  strongest known risk factors for NHL are primary or acquired
  immunosuppression, but these severe deficiencies are
  relatively rare and cannot explain the rapid increase
  observed in the elderly. Recent work suggests that common
  exposures which influence immunocompetence, albeit at a much weaker level,
  may also be risk factors for NHL. Two such risk factors recently associated
  with NHL are prior history of blood transfusion and certain aspects of diet.
  In four out of four studies, prior history of blood transfusion was
  associated with approximately a doubling in NHL risk, even for a transfusion
  first received a decade or more before diagnosis. Other
  studies suggest that diets high in animal proteins and fats may increase
  the risk of NHL while fruit and vegetable consumption may
  decrease risk. Allogeneic blood transfusion is known to suppress
  the immune system, and diets high in protein and fat may
  also lead to altered immunocompetence, although other
  mechanisms such as viral transmission or the effects of
  heterocyclic amines and N-nitroso compounds may also play a role. Follow-up
  of these observations my lead to a better understanding of
  the NHL epidemic and new approaches to
  the prevention of NHL. [References: 38]

Ooops!  This last line should be omitted from your probability chart,
unless you consider burning in hell for an eternity a form of
immortality.  On second thought, while the rest of the universe
(including heaven) is suffering a slow heat death, us sinners will
still be enjoying the infinite energy of eternal flames.  Forget the
"Far Side" party.  Maybe we should brush up on our refrigeration
theory and metallurgy application notes.  It sounds to me like the
devil is onto something here.  Is there any way to guarantee a trip to
hell?  How about this:

I, Joseph F. Jenkins Jr. hereby irrevocably offer my everlasting soul
to the devil for the amount of $20,000 to be deposited into my savings
account at Johnson Space Center Federal Credit Union by COB 10/28/98.

If this works, I'll let you know and the next guy can ask for $25,000
:-)  Actually, I should be worth more since I was a fully indoctrinate
Southern Baptist with a Christian name, none the less.

While the objective of building a petaflop machine isn't
new, here's some information I happened upon on the PR Newswire
concerning progress towards the machine. I'm including a portion
of the article since there is no URL:

3-D Transistor Key Enabling Technology to be Demonstrated 

"COSTA MESA, Calif., Sept. 29 /PRNewswire/ -- Irvine Sensors
Corporation (Nasdaq: IRSN, Boston: ISC) announced today that
it has received an approximate $738,000 research and development 
contract from the United States Army Space and Missile Defense 
Command to demonstrate the feasibility of an ultra high density 
interconnect to enhance its 3D Artificial Neural Network(TM) 
(3DANN(TM)) technology. The new interconnect is part of Irvine 
Sensors' planned progression of technologies intended to eventually 
lead to a "Silicon Brain," a recognition system conceived to emulate 
performance of the human central nervous system. The Army's interest 
in such technology is for potential application to ballistic missile 
defense systems. Irvine Sensors believes that human-level recognition 
technology could also have commercial applications in such fields as 
medical diagnostics, DNA sequencing, radiography, security systems, 
and speech recognition. Optical displays are also expected to benefit 
from the three-dimensional active transistor interconnect technology 
to be developed under the new contract."

"The problem being addressed by the Silicon Brain development can be 
compared to that faced by a football quarterback who, when confronting 
multiple threats and opportunities simultaneously, must take 
instantaneous and decisive action. During missile defense, events 
unfold even faster, and the threats and opportunities are much greater 
in number. What you'd like is human-level intuitive responsiveness, but 
at higher speeds and typically under adverse, humanly-impossible 
conditions," said John C. Carson, Irvine Sensors' Sr. Vice President 
and Chief Technical Officer. "Although it will take several years 
before the technology can be made available for products, we believe 
the Silicon Brain will ultimately be able to solve that problem... 
attaining petaflop performance, or quadrillions of operations per 
second, using less than ten watts of power, in one-third of a cubic 
foot, or about the size of a shoebox. This will be the same volumetric 
efficiency as the human brain."

The 10/98 issue of _Electronic Engineering Times_ has an
article on Irvine Sensor Corporation's efforts. The EET article
gives a bit more meat about the time frames and performance and
the developmental objectives that might be pursued once a petaflop
machine is constructed. A reference to five to ten year time frame
for achieve 10 PFLOPS was stated.

Here's a snippet from an informative story at 

http://www.nando.net/newsroom/ntn/health/102898/health6_18043.html

For the first time, U.N. experts estimated the number of people in their
80s, 90s and over 100 -- and found 66 million people over 80 including 6.4
million over 90 and 135,000 centinarians.

"With the continuation of fertility decline and increase in life
expectancy, the population of the world will age much faster in the next
half-century than previously," the U.N. said.

Interesting iterm, Doug. Last night on my favorite web news(non)paper, I
saw an announcement about Intel's latest supercomputer Pacific Blue, which
manages 3.9 teraflops. I think that's the current record.

Consider someone considering setting up a colony on the moon, where a legless
colonist could barely afford passage back to Earth, or around Jupiter, where 
transportation is just too expensive for a legless colonist to afford passage
back to Earth.  Max's moral calculus would encourage them to set up the colony
at Jupiter rather than the Moon, all else equal.  

This seems perverse to me, and argues for Hal's position.  Another example 
would be: it is all right to make a Morlock tuned for mining deep beneath 
the Earth, as long as you close off all the tunnels they could use to return
to the surface?  I don't like the idea that you can do things to people which 
would be considered bad in our environment, but which are all right as long as 
you limit their options to move.

I agree with Max, it's a ridiculous thing to fear and will never happen, the entire
idea is grotesque. let's get back to the real world people,  Jupiter has no solid
surface so 4 legs would be pointless,  we'd want to engineer humans so they
had huge hydrogen filled stomachs, that way they could float around high in the
atmosphere of the planet.

4 legs, the very idea! I don't know where people get such crazy notions.

Okay, but I'm trying to get at the more general issue: when is it OK to
make modifications to the genome of one's unborn children?  How do we
judge whether the changes will turn out to be acceptable when you can't
ask in advance?

Most changes will have some tradeoffs; few will be entirely advantageous.
Is it ethical to make these kinds of changes?  Does the parent have the
right to make the decision?

Roger Zelazny wrote a very pretty short story called "The Keys to
December", about a group of children who were born modified for a
very cold world which was then destroyed before they could move there.
A corporation had paid their parents to have babies modified like this,
and also contracted to pay for their upbringing and education, but then
they would have been more or less forced by circumstances to live and
work on this cold world that the company wanted to develop, since nowhere
else would be livable for them.  Should the parents have had the right to
have modified children like these?

Suppose I live in space, and never go to Earth because it is too expensive.
Can I modify my kids so that it would be practically impossible for them
to go, if it helps in the space environment?

You can craft a whole range of cases like this, where the adaptions are
more or less beneficial.  It's especially hard to judge when the adaption
is only beneficial in a niche environment.

In practice, these situations may not arise.  By the time we can do genome
modifications, perhaps we can will be able to do physical modifications
just as effectivelly.  However I have doubts about this when dealing
with mental adaptations.  To rewrite your mind late in life could be a
hard task, and it might be necessary to be born with different senses
or limbs in order to use them with maximum effectiveness.

These are canards - propagated in large part I suspect by unscrupulous
marketing types and empire-building IT mgrs. Windows is only "very" usable
compared to what it was like 5 years ago - it has been and is still far
behind the curve compared to other GUI-mediated OSes. Many university-run
ergometric studies support this.

And it is much more expensive to maintain a Windows LAN than a Mac LAN.
Initial hw costs are greater, but support and training costs are lower, and
Apple computers depreciate more slowly than their cheaper Intel/clone
counterparts. Again, there is hard data to support this claim.

I would have to disagree. Several of their products are good (Excel remains
an example of MS at its best), most are merely passable, and too many (and
amongst these some of the most widely used) are absolutely horrid. MS Word
is a horror, from both user and support viewpoints, for example. Almost any
other widely available commercial WP app is better - Nisus, WordPerfect,
Claris, et al. Faster, more stable, less cluttered, and more intuitive. I
suspect that centuries of productivity hours have been poured down the
MSWord drain.

Untrue (YDNRC). According to recent Dataquest research, more than 22
million computers *currently* run MacOS (70% of a total sold base of over
30 million since its introduction 1984, Macs may cost a bit more, but
apparently they are built to last as well). With roughly 3.2 users per
computer, that means that there are about 70 million Mac OS users
worldwide. Apple, btw, has increased its desktop mkt share over the last
year - an underreported story even in the face of that company's recent
triumphs in the marketplace.

Linux installed base is increasing rapidly (and please note that I am one
of "those crazy Linux users"), but even the most optimistic (and somewhat
self-serving, it should be noted) estimates by Red Hat puts the installed
base of Linux users around 7.5 million. More realistic estimates put the
number between 250,000 - 1.5 million. [Harald T. Alvestrand has a Linux
counter project, some quite rational thoughts on the difficulties in
getting good numbers for this estimate, and links to various other attempts
to pin down an accurate estimate. http://counter.li.org/estimates.html ]

Well, this is the point on which Justice disagrees, innit? They maintain
(and are attempting to show through evidence and testimony) that MS got and
held a lot of that mkt share through unethical and illegal anti-competitive
practices. Btw, for Max and others who seemed to have missed the
distinction, it is various *monopolistic* practices which are illegal, not
actually being a monopoly.

>(as a side note, linux is still quite tough to use and configure, count
>1-2 more years for it to really get into the general market)

I think Linux has a great future as a server OS, but I am skeptical that it
will *ever* reach the desktop in a way that makes a real impact on the
other OSes. Nor is this neccessarily a bad thing - I don't want to drive a
747 to the grocery, and I don't need a passenger car that can seat 300 and
can hit Mach 0.8.

But baby, I *love* having that 747 at my beck and call!

For obvious reasons, I've been concerned with this question for a number of
years, more so since Damien Broderick (!) expressed concern about my plans it
in The Spike.

Let's ask the question this way:  Most people would say that we don't have the
right to modify a genome, or perform neurosurgery, to increase intelligence. 
Suppose a mutation arises naturally containing that modification.  Should he
be prevented from having children?  Can his genes be inserted artificially? 
Can an improved version be engineered de novo?

And no, this isn't a theoretical argument.  One of the most powerful arguments
I intend to wield is that if you're going to prevent me from creating copies
of myself neurosurgically, you may as well prevent me from reproducing
biologically.  And is it such a large step from there to sterilizing the
stupid?  Jews?  Nazism lies not in the concept of a master race, or
sterilizing the "inferior", but in *any* denial of the right to exist on the
basis of genetics.

Despite such arguments, I still expect all cognitive engineering to be banned
in the U.S.  The question is not how to prevent this, but how to keep the
backlash from destroying the country long enough for the law to be repealed. 
For myself, I fight by changing the rules of the game, not in big flashy
confrontations.  I will inform my enemies who they are and that they have lost
when the battle is won.

I must disagree.  While I have never used (or heard of) Nisus, I have
tried WordPerfect, Claris, and various other word processors, and have
found that Word is more intuitive (for me) than any of the others. And
Word on Windows machines is even fairly stable (though it seems to crash
very often on Macs).

Excuse me?  Over three users *per* computer?  So two MacTerminal (tm) 
stations are sold for every Mac? :)  Maybe you meant 3.2 computers
per user?  That would seem more likely, in my experience (both when
I used Macs at work, earlier this year, and at home now, where my wife
and I need 5 computers total).

Much of that is due to the iMac, I believe, which siphons from
Windows users, not Linux (or anything else, really).

The problem is that these practices only work when those affected
(consumers and resellers) feel that Microsoft products are better
enough to warrent the trouble of dealing with them.  If the 
product was seen as inferior, or even just barely as good, their
market share would vanish.  Admittedly, because of the installed
base, this would require either Windows compatibility or free 
software, or both.

I guess this depends on what you consider an 'impact'.  Linux has
already made a real impact, if by this you mean that other major

excerpt from "Isn't libertarian socialism an oxymoron?"

http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/1931/secI1.html

So what does socialism mean? And is it compatible with 
libertarian ideals? Webster's New International Dictionary 
defines a libertarian as "One who holds to the doctrine 
of free will; also, one who upholds the principles of 
liberty, esp. individual liberty of thought and action." 

According to the American Heritage Dictionary "socialism" 
is "a social system in which the producers possess both 
political power and the means of producing and distributing 
goods." This definition fits neatly with the implications 
of the word "libertarian" indicated above. In fact, it 
shows that socialism is necessarily libertarian, not statist.

I preface this URL with the fact that none of this has been
corroborated by other scientists. However, a relevant section
of the article explains the situation:

"On October 22 and on the following night, the engineer reported
detecting signals from the EQ Pegasi star system which is 22 light 
years away."

"The signals were not the type that occurs naturally. The data has 
been distributed to several astronomers and observatories."

There are plenty of possible explanations other than ETI but it
will be interesting to see how this story develops.

Perhaps dolphin A was hoping dolphin B wouldn't figure it out, and 
that he (A) would be returned to the other side of the pool and there 
would be fish left.

They should have done the experiment in such a way that two levers at
opposite sides of the pool need to be pulled simultaneously to get the fish.
Teach two dolphins to do the trick, then remove one of them and put in a new
dolphin who doesn't know the trick.

Perhaps dolphin A was hoping dolphin B wouldn't figure it out, and 
that he (A) would be returned to the other side of the pool and there 
would be fish left.

Perhaps, dolphin A and dolphin B just had a serious difference of 
opinion about human intelligence and are no longer "talking" to 
each other.

In this case there is an important extra piece of information: a subject
who already has experienced some form of alteration or enhancement, and
likes it.  He wants to pass it on to his offspring, which will tend to
happen naturally if it is genetically based, and could be arranged to
happen artificially in any case.

Perhaps we can generalize and say that modifications of unborn children
are OK as long as most people who had received such modifications were
happy about it.  This is not a perfect generalization, in that there
might be a situation where someone liked a trait and wanted his kids to
have it, but most people with that trait hated it.  In that case we might
question the wisdom of passing it on.

This does not help much when we propose to impose a modification for
the first time, since there are no others we can poll who have the mod.
In that case we might adopt a policy of gradualism, combined with
consensual physical modifications.  Let's see a population of people
satisfied to have their legs surgically removed before we decide to have
children born without them.

Gradualism will be more difficult in some cases, like turning feet into
hands, or John Clark's human bags of hydrogen gas living on Jupiter
(giving new meaning to "fire in the belly"?).  Even then it may be
possible to make the changes incremental by using some imagination.

BTW I always try to split this kind of question up into two parts.
The first is, is it wise and proper to make modifications to your
unborn children in this way?  In other words, if someone came to you
and asked your advice about whether they should do it, would you
say that it is a good idea.  We approach the question on an individual
level and try to decide what approaches would be best, from a moral
and ethical perspective.

Once that is done, you can pull back and look at it from society's point
of view.  Should coercion be used to enforce this morality?  Think of
murder, which most people agree is wrong on a personal level, and they
are so sure of their feelings that they feel comfortable enforcing this
prohibition on everyone.

It seems to me that cases where the proper path is fuzzy or unclear
at the individual level should be the last ones where society decides
to employ coercion.  If I don't know what is the right thing to do,
I certainly shouldn't be telling you  what to do.  So it is important
to analyze the individual case carefully in order to both decide what
is the ethically proper course, and also how much certainty we can
have about it.

Perhaps dolphin A resented not being consulted on the design of the
experiment and the thought of being tested on an utterly simplistic
communication skill ;-)

Ok, what if, instead we replace the phrase socialist libertarian with
collectivist libertarian?  The internet Miriam Webster defines
collectivism as: "a political or economic theory advocating collective
control especially over production and distribution; also : a system
marked by such control."  I usually equate socialism with
collectivism, perhaps in error.

At least in Netscape 4.0.x, you can
pull down the "communicator" menu and
select "message center." This pops up a

I must add that a Las Vegas, CO, or NM location would certainly increase my
ability to attend.And, I certainly would love to attend an Extro.

Question:

	If the general theory of relativity states that "the faster you go"
[and approach the speed
of light], the slower time will "be for you" "relative" to everything
else...?

	Then if everything on the quantum level travels at near the speed of
light, why would a 
complete object vs. single quantum particles change "time" as it
increases speed ?...  If the quantum
particles that make everything up are already traveling at nearly the
same speed, then why would time
change if any of them take a general direction?

  IAN: The definition of socialism cited observes 
  by default that consumers have been deprived of 
  political power -- which is held by producers --
  and that consumers have been taken out of the con-
  trol of the distribution of goods; which is exactly 
  the case in the socialist, but not libertarian, state.

  We can also observe that a definition of libertarianism
  need only note that * individuals * have political power,
  not that one social subset, such as producers, had power.
  What is more, the idea that producers have power in the
  socialist state is false, the central planners have it.

  The case presented for the nondifference of socialism 
  and libertarianism has not been made by the selective 
  set of definitions cited. Here's a better definition
  that clearly defines what is unique to socialism:

 From Merriam Webster's (http://m-w.com)

  SOCIALISM: 1: any of various economic and political 
  theories advocating collective or governmental ownership 
  and administration of the means of production and 
  distribution of goods 2 a: a system of society or group 
  living in which there is no private property b: a system 
  or condition of society in which the means of production 
  are owned and controlled by the state 3: a stage of society 
  in Marxist theory transitional between capitalism and 
  communism and distinguished by unequal distribution of
  goods and pay according to work done

Is it just wild-eyed idealism on my part? It seems to 
me that by the time we have the ability to make highly
stategic genomic modifications, individuals will 
also have the ability to choose whatever body type 
they prefer.  The Transhumanistic ideal would be that 
anyone who had been genetically modified would at any 
time have the liberty of choosing between any number 
of body types.

We don't have to worry about a 6-handed version of a 
human living and working on a space station being 
condemned to that body type and that body type alone.
One's brain should be quite transplantable by the time 
we have the technology to construct 6-handed humans.
Of course, I could be entirely wrong.

BTW, watched a Deep Space Nine episode tonight 
about a group of genetically enhanced mutants.  
Basically they've been ostracized and institutionalized
despite their intellectual superiority.  Thing is . . . they're
a bit eccentric.  Except for Dr. Bashir (sp?), the one that 
was able to fit in, hiding and protecting his transhumanistic 
identity.  I've also noticed that the new version of "The 
Outer Limits" frequently has episodes with transhumistic
themes.

Maybe it's just too late, but I don't see how you get this result, Robin. A
*pragmatic* calculus would give you this result. Setting aside the moral
issue, you might go for the Jupiter mission because you know the legless
astronauts will be stuck with it and can't screw up your mission by
deciding to return to Earth. But, if they take the moral issue into
account, they would do the opposite of what you suggest. If they cannot
afford to get back from Jupiter, they are simply stuck and their options
limited. If they are on the moon and can barely afford to return to Earth,
their options are not great, but they are broader than the Jupiter people.
They may get home poor (maybe they can sell their story to the media...)
but at least they have that option, whereas the Jupiter folks do not. So, I
get the opposite result from you. Or are we somehow talking at
cross-purposes here?

I agree, but I never suggested that. Whether it's okay to make a Morlock
would depend on many things, adding up to what kind of life a Morlock would
have. If above-surface humans were rapidly dying off due to apocalyptic
environmental changes, children might be much better off as Morlocks.

In my scenario, the already-grown unaltered humans have decided to go into
space. They have every right to do this. Given that they are going into
space, I was suggesting that it might be morally unproblematic for them to
then have children in space who were better adapted. I don't think that the
children would have a justifiable complaint about being in space, since it
was a decision made by the parents for themselves. Given that decision,
they must then decide whether to have children. If the offspring will have
lives worth living, this seems a reasonable choice. The parents in this
situation are not limiting the children, the parents are making choices
about their own lives then producing offspring in the resulting situation.

If someone left China and came to the USA, and then had a child here, that
child would usually not have a defensible moral objection if they wish they
had been born in China.

  I wrote a letter to an acquaintance who had recently suffered a heart
attack, about possible dietary interventions. I thought this might prove
to be interesting to others, so part of my letter is reproduced here.

       ---------- Forwarded message ----------

  From my files on cardiovascular disease I've gathered that getting more
exercise, eating less meat (except fish), and consuming more fruits,
vegetables, nuts and legumes is likely to modestly lower the risk of
cardiovascular fatalities. For a more significant reduction in risk it
seems one has to go beyond the standard recommendations one hears from
doctors.
  A good example of this is from (J Am Col Nutr 1293): 255-261 1993). The
mortality rate of patients who had suffered a heart attack was found to
vary dramatically with the quantity of fruits and vegetables the patients
ate as follows:

                            Control   Dietary  Invention Groups
                               "B"        A1          A2
Fruit & vegetables (g/day)    182        492         652
Total Mortality                13.8%      10.4%        5.5%

  I doubt many doctors would be disatisfied with any patient who was
eating about 492 grams of fruits and vegetables per day! However this is
still a dangerously poor diet, with about double the mortality rate of
those who consumed still more fruits and vegetables.
  There is very little data indicating what the optimal quantity of fruits
and vegetables one should consume for maximum longevity, possibly because
virtually nobody ever consumes this. I would recommend maintaining an
intake over 1 kilogram per day to be on the safe side.
  There are probably great variations in how protective individual fruits
and vegetables are. For example there exists some data suggesting that
eggplant actually raises blood pressure. However based on the information
at hand I can make two suggestions that I feel stand out from the crowd as
likely more protective than most. One is garlic. It has been found that
taking at least 300 mg/day of garlic powder for over 2 years was
associated with increased elastic properties of aorta in the elderly.
(Circulation 96: 2649-2655 1997) Doses larger than 300 mg were not more
protective so a very modest daily intake of garlic or its powder is my
recommendation here.
  An interesting study was done relating adipose biopsy carotenoid
concentration with risks of a heart attack. This is particularly
interesting since tissue concentrations reflect long term intake of
carotenoids. Only lycopene had a significant relation with risk, which
decreased progressively with higher tissue concentrations. There was no
indication of a maximum threshold beyond which lycopene had no further
effect. (Am J Epidemiol 146: 618-628 1997)
  I would like to suggest two easy ways to increase fruit and vegetable
intake to over 1 kg/day. I've found that 1 kg of seedless watermelon makes
a nice snack - when it is in season. I've tried a variety of tomato
products, to see how easy it is to consume them. Raw tomatoes are slightly
bitter, and most tomato sauces have an "off" taste. Tomato soup tastes
bland. I've found one tomato sauce which tastes very good. The brand is
called Bielle, and it is manufactured in Alberta. It contains tomato puree
rather than paste, and this might make the difference. I doubt any rotting
tomatoes were used to make this sauce. However this is expensive and may
be hard to obtain. Based on taste and cost the easiest way I've found to
consume large quantities of tomatoes is tomato juice. Lycopene is less
easily absorbed from tomato products that are less heat processed, but
tomato juice is hard to beat if large amounts are to be consumed.
Consumption of 330 ml/day of tomato juice has been found to reduce DNA
damage in lymphocytes. (Carcinogenesis 18(9): 1847-1850 1997) (The same
study also found carrot juice to be even more effective.) You might want
to consider purchasing a juicing machine.
  When increasing fruit and vegetable intake, it is important to avoid
flatulence inducing ones! Many vegetables suffer from this side effect, so
concentrating on fruits more than vegetables would likely be the easier
route. (The only legume source free from this side effect seems to be
processed soybean products such as tofu, and soy milk.) I should mention
that some vegetables are also associated with increased risk of side
effects, such as stone formation with oxalate rich spinach, and sun burn
with psoralen rich celery.
  A funny thing happened during the Adventist Health Study relating diet
to mortality, in a group with one seventh the heart attack risk of the
general population, and who already live 7 years longer. The big finding
was the largely unsuspected health benefits of nuts. Here's some data from
(Arch Intern Med 152: 1416-1424 1992).

                           Relative Risk

             >=3/wk            1.19

  This nut/longevity relation was later found to hold even in old age.
Here's some data from those over 84 years of age. (Arch Intern Med 157:
2249-2258 1997)

nuts          <1/wk            1
             1-4/wk            0.71
              >4/wk            0.55

  I've looked at the data comparing the effects on lipids of various types
of nuts. The best results seem to be with almond ingestion, which results
in a better HDL/LDL ratio than with olive oil. (J Am Col Nutr 17(3):
285-290 1998) It's probably a good idea to consume some nuts on a regular
basis - particularly almonds.

There was a posting about diet contra exercise as a life prolonging faktor.
I cannot find it in my mailprogram or in the exi archives. Can anybody
remember this posting? And if so tell me where to find it again.

Ian, what seems evident here is that argument by selective definition is
not enough and cannot persuade parties. In this thread, for example,
others would say that politics is about forging and changing coalitions
and that this definition seems to negate the ability of any individual
from having or creating political power without the involvement of
others, as you implied.

There is this problem with general discourse in a way that likely even a
Platonist would agree that written language is about not being able to
come to agreement and in fact is more about missing perspectives. What I
would hope eventually to see is a collective internet rendering of
presentations that is something even bolder than what crit.org can do.
I'd like to eventually see an elevation of subject matter on the basis
of subjective evaluations of features where, by using say e.g., floating
radio buttons in a sidebar to the subject area, to enable a scoring of
features so that neural net patterns and/or markov-like chains could be
developed and forever remain open to revision. Such an eventual global
valuation of everything via the net is what I foresee. Because my
software development is in this field, this is my expectation of
libertarian socialism.

Until this demarchy is a reality I feel it is a pity to contribute a
wasteful writing of replies to email posts that disappear into a
nothingness of biased meanings.

  After reading an interesting research report on rooibos tea, I looked
for and failed to find any local supplier of this beverage. Eventually I
obtained a supply from a company called H & H International Trading.
If anyone else can not find this beverage locally, they can contact H & H
at their web site at www.bostea.com.

Title
  The suppression of age-related accumulation of lipid peroxides in rat brain
  by administration of Rooibos tea (Aspalathus linearis).
Source
  Neuroscience Letters.  196(1-2):85-8, 1995 Aug 18.
Abstract
  The protective effects of Rooibos tea (RT), Aspalathus
  linearis, against damage to the central nervous system (CNS) accompanying
  aging were examined by both the thiobarbituric acid reaction (TBA) and
  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods in brains of chronically RT-treated
  rats. Ad libitum administration of RT was begun with 3-month-old Wistar
  female rats and continued for 21 months. The contents of TBA reactive
  substances (TBARS) in the frontal cortex, occipital cortex, hippocampus and
  cerebellum in 24-month-old rats after administration with water were
  significantly higher than those in young rats (5 weeks old). However, no
  significant increase of TBARS was observed in RT-administered aged rats. When
  MR images of the brains of 24-month-old rats with and without RT as well as
  5-week-old rats were taken, a decrease of the signal intensity was observed
  in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum in MR images of aged rats
  without RT, whereas little change of the signal intensity was observed in MR
  images of the same regions of 24-month-old rats treated with RT, whose images
  were similar to those of young rats. These observations suggested that (1)
  the age-related accumulation of lipid peroxides in the brain was closely
  related to the morphological changes observed by MRI, and (2) chronic
  RT-administration prevented age-related accumulation of lipid peroxides in
  several regions of rat brain.

It's just wild-eyed idealism.  Genomic modification and neural modification in
infancy are a hell of a lot easier than reversing the modification in
adulthood.  We can't rely on the "we'll be able to reverse it by the time
they're 18" to solve the moral issues.  Plus, I don't think that argument is
correct.  Neuromod will be the real hot-spot issue, and neuromod is almost
impossible to reverse.

The writers of Deep Space Nine are not real mutants and know nothing
whatsoever about the cognitive science involved.  Furthermore, their mutants'
goals and personalities are based on normally-intelligent writers' fantasies
of being a superior mutant, and bear no relation to an actual personality
shaped by specialized genius.  If we want to survive, we will need to react on
the basis of fact rather than 50 years of bad TV.

It seemed to me that that you were arguing before for evaluating these
scenarios based on whether the creature was well-tuned for his environment,
*taking for granted* whatever environment he was in.  This seems to me to 
let people off the hook for choosing what environments to place people in.
Here you seem to accept responsibility for environments.  But in 
this next case you don't seem to accept this.

>In my scenario, the already-grown unaltered humans have decided to go into

It isn't obvious that they do have every right to do this.  If you are
responsible for the total package you put your children into, their 
environment plus how tuned they are for that environment, then it becomes
open to question whether it was all right to take your kids into space.

This seems a complicated rule-based morality, which I can't follow very 
well.  My more consequentialist morality just asks about how much worth
living those lives would be.  Parental choices for themselves are no excuse.

Only because the USA is not considered such a terrible place to be.

  IAN: I certainly believe that libertarianism is 
  the real "socialism" where we define socialism as
  a system that most effectively meets social needs,
  and a system directed by the people (a supply and
  demand system), whereas what we call socialism is
  directed by elite planners (control and command).

Sure, and many Tobacco Institute studies say you can't get lung cancer from
smoking. The facts are that a) any Mac is more expensive than a comparable PC
(this may have changed recently, but I'm not sure), b) between 1980 and 1996
the typical office PC was 2/3 the cost of a comparable Apple, making it the
obvious economic choice of bean counters who didn't give a fiddlers damn about
ergonomics. c) Those office PCs were not capable of running other GUI OS's,
they were stuck with various flavors of DOS until the introduction of Windows.
If Apple had gone out and developed a Mac OS to work on PCs, then they might
have something to complain about with Windows, but if they had, I doubt Windows
would exist today.

WP which was first to market was technically superior to Word, thus it got an
early lead in word processing intensive fields like Secretarial/legal, etc. and
people that got trained in WP mindsets obviously have a fixed idea of how a
word processor should run. Word, on the other hand, started off as a simpler
application, so its learning curve was, in fact, shorter than WP. Today, it
really does not matter, though if a user starts with one word processor, they
will tend to have trouble migrating to another with the same efficiency as they
did with the original. This goes both ways. I, for example, find WP abominable
to use, but only because I spend years on Word.

I would love to look at this study. Considering that most Macs are used in two
areas: publishing and college students, I would have to highly contest the
users per Mac figures as overly generous. I also contest the claim that 70% of
all Macs are currently being "used". I see many more unused/piling up dust Macs
today than I do ones in use, and the ones in use are almost all version 7.5 or
newer.

While I prefer Netscape myself, I do concede one important technical advantage
that Internet Explorer has over Netscape, which would, if I were an AOL
executive would sell me on that browser as the default browser: page load time.
IE hands down loads a page faster than Netscape. AOL's major malfunction over
the past 8 years has been that bandwidth per user actually used is extremely
low. Page load speeds and mail delivery times, as well as connection
reliability are among the worst I have seen in any ISP or online service. This
may have changed recently, but at the time of the browser war Justice is
arguing, AOL was WAY behind on backbone expansion, and had picked up up
millions of new users.

Microsofts sales people may have been agressive, but no more so than I have
seen from many other sales people in other companies and industries. If I had
been an AOL exec at the time I would have picked IE myself....

There are fairly safe changes, like making sure that the offspring will be
healthy, tall, muscular etc, in other words: built to optimize the human
form (to be on the safe side, you can model them (clone?) in the image
of the best speciments alive today). That's the very least one could,
and indeed *should* do as soon as these techniques are deemed safe
enough to use. Certainly the cloning thing should be feasible quite soon.

I would strongly advise against any changes that would classify someone
as a "freak" (like being legless, having 4 arms etc.) An enhanced human
should blend in easily with the rest of society (save for extra beauty
etc, which are positive destinctions).

Perhaps Dolphin A thought that the quality of the food was so poor, he
could not in all good concience recommend it to Dolpin B, but then he was
having a tiff with Dolphin B over a female, so he didn't mention how bad it
was either, hoping that Dolping B would wind up upchucking in front of the
object of their romantic competition.

No No No. You missed the most important difference. In the first
definition, it applied to the individual, while the second refered to
the 'producers' as a common group. This is the essential incompatibility
of libertarianism and socialism. Libertarianism declares that the prime
political unit is the individual, while socialism declares that the
primary political unity is the community or society, thus letting in the
buggaboo of coersion of the individual by the tyranny of the masses.

Oh, sweet reason!

29 years after watching the Apollo 11 launch, seeing the Shuttle go up
still gives me a massive thrill and brings tears to my eyes.

I hope this event boosts interest in space and science in general. As a
good follow-up to the launch, tonight CNBC will be covering the idea of
privatizing more of the space program, an idea favored by Buzz Aldrin.

Onward and Upward!

That's the closest thing to utopia I can think of. Of course, not
everybody might share this view.

The idea must have been around for some time. A SFnal treatment is James
P. Hogan's novel _Voyage From Yesteryear_ (1982), where he speculates
how a society would develop when everybody's material needs are
fulfilled. The result is a Libertarian "society", where people indeed
strive for reputation and recognition from others in their field of
choice (arts, science, engineering, ...).

I'm not sure whether it was in Raymond's "The Cathedral and the Bazaar"
or a followup paper, but the analysis that this model is behind the Open
Source community is convincing.

Can you give net refs as to how this Libertarianism doublethink came
about where the word *political* (i.e. I think of it as describing an
aspect of people's connections) came to focus on a node within the
connections rather than the collective. If I were to use an analogy, the
concepts of a jukebox, genre, playlist or database springs to mind as
words on one end of the scale where the adjective *political* would
reside and words like individual, song or field appear at the other end.
Thus to me a song isn't a set and an individual isn't his connections.
My PC isn't a primary internet unit because before I used the internet
my PC did other things. I know there are differences between adjectives
and nouns and that confusion between the two can lead to delusional
thinking, but even though I also know the Nazis were deluded in their
thinking about race, etc., this plural/singular (i.e.,
political/individual) definition mix up that you point to has me
perplexed.

An Australian physicist at Perth Observatory sez:

There's a closed mailing list for SETI signal verification, and a BBC
reporter is on it. Someone anonymously faked moderation on a post and
claimed to have seen signals, and the BBC guy reported it before

  IAN: A libertarian society is a society in which 
  a set of collective rules (political power) exist
  that define the rights of individuals.  Robinson 
  Crusoe has no political rights, and the example
  of your computer free from the net is Crusoe. 

  So there's no contradiction between the concepts of
  political rights, the individual, and libertarianism.
  The individual in society has political rights, more
  or less, but Robinson Crusoe has no polical rights.

Active-shield based virtually infinite computing resources performing 
operations logistics management to steer people around like toys 
makes a lot of sense.

Simply make everybody's dreams come true simultaneously: pairing 
supply with demand on the level of personality profiles.

Essentially automating the dating and mating game, hooking up need 
with gratification, problem with solution.

No more need for the Center for Disease Control.  Simply herd the 
herpes boys into charmed contact with herpes girls: aids patients 
with each other, syphilis carriers with others, etc.

This improves significantly on celibacy, in my opinion.

However, I still haven't figured out the most technologically 
efficient and ethically practical birth control.

No need for natural reproduction.  But is vasectomy a better solution 
than outright castration?  Who needs sperm-meets-egg when a blood 
sample taken to the local geneticist will do just fine?

But, what's the best mass sterilization implementation plan?  Can 
male sterilization be performed without forcing the boys from the 
hood to go under the knife.  I'm not so sure they'll go for that. 

Maybe some sort of chemical in the water supply?

I'm not impressed at all. I think manned space missions are a tremendous
waste of my taxes. Very little real science has been done on these expensive
flights of fancy and propaganda.
We should all applaud last weeks successful launch of DeepSpace 1, a truly
progressive space project. Ion engines, cool solar power technology,
ingenious self-monotoring systems, and other futuristic technologies that
seem far more essential to the understanding and perhaps population of the
universe by future updates of our species.
The past bunch of space shuttle fights seem redundant and wasteful. A lot of
dubious military agendas being pursued.

Crusoe is still an individual and your earlier statement that the basic
political unit in your definition of Libertarianism is the individual. I
contradict this. Sure the basic political unit may reside in the
individual but isn't the individual. The individual may be a type of
political unit but hardly *the* basic one. I would be happy to accept
that another basic political unit maybe an abstract conflict of some
sort. I don't say all conflicts because right now I'm installing a
network and have irq conflicts; - unless you accept that my relationship
with the net is political.

Suppose that atom A and atom B are chemically very similar atoms
far apart from each other such that no electromagnetic interactions
occur between them and that no external forces are acting on them. 

While an electron in atom A might have the same average velocity relative
to nucleus A as electron B has relative to nucleus B, if
atom B is moving away from atom A then electron B will
have, in addition to its  orbital velocity around
nucleus B,  a translational velocity relative to nucleus A.
It is this relative translational velocity that is responsible for
time dilation between frames.   

What special relativity shows is that if you have one point of reference
(the nucleus of an atom for example) and build a coordinate system
around it, then if another frame is moving away from the first
at a constant velocity, then systems evolving (clocks ticking,
electrons orbiting) in one frame will appear to run slower in
when measure from the other frame. 

Time dilation only has any meaning relative to clocks that
are stationary in a reference system you are moving towards or away from.
In atoms, while electrons move AROUND the atom at nearly
light speed, they move AWAY from the nucleus, on average, with zero
velocity (on average, the electron in a hydrogen atom will
be found at the same Bohr radius). It is for this reason that
until one collection of matter starts moving away from another,
no time dilation effects between the two collections are present. 

An aside: 
While the above result between the two atom A/atom B systems is true,
and I think resolves the main point of your question, the situation in the
electron-nucleus system of a single atom is more complicated than I
might have implied.
  Due to the speed of the electrons, there are relativistic effects to be 
considered when setting up equations for the electronic wavefunction 
(the function that will tell you the probability of finding an electron 
at a certain location); this was first done successfully in the 30's by Dirac, 
who replaced Shroedinger's Equation with one that took into account 
relativistic effects of the electrons (Mathematically, this means he 
made the Hamiltonian  "Invariant under Lorentz transformations").  
  But this change only affected the final form of the wavefunctions 
(it also leads to a natural meaning for the spin of an electron), which
had to now satisfy a different equation and use different coordinates. 

The result is still true that in general, when you move an atom, the 
electrons move along with it and in a time-averaged sense are "stationary"
relative to the nucleus, and hence you can treat matter as macroscopic 
continua for the purposes of time dilation and other Lorentz transformation
effects such as length contraction. 

I hope this helps answer your question.


Extropically,

Wade Cherrington

I'm not disagreeing with you about the cost of the mission and the
undesirability of tax funding, nor about the scientific gains. Nevertheless
I *am* still impressed and inspired. I try not to let my political views
get in the way of my appreciation for a magnificent triumph of human
intelligence over the forces of nature.

If you don't understand my response, please read Ayn Rand's classic essay
on Apollo and Dionysus (in The New Left).

Onward!

I received similiar indications when I spoke with a public
relations person at SETI today. I was told SETI was going to 
place information to the effect that the entire affair appeared to
be a hoax sometime today. The information I found on the subject
lends weight to the "hoax" probability:

http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Hall/7193/latest.html\\

However, SETI has yet to make any announcement on their website
nor has any other group emerged to debunk the claim. Strangely,
the BBC has not issued any follow-up on the story either.

I'm sorry, but i don't see any purpose to this exercise.  Trying to carry

  IAN: There is (1) an individual, like Crusoe, and 
  (2) a political individual, which is an individual 
  in a society, i.e., a "social individual." The term
  "political" refers to identity attributes of the 
  individual that are derived from social relations.

  The dual states of the individual cited "quench" 
  the purported  contradiction: (1) is the absolute 
  individual Crusoe, and  (2) is the relational, and
  thereby political, individual. Both are individuals.

  That there are social relations in a market society
  and a set of rules of conduct, which thereby define 
  the political, does not negate a set of rules that 
  define and defend private property and liberty.

  So the "social individual" is not a contradiction,
  neither is the individual as the basic social unit,
  and as such, the individual as basic political unit.

  IAN: Well, of nonzero positive integers, 
  1 is the basic unit, and in the same way
  it would appear that 1 person is the basic
  social unit. Of course, I guess we could go
  so far as to say that it's one cell or atom.

  perhaps soon to be "transhumanized atoms."

There are several, but almost all are some version or another of

so you needn't worry about having to go out and find it. :)

Not sure why you think I missed that distinction... I never said that being
a monopoly was illegal.

However, the distinction is a fine one. Microsoft *are*, in effect, being
prosecuted for being a monopoly. Their practices are no different from
others in the industry. They are dragged into the courts simply because
they are "too big" and so, apparently, at some point these common practices
(bundling, offering incentives to carry your product, etc.) became illegal.
There's no clear legal boundary to tell you when your company becomes too
big and must tie its own hands in competing. So much for the rule of law.

I do read the sarcasm in this posting but wil answer part of it anyway.

Why should we want birth control when people and intelligence is the biggest
natural resource there is?

What we want is better education and more people.

A lot of what we do seems wasted, and I to believe that space flight is not
the most important item on the agenda these days.

Still I do think that there wouldn't be many Transhumans and extropians
today if it wasn't for the space programs. It is probably a very important
step in the memetic evolution of Transhumans.

And so what if it is bloated pr. events. Isn't this what we need too?

Besides it isn't my tax money being used for once ;-)

Hello there. I'm in Sydney. Where are you? I'm a newcomer to extropian
ideas. I found it through libertarian links and am familiar with the
libertarian/legal polycentrism aspect. With the rest, I am still exploring
though I have always found the hard AI arguments  and the Richard
Dawkins-type arguments which underlie some extropian ideas very convincing.
My intepretation of extropian political ideas would be an emphasis on legal
polycentrism, individualism and respect for science and rationality. Some
very Objectivist memes there. If this is what you have in mind, I'd be happy
to see an extropian party having an educative influence on Australians.

This is not quite correct. Virtually all GUIs make use of X Window
facilties, but they are not X Window. Most widespread are
http://www.kde.org and http://www.gnome.org . Despite that KDE
currently offers more features, Gnome's concept is imo more powerful
(apps not limited to just C++) and proven (it's based on the same 
toolkit as The Gimp), and it does not suffer from legal problems 
due to TrollTechs proprietary (despite available as source, you 
are not allowed to modify it) Qt library as KDE does.

Personally I use FVWM, and, occasionally, KDE. I'll switch over to
Gnome once its beyond beta.

I use FVWM as well.  While all of the information you mention is
certainly true, I am not certain how it invalidates what I said... :)

Its quite a while before EXTRO 4 happens and I'd rather have this
discussion now rather than the months leading up to the conference. 
This isn't the forum to get too detailed about security, except that
I'd like to know that at least the issue will be addressed. Of the
many lurkers on this list, I often wonder how many are hate motivated.
 Are there any of those "voluntary human extinction" types with Ted
Kazenski tendencies?   I expect Transhumanism to be getting pretty
close to critical mass in popularity in a year or two.  We may not be
serious threats to them now, but it is inevitable that such will be
the case in the near future.

I'm not involved with organizing the event, so I can only recommend
that we all keep a close eye on unknown individuals leaving back packs
or bags unattended.  And maybe those with concealed weapons licenses
should contact event organizers and volunteer to carry their g** word.
 I look forward to a safe EXTRO 4 knowing how alert we _can_ be.

To bad, I like the tall sexy female mutant.  I think she was able to use her
intelligence to amuse herself.  She shaped her own personality, and played with it
like a toy.

We wouldn't make this moral calculation.  But the governments of China and India
would.

Politics is interhuman relations, just as TCP/IP is a protocol by which means
individual computers communicate. A computer by itself has no need of TCP/IP,
just as an individual hermit (RObinson Crusoe) has no need of politics. When one
individual meets another, and they interact on an ongoing basis, a protocol to
exchange data is needed. This is politics. The difference between socialism and
libertarianism is like the difference between the network concepts of
server/client versus distributed networking. A Mainframe is like a Socialist
State, and the people are mere terminals, while a Libertarian Network is all PC's
interconnected and sharing data on an equal basis.

Political, referring to the primary residence of rights. Socialism denies the
concept of Natural Law, and states, as Mao said,"Justice comes out of the
barrel of a gun". This is known as the Force Doctrine. Since a majority can
always overpower an equally equipped minority, majority rule as the source of
all rights is merely a voice vote in what would otherwise be civil war.
Socialism says that since the State, as the representative of the majority,
can impose its will on all, it is the source of all rights. Libertarians state
that since all rights are Natural, i.e. humans as individuals posess them  as
a result of either evolution or 'creation' by  a creator, and the State only
posesses authority as delegated by the individual, that the tyranny of the
majority is morally wrong. Laws should not exist to restrict the rights of the
individual any further than to prevent infringment or harm to the rights of
another individual. Force should only be used in the defense of the rights of
the individual.

Y2K  Solution!
8  Pine  Circle  Dr., Silicon  Valley, Calif.

OTC  Company  "TCFG"  21 st. Century  Frontier  Group  has
through  several  members  of  their  administrative  research
department  leaked  vital  information  about  their  companies  
efforts.

Everyone  was  tight  lipped  and  interviews  were  refused,
and  through  un-named  sources  we  have  learned  that  the  
technology  and  software  solution  are  in  the  process  of  
being  patented!

In over  1640  trials, using  various  data  systems  the  use  
of  the  new  technology  and  software  solved  the  Y2K
problem  100%  of  the  time. 

This  small  publicly  traded  company  "TCFG"  which  is  just
3  years  old  is  through  various  sources  now  negotiating
with  the  "Big  Boys"!

"TCFG"  the  letters  to  look  for.....

Following up on the silicon brain story posted earlier, I came across another
interesting article in the EEtimes

http://www.eetimes.com/story/OEG19981026S0015

This one is about a Raytheon project to build an artificial soldier topped off with
the Cog head from MIT. The neural net system proposed is of a type that is new to
me, in that it assumes that the information passed among neurons comes as a result
of the temporal synchrony among signals. Anybody else come across that theory?

 Building an autonomous, heavily armed soldier strikes me as a risky way to try out
AI theory. A fixed place ABM system is one thing, but a general purpose killer
robot seems like asking for trouble. If programming "do not harm humans" has some
challenges, "kill all humans except for the friendly ones" seems fraught with
peril. Reminds me of an old SF tale, I think called "I made you", in which a dying
engineer is pinned down by the robot sentinel he built.

 I'd vote for keeping these guys immobile unless you are *really* sure of your IFF
programming.

Good letters to watch out for if you're a scammer trying to drive up prices on 
penny stocks with so called "research."

When the stock jumps from 10 cents to 4 bucks and you pocket a few hundred 
thousand and leave the country, I think the US government is going to be doing 
some looking, and it ain't gunna be at a stock ticker.

 Lots of Bernard Hugheses, but only one with my web domain. Like many people here,
I usually put my domain name in my sig, which says a lot about me. I'm emotionally
an optimist, so I am hopeful my views won't make me a target. But intellectually,
I am more pessimistic. I recall how often quite "reasonable" people have gone into
"kill the weirdoes" mode over what seem to me strange but harmless lifestyle
choices. Not to mention some of the choices advocated here which would really
change the world.

 Despite my pessimism, I don't want to put much energy into covering my rear.
Moving forward is more attractive.

I have yet to see a Window Manager that does not use X for Linux.
However, there is a project to create one called Berlin
(www.debian.org/berlin)  Personally, I use a WM called Afterstep(loosely
based on FVWM2) with has a very stylish look reminiscent of NeXT.  I plan
to switch to WindowMaker soon, and then Berlin when it is usable.
Enlightenment looks great, but apparently it is slow on the average
machine.

I recommend Linux to anyone who is frustrated with Window's crashing.  I
have a dual-boot system... my Windows crashes daily, my Linux has not
crashed once since I installed it a year ago; however, I do not recommend
Linux for anyone that wants to be able to point and click to do
everything.  Linux is not quite there yet, but it will be within the next
couple years.

For some nice screeshots of what your Linux GUI could look like, check out

The motivation for robot soldiers does not come from ground commanders, but from bean
counters and politicians. Any ground commander knows that a) you don't own any peice of
land until you stick an 18 year old kid with a rifle on top of it, b) the worst threat
to a free democracy is a professional army at the beck and call of the leadership with
no personal stake in maintaining civil liberties. Such 'Robocop' concepts are flawed
from basic principles, and should be stomped out wherever some idiot gets a hair up his
butt to build one, unless the AI is granted citizenship and recognized as 'human
equivalent' form the start (not bloody likely). Anything less is a prescription for
tyrrany.

I certainly understand dualism. It's what propaganda thrives on. No one in the
media would dare criticize a brave 'American hero's space mission' even if that
mission has wasteful and immoral objectives. Deep Space1 is an example of real
science and humanitarian objectives. We spend still way too much on our former
Alzheim-ic president Regan's Star Wars idea. The military still controls space
and the media
so of course John Glenn returning to space is going to be covered with the
fervor of the return of Jesus Christ....
It's time to liberate ourselves from misplaced patriotism...

Even this is a slight oversimplification, at least as it was
explained to me. I'm working on getting Linux up on my
hardware, and I have Linux friends at work. My friends
claim that Gnome is a desktop manager, which works in conjunction
with a window manager (the truly sexy example of which is enlightenment)
which in turn uses the X window primitives. However, if you
just go out an load up Redhat 5.1, you'll be running FVWM, which
works just fine and which you can think of as your window manager/GUI/
desktop/whatever.

Why is Linux of interest on this list? Well, I see it as an
early indication that the traditional, antiquated views of
"intellectual property" that we keep desperatly trying to
apply to software are in fact becoming rapidly obsolete.
This has implications for the economics of nanotechnology,
as we all know. However, the nitty-gritty details of Linux
are best  discussed elsewhere. If you like this sort of

Actually, NEC's SX-5 series can peak at 4 Tflops. SGI's 
Mountain Blue, to be powered up in November at LANL, is
allegedly going to be able to peak at 4 Tflops also. IBM
is building a 10 Tflop machine machine for the DOE to come
online in mid-2000. Additionally, IBM is working on a 
100 Tflop beast to operate at Livermore and simulate H-bomb
detonations. That machine is expected to power up around 2004.

As an aside, a computer engineer stated a petaflop machine
could be built today. The only problem is it would cost
US$ 55 x 10^9 to build.

For some reason, despite my previous wails, Mike keeps misquoting this
real-politik observation (which is congenial, I'd have thought, to
Libertarians and gun-fanciers).  Mousy Dung *actually* said:

`POLITICAL POWER comes from the barrel of a gun' 

- that is, however true, noble and virtuous your political ideas, if you
don't have the firepower to back them up you're smoke in the breeze.  A
moment's checking on the Web would confirm this quote.  Cf., e.g.,

Latest post on the BBC site

http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_203000/203133.stm

 sez:

< At first the part-time astronomer who discovered the signals
             would not reveal his identity. However he has since been
             named as Paul Dore of Siemens Plessey Systems in the UK. 

             He has been using a small radio telescope belonging to his
             firm to scan the sky for intelligent signals. 

             On October 22 and on the following night, he reported
             detecting signals from the EQ Pegasi star system which is 22
             light years away. 

             The signals were not the type that occurs naturally. The data
             has been distributed to several astronomers and
             observatories. 

             However astronomers at the Jodrell Bank Observatory in
             England say it is all a case of mistaken identity. Astronomer
             Ian Morrison told BBC News Online: "I think he has detected
             signals from a satellite." >

Other evidence more strongly suggests either that Dore's story changes when
challenged, or (remote possibility) some hasty disinformation moves.

 This actually happened to me! My ancestors left their nice, sunny, verdant locale.

They moved northward to hang around glaciers and huddle in snow caves without
even consulting me. Now my skin is so damn sensitive I can't spend more than a
few minutes in ordinary sunlight without damaging it, let alone swing through
trees.
They didn't even leave me a note- no inscription on a rock, no phone call to say
"I'm sorry", nothing.

  I recieved an inquiry about treating breast cancer. I thought others
might be interested in my reply, which I reproduce below:
       ______________________________________________________

 If you want to possibly buy a little time with dietary treatments I can
recommend the consumption of large quantities of tomato and possibly
carrot products. Giving lycopene (the red pigment in tomatoes) to mice
that tend to develop breast cancer slows down the development of this
disease by about 2 months. (Anticancer Research 15: 1173-1178 1995) While
tomatoes are associated with reductions in cancer risk with a variety of
cancers, the data linking to breast cancer is less solid, possibly because
few people are willing to consume the large quanities of tomato products
needed to achieve an effect in this tissue. 
  Human epidemiological data does support an anti-breast cancer effect of
high consumption of carrots - about a 20% reduction in risk. (Epidemiology
9: 338-341 1998)
  Again I emphasize that only consumption of large quantities of tomato
and carrot products can be expected to exert any significant effect on
late stage malignant breast cancer - say 2 liters of tomato juice and
carrot juice per day. Boiling the tomato juice with a little olive
oil in it would greatly increase the absorption of lycopene, so this is
what I recommend. The bottom line is that amounts of these foods which can
be expected to significantly affect matters will result in a change in
skin coloration. This is harmless.
  As a additional adjunctive intervention a vitamin E supplement might be
tried. This does not affect cancer itself, and it greatly increased the
effectiveness of lycopene as an anti-cancer agent in a recent test.
(Biochem Biophys Res Commun 250(3): 582-585 Sept 29,1998) This is so new
that the local university library does not yet have in this issue of the
journal. I spotted this on medline.
  Good luck.

Look at:

Apparently they found that the adult human brain can regenerate cells,
despite what was previously thought.

fact know little about politics and less about philosophy. It always amazes me
when people look to the dictionary as the ultimate authority in settling deep
questions. In general we don't we look in a dictionary to learn how to

how to write their book, sometimes they get it wrong and usually it's circular.

In a recent post to a private mail list group, one of my oldest friends and
intellectual mentors equated the concept of transhumanism (that I have
discussed with this group around many a campfire now) with the term "inhuman".
An exchange of letters has followed.  This is my most recent volley in that
discourse:

Picking up the cudgels this morning, I see that in a message dated 98-10-30
11:05:21 EST, Frank writes:

> My dear human friend Greg,
>  	I want to be very specific in my challenge. 

Well, to be precise, I believe it was me who challenged you, Frank, to
explicate and justify your equation of "transhuman" with "inhuman".  This is
more than just a debating point of order, but rather goes to who has the
burden of persuasion in this matter.  In response to this question, let me for
a moment put words into your mouth, Frank: You would respond (I would guess)
by saying that of course I do, since I propose a change to the status quo in
my concept of a transformation of man into, ultimately, post-man.  I would
disagree (not surprisingly).  I do not believe that this change marks some
"unnatural" departure from the normal order of the universe but, as I have
written before, instead is simply the natural next progression of the
evolutionary process that has given rise to what we are now.  

I might see the question differently if I were sure that there will be an
INSTANTANEOUS transformation, a true "singularity" in the Vingean sense, but I
am not so sure that will happen.  It is, I believe, a matter of perspective as
to time.  For those who will tread the path of techno-transformation, there
will likely NOT be an instantaneous or near-instantaneous transformation.  For
those who choose to not make radical changes to their nature, there may SEEM
to be a near-instantaneous change.

But I digress.  I daresay that most of humanity WILL place the burden of
persuasion on the advocates of transformation, so let us move on.

> Even if we stipulate, 
> temporarily for the sake of this discussion, that the singularity is
possible,

I see that you do see the importance of the time scale, Frank.  Let us imagine
a dialogue:

Greg:	So, Frank, what if the process of transformation of a human into a post-
human takes place over, say one thousand generations -- a period of perhaps
ten to twenty thousand years?  Would your reservations regarding and
opposition to such changes be less in such a case?

Frank: Yes.  With more time to adjust, we would . . .

Greg: Let me interrupt momentarily for the sake of argument . . .

Frank: Typical.  So impatient.

Greg:	How about one hundred generations; a period of two or three thousand
years?  Would your objections then be less than they are now, but more than if
we took longer?

Frank: Yes, I'd say that's fair.

Greg:	So, Madam, we have established that you are a whore, and we are simply
haggling over the price, no?

Frank: Anything for a laugh.

But the point is important, I continue.  I believe that you are reasonable
enough, Frank, that you will not take the extreme position that augmentation
-- even radical augmentation -- is not in and of itself a bad thing, but
rather that you will maintain that "we" are simply not morally ready for such
enhanced power.  And of course (as you make clear below), the question comes
down to who "we" are, who will make such choices.

Let me clarify: Neither I nor any other transhumanist proposes to force any
change on any person.  Whether it be the growing number of "Euro-(and
interestingly, "Australio-") transhumanists" with their decidedly more
communitarian tendencies, or the (ironically) more "traditional", libertarian,
extropian American band of original transhumanists, no serious thinker
proposes mandatory transformation of any particular person's "human nature".
(Setting aside -- for the time being only -- the question of genetically
heritable augmentation.)  So, the issue is, are the people who will choose to
transform themselves more fundamentally than is already possible morally
capable of making the change in such a way that the world is a better, rather
than a worse place for everyone to live in?

>  why is there the least reason to think that the moral philosophizing that 
> you engage in will in any way prevent a transhuman future from resembling
our 
> human past, in which differences in wealth and power have, with dreary

Well, here we get to your fear, Frank's: A class of oppressive posthuman
overlords.  As you close your message:

>  	The gods are beautiful, powerful, magnificent--but they are not good.
>  Theomachus.

Before I go on, let me say that while I am a great believer in tapping the
inherited wisdom of human culture, I am by no means sure that the epigram of a
man who lived in a culture that could not invent the offset crank should be a
guide to our behavior as we consider the wisdom of altering our genomes or
augmenting our minds with implanted computational prostheses.

But let me first cast a slightly different light on the point you make.  We
are talking about power conveyed by technology.  And I see that power conveyed
by technology has been a little different from power conveyed by other means
(such as power conveyed by coercively imposed social orders).  Again, you say
that I must distinguish the future for which I work from

> our 
> human past, in which differences in wealth and power have, with dreary 
> regularity, led to oppression

Let me point to some examples of technologies that have, at least, been
neutral in terms of "oppression".  As we sit here today -- in 1998 -- can we
say that the following technological developments have lead ONLY to
oppression?

-- writing, the printing press, the telegraph, the telephone, radio,
television and the Internet;
-- the train, the automobile, the airplane, the rocket and the spaceplane;
-- fire;
-- eyeglasses, antibiotics and antiseptic surgery

In fact, some of these -- the Internet, eyeglasses, antibiotics -- seem to me
to have NEVER been used for oppressive purposes.  Some, like fire, radio and
the airplane and automobile (when equipped with weapons), have been used for
both oppressive and liberative purposes.

Now, let us blend the light from these two different perspectives: "power" and
"technology".  If, as you wish to do, Frank, we can only be guided by history,
let us ask what has distinguished the different KINDS of power that have grown
from the different types and uses of technology.  The answer seems clear: The
less expensive a technology has been and the more widely distributed have been
its effects -- both good and bad, the less "oppressive" has been the power it
conveys.  

An automobile vastly augments the individual human's power in a basic, animal
sense.  With my car, I can move an order of magnitude faster than the speed to
which "nature" has limited me.  But this power is readily available to
essentially every member of the society in which I live.  Of course, one can
say that I am oppressed by the automobile, because it has transformed my
society into one where I am "coerced" into buying an automobile in order to
participate fully in the fruits offered by my country's social life.  Or we
can say that we automobile owners "oppress" people who live in societies where
automobile ownership is less evenly distributed.  It is, we can see, a matter
of perspective.  Automobiles may seem oppressive to the Amish, or to a
Peruvian peasant.  But they are a liberating technology -- in a very real
sense of personal power -- to both me and my yard man, even though I am, in a
measure of money only, an order of magnitude more wealthy than my yard man.

What a series of great leaps!  With all due respect, Frank, this sounds like
the sort of grandiose and incautious rhetorical hyperbole for which you have
been seeking an indicting of me for the better part of these last three
decades.  Let us take a deep breath and try to make some sense of what amounts
to a rush from a catalogue of historical discontinuities, upheavals and
excesses, through a stab at "effete moral philosophy" to the oppression of
humanity by, presumably, a handful of transhuman demi-gods.

And we can start with moral philosophy.  Here, let us distinguish prescription
from description.  I agree that admonition is a tool of extremely limited
power.  Christian preachers have railed against various flavors of immorality
for two thousand years, yet an avowedly christian president gets a hummer from
his emotionally unstable aide, something his religious ayatollahs explicitly
condemn. 

I return to the point I make above: See how people actually make use of
technological power.  It depends on how widespread and evenly distributed it
is.  Prohibit it, and only the wealthy and/or daring will have it.  Encourage
it -- or at least allow it to grow at its own pace -- and many MAY have it.
All, of course, depending on the price.  If only a few can afford to or are
allowed to have some greatly augmented power, one may find oppression.  Allow
people to adopt it at their own pace, as widely as they feel comfortable so
changing, and we have less potential for oppression.  The more tightly you
restrict this power, the more certain you are to put it into the hands of only
a few -- and those few ones who disdain your restrictions.

It seems like THE point.

You point to "brutality, greed, and oppression"; I point to progress.  The
world IS a better place now, in the aftermath of the Enlightenment, with its
inseparable admixture of science, technology and social openness (whether
political -- as in democratic institutions -- or economic -- as in the
liberation of the market of human enterprise).

You are suspicious of "effete moral philosophy".  So am I.  I am suspicious of
those who would proscribe and prescribe.  I see the last 300 years as a period
when a loosening of control by those who think they know best has resulted in
a real improvement in the human condition.  I see humanity redeemed by itself,
not by priests or nobles or vanguards of this or that segment of humanity.  I
see people defeating oppression by consensual collective action without the
assistance of their "betters".

Let me assume that you, too, are an Enlightenment man, Frank.  As such, answer
this question: Which is better: People empowered, or people held to some ideal
template?

But leaving aside such broad, rhetorical questions to which only one sane
answer is possible, let us return to the crux of your question:

>  	What would prevent transhumans from regarding humanity as subrational 
> creatures deserving of any major protections or inhibitions of their own 
> transhuman desires? 

I ask, what would motivate them to do such a thing?  Are we inherently cruel
to our parents? Let's do a vocabulary lesson.  As much as I normally hate
turning to dictionaries as sources of authority, let's see how Merriam-Webster
defines some of the terms upon which your original statement was based:

	human [2] (noun)
	First appeared circa 1533
	 : a bipedal primate mammal (Homo sapiens) : 
        MAN; broadly : any living or extinct member of 
        the family (Hominidae) to which the primate belongs

Well, hopefully you will not be a chauvinist about this, Frank, and place some
moral value in the mere physical form of a homo sapiens.  After all, is an
amputee any the less "human" because she lacks one of the two legs upon which
this definition is based?  No.  The "human" to which you refer is really, I
think:

	hu*mane (adjective)
	[Middle English humain]
	First appeared circa 1500
	 1 : marked by compassion, sympathy, 
           or consideration for humans or animals
	 2 : characterized by or tending to broad 
           humanistic culture : HUMANISTIC <~ studies>

It is probably the former of these that you really mean when you speak of
"humanity", I will guess.  And then, there is the Frankenstein word:

	in*hu*man (adjective)
	[Middle English inhumayne, from Middle French & Latin; 
      Middle French inhumain, from Latin inhumanus, 
      from in- + humanus human]
	First appeared 15th Century
	 1 a : lacking pity, kindness, or mercy : SAVAGE <an ~ tyrant>
 	  b : COLD, IMPERSONAL <his usual quiet, 
           almost ~ courtesy --F. Tennyson Jesse>
 	  c : not worthy of or conforming to the needs 
          of human beings <~ living conditions>
 	2 : of or suggesting a nonhuman class of beings

The language here suggests that the concern you have is for compassion on the
one hand and a lack of it on the other.  

What will characterize the post-humans I envisage?  Two things: Greater mental
abilities and greater physical power.  (I assume that the technicalities are
understood here, at least in their basic outlines.)  

And here lies the real question: Is there any reason to assume that smarter
people are LESS compassionate than, for want of a better word, "dumber"
people?  No.  In fact, I believe that the evidence of our everyday experience
indicates just the opposite, as knowledge enhances empathy: The more people
learn of gorillas, the more likely they are to empathize with them.  On
average, people who see pictures of Auschwitz are less likely to engage in
atrocities.  I challenge you, Frank to an accounting of this phenomenon.  I
think you will run out of examples of knowledge and comprehension leading to
cruelty before I run out of contrary examples.

Is greater raw power congruent, to use your term, with less compassion?  I
admit that, in the abstract, this is a more problematic question.  We are
creatures of a mixed nature.  We are primates, with a strong sense of social
hierarchy imposed by force.  But we are also capable of something more, as all
of the world around you indicates: In societies characterized by openness and
respect for liberty, we see overwhelming evidence that we can overcome our
primitive nature.  Do we become perfect egalitarians in such circumstances?
No.  That is the impractical dream of effete moral philosophers.  But do we
consensually submit to regimes of limitations on our personal power, so that
we can express the compassion that comes with greater knowledge?  The history
of the last 300 years indicates that we do.  The very open societies that make
it possible to create the science that leads to the technology of
transhumanity are themselves the incubators of compassion.

Does this conclusion sound Panglossian to you, Frank?  No doubt it does.  What
if Hitler had had these powers?  What if Stalin?  But for accidents of
history, you may argue, we would all be the permanent thralls of transhuman
Nazis, you may argue.  I do not think it is an accident of history that it is
the most open society ever known that is developing this technology.  Closed
societies simply could not have created the OPEN INFORMATION STRUCTURE upon
which it is premised.  It would have taken many thousands of years -- if ever
-- for the kind of "science" practiced by totalitarians to create what we have
created in three short generations since we contained (and now have largely
vanquished) those monsters.  Long before Nazi scientists would have solved the
riddle of the human genome, that society would have crumbled into savagery.
Long before Stalinist mathematicians would have developed supercomputers,
communist totalitarianism DID crumble into savagery.

Here I return to the quip I made some time ago: "We are all Marxists now"
(after Nixon, who is reputed to have once said, "we are all Keynesians now").
In this I mean that we have all learned that social structure is inextricably
intertwined with technology in a symbiotic, feedback relationship.  Particular
technologies give rise to particular social structures and visa versa.  (It is
the "visa versa" in which I and other modern observers depart from Marx.)
Real science (as opposed to received recipes for crafts) is a FUNCTION of an
open society and open societies are a FUNCTION of science.  By definition, the
science and technology (and the two cannot really be distinguished in this
time) of transhumanism will be the hardest problems of natural understanding
and control humanity will ever undertake -- for having mastered them, they
will transcend "humanity" in the sense of a physical description of homo
sapiens and her limitations.

So here is the paradoxical nut of the problem, Frank: Only openness makes
techno-transcendence possible and the only tonic for oppression is openness.
If you allow us to come to the brink, and then throttle the process with
coercively imposed restrictions, you have prescribed perhaps the ONE formula
for creating the very monsters you fear.  And we are on the brink, have no
doubt whatsoever.

 Good news/bad news I guess. Good news if we can regenerate some of our
failing brain cells (Sign me up). But bad news if new cell generation is
essential to brain function. Makes uploading to an electronic version
trickier. Interesting that the cell regeneration was found in an area
thought to be associated with memory formation.

Ah, but the beauty of future technology is that it can ultimately give
the power of a whole nation, or even a world, to just one person. A Jupiter
Brain is an army of philosophers, soldiers, scientists, artists and workers
all by itself. It is autonomous. If a guy like Hitler can obtain the crucial
technology to upload and expand before anyone else, or at least in the
early stages of transhumanity, he *could* use it to kill/enslave everyone
else without suffering any bad consequences. Those that will have these
technologies first will almost by definition be the rich and powerful
(the leaders of corporations and government agencies etc.) These people
have certainly not been selected for high moral standards, but rather
for ruthlessness, love of power and determination. Natural selection.
Now, this is not a reason to get depressed or something, but rather...
(you know what).

Really?  To the best of my knowledge, the rich and powerful
do not spend a lot of time in laboratories.  I am curious as
to why you think that they would have access.  Any of the 
arguments that you apply to show that they do not need the
rest of humanity applies even more aptly to the scientists
and engineers who *build* the technologies.

Hm.  Do you post from work, Spike?  Some companies

Watching some of the news coverage of the Discovery mission, I was
particularly drawn to the interviews with little schoolkids.  Many of them
expressed an interest in someday going into space themselves, but they also
expressed their feelings about the launch of John Glenn into orbit through a
filter of fear.  It suddenly struck me, many of these children have a first
memory of the space program that involved seeing a teacher get blown to
bits.  Our generation, most of us have positive early memories of seeing
exciting new achievements in space, the overcoming of danger, brave men and
women facing new frontiers.  My own first recorded memory is one of standing
in front of the television, watching the first steps on the moon.  

I would be curious to know whether anyone sees little trickortreaters
dressed as astronauts this year.  On halloween, children dress as their
fantasies, or as their fears.  I haven't seen robots or astronauts in many
years.

Wishing you a happy and treat-laden eve,

Kathryn Aegis

	(Sorry, Alejandro. I was using my fathers header by proxy and
forgot to remove his name from it, so it was not Brian Clancy, rather Steve
Clancy, sorry.)
	Well, I feel that there is a need for some form of extropian
political representation in Australia. I assume that you are resident in
Australia, so I don't need to remind you of the political spectre of
Pauline Hanson and her rather illogical political party.
	It has been stated in previous list postings that one way to get
around the laws that inhibit extropian principals and enterprises, like
genetic and body alteration, would be to simple break the law. While this
is an admirable thing to consider, risking one's self for one's beliefs, it
is quite difficult to do genetic study and scientific tasks while locked
behind bars for 20 years to life.
	This is why we need extropian principles in our political way of
life, if nothing, to counter the somewhat illogical rantings of our present
system.
	Thanks, Steve C.

They have their security men to keep an eye on the scientists,
this goes especially for government research and big companies,
the two most likely sources of upload/AI technology. The guys
that pay for the research will no doubt make sure to check how 
their money is being spent.

Yes, but few of them have the "big picture" or the attitude to use
the technology for themselves. The guys that created the first 
A-Bomb were only allowed to "play" with it under strict government
supervision, and the same will most likely be the case here. Of
course, it could be that a group of scientists would keep the tech
for themselves and become gods, but it's not very likely. Wrong
mentality; they'll just meekly hand over the tools for godhood to
their masters.

But the security people must know enough about the potential
to decide if the scientists are violating their contract or
whatever.  This only creates yet *another* layer of people
between the "rich and powerful" and the technology.

It would have basically been impossible for an engineer or small
group of them to build more A-bombs in secret.  A-bombs do not
manufacture more.

I don't know that scientists are any more likely to meekly
hand over anything than other people...

Sure, I know a guy nicknamed "TD".  Although he's not exactly a friend, he is
the kind of guy who'd read Extropians.  He's the Dean of Metaphysics at ol'
IOU, Illuminatus University.  Not hard to recognize; horns, tail, red skin. 
Pretty affable guy, actually, unless someone starts waving a cross around.  I
believe "TD" stands for "The Devil".
