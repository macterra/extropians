The current New Scientist has a feature on Roton available at
<http://www.newscientist.com/ns/980801/features.html>.  Briefly,
a Roton craft's engine spins on ascent, saving the weight of fuel
pumps, and a helicopter like propeller opens during descent to help
accomplish a soft landing.  These and other improvements could
supposedly provide an eighty percent reduction in cost/kg relative
to conventional rockets.

I believe someone mentioned the Roton on this list a year or two
ago.  Rotary Rocket <http://www.rotaryrocket.com/> seems to have
made financial, political and technological progress since then.
They have raised $17 million so far, expect to raise $30 million
more this year, NASA administrator Daniel Goldin likes them, and
they supposedly could do flight testing next March.

Crit is great, but it times out easily on low bandwidth/high latency

instead of going via http://crit.org , which can easily be overwhelmed by sudden

I have been thinking about recent postings relating to music--which music
enhances mental processes, which music might be considered 'extropian',
technical processes for predicting what sort of music an individual might
want...and I agree that any listing of 'extropian' music would have to
include the tastes of many individuals.  I myself would have to nominate
punk and post-punk for inclusion, that explosion of intelligent rage that
burst across the Atlantic to find homes in squalid little clubs in various
cities.  ('squalid' meaning you had to carry a baseball bat to go downstairs
to the bathroom...)  If you avoided the skinheads, you could find a
collection of hypersmart freaks who found little value in the limitations of
mainstream culture, who valued 'interesting' over 'pretty'.  The aethestic
survives today in industrial, grunge, hardcore techno, cyberpunk literature
and the Doc Martens in Nieman Marcus. 

If someone were actually writing a program to produce the 'perfect' music, I
would have to tell that person:  don't give me what I want, don't play the
notes I expect to hear--give me something to blow away the flabbier neurons,
knife-edged to cut away complacency, trash my assumptions and leave me
floundering in the deep end of the pool....

Sin,

Title
  Hydroxycitrate causes
  altered pyruvate metabolism by tumorigenic cells.
Source
  Biochemistry & Molecular Biology International.  40(5):1047-56, 1996 Nov.
Abstract
  Metabolic fates of pyruvate (CO2, lactate, citrate) in normal and neoplastic
  cells have been assessed. Pyruvate consumption by tumour cells falls (by
  72-85%) and mean percentage oxidation rises from 75% to 91% with
  hydroxycitrate. Ratios of rates of oxidation of
  (3-(14)C-pyruvate) : (1-(14)C-pyruvate), indicating CO2 produced from TCA
  cycle activity : that from PDH activity, are higher for tumorigenic
  (0.17-0.24) than for non-tumorigenic (0.005-0.04) cells and increase
  (0.27-0.65 and 0.13-0.29, respectively) with hydroxycitrate.
  Although maximal ATP-citrate lyase activities do not correlate with
  malignancy, citrate may be a major fate of glutaminolytic pyruvate in tumour
  cells. Citrate accounts for 14-37% of consumed glutamine compared with 11-13%
  being recovered as CO2. By contrast, approximately 100% of glycolytic
  pyruvate is converted to lactate.

Title
  Elevated intakes of
  supplemental chromium improve glucose and insulin variables
  in individuals with type 2 diabetes.
Source
  Diabetes.  46(11):1786-91, 1997 Nov.
Abstract
  Chromium is an essential nutrient involved in normal carbohydrate and lipid
  metabolism. The chromium requirement is postulated to increase with increased
  glucose intolerance and diabetes. The objective of this study was to test the
  hypothesis that the elevated intake of
  supplemental chromium is involved in the control of type 2
  diabetes. Individuals being treated for type 2 diabetes (180 men and women)
  were divided randomly into three groups and supplemented with: 1) placebo, 2)
  1.92 micromol (100 microg) Cr as chromium picolinate two times per day, or 3)
  9.6 micromol (500 microg) Cr two times per day. Subjects continued to take
  their normal medications and were instructed not to change their normal
  eating and living habits. HbA1c values improved significantly after 2 months
  in the group receiving 19.2 pmol (1,000 microg) Cr per day and was lower in
  both chromium groups after 4 months (placebo, 8.5 +/- 0.2%; 3.85 micromol Cr,
  7.5 +/- 0.2%; 19.2 micromol Cr, 6.6 +/- 0.1%). Fasting glucose was lower in
  the 19.2-micromol group after 2 and 4 months (4-month values: placebo, 8.8
  +/- 0.3 mmol/l; 19.2 micromol Cr, 7.1 +/- 0.2 mmol/l). Two-hour glucose
  values were also significantly lower for the subjects consuming 19.2 micromol
  supplemental Cr after both 2 and 4 months (4-month values:
  placebo, 12.3 +/- 0.4 mmo/l; 19.2 micromol Cr, 10.5 +/- 0.2 mmol/l). Fasting
  and 2-h insulin values decreased significantly in both groups receiving
  supplemental chromium after 2 and 4 months. Plasma total
  cholesterol also decreased after 4 months in the subjects receiving 19.2
  micromol/day Cr. These data demonstrate that supplemental
  chromium had significant beneficial effects on HbA1c, glucose, insulin, and
  cholesterol variables in subjects with type 2 diabetes. The beneficial
  effects of chromium in individuals with diabetes were observed at levels
  higher than the upper limit of the Estimated Safe and Adequate Daily Dietary
  Intake.

Title
  Inhibition of human breast cancer cell proliferation and delay of mammary
  tumorigenesis by flavonoids and citrus juices.
Source
  Nutrition & Cancer.  26(2):167-81, 1996.
Abstract
  Two citrus flavonoids, hesperetin and naringenin, found in oranges and
  grapefruit, respectively, and four noncitrus flavonoids, baicalein, galangin,
  genistein, and quercetin, were tested singly and in one-to-one combinations
  for their effects on proliferation and growth of a human breast carcinoma
  cell line, MDA-MB-435. The concentration at which cell proliferation was
  inhibited by 50% (IC50), based on incorporation of [3H]thymidine, varied from
  5.9 to 140 micrograms/ml for the single flavonoids, with the most potent
  being baicalein. IC50 values for the one-to-one combinations ranged from 4.7
  micrograms/ml (quercetin + hesperetin, quercetin + naringenin) to 22.5
  micrograms/ml (naringenin + hesperetin). All the flavonoids showed low
  cytotoxicity (> 500 micrograms/ml for 50% cell death). Naringenin is present
  in grapefruit mainly as its glycosylated form, naringin.
  These compounds, as well as grapefruit and orange juice concentrates, were
  tested for their ability to inhibit development of mammary tumors induced by
  7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) in female Sprague-Dawley rats. Two
  experiments were conducted in which groups of 21 rats were fed a semipurified
  diet containing 5% corn oil and were given a 5-mg dose of DMBA
  intragastrically at approximately 50 days of age while in diestrus. One week
  later, individual groups were given double-strength grapefruit juice or
  orange juice or fed naringin or naringenin at levels
  comparable to that provided by the grapefruit juice; in the second
  experiment, the rats were fed a semipurified diet containing 20% corn oil at
  that time. As expected, rats fed the high-fat diet developed more tumors than
  rats fed the low-fat diet, but in both experiments tumor development was
  delayed in the groups given orange juice or fed the
  naringin-supplemented diet compared with the other three
  groups. Although tumor incidence and tumor burden (grams of tumor/rat) were
  somewhat variable in the different groups, rats given orange juice had a
  smaller tumor burden than controls, although they grew better than any of the
  other groups. These experiments provide evidence of anticancer properties of
  orange juice and indicate that citrus flavonoids are effective inhibitors of
  human breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro, especially when paired with
  quercetin, which is widely distributed in other foods.

Yes, particularly since the "governors" have a monopoly on itsuse.

I think this quote has much relevance here:

"Without a global revolution in the sphere of human consciousness,
nothing will change in the sphere of our Being as humans." Address to
the United States Congress, February 1990, Vaclav Havel.

The issuing of "permits" doesn't appear to me to do anything for
this global revolution.

jf, i read your site.  interesting but they failed to deal with a
subcategorythat i am wondering about: those who voluntarily give up all
privacy for some special purpose, such as advancing medical
science, for instance.  im neither poor nor rich, but i have nothing
to hide from anyone, not one thing.  i would post on a website
my every paycheck and purchase, if a group were formed for some
special purpose to do that for some good reason.

for instance, there was an article yesterday in the news that said
there is a direct correlation between personal income and longevity.
this is not hard to understand for the poor: they might neglect medical
care while trying to eke out a living, but the study showed that there
was no point at which the curve leveled out.  if a group of extropians
were to want to learn why, and formed a group that was willing to
reveal eeeeeeverything, well, for that im willing to strip myself
naked, financially.  spike

        That is a very key point from both a musicological as well as
compositional standpoint.  In the case of a listener, music is wholly
subjective: it can be interpreted as "extropic" if that is what the
listener derives from it.  To use myself as an example, I listen to a lot
of music (dubbed as progressive rock) from the late sixties and seventies;
I find that the majority of this progressive-music movement strives toward
a distant goal of perfection.  Musically, the songs are generally lengthy
and are technically quite difficult to play.  Lyrics in this genre usually
have a lot of depth and even (as with Yes' "Starship Troopers" and Mike
Oldfield's _The Songs Of Distant Earth_) base themselves around science
fiction.  However, it is only my enjoyment and interpretation of this genre
that makes me prone to calling the music "extropic."  Many others will
disagree.

        Composition of material is a different matter altogether.  When I
write music, I don't necessarily have an "extropic" objective in mind,
though could it not still be considered as such because it was written by
an extropian?  Referring back to Kathryn's post, I'm not sure if it is even
feasible for any composer to create music that is universally accepted as
being "extropic"...the pure subjectivity of artistic interpretation --not
to mention the complex individuality of each and every listener-- makes
such a task pretty well impossible.  As for enhancing mental processes, all
music does that in some way or another; the key is to find which kind of
music really appeals to each listener: something which can involve a lot of
searching.

I wasn't going to bring up specific bands, but upon thinking about it, it
does surprise me that no one has mentioned the Cocteau Twins in any of these
music discussions.  Their music is electronic based, highly experimental,
appeals to a sophisticated mindset and sometimes involves devices mounted on
humanss.  I remember one appearance by this group, and the lead singer had a
device strapped to her throat with a lever that altered her voice when she
moved the lever, allowing her to make many noises she could not have made
otherwise.  

Sin,

Kathryn Aegis

Hi,

People have said that more than 60% of my life is geared around living life
as an open book via the Internet; - I agree. Our group has good reasons for
doing this with an aim towards memory prosthesis and longivety. We use
Ingrid repgrid software to clarify our plans and actions. Check out last
Saturday's party to see what I mean at:

I agree mostly although I'll say that we do all these things, yet even the
Linux boxes on our network have fallen prey to crackers a couple times.
About the "safest" desktop hosts on our net, in the sense that they are
targeted least, are most resistant to damage, and offer the most secure
anti-viral tools, are (perhaps ironically) the Macs. Of course, none of the
PPC boxes are running *just* MacOS now (they've all got Linux, BeOS, and
various advanced flavors of MacOS on them as well), and we're divided as to
whether this is a good thing or a bad thing, exposure wise, as one can
argue that a multi-OS capable piece of hw has *all* the security failings
of each of its OSes, or conversely that, unlike a single-OS box, since it
exists as a particular OS host for a discontinuous fraction of the time, it
is less attractive and harder to "hit".

Of course, the only computers we've got that have *never* had a successful
viral or trojan-horse attack are the NewtonOS devices, which is a little
ironic, considering that the openness of their systems is second only to
the Linux boxes. We've even taken part in a couple developer-based projects
to suss out their security holes and how they might be exploited. Guess
there's a real advantage in having a different "digital genome" than the
typical host.

Gary Hudson is a pretty smart guy; if he says he can do it, I think he has
a good chance of doing it. And, frankly, an 80% reduction over inflated 
government launch costs shouldn't be that hard.

I'm sorry, can we have some concrete examples of these evil weak-hearted
people ?  Or is this just an exercise in name-calling?

Animal rights activists are as diverse a group as transhumanists and with
concerns publically mocked without rational criticism, something we can all
relate to here.  Do you think every


:The point is that the 'Cute' factor is what sells animal rightism and
vegetarianism
(which is why many more women than men are one or the other).

Lorrey, I've read a lot of arrogant sexist bullshit on this list

Engineering ugliness into
any improved meat producing organism will reduce the amount of public
aversion to it
being slaughtered for McNuggets. Though there may also be a bit of an uck
factor, as in
"EEEEWWWW! You're gonna eat THAT???!!!

I found some information on advanced dewar construction in Richard
Rhodes book "Dark Sun: the making of the Hydrogen bomb. I don't
know if the cryonics companies are aware of this or not (probably)
but I thought I'd mention it.

...Between the second, outer assembly and the dewar, the
cryogenicists ingeniously interposed a single floating thermal
radiation shield-another thin walled tank, probably made of
copper...

... a thermal-radiation shield floating in a vacuum can
significantly reduce radiant-heat transport from a warm exterior to
a cold interior. Without it Wechsler observes "your talking a warm
surface and a cold surface, and the temperature difference is a
couple hundred degrees Kelvin. I don't care if you've got a vacuum
between them, the heat leak into the cold surface is serious. But
theres a neat little trick. If you can put in a surface with an
intermediate temperature and float it-isolate it thermally- then
the outside surface sees the intermediate, and the inside one sees
the other side of the intermediate, and that cuts the loss way
down...

...rather than clutter the secondary with multiple floating
shields, they borrowed another trick, if you can make a shield
float at a lower temperature than it normally would, Wechsler says,
than you pick up the reflectivity of fifty thermal radiation
shields. To cool the shield they welded a pan to the bottom of the
copper shield that they kept filled with liquid nitrogen.....

hope this is of use.

 The obvious way is to put something like this on the home page of any
site you want people to use it on:

  We encourage you to look at these pages through <A HREF="http://crit.org">
  CritLink</A> to see any criticisms others may have made about our ideas
  or to make such criticisms yourself. Follow
  <A HREF="http://crit.org/http://www.extropy.org">this link</A> to
  start browsing our site via CritLink.

 Is there anything you want it to do beyond what this does?

I couldn't agree with you more on the Cocteau Twins...they are really
bionic! I saw them live and they had a really intresting blend of
computer-controlled rhythms and sheer human emotion...
I met Elizibeth Frasier! she's sooo cute! I was standing outside
Roseland NYC after the show and the whole band came out! I shook her
hand.

Anyway I also think Dead Can Dance and Portishead are really extropic,
They are both uploading folk music, if you can understand that...storing
ancient aesthetic knowledge. Deep Forest is another extropic group. I
think that using computers and synthesizers to store, manipulate and
perform ancient musics is a really extropic endeavor.

Anyway just thought i'd add my two cents...

I went and checked it out today... doesn't look like anyone's used it to comment
on ExI's website so far. From the very familiar set of author's names found in
the "Messages posted in the last 28 days" list, I get the feeling crit isn't
being heavily used yet. One problem might be how slowly it runs. Not sure why
all the lag, but it took a while to get through just a few pages. Might be
frustrating for people looking to use it.

While I did not say this, I will support the accuracy of this prediction. While
vegans/animal rightists as individuals may not perform such shallow and
obviosly manipulative and untrue attacks, I know from personal experience that
activists and political action groups (on both sides of the spectrum) do not
care how much they lie or distort the truth, so long as they can curry public
sentiment in favor of the policies they are trying to shove down people's
throats.

Unfortunately, your ad hominem attack is inaccurate in truth. The company I
work for processes mailing lists for several of these activist organizations,
and I can tell you that the female members outnumber male members by a ratio of
at least 4 to 1. Those are the facts, not 'arrogant sexist bullshit' as you
claim. Likewize, I can also make the claim that most Physical Therapists are
female, by a factor of at least 9 to 1, based on my knowledge of the mailing
lists of several Physical Therapy professional organizations.

You have not made any opposing statements with any facts to support your claim,
so if you cannot, then please rescind the personal attack and apologize.

Yeah, he is pretty sharp. Since current US govt costs are $10,000 per pound,
he would bring it down to $2,000 per lb, which is in line with the cheapest
Chinese and Russian launchers. The biggest benefit of his system in this
respect is that since the US govt has a law that all US launches of US
payloads using imported launchers from China or Russia must still be charged
at least 95% of the charge that the lowest domestic launcher would cost,
Hudson's project will bring back a lot of launches into the US that are
currently being performed by the Chinese and Russians for US multinational
corps in their home countries, so it will mostly benefit the Mission
Controllers union here in the US, making more jobs for US technicians....

Whether or not female members outnumber males is immaterial & not the
source of my hasty response.  In fact I have no doubt that there are more
women involved in animal rights, as that jives with my own experiences.
What I began to object to is the causation you're assigning:
"The point is that the 'Cute' factor is what sells animal rightism and
vegetarianism (which is why many more women than men are one or the
other)," that is, women are spinelessly vulnerable to cuteness, turning off
any critical thinking capacity at the sight of a fuzzy nose in a cage &
that there's no other explanation for their activism.

Do you deny this implication, or do you have another explanation?  I have
little more to say on this; I'm only surprised the rest of the list let you
get this one by.

:You have not made any opposing statements with any facts to support your
claim,
:so if you cannot, then please rescind the personal attack and apologize.

I already apologized for the accident of sending this message fragment to
the list; if you'll notice, it doesn't even end with a punctuation mark.

Vegetarians have as many reasons for not eating meat as atheists have for
not believing in Bog.  Not all atheists have responsible reasons ("It's
cause my parents, man, they're, like, Fundamentalist whackos!"), nor do all
vegetarians.  But how many Burger Thing addicts could kill and eat
something themselves, or even stand to think much about the process that
took sunlight and dirt, wrapped a few proteins around it and packaged it in
wax paper, comfortingly annonymous and 'safe' (emotionally neutral) as a
piece of fruit?

:Engineering ugliness into
:any improved meat producing organism will reduce the amount of public
aversion to it
:being slaughtered for McNuggets. Though there may also be a bit of an uck
factor, as in
:"EEEEWWWW! You're gonna eat THAT???!!

This wouldn't happen if the public had regular exposure to the source of
their food... ask someone who grew up on a REAL farm and slaughtered the
same animals they raised how squeamish they are.  In that situation, the
meat consumer is involved not only in the grub but in supporting the
animal, getting to know it.  By the same token, a hunter taking meat from
other free beasts has a respect for the animal, a special relationship
unknown to the masses huddled up to the teat of factory farms.

Some vegetarians and certainly many run-of-the-mill McDeath-scarfers both
say, "Oh, yuck, how gross," flinching with discomfort, because they have no
connection to the living animal or to the act of butchery; it's foreign,
alien, and they wouldn't want to face their dependence on something
repulsive.  The spawn of our suburbs have no respect for meat animals
because they've never raised them, never hunted them, never killed by
themselves and learned from the experience; we relate to plastic-wrapped
beef in the supermarket on the same thoughtless level as we think about
fruit, in so far as we think about it at all.  Just pluck the morsel from
the branch; no thought before or emotions after, never mind how it got
there.

At any rate, deliberately to create walking McNuggets would play right into
apathy and the  irrational selfishness of the American suburban belly.  How
on earth does it increase extropy --particularly the aspects we admire of
knowledge, vitality and beauty-- to breed something for its ugliness so as
to manipulate fear?



Has anyone speculated, in SF stories or elsewhere, about the effects of
nanotech on cuisine?  Other than mass-produced rice for Chinese peasants, I
can't remember any.

I think you'll find that the assumption that this
is because of the "cute" factor is the reason for
it being "arrogant sexist bullshit".

I also hate to be techno-pesimistic, but this is *rockets* you are talking
about.  So, I'd like to point out that Gary Hudson has been involved in
many, many rocket projects, all failures.  I applaud his determination.  In
my opinion, he is a brilliant salesman, and can attract funding to any
rocket project at all.  Since his job in this curent endevour is not a
technical one, I am sure he is an asset to the project.  In my opinion, all
of his technical ideas of the past were doomed due to a lack of respect for
simplicity, and I am not speaking out of hindsight.  For that matter, most
space launch projects suffer the same problem.

What is superintelligence?

A superintelligence is any intellect that greatly outperforms the best
human brains in practically every field, including general wisdom,
scientific creativity and social skills. This definition leaves open
how the superintelligence is implemented. For example, it could be a
classical AI or a neural network, or a combination of the two. It
could run on a digital computer, a network of interconnected
computers, a human brain augmented with extra circuitry, or what have
you. The definition also leaves open whether the superintelligence is
conscious and has subjective experiences.

 Sometimes a distinction is made between weak and strong
 superintelligence. Weak superintelligence is what you would get if
 you could run a human-like brain at an accelerated clock speed,
 perhaps by uploading a human onto a computer [see "What is
 uploading?"] If the upload's clock-rate is a thousand times that of a
 biological human brain, it would perceive reality as being slowed
 down by a factor of thousand. This means it could think a thousand
 times more thoughts in a given time than its natural counterpart.

 Strong superintelligence denotes an intellect that is not only faster
 than a human brain but also qualitatively superior. Not matter how
 much you would speed up a dog brain, you would not get a
 human-equivalent brain. Similarly, some people think that there could
 be strong superintelligence that no human brain could match no matter
 fast it runs. The distinction between weak and strong
 superintelligence may, however, not be at all clear-cut.

  Many (but by no means all) transhumanists think that
  superintelligence will be created in the first half of the next
  century. This requires two things: hardware and software.

 When chip-manufacturers plan new products, they rely on a regularity
 called "Moore's law". It states that processor speed doubles about
 every eighteen months. Moore's law has been true for all computers,
 even going back to the old mechanical calculators. If  it continues
 to hold true for a few decades then human-equivalent hardware will
 have been achieved. Moore's law is mere extrapolation, but the
 conclusion is supported by more direct considerations based on what
 is physically possible and what is being developed in the
 laboratories today. Increased parallelization would also be a way to
 achieve enough computing power even without faster processors.

As for the software problem, progress in computational neuroscience
will teach us about the computational architecture of the human brain
and what learning rules it uses. We can then implement the same
algorithms on a computer. Using a neural network approach we would not
have to program the superintelligence: we could make it learn from
experience exactly like a human child. A possible alternative to this
route is to use perhaps genetic algorithms and some methods from
classical AI to create a superintelligences that may not bear a close
resemblance to human brains.

The arrival of superintelligence will clearly deal a philosophical
blow to any anthropocentric world-view. Much more important, however,
are the practical ramifications. Creating superintelligence is the
last invention that humans will ever need to make, since
superintelligences could themselves take care of further scientific
and technological development more efficiently than humans could. The
human species will no longer be the smartest life-form in the known
universe.

 The prospect of superintelligence raises many big issues and concerns
 that need to be thought hard about now, before the actual
 developments occur. The big question is: what can be done to maximize
 the chances that the arrival of superintelligences will benefit
 humans rather than harm them? The range of expertise needed to
 address this question extend far beyond that of computer scientists
 and AI researchers. Neuroscientists, economists, cognitive
 scientists, philosophers, sociologists, science-fiction writers,
 military strategists, politicians and legislators and many others
 will have to pool their insights in order to deal wisely with what
 may be the most important task the human species will ever face.

 Transhumanists tend to want to grow into and become
 superintelligences themselves. The two ways in which they hope to do
 this are: (1) Through gradual augmentation of their biological
 brains, perhaps using nootropics, cognitive techniques, IT tools
 (e.g. wearable computers, smart agents, information filtering
 systems, visualization software etc.), and, in the future, neuro/chip
 interfaces and bionic brain implants. (2) Through mind uploading.

This is the second to last section of the FAQ... There are of course 
many more "transhumanist concepts" that one could explain (e.g. 
cryonics), but the FAQ is already rather long.


TRANSHUMANIST CONCEPTS

What is nanotechnology?

What is superintelligence?

[I'm made a separate posting of my answer to this.]

What is uploading?

Uploading (sometimes called "mind uploading") is the hypothetical
process of transferring a mind from a biological brain to a computer.

The idea is that by scanning the synaptic structure of a brain, we
could implement the same computations on a computer that would
normally take place in the brain. If you think the essence of yourself
is information -- your memories, values, attitudes and emotions --
rather than the grey, cheesy lump inside your skull, then you might
view your identity as being preserved in this process. The scanning
could be accomplished by means of nanotechnology.

Uploading should work for cryonics patients provided their brains are
frozen in a sufficiently intact state.

Uploads could live in an artificial reality (i.e.  constructed
computer-simulated environment). An option would be to have robot
bodies and sensors so they can resume their lives in physical reality.

The subjective time of uploads would depend on how fast the computers
are on which they are running.

Uploads could be distributed over vast computer networks and they
could make frequent backup copies of themselves. This should make it
possible for uploads indefinite life spans.

Uploads could subsist on a very small amount of resources compared to
a biological human, since they don't need physical food or shelter or
transportation.

Uploads could reproduce extremely quickly (simply by making copies of
themselves). This implies that resources could quickly become scarce
unless reproduction is limited.


What is the singularity?

I have missed something about the way this FAQ was originally organized, but
aren't most these actually 'transhumanist technologies'?  When I hear the
phrase 'transhumanist concepts' I think of 'transhuman', 'posthuman', as
well as the 'singularity' and the various paths of evolution.  This may be a
function of the manner in which the English language is used on my side of
the Atlantic--North Americans tend to use the word 'concept' to indicate a
broader idea rather than a concrete manifestation.  Can someone clarify this?

Thx, Kathryn Aegis

The Virions (to whose mailing list I also belong) would claim that 
each of these categories is a component of the structure of the 
Extropian meme system, and that they interact with each other and 
cannot be strictly separated.  The realization of Extropian physically 
transformative (or posthuman) goals, such as uploading, 
superintelligence and immortality, depends upon the achievement of 
certain technologies, such as nanotech and coherent light 
computation, and the instantiation of Extropian social ideals is more 
likely to be facilitated in groups whose members accept Extropian 
principles.                   Salamantis

from http://www.xprize.org 

The XPRIZE is a $10,000,000 prize to jump-start the space tourism
industry through competition between the most talented entrepreneurs and
rocket experts in the world. Following in the footsteps of over 100 aviation
prizes offered between 1905 and 1935 which created today's multibillion dollar
air transport industry, the XPRIZE will be awarded to the team which designs
the first private spaceship which successfully launches three humans to a
sub-orbital altitude of 100 km on two consecutive flights within two weeks.
All
teams must be privately financed. 

Competitors: 

As of April 30, 1998 the international competition is open to all teams which
abide by the XIPRIZE rules. 14 teams are currently registerd. 

Funding: 

St.Louis business leaders have provided over $1.50 million in funding to
support the Foundation's work in organizing the competition. With this support
in place, the Foundation is now working to raise the full $10 million purse. 

St.Louis Connection: 

The XPRIZE is headquartered in St.Louis because of the connection with
Charles Lindbergh and the Spirit of St.Louis whose historic 1927 flight
changed the course of aviation history. St.Louis is working with the XPRIZE
Foundation to promote the city as a visionary, high-tech community. 

New Spirit of St.Louis Organization 

The New Spirit of St.Louis Organization is composed of business leaders
who have each contributed to the XPRIZE Foundation to help to create the
competition. Historically, the original "Spirit of St.Louis" organization
consisted
of nine St.Louisans who jointly contributed $25,000 in 1927 to support
Charles Lindbergh's attempt to win the Orteig Prize. 

Endorsements: 

The XPRIZE has been endorsed by leading space and aviation organizations
including: The Association of Space Explorers, the US Space Foundation, the
National Space Society, Federation Aeronautique Internationale, the Aeroclub
de France, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the Society
of Experimental Test Pilots, the Experimental Aircraft Association, and the
Explorers Club. 

Historical Analog: 

By 1929, governments, individuals, newspapers and major corporations had
offered more than 50 major aeronautical prizes. Among them was the Orteig
Prize, a $25,000 cash prize sponsored by a wealthy hotel owner, Raymond
Orteig, for the first person or persons to fly non-stop between New York and
Paris. The Orteig Prize stimulated not one, but nine separate attempts to
cross
the Atlantic. To initiate the flights, competitors raised and spent some
$400,000, or 16 times the amount of the prize. As a result of these early
aviation prizes, the world now enjoys a $250 billion aviation industry.

AFAIR the shuttle breaks in two at the front of the payload bay, and the
crew compartment tumbles down the runway. The official policy would be to
jump out of the shuttle and come down by parachute, but since the landing
gear isn't lowered until a few seconds before impact, that's a bit tricky.

AFAIR one emergency lowering when the hydraulics failed (in fact I think
they always blow the pyrotechnic charges now just in case), a couple of
close calls, and numerous blown tires due to wheel locking.

 Unfortunately, your ad hominem attack is
 inaccurate in truth. The company I work for
 processes mailing lists for several of these
 activist organizations, and I can tell you that
 the female members outnumber male members by a
 ratio of at least 4 to 1. Those are the facts,
 not 'arrogant sexist bullshit' as you claim.

I'm not so sure this stereotype doesn't have some basis in reality.  I am
unable to recall the particulars but I actually do remember studies that
determined that females were more attracted to "cute" faces.  Cute was
defined as faces with big eyes, large head to body ratios, and other
child-like attributes.  It may be rash to assume causation in this
particular case, but it may also be rash to hurl insults.

  This is the 23'rd update on my fly longevity experiments. The high summer
temperatures of 30 to 35 C have accelerated fly aging, so that this
experiment was concluded in a month, as opposed to a typical duration of
around two months during the winter months.
  In this run I was primarily interested in seeing the results with
methyl-sulfonyl-methane. Although this supplement proved to be a bust, both
low and high dose marjoram and royal jelly appear to enhance average life
span somewhat. Neither of these lenghtened maximum life span, so no
antiaging effect could be claimed.
  The high temperatures encouraged pathogen growth in one of my breeding
bottles, which had to be destroyed. The other breeding bottles also had
fewer flies than I had hoped for, so the eleventh run is  rather small. I
am creating more breeding bottles so as to insure a larger twelveth run.
  Many of the supplements I have tested in the past were spices. This had a
disadvantage, in that the amounts of these materials fed the flies were
much larger than the amounts (relatively speaking) that humans typically
consume. I am now mostly switching over to foods that humans typically
consume much larger quantities of. Thus if a food exerts an antiaging
effect in flies, it would be at least possible for humans to consume
similar quantities.
  The eleventh run focuses exclusively on fruit juices. The most
interesting juice IMHO is cranberry juice, which is known to exert a
protective effect on urinary infections. If this exerts a protective effect
against pathogens for flies it might increase their average life
expectancy.
  Other juices have other interesting properties. Orange juice exerts a
significant anticancer effect in rodents. Grapefruit juice increases the
absorption of many drugs, but also increases the risk of kidney
stones. Pineapple juice is very effective in inhibiting the browning of
apple rings. (J Food Sci 58(2): 399-404 1993) Whether any of these juices
can increase fly life span is open to conjecture. There exists only one way
to answer this question - do an experiment!

Since the roton is essentially a helicopter with rockets, it can complete
autogyro maneuvers and can land in any patch of field in an emergency, while a
shuttle requires a specially built 10,000 foot runway with twice the normal
concrete thickness. A shuttle lands at over 250 miles per hour, so if it loses a
landing gear, they are basically screwed unless they ditch at sea.Mike Lorrey

While one might automatically think that I made an unfounded leap to assume
that women are more likely to 'spinelessly vulnerable' to cuteness, I think
that the assumption that one has to be 'spinelessly vulnerable' to cuteness to
allow cuteness to become a factor influencing one's empathic response to others
is sexist in and of itself. The use of the term 'spinelessly vulnerable'
automatically implies that it is inferior because it does not seem masculine.
Just as you are accusing me of making an unfounded leap to a conclusion, you
are making an equally false jump to the conclusion that one has to be
'spinelessly vulnerable' to appreciate cuteness.

I make no sexist judgement about an individual's empathic response outside of
the claims of feminists that women are in fact more empathic, I just beleive
that since a) there is absolutely no proof or evidence of sentience amongst any
animals besides humans (except perhaps dolphins and some of the great apes) b)
humans are the top predators in all land ecosystems and have been for thousands
of years (and have been tops in all water ecosystems for at least the last
thousand) c) it has been proven that lack of wild herd management policies
which include hunting and harvesting at calculated levels causes in the long
run far greater pain and suffering for more animals than is experienced under a
hunting policy, that an individuals empathic response to a cute and fuzzy bunny
is not a rational basis for an individuals vegetarian or animal rights beleifs,
that if an individual wants to reduce pain and suffering amongst animals then
they should support hunting policies.

A human being's evolved empathic response is meant for use in interpersonal
relations between other human beings, however some stunted individuals who are
not able to full fill their affection craving or co-dependencies with other
humans tend to use animals as surrogates. This is not a behavior which has a
positive evolutionary advantage for the individual.

Additionally, the attitude of animal rightists that domesticated farm animals
are not 'natural' is scientifically baseless, since such animals have been
evolved by their symbiosis with humans over several thousand years into the
animals they are today, just as much as ants have domesticated other insects
which they use to produce food for the ant larvae in the nest. Animal rightists
exhibit the major failing that most true environmentalists accuse mainstream
humans of: separating humanity from 'nature'. The human species is as much a
part of nature as any other species, and everything it does is as much a part
of natural evolution as any other species. Why is it that dams built by beavers
are 'natural', while dams built by man are 'artificial'? Why are termite hills
and bee hives 'natural' arcologies, while apartment buildings and cities are
'artificial'? Why are ant's domesticated insects 'natural' while cows are not?
Such paradoxes expose the lie of animal rightists.

People tend to lose their irrational knee-jerk PC responses once they've

Another failing of Hudson (which is not bad) is an inability to appreciate the
conservative narrow mindedness of most investors. Yes, many of his projects have
been excessively complex, however the main reason why he has always had trouble
raising sufficient capital is because his ideas are always not part of mainstream
aerospace/aerodynamic design conventions, sometimes so far out that people think
he's crazy. His Pheonix project was actually rather simple, and would have worked
if he was able to get sufficient funding. His funding problem was caused more by
the expected bureaucratic expenses adn delays being seen as a major impediment.

Thats the point of my original argument. However, if we all were put back into
a pretechnological world, 99.99% of the people would die from starvation, with
harvestable animal food all around them, which is irrelevant to the original
discussion. The discussion was about making healthy sources of protein with a
minimum of 'suffering and pain'.  I countered that since the whole idea of
wanting to avoid 'suffering and pain' in killing animals was an animal rightist
response, that the better idea PR wize is to engineer a healthy source of self
reproducing protein which most animal rightists would have no aversion to
killing. Since empathy with animals is mostly a matter of a human
anthropomorphizing upon the features of animals that humans see as 'cute', i.e.
features one normally sees in children (large eyes, large heads, and other
childlike features), reducing the 'cuteness' of an animal would obviously
reduce an animal rightists aversion to killing it, as well as reduce its
usability for photogenic PR campaigns put on by animal rightists.

yes, an individual who has never had to directly associate their daily food
supply with them actively harvesting animals tends to have a reduced inhibition
to anthropomorphize animals.

Not to manipulate fear, but to reduce the manipulability of an animals features
for anthropomorphising. I've never seen a 'Save the sea cucumber!", or "Save
the slime mold!" campaign, have you??? It increases extropy in that it
increases the supply of healthy, self reproducing protein sources for the human
food supply, which will be needed in the next 50 years as the world population
rises from 5.5 billion now up to 18 billion before it tops off....

nanotech will definitely, with sufficient sophistication, allow production of
as tasty a hunk of beef as one could hope for, but I'd doubt that you could get
any vegan to eat it who can afford alternatives.

first written in 1981-82.

The fine-tuned version is available at both:

www.transhuman.org
www.extropic-art.com/transart.htm


Transhumanist Art is an arts period of many modes of the arts and
creativity.  It first came into being in the early 1980's and has stretched
and yawned, mutated and spread across the universe ("We are transhumans
..." on its way across the Solar System.)   To date, hundreds of creative
transhumans have communicated about their art.

in 1990.  The latest version is more cogent.  

Over the years Transhumanist Art has stretched and yawned, mutated and

Protein is not the nutrient that vegetarians lack, it's vitamin B12 (i'm
pretty sure its B12), which can be supplemented in pills, or the specific
vegetables that B12 is more abundant in.

I'm not sure what you're saying exactly, but I knew someone who was raised on
a slaughter farm, and is a strict vegetarian today.

 This is a bit too abstract. How about throwing in some examples of
companies that price their products to reach tens or hundreds of millions
of people (Intel, AOL, Coke, Exxon, Disney, etc) and challenging
the people who are asking that question to explain why greedy capitalists
would prefer to invest in products that only the rich would ever buy?
How many investors got rich on mass-market goods and services and
how many got rich making Rolls Royces, yachts, caviar, etc.?

There is no natural place to draw a line between these two, however.
A biological body augmented with nanotech may use materials we don't
normally associate with biology.  There is a continuum between ordinary
biological bodies and things like cyborgs and robots.

As far as uploading, this does suggest an architecture where the seat
of consciousness is within stationary structures while manipulation is
done via remotes.  However there is nothing inherent in the upload concept
which would prevent some or all of the consciousness moving into the
remote manipulators, and you are again back to the cyborgs/robots.

The bottom line is that you have matter, energy, and the laws of physics.
Conscious entities will use these to accomplish their goals.  Trying to
categorize their means as biological vs technological is not going to
be useful in the long run.

Iain Banks wrote a story which includes a feast of 'Richard Nixon Burgers',
'Pol Pot Chow Mein' and other Earth delicacies (I think the names are right,
but I haven't read it for quite a while). All grown humanely in vats from 
DNA samples taken by nanoprobes, of course.

Burch called it 'technologies'. I changed it to 'concepts' for two 
reasons. First, I wanted to explain what the singularity is supposed 
to be and I cound't fit it under any other section. Second, the 
notion of a transhuman technology is a little strange - a cogwheel or 
a rubber band are techenologies that are very useful for 
transhumanist purposes, so it's unfortunate to give the impression 
that only some fancy sci-fi future tech would qualify as transhuman.

If there's a problem with "concept" we can change it to something 
else --  not "applications" though, since the singularity is hardly 
an application.

   A good maxim (due to Karl Popper) is that the value of any discussion 
   is inversely proportional to the time spent discussing the meaning of 
   words.  >:-}
   
   Kathryn goes on to quote two 'example' questions from Nick Bostrom:
   
   
>>
>>TRANSHUMANIST CONCEPTS
>>
>>What is nanotechnology?
>>
>>What is superintelligence?
>>


   All 'What is?' questions are flawed by their essentialist framing of 
   the question.  The implication is the Platonic one, that there is an 
   underlying pure concept which it is our job to define.   The best you 
   can end up with is a sort of glossary.
   
   Whereas a nominalist approach (that discourse is conventional) would 
   point out that good definitions (especially scientific definitions) 
   read 'from right to left':  thus:
   
   'Nanotechnology' is the scientists' effort to answer the question "What 
   shall we call a branch of science and technology addressing the design 
   and construction of tiny (even molecular-level) machines?"  instead of 
   asking 'What is nanotechnology?"  'Nanotechnology ' is shorthand for 
   the longer definition.  That's all.
   
   
   Those of us who are used to thinking of scientific advance in terms of 
   hypothetico-deductive problem-solving would present the _interesting_ 
   questions thusly:
   
   "What problem(s) are we trying to solve here?"
    ============================================

   where the problem-solving iteration is:
   
           p1 --> th --> dp --> ee --> p2
   
   whereby p1 is the initial problem; th is a testable hypothesis;  dp is the 
   deduction of testable propositions; ee is error-elimination via (inter 
   alia) logical evaluation and real-world testing; and p2 is the 
   (hopefully) smaller resulting problem.
   
   
   So an FAQ which has an initial heading describing the 
   problem-situations which chiefly concern extropians (i.e. 
   forward-looking and forward-thinking people), followed by a 
   presentation of hypothetical solutions, with a discussion of some of 
   the possible difficulties, would be most useful.
   
   The document could then be enhanced by a Neuro-Linguistic Programming 
   style re-write, to give it added focus, zip and impact.

It seems to me that there is at least one striking difference worth 
naming, between systems which have been designed and understood from the 
ground up, and evolved systems which we have tweaked and adapted to our
purposes.  Cars vs. Cows.  

While larger systems may contain subsystems of both types, I expect 
limitations on the granularity of integration, exactly because our 
limited understanding of evolved systems limits our flexibility in 
interfacing them with other systems.  Maybe all we really want out of 
cows are certain chemical processes in their stomaches, but cow systems
are hard to disentangle, so we'll leave them as units for some time to
come.  

I recall Drexler having written about this issue regarding nanotech.

On `shapers vs. mechs`:  these describe technologies, or methods,
while the social separation usually (always) happens along goals and
values; I can not think of an example where these were split along the 
same lines.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

Last night I saw Schindler's List.  Following are a number of ramblings 
that have come to mind, without regard to plot points they might 
divulge -- I'm not in the mood for that kind of censoring.

An initial sobering thought:  If everyone in the world were going to die 
except those whose names I could remember, some people I like quite a lot 
would die.

Money -- time -- life.

Oskar Schindler became extremely wealthy and saved 1100 lives.
Do I -- do you -- have enough to save even one?  The most important
one -- your own?  And now that I think of it, Schindler saved 1101,
of which the last had to be the first or the 1100 were doomed.  But
I digress.

Let's start with cryonics -- a slim chance, but your best one at the
moment, should death come after you.  Do you have enough to pay 
startup costs, insurance, annual fees, for a chance to save that most
important life?  

What if your insurance company goes belly-up, or institutes new rules,
or drops your coverage, or...?  Do you have enough to pay out of 
pocket for your suspension?  For whatever reason, it could be your
only chance to live.

Even if you are signed up for cryonics, but especially if you aren't, I
presume you realize that each year that you stay alive improves your 
chances for living indefinitely; medical technology, computer technology, 
cryotechnology, etc. are constantly improving.  Schindler bankrupted
himself in seven months, but it was just long enough.  Do you have 
enough to live another year if you lose your job?  If you become
disabled?  If you require constant hospitalization?  If you require
expensive medical treatment not covered by your insurance, or that is
only available in a foreign country?  Or for which you have to pay 
bribes to ensure that you are in the experimental group in clinical 
trials?

What about for five years?  Or ten?  Every year could be the year in
which rejuvenation is discovered -- in which a crucial disease (any
disease can be crucial if you have it and it can kill you) is cured
-- in which suspended animation is perfected.  How much can you 
afford to pay to live till that year rather than to die in the year
before?

And what if you have fatal disease X (AIDS comes to mind as an 
example, but there are others, and evolution seems to toss us a new
one now and then)?  Can you afford to fund research to find the cure?  
Or at least a treatment that will allow you to live another year, or 
five, or ten?

And what about the people in the world most important to you?  Can 
you keep them alive?  How many are there, and how much would it take?
If you don't know, do you need an Itzak Stern to help you find out?

I've heard many people say "I don't care about money".  Neither did
Schindler, but he realized that money could mean the difference 
between life and death, and he cared about life.  While our 
circumstances are not as dramatic, the things I mention above, and many
others (living in a safe neighborhood, driving a safe car, whatever)
show ways in which money can prolong our lives.  Schindler and the
Schindler Jews survived until the end of World War II.  Your mission,
should you choose to accept it, is to survive until the War on Death
is won.  How long can you afford to survive?  What is it worth to you
to make enough money to survive longer -- the additional month or year
that it might be before victory is declared?

"The worst is over"

"I could have done more"

Schindler also could not have saved 1100 lives had he not been a member
of the Nazi Party.  He clearly hated what they stood for, but he 
realized that they had the power and that he would need some of it in
order to save lives.  I have been a member of the Libertarian party for
almost 15 years, but I have the feeling that both the similarities and
the differences in the situations here/now and there/then deserve some
quiet contemplation.

I wonder if people can be taught to hate death as much as I do?  An army
of such warriors could certainly fight the War on Death more effectively
than me alone.  Perhaps that would be the best use of money -- starting
a school, funding a college course or community education class....

Or perhaps taking a cue from Hitler's original propaganda machine:
commercials, TV shows, newspaper articles (or even my own newspaper),
movies (though Schindler's List sets an awfully high bar), and other
mass media.

I disliked South Park before I saw Schindler's List -- I'm pretty sure
I couldn't stomach it now.

I definitely need to go find something light, happy, upbeat, and 
positive to see or do.

In the wonderful rag that circulates in the city of Bahston there was a 
story portraying cryonicists and probably extropians and transhumanists 
as geeks with no sex lives. Sure thats an accurate description of me but 
everybody else too? :-) Heres an part of the article.

>>>Pawing through a magazine profile of Ralph Merkle, a nerdy West Coast 
scientist, I noticed a curious biographical detail: Mr. Merkle is one of 
the few people in the world who have paid to have their bodies 
cryonically suspended -- frozen -- after death. He hopes that scientists 
will discover a way to revive human life from frozen tissue before the 
Apocalypse, or before his yearly payments to Arizona-based Alcor Life 
Extension Foundation run out.

OK, it's a bet. But more intriguing, Merkle's Web site provides a link 
to "quite a few people well known in the fields of computer science, 
software development and other high-tech areas" who've opted for the 
deep freeze. There are 26 of them and, not surprisingly, they have some 
things in common:

1. They are all nerds.

2. Twenty-five of the 26 are men.

3. Most of them, with the exception of Cambridge's own Marvin Minsky, 
live in California.

So here's your first peek at post-Armageddon America: a bunch of 
cockroaches scurrying around the pant legs of 25 computer and biotech 
nerds, who are in turn scouring the Santa Cruz Moutains for frozen women 
to revive and fraternize with. It's a chilling thought.

Interest in cryogenics has been heating up, slowly, since the 1964 
publication of Robert Ettinger's book "The Prospect of Immortality." 
Ettinger now runs the Michigan-based Cryonics Institute, which charges a 
one-time, $28,000 suspension fee for clients who want to be around for 
the release of Windows 64. On his Web site (www.cryonics.org) Ettinger 
plays awful music and boasts of his company's "proven track record," 
whatever that means.<<<

Is this our image? I checked out the Transvision pictures and I have to 
confess things are not looking good. It looked like a Revenge of the 
Nerds reunion. Between geeks and plastic surgery experiments I think 
we're in trouble!!!!

The latest Cryonics mag has a provocative article by Saul Kent arguing
that the main reason for low interest in cryonics is almost universal
disbelief that it will work.  This contrasts to arguments of most cryonics
salesfolk that the major barriers are confronting death, wanting to live
in a possibly-weird future with few people you know, letting your family
know you're going to do something weird and icky-looking, etc.  

Sounds like Kennita is in the later camp, but Saul may be right.

By "evolved systems" do you mean strictly biological systems which have
evolved over billions of years, or do you mean more general systems
which use evolution as a design methodology?  It may turn out that many
artificial systems will be designed at least in part using evolutionary
methods like genetic algorithms.

On the other hand, during the era in which we are biological entities
there will be great value in understanding the tangled processes which
produce life (and health), as well as finding ways to marry technology to
these naturally evolved systems.  Once nonbiological options exist this
will become less important, but in the meantime we may have achieved
good enough understanding of biology that we will be able to integrate
it into more complex systems.

That article has several mistakes.  I pointed out two of them to the author,
and he promised a correction, but I don't know if it ever appeared anywhere.

The level of hostility toward "nerds" in that article is frightening.
I can't think of another peaceful subgroup of humans where a similar level 
of hostility would be tolerated in a newspaper article.

Does not the fact that we can dream indicate that the compute power of
our minds includes the compute power needed to run artificial
environment simulations?  Does this not provide an existence proof
that realistic artificial environment simulations for uploaders should
ultimately require relatively little compute power compared to the
uploaded mind?

I mean both, though the effect is stronger for the former.  Artificially evolved
systems are similarly hard to disentangle, but evolution will likely be used to 
design small grain systems which are then combined into larger systems via 
explicit understood design.

Great value, yes, but I think the problem is so hard that this won't translate
into enough progress to change the overall characterization of such systems
as mostly not understood and hard to flexibly make use of parts.  By the time
we can switch to fully designed systems, I think the temptation to do so will 
still be very strong.

This may turn out to be true, but dreaming isn't quite like VR.  With most
of my dreams, much of my mind seems to be asleep.  Bizarre events occur
and I don't even notice.  The story changes, I find myself somewhere
else without actually going there, etc.  As a dream author I seem to be
quite incompetent, and the only thing which saves me is the inattention
of my audience.

Creating a true artificial environment which can fool an alert, attentive
mind will be a more difficult task.  You may be correct that it will
be easier than simulating a mind, which will no doubt require massive
computing resources.  But dreams don't make the case.

Don't worry about those few extropian females dude, they're mostly  lesbians :-)  Because of our dorky image, no self-respecting hot babe
will associate with us (not to mention the fact that attractive people, especially women, are usually shallow). Go blame society!

It says here in my local paper that `scientists are puzzled over the
deaths... of the world's first five calved clones...'  Mysteriously, the
very brief story adds: `The calves' deaths leave the twin calves born last
month as the only survivors among the first five animals cloned using the
same technique' used by Roslin Institute.  I can't track down further
details on a brief scan of the net.

mark the reason i am having such difficulty with this concept is that the
roton is a re-entry system.  you still have to lift the thing into orbit
somehow to reenter the atmosphere.  the reentry system of modern
government launchers is neither the cost driver nor the weight driver.  spike

http://cnn.com/WORLD/asiapcf/9807/31/RB000417.reut.html

suggests that the report I cited earlier was garbled, unless something even
more recent has zapped other clones.

It says:

TOKYO, July 31 (Reuters) - Japan's cloning programme suffered another
                  setback when twin cloned calves died soon after birth,
Japanese researchers
                  said on Friday. 

                  Twin calves produced from cloning somatic cells taken
from unfertilised eggs
                  from an adult cow, died soon after birth in Japan's
Ishikawa Prefecture, 350
                  km (220 miles) northwest of Tokyo, on Thursday night,
they said. 

                  A surrogate mother cow died earlier this month after
giving birth to twin
                  cloned calves, while another cloned calf died 16 hours
after birth last week. 

[... but:]

                  Researchers suspect the two calves, born 14 days ahead of
schedule from a
                  surrogate mother after difficult labor, suffocated after
taking in too much
                  amniotic fluid during birth.

Supposedly the Roton will cut launch weight by spinning the engine,
pumping the fuel into the engine chambers and avoiding heavy pumps.
The designers considered using the rotors to help lift the rocket,
but considered the additional risk too great.

Rant on (please indulge me):

Having to bring virtually every nonpropellant ounce you launch (scant
consumables and boiloff) back to your landing site causes many margins to
be razor-thin. 'Tain't easy. 

That decision to not rely on the rotor blades for takeoff lift probably
really pained the designers. But that, and the decision to set a price
point that doesn't send "industry experts" spinning in an anti-Roton tizzy,
are signs that the company in question is (
   a) trying to play ball with the existing space launch cartel(s) _and_ 
   b) adopting something resembling prudent risk management. 

It is possible that Hudson and company's calculations including safety
factors suggested that the added mass of the longer rotors, stressed for
the added forces, made benefit unclear; or increased boost-phase dynamic
loads to a risky level, or simply presented too high an investment risk for
the likely initial short-term Return On Investment (ROI).

I seem to see every (self-contained; laser launch doesn't count) SSTO
design encountering the same set of problems. The semi-Roton (for such is
what Hudson and company are actually describing now; as Lincoln famously
observed, calling a tail a leg doesn't make it a leg) might have them to a
lesser degree than a full Roton, built with available engineering and
materials, would. 

If I recall calculations I last made a decade ago, the two biggest problems
for SSTOs are: 
   (1) sensitivity to small thrown mass changes (hence, overall mass ratio
changes) and 
   (2) actual bring-down payload mass. 
Boost-phase rotor deployment ought to improve both, or it ought not be
done. Even a microscopic upward bump in thrown mass tends to have a
negative impact on bring-down payload mass. If the latter goes negative,
you're stuck with the old "Destination Moon" (or "Cold Equations") solution.

If you sell your system as just a delivery truck, bring-down mass can be
finessed as not part of your business plan--somewhat. But a true space
transportation system needs to be able to bring useful amounts of things
down, too.

These matters have so far proven to be very tough on SSTOs, even those on
the drawing boards. For decades, the only rocket technology thought to be
up to the general SSTO surface-to-orbit, orbit-to-surface cargo job was
high-mass-flow nuclear (Isp~=1000++). That's not a modern contender for all
the usual NIMBY reasons. But modeling, materials and manufacturing
technology unavailable in the 1950s make chemically boosted SSTOs
tantalizing--the modern space launch golden apple, just barely out of reach.

Even the Shuttle puts atmospheric lift to use during boost. The numbers for
true Rotons continue to be intriguing. Eventually, routinely available
materials will advance to the point where chemical propulsion can reliably
do some SSTO jobs. 

Exactly what those jobs will be is still up in the air. I continue to watch
Mr. Hudson's efforts with interest, and to wish him every success.

Rant off,

MMB

I think you'd first have to prove that dreams are real and not just false
memories. I can remember Mt Fuji pretty well, but that doesn't mean I can
simulate it inside my head.

How about the studies into lucid dreaming?  I have had a few lucid
dreams in which I was totally in control.  It is very similar to what
we think of as virtual reality.  There are studies that seem to
indicate that lucid dreaming can be learned.  Those of you who have
never experienced this might ought to look into it.

Subject: Update: Showtime's Passion of Ayn Rand

Dear listmembers:

Barbara Branden recently published, in Liberty magazine
(www.libertysoft.com/liberty/), a letter to John Hospers detailing her
experience with Showtime's adaptation of The Passion of Ayn Rand.  It
sounds like the movie, filmed in January and February of this year, could
have an unusually positive effect on public understanding of the
Objectivist movement.

Both Barbara and Bill Bradford (of Liberty) have granted permission to
distribute her letter on this list, and in addition Barbara has supplied me
with a considerable amount of text which was inadvertantly omitted from the
version published in Liberty.  The fuller version is below.

Enjoy,

Joshua


----------------------------------------------

Dear John,

I intended to be in Toronto for only a week during the filming of The
Passion of Ayn Rand -- but after two days on the set, I knew that no power
on earth could tear me away until the shoot ended. I am having a more
wonderful time than I ever dreamed possible. 

Howard Korders script is excellent, and I am constantly being asked to
write bits of copy -- which means that I get material into the script that
I had wanted in. The cast is marvelous; Helen Merrin as Ayn is superb, as I
expected her to be; Eric Stoltz as Nathan and Julie Delpy as Barbara are
very, very good indeed; and the total knockout is Peter Fonda as Frank. One
very rarely sees a performance such as his. He doesnt act Frank; he is
Frank.  He has me in tears almost every time he's on camera, and Helen
often does too.

Even the smaller parts were wonderfully portrayed.  Tom McCamus, who
portrays Robert Berole, is a major Canadian actor; I had seen him as King
Arthur in Camelot, last summer at Stratford.  I was very touched when he
wrote in my book: "Thank you for letting me be your boyfriend for a while."

One day, several young people, on the set for the first time, came up to me
to introduce themselves. Were the Collective, one of them said
earnestly. I tried not to burst out laughing, but I couldnt help it.

My one disappointment is the character of Caroline.  Shes the young
woman, played by a fine young actress named Sybil Temchen, with whom
Nathaniel falls in love.  She is not at all like Patrecia in her
personality, her psychology, or her character; shes an amalgam of several
characters.

Al Waxman, an actor who has been in American films for years, played Jack
Warner -- a small part in which he has an argument with Ayn about the movie
of The Fountainhead.  He told me, "Theres three places I could be right
now: In Switzerland with my wife; having the hip surgery I badly need; or
being part of this film and playing a ridiculously small role -- but
head-to-head with Helen Mirren.  Later, I saw him limping and asked if the
pain was bad.  He said, "It hurts until the director says 'Action,' and it
hurts after he says 'Cut.'  In between? What hip?"

In the beginning of one scene, Julie Delpy is finishing a lecture on
Efficient Thinking.  Her lines had little or nothing to do with the
subject, and I was asked to re-write them.  When the shooting of the new
scene was finished, Julie came running over to me, saying: "Barbara! Its
wonderful! How do I get the tapes?"  You may be sure she will receive the
tapes.

Julie is truly beautiful, a rare mixture of delicacy and strength.  Months
ago, when the producers and I were discussing casting, they asked whom Id
like to portray me.  I said, "I dont know most of todays young actresses,
so I cant choose -- so long as shes breathtakingly beautiful!" I got my
wish.

Peter just won a Golden Globe award; on February 10 the Oscar nominees will
be announced, and it's likely that Peter will be among them -- which means
the press will descend. U.S. News & World Report has been here,
interviewing the stars and moi, and the New York Times is expected. It
looks as if there will be a lot of publicity, both by Showtime and in the
press. 

The other day, I rounded a corner on the way to the set -- and almost fell
over. On a busy corner was a very large billboard with a picture of Peter
as Frank and the words: "This is John Galt! Find out who he is in Ayn
Rand's Atlas Shrugged!" I lost all sense of what decade I was living in.

The director and the stars -- particularly Julie -- very often ask me
questions about the psychology and thinking of the characters. This is
delightful. I have to tell you of one event that you may have trouble
getting into your head; God knows I had trouble. At the wedding of Barbara
and Nathan, a woman stands behind them, with tears in her eyes; after the
ceremony, Barbara turns to smile lovingly at the woman, who is her mother.
She also is me. I am my own mother at my own wedding!!! I loved every
minute of it. Mary Lou Gutscher, my wonderful hostess who has accepted,
without a whimper, this woman who came to dinner, rushed out to get me a
T-shirt that reads: A Star is Born! In future, I expect to be treated
accordingly. 

After the shoot one day, Mary Lou and I walked into a nearby grocery store
to get a couple of things. Something seemed strange; the store looked oddly
out of place. And then we discovered we were trying to buy fruit in a prop.
(I must confess that on my first day on the set, I ate a prop.)

This can give you only a vague sense of how truly wonderful those five
weeks were for me. When I first arrived, Helen told me that both cast and
crew were terrified at what I might think and say and do -- but after one
day, I was involved in a love affair with all of them. Helen is as
remarkable a woman as she is an actor; I can't imagine a better
performance, and I can't imagine feeling greater admiration and affection
for a performer. She told me from the beginning, about Ayn: "I will not let
her down. I will not let her be diminished."  She read my book, watched
interview tapes of Ayn, read a lot of her work, and came away convinced
that Ayn was a great woman, great in intellect and in passion. She kept her
word: Ayn is not diminished.

I had all the cast and the members of the crew whom I really got to know
sign my book about Ayn. Helen wrote that this was one of the best acting
experiences of her career. She had told me that her father had been a
communist, that she had been raised to be a communist, and that she'd only
begun to question it fifteen or twenty years ago. So I don't know how she
-- or Peter or Eric or Julie or most of the crew -- view Ayn's ideas. What
was so special was that it doesnt matter. All of them, and most
particularly Helen, approached their work with an astonishing integrity.

In one of the final scenes, Helen-Ayn was to give her last talk before her
death, and to be terribly aged, weary, and ill. I entered the set and saw
Helen from the back at first -- and what I was seeing, from the back and
before the shooting of the scene began, was an aged, weary, and ill woman.
You can imagine what she projected when I saw her from the front.

I normally watched the shooting from the monitor of the director,
Christopher Menaul, wearing a headset. We had to get into odd places at
times. One day -- one late night, to be exact - Chris and I and about ten
of the crew were squashed into a bathroom, which happened to be the logical
place from which to shoot the scene. The brief scene was of Helen looking
into a mirror, not saying a word, but speaking paragraphs with her eyes and
expression. When the director called "Cut!" there was a sharp intake of
breath in the bathroom and everywhere on the set: No one had breathed
during the entire scene.

People in the crew, who were as remarkable as the cast, kept telling me
what a joy it was for them to work on such "a quality film." I was as
fascinated by what goes on behind the camera as in front of it. Within a
few days I was convinced that making a film is so complicated that it can't
possibly be done, never was done, and never would be done. Only they did
it. And it truly is all smoke and mirrors -- and lights. One day we were on
a set, a beautiful house in Toronto that had the feel of Ayns home in
Tarzana. Outside, it was a dreary winter Toronto day; inside, the house was
flooded with California sunshine.

What most fascinated me about the crew is the extent to which each one of
them has to be a self-generator. There were about 40 of them, and their
jobs were much too complex for anyone to be truly in charge; each one of
them had to know his job exactly, and do it perfectly. I got to know many
of them. They have remarkable lives, traveling to shoots all over the
world; and they all seem madly in love with their work.

It was amazing, during those five weeks, to find myself gradually feeling
as if I were part of a close family -- cast and crew. We were together
often sixteen hours a day or more, we ate together, we talked together, we
all were involved in the same deeply meaningful project and we all had the
same goal; and I realized again something I had known before: the kind of
closeness and caring that is possible when people share a common value and
a common goal.

When the shoot was over, especially when Helen and Peter left, I felt
utterly bereft. When I got home, one of the producers called and asked if I
was suffering, as she was, from post-filming depression. Definitely. It's
somewhat like finishing a book: One lives so intensely during the writing
of it that when the work is finished all the world seems, for a while, flat
and stale.

The first few days I was on the set, even though the filming was not in
sequence, it vividly brought back my past, and I had the sense that I was
reliving those days. As a result, I had tears in my eyes -- at minimum - a
good deal of the time. The tears were not for Nathaniel or for me, but for
Ayn and Frank. I kept feeling as if I must stop from happening to them what
I knew was going to happen. But by the second week, it stopped being so
intensely personal, and I enjoyed the wonder of seeing my book brought to
life. I realized that a book is about something, but it's not the thing
itself; a film is the reality.

This was not a once in a lifetime experience. It was a never in a lifetime
experience. This is not the sort of thing that happens. And I feel so
blessed that it happened to me.

I could happily go on forever, there's so much to tell about those
astonishing weeks. The director and the producers had me write a lot of
dialogue both before I came to Toronto (I arrived here the second day of
the shoot) and especially after. What they wanted from me mostly was
philosophical dialogue pertaining to Objectivism, which, understandably,
neither they nor the scriptwriter could quite handle. 

So I happily wrote dialogue, and got ideas into the script that I had badly
wanted to get in -- such as: No man has the right to initiate the use of
force. (Interesting to me was the fact that I had no writer's block, not
even for one second; I often was asked, at two or three a.m., to produce
something by the next day -- and I did it with no trouble whatever. It
seems as if I'm not blocked when I can't afford to be.)

But there was one scene I was unhappy about and which I couldn't get
changed, despite the fact that from the beginning so many of my suggestions
had been accepted. That was the scene where Ayn slaps Nathan. Her words in
this scene were weak, not psychologically true. I kept saying that they
should go to my book for the dialogue, because that was so much stronger
than what they had.

A couple of days before that scene was to be shot, Helen came up to me with
a sheet of paper on which she had rewritten her dialogue for that scene.
She said it was terribly weak as it was -- that it made Ayn petty, which
she never would have been, that she should be shown as an erupting volcano
- and that she had gone to my book for the words she would say. She chose
almost exactly the lines I would have chosen -- and she had the clout to
get them accepted by the director.

The president of Showtime came to the set, presumably because, as the
producers told me, he was very excited about the daily rushes he'd been
seeing. As the shoot progressed, all the people involved seemed to get more
and more of a feeling that they had something quite remarkable on their
hands. In the middle of the shoot, Showtime added half a million dollars to
what they had initially agreed to spend. I know that's loose change to you
and me, but it was important to Showtime.

This has been an incredible experience for me in more ways than the above.
For many years I have had, to say the least, a jaundiced view of the people
who work in Hollywood.  I earned that view through painful experience with
Hollywood producers.  So I assumed that the producers of PASSION would run
true to form.  I was totally mistaken.  Normally, the writer of the
original material is considered to be the person of least consquence
involved in the film.  But from the very beginning, Linda Wexelblatt and
Peter Crane, the on- line producers, sent me every draft of the script and
asked for my comments and suggestions, many of which were incorporated.
Except when they clearly knew better than I. I grew very fond of Linda and
Peter, but still I waited for the "Hollywood types" to appear.  I'm still
waiting.

I was so delighted when Marilyn Lewis, one of the executive producers, came
to the set.  She's the woman who took an option on Passion seven or eight
years ago, and fought like a tiger ever since to have it produced either as
a feature film or a television movie.  She and I spent considerable time
hugging each other and gloating.

It is remarkable that, where once the name "Ayn Rand" got doors slammed in
one's face, it now opens doors.  A major newspaper--that probably should be
nameless -- sent a reporter to the set.  She told me that her editor was a
fan of Ayn, which was why she had been given the assignment to cover the
shoot. It is a newspaper that has been out for blood with Ayn from the
moment she first picked up an American pen.  

It appears that we are becoming respectiable -- even mainstream!  I, for
one, will have to learn how to adjust to that, after years of being an
intellectual pariah.  Well, a lot of people worked very hard and very long
to reach this day.  But one doesn't always get what one has earned.  This
time, the fruits of our labors are everywhere to seen.

I feel enormously happy about what I saw in Toronto -- although I haven't
yet seen the first cut.  But Chris Menaul, who is anything but a fan of Ayn
philosophically, is a brilliant director, and I have little doubt that the
film will be very fine indeed.

I also feel very solemn about what I saw in Toronto.  One day, standing at
Chris' monitor and listening to Helen deliver lines from Galt's speech, I
realized, with no modesty whatever, that I had done for Ayn what no one
else was able to do.  I had written as honest and accurate a biography as I
knew how, and now, because of my work, the reality of Ayn's life would be
on national television in this country, and in movie theaters in Europe.
The real Ayn -- the woman who was so magnificent in her person and her
life, yet so tragically flawed, the woman who suffered so bitterly and
unjustly, yet was so seminal a genius in her philosophical thinking.  And I
thought: "I have kept my promises.  I have paid my debts."

There will be a premier of the film in Los Angeles before it is shown on
television. I certainly plan to be there.

Love,

Barbara

Dreaming is a way for the brain to function more efficiently by 
sifting the day's stimuli for novel or useful memories, comparing/ 
contrasting them with previously filed data, and shifting those 
selected for retention into longer-term storage (and dumping the 
rest) while it is disconnected (offline) from the cerebral load 
imposed by the exigencies of interaction with the perception-action 
manifold.  If we had to process our perceptions and react to them at 
the same time we selected for relevance and stored the selections, 
the cognitive complexity requirements of such massive multitasking 
would entail such massive brains that we would probably have to 
carry them around in wheelbarrows.   Joe

Uh, Roton is a supposedly low-maintenance SSTO; using rotors significantly
reduces the mass because you don't have to carry a lot of fuel to use for
the landing. A very large part of the cost of government launchers is the
cost of assembling the numerous stages, testing them, building parts with
extremely low probability of failure and then throwing them all away.

An SSTO can in principle be much cheaper because it's not thrown away, it
can land if there's an in-flight failure, and all you need to do to fly
it again is tow it to the launch pad, run the pre-flight checks and 
hook up the fuel lines. Obviously with a first-generation it's not going
to be as simple as flying a modern jet, but it should be much simpler
than any expendable launch vehicle in operation today.

So the rotors are a minor point except to the extent that they make it
a workable SSTO.

As far as I'm aware the shuttle's wings add a large amount to the cost 
and weight.

Hi,

I got 4 emails today from maps-forum@bigfoot.com inviting me to join

I was wondering if anyone else was likewise spamed.

	Forget dreaming for a moment!  Everything we are consciously
aware of while we are awake is a complete model or simulation of the
reality beyond our senses entirely constructed of phenomenal qualia.
That is why virtual reality works.  The proper stimulation of our
sensors via signals generated, not from reality, produces the
conscious representation of the VR world.

	There is no color, smell, sound, warmth... or pain beyond our
senses; only the electromagnetic radiation, chemical content,
acoustical vibrations, kinetic energy of molecules... and bodily
damage our brains merely arbitrarily represent with such phenomenon.
Obviously color, smell, sound, warmth, and so forth can also be caused
by computer generated stimulation of the proper neurons and this
proves they have nothing to do with what we usually think they are.

	These differing phenomenon, the ones we sense and our
conscious representations of them, though they do a good job of
representing each other, are nothing like each other.  One is the
initial cause of the cause and effect perception process and is beyond
our senses.  The other is the final result and inside our brain.  The
fact that we can dream, or produce very similar conscious awareness
worlds inside our brain without external input is simply yet more
proof of this.  What we experience or consciously know when we are not
sleeping is at least as much proof of the representational power of
our brain than what we experience in dreams.

	If you consciously know something, whether dreaming or not;
that, alone, is proof that your brain has the computational, or more
accurately the representational power, to simulate whatever it is you
know.  If you don't know it, you must not be representing it.  If you
do know it, that knowledge is in your brain.  The senses collect data
and from this produce a gloriously phenomenal conscious world or as
you called it an "artificial environment" inside your brain.  You
don't really know anything about what is beyond your senses.  After
all, for all you know, it might not really be there but only virtually
so.

        Yes, I have been sent three so far.  The caveat to their objectives
is their choice of words e.g.: "obtain governmental support" and
"psychodelic."  In any event, it doesn't sound too credible.

I've seen lots of discussion of superintelligence recently and I've read 
what articles I could find on the subject. I've seen lots of talk about 
computer power skyrocketing into the stratosphere, singularities, and 
the Cubs winning the pennant.

What I have not seen is talk about software. Where is the software for 
these superintelligent entities? Where is the software for 
human-intelligent entities? As far as I can tell, no one has a firm idea 
how the human brain/mind works. Are we jumping the gun here? Shouldnt we 
be talking more about the software? Right now the sequence I see us 
envisioning is:

Computing power reaches brain level computing
Nanotechnology matures to allow for the above computing power to work
AND THEN A MIRACLE OCCURS and we have the software
and VOILA! superintelligence!

I'm uncomtable with the MIRACLE thing. Anyone able to replace it?

A while back in a Wired article on wearable
computing ("Dress Code", Issue 6.04, Page 186)
Extropians were described as the "dark side". I
think it may have been mentioned on this list at
the time, did anyone contact the author, Thomas A.
Bass (tbass@hamilton.edu), and get a response?

"Attending the Media Lab event are a handful of
borgs who would love to hop into faster-that-light
space transport and dive straight into the
Clynesian future. They drift around the edge of
the party, wearing Japanese laptops strapped to
their chests and homemade keypads attached to
their wrists. When I try to chat with them, the
conversation keeps slipping into well-worn
grooves. They tell me they are Extropians, like
Hans Moravec and Timothy Leary, who are getting
ready to upload their psyches, jettison our
exhausted planet, and blast off for the
intergalactic frontier. They combine Buck Rogers
naivet with a wide streak of paranoia. They are
hungry for prostetics and yearning for time
travel. They shadow the party like doppelgangers,
reminding us that this technology has its dark
side. But no one at the symposium cares to look
under this particular rock or pay them much heed."

The roton rotor blades are also used for launching as well. The rocket engines
are supposed to be on the tips of the rotors, and the centrifugal forces
generated by the rocket propelled spin helps to feed the fuel to the motors, thus
eliminating the weight of fuel pumps and reducing the mechanical complexity of
the system (the highest maintenance parts of the space shuttle are the fuel
pumps). There is also an efficiency gain here. Since the chemical reaction of the
fuel propells the  rotor around (gradually rotating to full forward propulsion
beyond the atmosphere, kind of like how the V-22 Osprey rotates its wingtip
motors) and the rotor is using the reaction mass in the atmosphere, you gain a
bit of efficiency here. In propulsion, it is always more efficient to move a lot
of mass a little, rather than a little mass a lot  (those who think that
ion/plasma type drives are efficient are only right in that they are MASS
efficient, but definitely not energy efficient). Because of this setup, the roton
can fire up its rotor-tip engines when it lands in order to maneuver around if it
needs to for alternate landing sites, to counteract crosswinds, etc., which gives
it a bit more maneuverability than a normal autogyro.

The May 1998 issue of the American Economic Review (the most prestigious
economics journal) has on pp. 398-402 a short article by J. Hay and A. Shleifer 
on "Private Enforcement of Public Laws: A Theory of Legal Reform."  

They basically argue that public law enforcement is terrible in Russia now, and 
that Russia should try to rely mostly on private law enforcement in the near future.
The reason is that private parties have much better incentives than public officials
to enforce well.  

Of course they also claim without explanation that "public enforcement is surely the 
ultimate goal of any legal reform."  And even though they also admit that public 
officials have done a terrible job at defining law, they think private enforcement 
should be of publicly defined laws, because such laws "have a degree of legitimacy
that private rules do not,"  and because they for some reason think privatley created 
rules are not publicly visible to serve as coordination points.

	Very good point!  I agree with you and don't think the
mirricle is in the number of abstract mathematical calculations we can
perform or abstract data we can store.  Also, I don't think the
mirracle is software.  I believe the miricle is all in the phenomenal
(not just abstract) nature of our representations of information.

	I can look at a green thing.  I represent this with a green
qualia in my brain or mind.  I then look at something that reflects
700 nm light and represent this with a very different red quale.  I
can tell you what color it is.  There is not a lot of computation
going on in such a trivial process and knowledge representation.  No
complex software of any kind is required. Indeed, simple color
detecting machines at local paint stores do a much better job than we
do at this.  But, the key to our inteligence, is the powerful and
phenomenal nature of the red quale or sensation we use to represent
700 nm light as apposed to the absract, near meaningless way the color
detecting machine represents it.

	Once we discover the miricle of what red and it's fundamental
physical nature is, once we finally admit that it is something very
different and more than a mere abstract number representation (for
which the fundamental or physical nature of the representation is
irrelevent) and once we know, objectively, why green is different than
red...  Once we discover these kinds of phenomenal and intelligently
powerful things, and can create entities who's knowledge is
represented with the same kind of phenomenal stuff, in the same kind
of unified conscious world of knowledge, then we will finally
understand and be able to create true intelligence or machines that
really know and feel like the machine that is our brain does.

	I don't want a mega teraflop machine runing some infinitely
complex abstract software, I just want a simple color detecting device
that can realize that that red stuff it finally feels is much better
than the abstract, unconscious number representation it once used to
represent it's knowledge.  When we can finally do and recognize that
simple thing, I think that will be the mirricle that takes us to the
leap.

The same wavelength can appear to be different colors to the 
perceiver, depending upon such factors as ambient lighting and 
contiguous hues.  Until we deal with the holistic gestalt nature of 
perception in its own top-down terms and not in the atomically 
analytical fragmented manner we are accustomed to using, we will 
never approach an understanding of the process.   Joe

I cannot call it fake.  One of the real properties of what is "out there" 
must be to, when interacting with my apperceptive/cognitive system, 
produce what is "in here," in a pretty reliable and consistent cause 
and effect manner.  Otherwise, our representations would not 
possess their high positive survival value, and we'd all be dead. 
Interaction with the "out there", after all, is what produced the 
capacity to represent it "in here."   Evolution happens, and we 
cannot omit the fact of that dynamic dialectic process in our 
abstract "snapshot" reasoning.   Joe

It appears to me that there is a historical evolution of human cognition in
which the theological/religious phase gives way to a
metaphysical/philosophical phase and then a positivistic/scientific phase
and maybe now a synthetic phase in which a philosophy of science can provide
a self-chosen "existential" meaning to life and provide evidential answers
to what once could only be answered in religious or mystical terms.
The 4 etiological questions of origins:
1. How did the universe begin? (cosmogenesis)
2. How did life begin? (biogenesis)
3. How did humans get here? (anthropogenesis)
4. How did consciousness arrive? (psychogenesis)
responses:
1. Big Bang, inflationary cosmology, grand unified theories such as
superstrings, quantum gravity, supersymmetry, etc in astrophysics
2. pre-biotic chemical evolution of autocatalytic processes and
endosymbiosis (proposed by Lynn Margulis)
3. natural selection due to geological/environmental change, genetic drift
(e.g. a comet crash reducing photosynthetic food supply for large dinosaurs
but providing enough food for rodent sized mammals)
4. increased brain size, neoteny ("premature" birth) providing environmental
stimulation while the brain is still forming (less "hard wired")

I agree that religion should neither be endorsed nor condemned.  I think we
should by default answer all religiously oriented questions based on
scientific metaphysics (i.e. assumptions) not the mystical assumptions
(theological metaphysics) of the religious questioner.  Such questions
always devolve back to first principles which is the domain of metaphysics.

Having studied Eastern religions before getting involved in philosophy and
science, I can concur that Buddhism and Taoism are nontheistic.  However,
both of them are still mystical.  Taoism says that the universe or Tao
(literally the "Way") emerged from both Nothingness (T'ai) and
Everythingness (Chi).  The primordial T'ai Chi gave birth to Tao which then
polarized into the complementary forces of Yin and Yang.  These 2 forces
then interacting with the 5 Elements (Earth, Water, Air, Fire, and?
Ether)generate the manifested universe.  Sure there are no gods here but
still lots of mystical entities that are beyond measurement/evidence.
Similarly, Buddhism suggests that the samsara cycle of reincarnation can be
stopped by realizing the Nothingness of the universe (anicca) to eliminate
desire (dukka)and attain bliss/happiness called nirvana (or kenso).  More
mystical concepts. (Actually, lots of similarities huh? That's why Zen
emerged as a blend of Taoism and Buddhism - historical note)  Hinduism does
have many gods (polytheism) that are  manifestations of the universal god
Brahman [with the n](monotheism).  This theological/metaphysical dichotomy
is sort of like the Trinity in Catholicism. (Incidentally 3 of the Hindu
gods are primary making a clear trinitarian analogy - Brahma [without the
n], Vishnu and Shiva)

The point of this review of the eastern religions is to show how they are
not "more scientific" than any other religions on the planet just because
they in some cases have no god concept. One can argue that basic assumptions
such as the experimental method and hypothetico-deductive investigation are
unprovable.  That is the nature of first principles. Any system of thought
(religion, philosophy, science) has first principles that cannot be directly
argued for. Like postulates or axioms in a system of geometry, such are
either accepted - at least for the time being - or not.  If someone does not
accept the first principles of science then he or she is wasting his/her
time by pursuing dialogue with those who do accept these first principles.
There is simply no common cognitive ground for discussion.  For a more
detailed history of cognitive evolution see:

	Exactly!  But this apperition that "appears" to the perceiver,
or his knowledge, whether altered or not, is still something.  And
what this is is a quale.  True, ambient lighting and contiguous hues
can alter our neural processes resulting in the various different
particular apperitions that "appear" or the particular knowledge that
results, but what appears, or the perceivers knowledge is what it is.

	Yes, I can agree here.  Qualia isn't just a set of physical
blocks that our brain uses to build our conscious world of awareness.
The way it is all unified (i.e. I know that red is very different than
the smell of a rose...) is also important.

Yeah, just did. So he's essentially absorbed the old Delta Clipper team and
popped an autogyro on top and included his centrifugally fed engine
technology, but divorced it from the rotor (which to me was the most iffy
part of his original design anyways). So he still saves on fuel pump weight
and complexity, and reduced the flight regieme of the rotors so they won't be

I've heard this explanation before and it never satisfies me.  What does
this alleged daily sifting process have to do with the complex stories that
evolve, and the fact that dreams are often recurring? Dreams often have
nothing to do whatever with the days eevents.  I've even had dreams that
were purely aural; rich symphonic music that I feel certain I am
spontaneously composing.  This can easily happen on a day when I've heard no
music at all so what's being "sifted" here?

As for the lucid dreaming comment; I read a fascinating report about an
individual who was extraordinaryly good at it.  He was instructed to wait
until he entered a lucid dreaming state, and then to communicate that fact
to the waking world by tapping out his name in code with his finger and was
able to do it.  Imagine having conscious control of your dreams.  You could
do anything, be anyone, go anywhere.  Sound like fun?  They have devices
that are designed to induce lucid dreams for those who want to train
themselves.  I don't know whether they actually work or not.

Yes.  Not only that, it claimed that they had some Extropian subscribers
already, and that they and the Extropy Institute shared many of the same
goals.  It came very close to *implying* ExI support, which I doubt
realy exists.  It stopped short of saying anything specific, however.

It seems a major thing about space travel is the high temperature re-entry.
Why not not slow the craft down before re-entry?  like before we re-enter, use
a saved amount of fuel and blast in the opposite direction, and just kinna
free-fall back into earth.

We impose narrative order on the succession of images.  Recurring 
dreams probably have to do with the pre-existing substrate 
memories being compared with the day's events.  This substrate 
changes, as experiences accumulate, but slowly.  As for the music, 
Ive heard it, too; and most of the time I'm not strictly asleep, but in 
the borderline hypnogogic state.  I'm unsure of its cause, but it does 
serve to remind that there is more to both perception and memory 
than image.

The Fifth Miracle: The Search for the Origin of Life
By Paul Davies, Allen Lane, 260pp, $A35
ISBN: 0 7139 9215 8

Reviewed by Damien Broderick


For a decade, Paul Davies has been an Australian national treasure. Before
that, he was a British national treasure who fled Thatcher's UK because its
scientifically trained Prime Minister was so mean to science (and to
everyone else).  He found a home at the University of Adelaide as Professor
of Theoretical Physics, publishing controversial books on science, until
his colleagues persuaded him that a chair as Professor of Natural
Philosophy might be more to the university's taste.  

Now, having collected the nearly two million dollar Templeton Prize for
reconciling the ways of God to physics, he signs himself (in one of his
many generous introductions to other people's books) simply `Cosmologist
and author'.  It's hard to know if he was run out of the lab on a rail by
indignant atheists, or removed himself to his South Australian country
property the better to produce an endless stream of splendid popular
science books on topics ranging from the new physics, the origins and
destiny of the universe, complexity theory, extraterrestrial and more
homely life and, notoriously, the Mind of God.

He has had the good fortune to find an immense public audience for his
ideas.  Seeing yet another Davies book in the stores, some have been heard
muttering at his prolificity.  That is unfair.  In the ring with the
Hemingway of science writing, Isaac Asimov (who published hundreds of
admirable books on a score of topics), Davies and his competitors are
modest striplings.  

What's more, Paul Davies has taken the trouble to know his stuff, even when
- as in this case - he is writing away from his field. His gift is to
synthesise knowledge from unlikely patches and convey it in clear, plain
language, sometimes theatrical yet somehow measured and comforting.  Davies
at 50-something can put you in mind of an earnest, wryly clever schoolboy
explaining hard things to his interested Mum. 

None of this really explains his great and startling success as a popular
writer.  His own research topics are arcane.  The scandal in his eminence,
surely, is the suspicion that the crypto-theological loading of his titles
is what sucks in hundreds of thousands of readers who have never picked up
a calculator for any task more gruelling than totting up the weekly bills.

Here is a scientist in good standing whose books (when they are not called
The Forces of Nature or The Physics of Time Asymmetry by P. C. W. Davies)
have eerily New Age titles: The Cosmic Blueprint The Edge of Infinity God
and the New Physics The Mind of God and now The Fifth Miracle These titles
are not exactly misleading, since Davies has moved from atheism to a
religious understanding of the world - though not the kind you'd be likely
to hear at the local parish - via physics and now biology.  

Yet they are at least somewhat disingenuous, all the way to the bank.
Dreaming up titles with this ambiguity makes a tasty parlour game: Crystal
Light Energy (on lasers), Maxwell's Demon! (on thermodynamics), The Shroud
of Turing (on artificial intelligence)...

Consider these remarks from The Fifth Miracle a title Davies presumably
chose or at least authorised.  `I am not suggesting that the origin of life
actually was a miracle' (p. xxi).  `Science rejects true miracles' (p. 52).
 `For many scientists, biological determinism is tantamount to a miracle in
nature's clothing' (p. 219).  But note the slipping and sliding.  What
Davies means by `biological determinism' is not Creation Science, say, but
traditional deity-free reductionism.  

If life formed by sheer accident, Davies is saying, that in itself is a
statistical miracle of biblical proportions.  And if it happened because
the universe is congenial to life, then something wonderful awaits us in
the deepest equations: `a self-organizing and self-complexifying universe,
governed by ingenious laws that encourage matter to evolve towards life and
consciousness.  A universe in which the emergence of thinking beings is a
fundamental and integral part of the overall scheme of things.  A universe
in which we are not alone.'

Not alone?  Davies means alien intelligence is likely elsewhere in the
cosmos, emerged without miracles and developed into its conscious estate by
Darwinian selection.  But one would be excused at seeing our reprieve from
loneliness (reading between the lines only too easily) as the Hand if not
the Mind of God, reaching down to cup us in our apparent contingency, our
cosmic lack of meaning.  Most non-scientific readers, I suspect, will take
spiritual succour from such words.  Perhaps that is what Davies intends,
but his explicit claims are always carefully protected by provisos and
cautions.

Despite these concerns, the book is a very fine example of accessible
writing on new science.  Davies has scoured the relevant journals, cites
each item sparingly but with pith, poses one intriguing argument against
another in a crescendo of logic and intellectual excitement.  Life, we once
supposed, coalesced in a warm pond or thin organic soupy ocean on the early
earth, perhaps 3.8 billion years ago.  Now that seems unlikely, and the new
prime habitats are infernal or celestial.  Life might have started deep
beneath a crust relentlessly bombarded by ruinous debris from space - or
fallen from the heavens, in comet-borne spores or meteorites hurled up from
the surface of Mars, then more hospitable to life than our own poor smashed
planet.

The details of each alternative are fascinating and copious.  Davies tells
his tale like a postmodern detective story with elective endings.  That is
just, since it is plainly too soon to know not only how the story comes
out, but how it started, and where.  Davies' own solution emerges at the
very boundaries of current theory.  As well as spacetime and mass-energy,
he argues, information itself must be fundamental, creating altogether
distinctive kinds of causation until now overlooked by reductive science.

This means `accepting that information is a genuine physical quantity that
can be traded by "informational forces" in the same way that matter can be
moved around by physical forces.'  It is a bold proposal, echoed in papers
only now emerging from quantum theorists and experimenters.  I just hope it
doesn't lead to Paul Davies' next book being called Quantum Angels. 

================================
Damien Broderick's next book is called Not the Only Planet an sf anthology
from Lonely Planet.

I find this an odd use of "mean". Thatcher was mean only in the sense that
she wanted to steal less money from tax-payers to give to scientists
feeding at the public trough. I'd like to see *more* "meanness" of this
kind. I'd rather scientists receive funding because they can persuade
people to give them money voluntarily.

On the other hand, perhaps I should complain about how mean the government
is not to hand out free money to philosophers.

Take it up with Prof Davies.  This is his opinion, paraphrased.  I'm not a
scientist.  It's true, though, that I find this `public trough' rhetoric
jejune; as I understand it, Watson and Crick cracked the DNA code while
gorging at that trough.

I'd have thought that nearly all the philosophers in both the UK and the
USA are state funded, except for those in seminaries, private universities,
and a few self-funded people like Max.  I get by that way myself, at least
to the extent that my meagre earnings from numerous books, reviews, etc get
topped up by the odd grant.  If I were an anarcho-capitalist, I suppose I'd
have to go off and hang myself in remorse.  Since I'm not, and since I am
ceaselessly productive in several useful genres that don't yet attract
enough income by direct sale of rights, private donation or subsidy, I'm
grateful for the mediated support (modest though it is, compared with what
I could be earning if I spent my time instead on TV sitcoms or advertising
geegaws) from the taxpayers of my nation.  I believe I pay them back more
than adequately in my productivity.  But I see that we venture here on the
forbidden ground of Basics, so I will say no more.

I agree; philosophical R & D is much farther from a monetary payoff 
than scientific R & D (this even holds true for pop science vs. pop 
philosophy books).  Nevertheless, all science has of necessity 
philosophical underpinnings, philosophical speculations inspire 
scientific experiments, and the results of scientific experimentation 
are taken into account during philosophical revision.

The discordance stems from trying to combine two connotations -- concept and
project -- into one title.  How about one of the following:

        Transhumanist Forecasts
        Transhumanist Scenarious
        Transhumanist Endeavors

I frequently have lucid dreams.  For those who don't know, lucid dreams occur
when you realize that you are dreaming.  This is very much like VR, in that
everything seems real, even though you know it isn't.

Lucid dreams seem very real to me.  I have devised tests to tell if I am
lucidly dreaming, because the dreams are realistic.  I almost always have
realistic dreams.  I am surprised when some people here say dreams are not
realistic enough to be VR.

It is very easy to learn to have lucid dreams.  I have taught some techniques
in the past, and people seem to have good results.  First, one must learn to
remember your dreams.  Everybody dreams, but they often are not remembered.
The reason for this is that the mind discards dreams as unimportant.  If you
have had the experience of waking up from a nightmare or a strange dream, and
then after a few minutes not being able to remember what it was about, you have
experienced this temporary memory function.  The brain normally does not
transfer dreams into medium-term storage or mark them for long-term storage.
The way to make yourself remember the dreams is to write them down as soon as
you wake up.  If you don't write them down, at least go through them in your
mind trying to memorize the details.  If you doubt this practice, test it for
yourself.  As soon as you wake up, try to count the dreams you remember and
memorize that number.  Later in the day, you probably will remember the number,
but have no memory of ever dreaming.  With practice, you can learn to remember
your dreams.  Most people don't, because they don't care about the dreams.  An
interest in dreams makes them rememberable.

After one starts regularly dreaming, the trick is to start having lucid dreams.
This is easy.  Invent a test for determining if you are dreaming.  My test is
to trace my memory back throughout the day.  I am typing at my computer now, I
remember coming into the room, I watched the news on TV before that, I had
sushi out with my lover before that.... etc.  I have a chain of memory
stretching back in time.  In dreams, there is no chain of memory because you
start a dream from scratch.  If you find that you are in a room, but can't
remember how you got there, it could be a lucid dream.  Trying to make objects
float by staring at them is good.  Try closing your eyes and visualizing
another locations, and then opening your eyes to see if the dream changed.  Or
invent an object or person to be found behind you, and turn around to see if it
really appears.  It is much more difficult to make things move or change while
you are looking at them, even in a dream.  Some part of the mind tries to hold
the dream realistic and consistent.

One you determine a test to see if you are dreaming, the next step is to
perform this test inside a dream.  The trick here is to test yourself to see if
you are dreaming all the time.  Do this many times a day, and as often as you
think about it.  After a day or two, this habit will appear in a dream.  You
will dream that you are performing this random test.  Inside the dream, you
will perform the test and hopefully realize that you are dreaming.

Once you realize you are dreaming, you can try to take control of the dream.
Trying to float up or fly is a common dream.  Sexual dreams are also popular
with lucid dreamers.  Anything you would like to experience in VR, can be
simulated in a dream.  For safety reasons, and sheer cowardice, I never risk
bodily injury in a dream, even if I am sure I am dreaming.  For example, I
would never jump off a cliff.  I would float up in the air, and after I verify
my ability to levitate, I would fly over a cliff.  Although it sounds like
dreams and reality can become confused, I have never thought that I was
dreaming when I was really awake.  Likewise, I have never dreamed that I tested
my dream and determined that it was not a dream.

There are many interesting tests to do while dreaming.  One is to communicate
to the outside world while you are dreaming.  This is very hard to do because
sleep paralysis keeps the body immobile while dreaming.  The eyes can move,
however, and creating code signals with eyes is very possible.  One note about
sleep paralysis, is that some people can remain conscious between dreaming and
waking up.  They become aware of their body before the sleep paralysis fully
goes away.  This causes semi-dreams where you are scared and can't move.  This
is a normal part of dreaming and sleep that most people don't experience.
Lucid dreamers sometimes can wake up (by regaining consciousness prematurely)
and experience their body in sleep-paralysis.

One trick reported in Omni (I think) for lucid dreaming, is that if you start
to wake up and want to remain asleep, they suggested spinning.  They said they
did not know why it worked.  My theory is that spinning changes your field of
view, and that the portions of the brain producing the VR image must kick in to
create new images.  I find that any movement of changing of dream images will
help me slip back into the dream state when I am waking up.

Outside noises or lights can be incorporated into the dream.  Telephone ringing
or alarm clock noises will be heard inside the dream and incorporated into the
dream.  Sometimes someone can talk to you, and you can hear what they are
saying inside your dream.  Sometimes you can answer, but due to sleep
paralysis, your words are usually garbled.  The fact that outside influences
can be incorporated into a dream makes me think that it might be possible to
have a VR simulation in a dream, with the dream design being fed in from an
outside source.  How many people have become so engrossed in a book, that you
look up and realize that you are reading a book, although for a while you were
almost living the story?  This is common, because the brain presents all data
to the consciousness as "reality".  The brain can also take its data from other
sources and present it to the brain, also as "reality".  I also find that it
takes no conscious effort to keep a dream going.  Once I create an object in a
dream, it continues on in my experience without any conscious effort on my part
to continue visualizing it.  I am very interested in using the dream state as
VR.

Real work and thoughts can be organized inside a dream.  I once tested this by
creating a new story plot in a dream.  I invented characters, outline of the
plot, and some specific points for the story.  When I woke up, I indeed
remembered my creation, which I had never thought up before.  Lucid dreaming is
too unpredictable for me to regularly do work or planning.  I have had
emergency situations where I was working around the clock, and when I finally
had to get some sleep, I finished solving some design problems in my head, and
had a working design fix when I woke up.

Sometimes dreams are distorted.  Sometimes a good solution worked up in a dream
will appear stupid when you wake up.  I also tested my "photographic memory"
capability in a dream.  I looked at some sine tables and randomly memorized
some values.  When I work up, the numbers were totally random and nonsensical.
I did not remember the correct tables, even though I have seen them many times.
I have performed complex mathematical problems in my head, imagining working on
paper in a dream, and found the result to be correct when I woke up.  I once
multiplied 1234567890 by 987654321 on paper in a dream and memorized the
result.  When I woke up, I wrote down the answer and worked it out to find that
I was correct.  So, sometimes dreams are distorted, but at other times the
lucidity seems to be the realistic consciousness capable of logical and regular
thought.

Sorry for all the rambling.  As you can guess, I have been lucid dreaming all
my life.  Although this borders on new-age mysticism, I assure you that dreams
are real, and realizing that you are dreaming is a normal and logical
possibility for the brain.  I started lucid dreaming as a child.  I used to
watch horror movies and then have nightmares about them.  Often, I would
recognize the monster and remember the movie, and often even the book the movie
was based on.  I would instantly realize that I was dreaming and the monster
wasn't real.  Although I usually just woke myself up from nightmares, I soon
learned to recognize other dreams, or change nightmares into pleasant dreams.
I believe that nightmares are a common way for some lucid dreamers to recognize
their dreams.  Many people have had nightmares where they realized it was just
a nightmare.

Sometimes dreams get strange.  I have only had a few non realistic dreams, like
on TV, with fog and distorted views.  All my dreams are in color and normal
looking.  There is a type of dreaming, when you first fall asleep, where there
are random images and sounds that are incoherent.  Dream researchers think that
these random flashes are neurons randomly firing during sleep, and that the
brain later starts sorting them out into a coherent theme.  I have had a few
dreams that I swear lasted for days or weeks, and woke up with very little time
having passed.  Most researchers think dreams progress at normal time speed,
although the dream often skips scenes, like on TV, so that you skip into a
future scene remembering that time has passed, even though you didn't
experience the time passage directly.  Some people will swear that you cannot
feel pain in a dream.  I have done it and insist that you can.  Some people
have reported being killed in their dream.  I have never dreamed that I was
killed or dead.  On researcher tried to tell me that you can't see changes in
brightness in a dream, but I tried it and insist that there are light intensity
differences.  It is reported that some people dream in black and white.  I
always have dreamed in color.  Durk Pearson and Sandy Shaw reported that 1
milligram of vitamin B12 a half hour before bedtime increases dream color
intensity.  I have seen some effect of this, but rarely.  (I take B-12
regularly anyway.)  Some people report that melatonin causes more violent
dreams or more nightmares or disturbing dreams.  My own (unscientific) studies
shows that melatonin helps people remember their dreams, but that the content
of the dreams don't change much.  The people who reported such dreams, who
later reported that they went away after ceasing melatonin supplementation,
would report the same kinds of dreams if I asked them about their dreams
immediately upon awaking.  They usually just forget their dreams.

That's my ramblings and comments about lucid dreams.  I don't know if they are
useful for anything.  They are fun to play around with.  I have a great respect
for the brain's ability to do amazing things.  Running a VR inside one's own
brain by using lucid dreaming techniques, seems an extropian thing to do.
Since we cannot do it consciously, it implies that we still have much to learn
about the brain and how to tap into it.

Title
  The use of a whey
  protein concentrate in the
  treatment of patients with metastatic carcinoma: a phase I-II clinical study.
Source
  Anticancer Research.  15(6B):2643-9, 1995 Nov-Dec.
Abstract
  Glutathione (GSH) concentration is high in most tumour cells and this may be
  an important factor in resistance to chemotherapy. Previous
  in-vitro and animal experiments have shown a differential response of tumour
  versus normal cells to various cysteine delivery systems. More specifically,
  an in-vitro assay showed that at concentrations that induce GSH
  synthesis in normal human cells, a specially prepared
  whey protein concentrate,
  Immunocal, caused GSH depletion and inhibition of
  proliferation in human breast cancer cells. On the basis of
  this information five patients with metastatic carcinoma of
  the breast, one of the pancreas and one of
  the liver were fed 30 grams of this whey
  protein concentrate daily for six months.
  In six patients the blood lymphocyte GSH levels were
  substantially above normal at the outset, reflecting high
  tumour GSH levels. Two patients (:1, :3) exhibited signs of tumour
  regression, normalization of haemoglobin and peripheral lymphocyte counts and
  a sustained drop of lymphocyte GSH levels towards normal. Two patients (:2,
  :7) showed stabilisation of the tumour, increased
  haemoglobin levels. In three patients (:4, :5, :6,) the
  disease progressed with a trend toward higher lymphocyte GSH levels.
  These results indicate that whey
  protein concentrate might deplete tumour
  cells of GSH and render them more vulnerable to
  chemotherapy.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a nutritional supplement of
  selenium will decrease the incidence of cancer. DESIGN: A
  multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled cancer prevention
  trial. SETTING: Seven dermatology clinics in the eastern United States.
  PATIENTS: A total of 1312 patients (mean age, 63 years; range, 18-80 years)
  with a history of basal cell or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin were
  randomized from 1983 through 1991. Patients were treated for a mean (SD) of
  4.5 (2.8) years and had a total follow-up of 6.4 (2.0) years. INTERVENTIONS:
  Oral administration of 200 microg of selenium per day or
  placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary end points for the trial were the
  incidences of basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. The secondary
  end points, established in 1990, were all-cause mortality and total cancer
  mortality, total cancer incidence, and the incidences of lung, prostate, and
  colorectal cancers. RESULTS: After a total follow-up of 8271 person-years,
  selenium treatment did not significantly affect the
  incidence of basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer. There were 377 new
  cases of basal cell skin cancer among patients in the
  selenium group and 350 cases among the control group
  (relative risk [RR], 1.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95-1.28), and 218
  new squamous cell skin cancers in the selenium group and 190
  cases among the controls (RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.93-1.39). Analysis of secondary
  end points revealed that, compared with controls, patients treated with
  selenium had a nonsignificant reduction in all-cause
  mortality (108 deaths in the selenium group and 129 deaths
  in the control group [RR; 0.83; 95% CI, 0.63-1.08]) and significant
  reductions in total cancer mortality (29 deaths in the
  selenium treatment group and 57 deaths in controls [RR,
  0.50; 95% CI, 0.31-0.80]), total cancer incidence (77 cancers in the
  selenium group and 119 in controls [RR, 0.63; 95% CI,
  0.47-0.85]), and incidences of lung, colorectal, and prostate cancers.
  Primarily because of the apparent reductions in total cancer mortality and
  total cancer incidence in the selenium group, the blinded
  phase of the trial was stopped early. No cases of selenium
  toxicity occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Selenium treatment did not
  protect against development of basal or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin.
  However, results from secondary end-point analyses support the hypothesis
  that supplemental selenium may reduce the incidence of, and
  mortality from, carcinomas of several sites. These effects of
  selenium require confirmation in an independent trial of
  appropriate design before new public health recommendations regarding
  selenium supplementation can be made

When you are dreaming, and you know that you are dreaming, 
the next task is to assert control over your dream.  The technique 
that worked for me was to will my dream hands to rise in front of my 
dream face where I could see them with my dream eyes.  Once I 
was able to assert this feedback-verifiable control, I simply 
generalized to other motions and visions.  Hope this helps,  Joe

This is also extremely basic stuff.

The spacecraft is already "just kinda" in free fall.

A ballistic object moving sideways at a speed at or above five miles
a second never hits the earth because the Earth's surface "falls" at at 
least the same rate the object does (no fair pointing the object so it
hits).

Every gram of propellant you orbit has to be accelerated to 5 or
more miles a second. That's expensive. Remember $10,000 a pound?
And then, 5 miles a second of of delta vee would necessitate a very
large amount of propellant having been orbited per gram of ship returned.
Somebody (Michael?) work the numbers here--I'm too tired.

If you have a beanstalk, you can get to orbit for not much more than the
cost of electricity; and you can go up or down as slowly as you please.
Good luck building the beanstalk.

I agree that better organization and communication like this would be a
great idea.  These working groups (WGs) could most logically be coordinated
by the World Transhumanist Association (WTA).  WTA members of the Foresight
Institute, Prometheus Project, National Space Society, etc. can make monthy
reports on a News page of the Journal of Transhumansit Studies (JTS).  (BTW,
a monthly e-mail of the JTS to members would be really convenient or at
least a message with table of contents and links to the features and stories
with summaries maybe.)

In some web surfing recently I came across this link:

    <A HREF="http://www.ceri.com/">Cognitive Enhancement Research Institute
</A> 

    http://www.ceri.com/

Anyone here able to vouch for this outfit's bona fides?

I've also encountered marketing for a life-extension supplement marketed under
the trade name Gero-Vita or GH-3.  This product claims to be based on the work
of a "Dr. Ana Aslan, director of the Institute of Geriatrics in Bucharest,
Rumania."  There's a very large amount of material on the web about this, and
I'm sure folks more up on the anti-aging nutrient world will have some

Hm.  This isn't at all obvious; after all, you might

I don't understand what the difference here is.

Yes, this to has bothered me.  The advances in hardware seem predictable and
on track, but given the bug ridden examples of SW we now see, it looks like
the SW problems might be harder.
Do any SW gurus on the list have any Morvec like graphs indicating the
progress in SW algorithms?  Anyone that uses windoze should have their doubts.
I think that some sort of self replicating/self generating SW is needed with
an evolutionary correction/redundancy built in will be necessary.  Any
progress in this area?

  Max, this is a _travesty_ of what Thatcher did, and why.  Taxes 
_increased_ under Thatcher (so she had no problems with 'stealing' money 
from people); while 25% of British manufacturing industry (the sort of 
private outfits who might employ scientists -- although few actually do) 
just disappeared, crushed out of existence by high interest rates and a 
continuation of ruthless bureaucratic oppression.  GNP growth was 
negligible -- all the suffering was for nothing.  A cruel hoax.


  (Politicians will always tax to the maximum; all that ever changes is who 
  gets the money.  You can campaign for tax reductions (which only the 
  rich will ever get); or you can campaign for your slice of the pie.  
  Guess what makes better sense effort-wise).

  What _did_ change 'radically' is the _identity of the beneficiaries_ of 
those feeding at the public trough; with a radical skewing towards the 
already better-off (i.e. the beneficiaries of past injustices).  I can't 
think of _any_ libertarians or honest entrepreneurs who are better off as 
a result of the Thatcher years.  Ask Chris Tame.

  As well you might!  
  
  [A] The Thatcher cutbacks made it well-nigh impossible for philosophy 
  lecturers you might approve of to find a place to teach, while all the 
  existing lecturing remained stuffed with Statists of various hues.  Some 
  of the philosophy lecturers locked out of posts thusly include people 
  whose names will be familiar to you.  You will remember that 
  Universities are primararily there to provide credentials and entry 
  papers to a ruling elite in a hierarchical Statist society.
  
  [B] There's a 'public-goods' trap in asking for money to promote our 
  ideas.  People think: "If these people succeed, they'll succeed anyway, 
  without my help.  And I'll get the benefits regardless.  Whereas if they 
  fail, I'll have wasted my money."

  [C] As we found when fund-raising for anti-tax campaigns in 1979 
  onwards, the rich said 'Who's paying taxes anyway?  Shaddup!!".  >:-} 
  The moderately well off didn't want to risk reprisals from the Revenue 
  Service; and everyone else pointed to the public-goods trap mentioned 
  earlier.  Or their eyes glazed over.

  
>Meany Max

  Not mean, Max, just unthinking.  95% of all the medical scientists and 
  technologists who ever lived are alive and working right now.  Ditto for 
  other scientists and technologists who provide the backbone, the impetus 
  and the detailed support for your entire programme!  Now guess who's 
  paying them.
  
  Why you should want to bring your entire Extropian programme to a 
  grinding halt, followed by rapid reverses as the vital expertise is 
  lost, is anyone's guess.  You _do want_ your programme to succeed, don't 
  you, Max?  Preferably in your own lifetime?  >:-}   You're not perchance

I think genetic programming will lend itself to this treatment.

But outside of that, software development groups need to use already existing
testing methodologies to reduce errors.  See, e.g., Myer's _The Art of Software
Testing_, an oldie but a doogie.

Im sorry I dont understand what you're saying.  If you go 6 miles above sea

slow the ballistic object down before entering the atmosphere?  Thats what I

Now that you mention the recognition of colours, I just thought that a
friend of mine, who works in an industrial setting, is building a machine to
sort potatoes. He does it by running the slowly rotating potatoes on a
conveyor belt by a camera which then scans the entire surface of the potato.

The interresting part is that they are using neural networks and fuzzy logic
to sort the potatoes. (about 75.000 a minute) First they made a neural net
that looked for everythin at once. Green spots, size, dark spots, rot etc.
etc. But they found out that they got much better and more controllable
results by having a neural net that looked for each of these thing
seperately and then compared their results to see wether it was a god or bad
potato.

Another eksample of a system with relatively small and simples parts that
works together for a complex result.

Agreed, it just seems beyond human ability to create software
from scratch to be able to do everything we've evolved to be
able to do. Some AI teams (such as in Japan) are now
experimenting with evolving subhuman AI creations...

I think the only path to a human-level AI will be to evolve
it inside of a totally realistic VR simulation, which mimics
how we came to be, just a whole lot faster (hopefully). This
was demoed in Egan's Permutation City.

 My understanding is that GH-3 is effectively the same as a supplement marketed by
Twinlabs as DMAE H3 dimethylaminoethanol and PABA. Available in tablets or (my
choice 'cause you can put it in coffee--the coffee kills the taste and gives you a
synergistic boost. I've been taking the stuff for years. I've been taking a large
dose of pantothenic acid followed ( not less than to 2 hours later) by a couple of
droppers of DMAE H3 in a cup of coffee. They react with one another to form
acetylcholine. Gives you a decent memory boost or anti-drowsiness substance. The
two hour wait is needed so that they don't react in your stomach. (gut pain like
the flu) Side effects include the previously mentioned stomach pain if you're not
careful. Also if you have any tendenancy toward myospastic back or torticolis you
might want to take it real easy as the combination increases muscle tone bodywide,
along the spine in particular. Headache is another common side effect. You can
adapt to the combination if you gradually increase your dosage, that minimizes the
negative effects.
 As for CERI I only know what I read, but I found the same website as you just a
few weeks ago. After reading the interviews and articles about treating
Parkinsonism with antioxidants and the article that explores the biochemistry
behind that therapy, I resolved to try a similar shotgun of antioxidants approach
on myself. I have no major illnesses, but I will turn 50 on my next birthday and
although I've been taking a fair amount of vitamins (C, E, multiple vitamin and
mineral supplements, the DMAE) I'd started to notice that my long, stressful
workdays ( I do MRI scans to put food on the table) were beginning to take their
toll on me. I picked up abottle of something called Super 10 Antioxidant by
Country Life. Has most of the compounds mentioned in the article and I added some
Lipoic acid and decided to take 1/2 gm of Pantothenic acid each time I took the
other two.
 For me, that combination works like nothing else I've ever tried. My energy level
is up as a rough guess between 30 to 50 %. The effect is not that of a stimulant,
it feels more like that of an antidote. I've experienced what feels like an
increase in my metabolism--I feel hotter but the thermometer says that I have the
old 98.6. The mix doesn't appear to induce a fever, just increase energy
production by reducing free radical mitochondrial damage. I run for fitness and my
running performance is up. One warning, I'd been taking that DMAE on a regular
basis-- after starting on the antioxidant mix I found that I had to lower my
intake of DMAE quite a bit. It works too well? with that in the mix and the effect
goes from wonderful to unpleasant. Hope I was of help.

If you read the paragraphs that follow the one you quoted, you will see my
response to that question. I'll try to explain the same facts a different way.

To do what you suggest necessitates treating reentry to Earth surface as if
Earth were an airless planet. This means that every gram of spacecraft has
to have all its orbital velocity removed by a rocket engine and propellant
carried up to orbit. 

Right?

Well, heck, how hard can that be?

Here's a somewhat simplified example to help guide your intuition: 

Let's say you wanted to use a rocket engine to stop a car moving 5 mph
(miles per HOUR). Suppose your computations yielded a result that suggested
you only had to burn _one pound_ of propellant to accomplish this. Great.

How much propellant would it take to stop the same car going _5 miles a
SECOND_?

Based only on kinetic energy being proportional to velocity squared, it
would take (3600)^2 times as much propellant. That works out to 12,960,000
pounds of propellant used in a rocket with the same specific impulse as the
first example.

Now how much did it cost you to orbit those thirteen million pounds of
propellant you are using to slow the car back down? 

Oh, only $10,000 a pound. 
Or 129.6 billion dollars. 
For each car you want to deorbit.

So you see it costs a lot to do that. Too much, even if my back of the
envelope figures are wrong by a factor of a thousand, and I doubt they are.

Alternate scenarios:
1) Come up with much more efficient propulsion, or don't use regular
rockets, or both, and the numbers change. Nuclear propulsion, Rotons,
beanstalks, laser launch... they're all considered far out today, so
they're hard to fund.

2) Come up with a low enough ballistic coefficient, and reentry can be
induced so gradually that heating is minimized. Like a biiig dandelion
seed. But you'd have to manufacture such structures in space, as we have no
practical way of orbiting them today.

President Extropy Institute (ExI)

 Extropy = the extent of a system's intelligence, information, vitality,
diversity,
 opportunity, and capacity for growth.


E X T R O P Y I N S T I T U T E

Extropy Institute (ExI) is a 501[c][3] tax-exempt educational corporation,
founded in 1992 as an outgrowth of the Extropy journal. ExI acts a catalyst
for
a better future by helping individuals extend their lives, augment their
intelligence, optimize their psychology, and improve their communities. The
Institute pursues this catalytic role in two ways: through a creative process
of networking and an educational process of disseminating ideas.

In its creative role, the Institute brings together the finest critical and
innovative minds in an intellectual and social network. This network of
thinkers challenges conventional ideas about human limits and develops new
ideas about the use of technologies of all kinds to improve the future.
Seeking
to develop careful thinking about extending the human life span, augmenting
human intelligence, improving human psychology, and refining economic and
political organization, Extropy Institute provides several forums for
networking and creative thinking. The Exponent newsletter gathers news of
developments, members' projects, and Institute activities. The EXTRO
conferences bring together thinkers from numerous fields of study. Other
seminars and local meetings, the Extropians email list, and the web site
provide additional forums for developing and refining ideas.

In its educational role, the Institute brings these (always open and evolving)
extropian ideas to the public in order to encourage more rational practices
and
beliefs. The Institute's web site provides information on extropian thinking
and links to further resources. Extropy Online presents extropian thinking
gathered from the best minds in a manner accessible to intelligent
non-specialists. The EXTRO conferences, in addition to their networking role,
also act as a means of communicating current extropian thinking to the public.
The Institute disseminates ideas and educates the public through
appearances of
its members on television and in newspapers, magazines, and books, and by
representing extropian perspectives at conferences and in debates.

In essence, the Institute seeks to catalyze continual discoveries that extend
our lives and increase the power and depth of our minds. While Institute
members may hold diverse and sometimes conflicting ideas about how to pursue
these ends, we agree in affirming the values expressed in the Extropian
Principles: Boundless Improvement, Self-Transformation, Self-Ownership,
Dynamic
Optimism, Intelligent Technology, and Spontaneous Order. [see
www.extropy.org/extprn26.htm]


E X T R O P I A N S O N T H E N E T

Extropy Institute sponsors a number of forums for sharing limit-busting,
life-extensionist, pro-technology, and other extropian ideas with bright,
like-minded individuals around the globe.

You can also access the Frequently Asked Questions file, and other Extropian
writings, on the World Wide Web. The official ExI Web page:
 http://www.extropy.org

The most popular service is the Extropians e-mail list (founded in 1991),
which
boils over with lively discussion and debate on numerous topics. You can join
the members-only list by sending a message to:
 extropians-request@extropy.org

A Hypermail archive of postings to the Extropian list can be found at:
 http://www.lucifer.com/extropians/

N O D E N E T
ExI is creating a network of specialized email forums (NodeNet). These each
focus on a particular topic, such as life extension research, neural-computer
interfaces, future forecasting, investing in the future, data security, mind
uploading, personality alteration, economic effects of technology, creativity
and the arts, truth machines and privacy, data security, and others. Extropy
Institute members can subscribe to these forums free of charge. The NodeNet
forums are organized so as to maximize useful discussion, information, and
analysis. The unique perspective and expertise of the forums makes them a
major
benefit of ExI membership. You can find information on current forums on the
web site at www.extropy.org/nodenet.htm.


 E X T R O P Y O N L I N E

Moving to the web in its tenth year, Extropy is a magazine covering the full
range of advanced, emerging, and future technologies with an emphasis on how
the individual and society can and will adapt and profit from these
developments.

Since 1988, Extropy magazine has provided a forum for thinking and discussion
about the advancing wave of scientific and technological progress and its
impact on humanity. Extropy's interests are multi-disciplinary and
cross-disciplinary. As fascinated as we are with the technologies driving
change, we are essentially concerned with the relationship between
technological advance and philosophical, creative, cultural, psychological,
economic, interpersonal and political ideas and institutions. Just some of the
technologies and issues covered in Extropy Online: 

* Advances in computers and human-computer interaction and integration. 
* Intelligence augmentation through nutrients, new smart drugs, and cognitive
techniques. 
* Life extension treatments, nutritional supplements, the latest anti-aging
drugs. 
* Exploration of our conception of "human nature" in a world transformed by
advancing biotechnology. 
* Applying critical and creative thining to living successfully in times of
rapid and deep technological change. 
* Refining political and social organizations to adapt and prosper in an
environment of accelerating change. 
* Rethinking traditional moralities in the face of scientific and
technological

breakthroughs. 
* Modifying mood and motivation with new drugs and cognitive management. 
* Identifying and analyzing poor thinking about the desirability and
applications of radical new technologies. 

If you're tired of shallow, trendy, or uncritical thinking on the
technological
frontier, Extropy will satisfy, startle, and stimulate you. 

 "I love it. Extropy excites the hell out of my mind." ZL, 1/93

 "In general I would call it the best periodical I have ever seen in my
life..." AC, 8/92

 "I just wanted to let you know that Extropy keeps getting better & better!
(as, of course, it must in order to be so named). What a uniformly excellent,
eclectic, thoughtful, well-written selection of articles. By far the most

The problem with introducing super intelligence software is related not only to
having the right hardware catalyst but more importantly as recent attempts show to
the political costs involved. The unexpected scuttling of the super scalable
Ingrid project at NTT in Japan is a case in point. My guess is that the main
competitor is the pre-existing neural network of hidden weights called money and
Japan's basic about-face strategy at the ending of the age of hypotheses might be
as follows.

Let a synthesized wholesale abandonment of the current economic system happen in a
way that has been carefully thought about and planned, where Japan's gift to the
world's poor is new technology and education in subjective methods of valuation.
This will embody a capitulation to lifetime learning and self evaluation, with
sustainable reassurance of what can be provided. Cyberspace will create a context
of mutuality by having an open honest discussion, provide feedback in a timely and
appropriate way, and hold its dialectic accountable for doing what needs to be
done to ensure everyone's well-being. Privacy will be on a need to know basis
satisfying the needs of those who wish to know. Once everyone has caught up with
this super intelligence singularity and re-evaluated everything, Cyberspace
awareness will obsolete national security.

The Japanese will eclipse the world in the meticulous fabricating of an inclusive
non-verbal appendage as the basis for explicit electronic dialogue. Japan's gift
of cooperation in the virtual world will be without any commitment to those who
have given earlier. This era of the Internet will signal the end of reciprocity.

Currently the avant-garde only purports to challenge existing structure. 
In a non-altruistic society full of self-regulating semi-intellectual 
oligarchies (the "professions") and corporate monopolies reigning over a 
suburban monoculture it is historically astonishing how much tolerance 
has been shown to the avant-garde. Most of recorded history has seen 
tiny elites dominate the majority of the then population. Prior to 
recorded history there were a few tens of millennia in rock art, costume 
and so forth. Some argue that modern language began about 60,000 years 
ago. The first sea crossings date to 800,000 years ago, and stone tools 
predate this by hundreds of thousands of years. The stated historic 
mission of the avant-garde has been the pressing forward of experiment 
and artistic sophistication in relation to both the artist as individual 
and the artist as the equal commentator upon society. In practice, in 
Australia, the indifference and physicality of suburbia has denied the 
vast majority of artists material support and has led to their reliance 
on teaching, academia, grants and alternative jobs to earn income. On a 
political level, this has inevitably restrained them. Even more 
pertinently, the mechanisms and infrastructure of modern late twentieth 
century art have reduced them to corporate instrumentalities. Direct 
artistic political challenge to the dominant elitist paradigms derives 
from the fringe cultures of the "alternative" scene rather than the 
artistic community. One has only to examine the lived lives of queers, 
feminists, punks, goths, ravers, junkies, new agers or hippies to see 
this. It is highly likely that the driven formal aesthetic of these 
different sub-cultures and communities will express itself in new forms 
of complex and developed art, which, since their birth in salons and 
bohemia, have struggled to exist within a culture of mass production, 
distribution monopolies and limited cybernetics. The more formal 
artistic avant-garde will also become more expressive, though at a 
slightly later date, since it is politically tied to the current 
socio-economic system for the period while work remains existant in its 
current form. What are some of the forces driving these forthcoming 
changes? 

New materials.
Controlled materials.
Accessible, low-cost and non-hierachial infrastructures.
Artist-controlled distribution networks.
The rise of the reviewer.
A new abundance of ability.
A new abundance of leisure.
Increased information and congruence of information.
Increased control of the body.
Increased control of an increasingly interactive environment.
Increased control of neurological consciousness and variation of its 
structure.
Increased political activism.
New moral and ethical debates.
New spiritual activism in response to increased ability.
The increased role of art as environmental theatre and ritual.

Already, it is difficult to follow the many possibilities being opened 
up in biology, nanotechnology and computing. These range from tens of 
molecular supercomputers inside individual cells to using radiotelescope 
networks as a sensory organ to watch the stars directly. Advanced 
automation and nanotechnology (which involves consciously constructed 
atomic and molecular arrangements and materials containing extremely 
large numbers of molecular supercomputers linked to assemblers and 
disassemblers), followed later by artificial or consciously constructed 
intelligence, will result in the end of required manual work and the 
disappearance of capital (as self-replication of automated production 
systems does not require organized manual labour driven by provision of 
goods and services as reward). Any sentient being will potentially be 
capable of choosing to control its level of intelligence and its 
component systems, including choice of lifespan. For example, crossovers 
between DNA computers and nanotechnology could result in the exchange of 
complex information through the saliva of a kiss.

PRACTICAL EXAMPLES

"Billboard"
Use of nanopaper or screenpaint to coat billboards distributed above 
artist warehouses and displaying downloads of  art, whether video or 
painterly. For example, 30-second interval displays of the performance 
artist during a 24-hour period. The same principle can apply to 
wallscreens, roomscreens, materials coating (for example, coating of 
cars), clothes, 'poster' pillars, "outside galleries" (galleries with 
exterior display) and simultaneous galleries (galleries with identical 
rotating and simultaneous displays at a variety of sites around the 
world). Institutions such as artbanks will cater for such needs.

"Nanopainting"
Use of nanomaterials to provide 3-dimensional simulation of brushstrokes 
and painterly effects, capable of modifying themselves. Your Goya 
modifies to a Rembrant in an hour or two. See the effects of layered 
oils - apparently.

"Car dance"
Use of automatic car driving systems to arrange a ballet of driverless 
vehicular transport, the poetry of chance and steering wheel, 
culminating in simultaneous car crashes with late 20th century crash 
dummies.

"King Kong"
You inhabit a virtual body six storeys high, venturing down a virtual 
Brunswick Street to lift cars and pick the tops off buildings. Point of 
eyesight view, however, comes not from your virtual eyes but a rotating 
panorama. As your journey begins you start to shrink.

"Spireshadow"
Modelling their work on the famous 1960s computer simulation, a group of 
sculptures create a short-term sculptural spire of immense height that 
casts its shadow on the precise day the precise distance across 
Melbourne to reach the border house from the shoreline. Impossible? No.

"MCG edit"
100,000 automated cameras track players and viewpoints, including 
personal choice shots, and store all visual data of the Grand Final. 
Viewers create their own 'director's cut' and compare notes while 
imbiding vegetarian VB (VB without filtration through animal products).

"Nano suitmask"
Gymnastics unheard of in the past are possible with diamond-muscle 
sheathing controlled by millions of molecular supercomputers.  
Patterning and shifting of skin and mask enable artistic expression of 
the Circus Oz version of the Tempest atop four adjacent city rooftops, 
with appropriate leaping and tumbling.

"Flower bed"
Your bed and bedroom are augmented by genetically sculptured flowers, 
which form the ceiling and open to the morning Sun while selected 
psychedelic neurotransmitters are wafted your way, according to your 
mood.

"Fogset"
Nanotech utility fogs lift the players up and surround their bodies. 
Like vampiric hosts, they float in the material as the Earth turns, 
hiding the Sun, while playing high-speed three-dimensional metachess and 
composing haiku. Afterwards they gather and discuss the game, vying to 
ensure that the best players are ensured the honour of victory.

"Villa of the Mysteries"
Virtual and overt realities merge in this historic reenactment of the 
ancient rites, modelled on Pompeii. Participants swap visual, aural and 
tactile sensory inputs, experiencing the mixed realities from a variety 
of perspectives, the shifting patterns modelled on the lava flows of 
yesteryear.

"Migration of the Spider Homes"
Modifiable houses with hydraulically controlled beds shift on hydraulic 
spider legs, foretelling the era of smart houses and thinking cities. 
Not content with shifting from beach to forest, they echo the call of 
James Blish in "Cities in Flight" by going solar.

"Twintown" 
A single male body to double female body transformation (consensual and 
without neurological override) is ritually enacted, and completed by 
Tantric branding. The parameters of the new bodies are decided by vote 
of  assembled friends and close relatives, after consultation with the 
wish-drive of the person concerned.

"Beehive Extravaganze: splitting universe"
Superintelligent self-modified bees are requested to provide their views 
on a potential universe design. No longer the province of physicists and 
mathematicians, systems design on this scale has broadened to include 
more poetic progenitators.

"Cyber mandala"
Socio-historical analyses of memetic constructs over the past 2,500 
years are reassembled as cyber mandalas on Simnet (which contains 
non-aware virtual versions of past personages) for meditative purposes.

"Sunsurf"
Flocks of special-material solar sails are infused with the 
consciousness of visitors and skim the colder surface of the Sun, their 
pleasure centres linked to the erupting solar winds and sunspots.

This projected breakdown of  art as a commodity in the face of 
multivalency will seem implausible to some, and wildly improbable to 
others, but flows naturally from the increased range of choice about to 
race over us. Far more freeform art than the examples quoted above will 
surface and interact at many different levels. Mythologies and lives may 
well be the new materials, for many. Ascending and descending constructs 
within oceans of consciousness are the probable result of our impending 
exit from the womb of history into the realm of hypersentiency and 
self-directed evolution. From this perspective, Cabaret Voltaire and 
Andy Warhol will seem to be precursors to and prophets of the dawn of a 
new age. Nation states and corporations may well become the romantic, 
semi-tragic dream-phrases of 20th century improbabilities, used for 
constructive design purposes and exploration rather than as the spine 
and skeleton of our everyday reality.

<yawn>

More class warfare.

You might just notice that todays' poor are richer than the dreams of avarice
of bygone royalty?

Somehow the wealth appears to be spreading.

One can only presume that the level of complexity of the brain, despite 
recent thinking, cannot be fully breached within the 27-35 years prior 
to the Singularity or Escalation. I view current approximations of 
software requirements as hugely underestimated, even given certain 
simpler parameters (de Bono) and nanotech engineering-AI. It is highly 
unlikely that estimates of 2005 for the Singularity are likely. More 
probably it is the congruence of certain events that effects the 
situation on the ground (after all, this is the definition of the 
Singularity on the Internet). That is, as predicted by many, the Nets, 
and SETI, and bootstrapping via bush robot facilities. An AI is most 
amenable to consciously controlled bootstrapping because its 
construction is more modifiable (presumably) and known. My own estimates 
of timeframe escalation indicate a rather different underlying structure 
to the Singularity or Spike as understood currently by Transhumanists. I 
certainly believe that the instrumentality of transformation is one 
being or set of beings and almost certainly an AI, though this is 
largely irrelevent. Structural transformation of thought-processes is 
almost inevitable, as foretold by Transhumanists, but the direction of 
such transformation is the question. Hypersentient self-transforming, 
self-directing beings are likely to exist consciously on a large number 
of chosen levels and to consider issues from a number of wider 
perspectives, including an awareness of the past and the various value 
systems of various emotional states. It is unlikely that such a being 
would consider existance from the point of view of a fixed, 
species-orientated, 20th century capitalist elitist perspective, given 
its innate understanding of its own amortality and abilities. It is 
highly likely that such hypersentient beings would gravitate towards a 
multivalency of experience and possibility and the generation or 
entrance into a multiversal system to provide sufficient possibilities 
for exploration. I would also note that conceptions of memes and 
datavores are inherently entropic and depend on continuous corruption of 
information. Extropic theory holds consciousness to be the spiking 
mechanism towards the control of spacetime, that is, that large aspects 
of the universe become a self-directing organism as well. Old hat, to be 
sure, but interesting. Not entirely scientific, but within a universe 
with a finite number of stars there is a certain amount of sense to a 
certain amount of illusion, the old Star Trek argument about Contact (if 
combined with an existant Omega Matrix a la Tipler - rather than an 
Omega Point at the Big Crunch - unscientific? To be sure. It is a guess 
about behavioural patterning, rather than scientific authenticity). It 
is unquestionably true that earlier post-Singularity civilizations or 
events could if they wish have intervened on this planet at any stage, 
so the issue is why not. The moral issue. There are some, even now, like 
myself, who wish to support all sentient life, all life with 
neurological systems (e.g. a mosquito), and beyond as far as the 
boundary can go, whether it is called process theology or foolishness. 
To focus for a moment back on the issue at hand, I wouldn't worry too 
much about elites of superwealthy nanotechnologists getting ahead of the 
rest. Scientists have a way of mishandling politics that would be almost 
beyond belief, if it were not for the unconscious bubblings of the 
events of the Escalation which make the requirements for some 
suppression of action and understanding more transparent. The primary 
fear of the population at large is almost always lack of physical space 
when the events of the Techno-Rapture are articulated. The secondary 
fear is the existence of only one universe and the necessity of (the old 
version) of entropy (expressed as death, both individual and universal). 
Incidentally, I read that the Sun would have extinguished life on Earth 
within 500 million years, not longer.

THOUGHT EXPERIMENT FOR THE DAY:

Take the typical population articles and graphs (there's a good one in 
one of the Science Spectras, 1996 I think, by a Russian) for human 
beings and go back with best possible approximations for population, but 
do not arbitrarily and culturally stop at any point. Are there 
fluctuations when breeding populations are splitting off? What are the 
projected or imagined species transpositions between our early 
lemur-like ancestors and unicellular organisms? Amphibians? Fish? It 
would be an interesting graph if it went back 4 billion years instead of 
4 million - and the point is, logically, that is only when we have such 
graphs and comparitive overall and individual graphs for other genetic 
groupings that we can properly conceptualize our genetic landscape. 
(overall biological 'trees' are a start). Perhaps it takes augmented 
bootstrapped intelligence to conceptualize such things. Perhaps it takes 
four or five people a month or two of measuring. I suppose it depends on 
how rough the estimations are. How many people get to add up biomass - a 
similar, if simpler?, issue. [Gaian theorists can also link the human 
population graph to species in culturally symbiotic and resource chain 
relationships with humans. This would tend to bear out the extropic 
spiking mechanism post-Singularity, as also reflected in, e.g. the 
anti-pollutant aspects of clean nanotech.]

Yes, but this is fundamentally different; godhood isn't something
that one would sell (or give away) like one would do with minor
technological advances such as phones, TVs cars etc. Just like nukes
were (and are) only for a select few, so will hyperintelligence, 
nanotech, uploading etc. initially be only available to a select
group, which will most likely use them to become gods. There is
no rational reason to distribute this kind of power once you have
it. 

Powerful businessmen still need others to make and buy their products,
and dictators and presidents still need their people to stay in power
& to keep the country running, but a SI needs NO-ONE, it's
supremely autonomous. I can't imagine why it would share its 
awesome power with creatures that are horribly primitive from its point 
of view. Would *we* uplift ants/mice/dogs/monkeys to rule the world
as our equals? I think not.

But then again, we can only guess at a SIs motivations (but I
wouldn't count too much on its benevolence). In any case, we
should all work hard to be among the first SIs, that's the only
reasonably sure way to live long and prosper.

Yes Mike, Natasha is really hot but since she is "taken" or unavailable (you
lucky guy Max!). Us single Transhumanist guys can't really count her because
of this.  Remi and Katherine Aegis are the only other posting messengers to
this list that I can think of.  I don't know their availability status.

Smooth joke, Natasha! We all know of course that Mike's brain was severely deprived of blood when he wrote that, for obvious reasons ;-)

To the best of my knowledge Remi is a man, and Katherine's gay, so try again ;-) In fact, I dare you to find one hot, reasonably young and available woman on this mailing list. Or the known transhuman community as a whole, for that matter.

I didn't feel like copying that entire conversation, and I think you've all
set it to memory anyway, so this is my thought...

I would have to agree.  To my knowledge, I haven't really even met one girl
who supports the Transhumanist way of thinking.  Inversely, the majority of
girls that I know that DO have a different philosophy are in fact Wiccan.
This is a philosophy that is more in tune with nature, and very few Wiccans
have a love for technology.  In fact, I haven't met one that does like
technology, and just about every Wiccan I've met (they've all been girls, by
the way, though I do know that there are male Wiccans) abhors the basic
transhumanist idea.  Perhaps this says something about the difference in the
thought patterns of the sexes.  I am not a sexist by the way, but it is pretty
obvious that most men and women think differently.  I feel that you will all
agree with me on this.

Well, I apologize for ignoring you emails.  Also, I didn't know you were a
female, although you're a bit too old for me (no, I'm not saying you're old.
I'm 16, you see.).  Also, I've read your profile, and it's not all that
welcoming.  When you tell someone not to IM you if they are simply going to
waste your time, it kind of discourages people.  I mean, what's a waste of
time to you could be very important to someone else, and vise-versa.

                             Gender and Nature in Contemporary 
Neopaganism

By Salamantis 

In recent decades, several social and political movements have had 
profound impacts upon the popular Western psyche.
Collectively, they pose a powerful challenge to religiously grounded 
relational paradigms which until recently have been
accepted almost without question. These movements include the 
human rights trio (ethnic/racial civil rights, lesbian/gay
rights and feminism) and environmentalism.

The last two of these, feminism and environmentalism, have been 
converging to the degree that a common discipline,
ecofeminism, has been born. Although some affinities exist between 
these two and the others, the only solid connection
seems to be the choice by some feminists of lesbianism on 
ideological grounds in spite of their personal sexual
preferences. What could the women's rights movement have in 
common with the attempt to preserve and protect our
planetary ecology which the homosexual and nonwhite rights 
movements do not share? To answer this question, we must
take a look at the paradigm they are all opposing, and in what ways 
each of them oppose it. 

                                       A.Our Present Paradigm

This paradigm is drawn from the moral laws set down in the holy 
texts of the religions comprising mainstream Western
Monotheism. These religions mainly include Judaism, Christianity, 
Islam and Zoroastrianism; their texts include the Bible,
the Koran and the Zend Avesta. For purposes of simplicity and 
brevity, we shall call this the JCIZ paradigm. 

JCIZ postulates a single omniscient, omnipotent and relatively 
benevolent male deity (Jahweh, Jehovah, God or Lord,
Allah or Ahura Mazda), who created and populated the world but is 
essentially transcendent with respect to it. This deity
is opposed by another somewhat less knowing and powerful, 
relatively malevolent male deity (Lucifer, the Devil, Shaitan
or Ahriman), who is also essentially supernatural. These two 
opposed forces of good and evil, light and darkness, contend
with each other by intervening in our affairs. Each of us shall spend 
eternity with whichever one he or she allies with; in
any case this earth is a temporary inconvenience, unimportant in 
the greater order of things. It is in our interest to ally
ourselves with the "good guy", and we know how to do this because 
He's thoughtfully sent us a male savior or prophet or
avatar (Moses, Jesus, Mohammed or Zarathustra) to so inform us. 

We are now in a position to understand the special affinity between 
feminism and environmentalism. Homosexuality is
condemned and slavery condoned in the JCIZ, but if these 
tendencies were reversed, it would not compromise the
underpinnings of the theological structure; gay/lesbian rights 
identical to those of straights and white/nonwhite equality are
no metaphysical threat to the integrity of the system. The religious 
ramifications of feminism and environmentalism,
however, strike it to its very core. By criticizing the consequences of 
following the JCIZ, they indict as immoral or unwise
the premises upon which it is based, and do so from the perspective 
of an alternative paradigm which derives from many
pagan sources past and present, but which is crystallized in Wicca. 

                                            B.Feminism

In the JCIZ, all deities are male, the first human is male, and any 
central prophets or saviors are male. In the cosmic play,
women are relegated to the roles of dupe, slave, rebellious whore, 
broodmare and submissive saint. Mary Daly's dictum
that if God is male, the male is God has the existential corollary, 
within the JCIZ, of reducing females to nothing. In order
to follow God's plan, women must submit to their husbands' rule in 
particular, and to male authority in general. Men may
have to attend the school of hard knocks, but women are stuck with 
their homework. They are to raise their many children
but not their voices, for fear of getting knocked about themselves. 
This excision of the feminine from spiritual significance
and their resulting societal subservience has provoked, within many 
contemporary women, a soul alienation of Marxian
proportions. Revolt against the predominance of this divine chain of 
being has followed, and the guerillas have not been
exclusively female. Some men have come to feel cramped and 
pigeonholed in the role of overseer on the domination
plantation and degraded and ashamed of what is expected of them 
there. They have therefore joined the rebellion against
the JCIZ gender hierarchy, agreeing with Martin Luther King that 
you can't hold folks down in a ditch unless you climb
down in there with them. As women and men come to the practical 
conclusion that only equality of rights, responsibilities
and opportunities works, however, they also tend to come to the 
spiritual conclusion that this is true because the sexes
equally approach divinity. This, however, would require deity to be 
comprised of masculinity and femininity in equal
measure, which of course directly contradicts the JCIZ. 

                                         C.Environmentalism

In the JCIZ, the Creator packed a hostile and bountiful world like a 
reluctant lunchbox for fallen humanity (read man) to
suffer, endure, dominate, subdue and exploit for his own benefit. 
This divine license for exploitation without regard to
consequences in the name of greed has borne bitter fruit. Because 
we have not held our common home in reverence, or
honored her as sacred to us, we have felt free to pollute, pillage, 
rape and otherwise profane her. Yet, after fouling our
own nest, we seem surprised to find ourselves surrounded by 
human filth, with the blood of extinguished comrade species
crying out inconsolably from the bleak bare ground. We are coming 
painfully to the understanding that the earth is our
source and foundation, and that poisoning and impoverishing her 
can only hasten our own hollow demise. However, the
grasping of the fact that we are only a part of something much older, 
wiser, grander and more complex than ourselves
draws us inexorably to an experience of awe and sublimity in the 
presence of the sheer marvel of it. We begin to see
ourselves as tiny threads, which, by some miracle, are able to sense 
the weave of a gigantic dancing tapestry (and the
reality is much more wondrous than that). The earth becomes 
hallowed for us. But this contradicts the JCIZ premise that it
is transcendent Deity which is holy, not a nature which, compared 
to the supernatural, must remain substandard. 

                                         D.Forbidden Fruit

Ecological degradation may be divided into natural resource 
depletion and biosphere pollution, but both have
overpopulation as a root cause. Overpopulation drives us like 
lemmings to mow our global lungs for farmland, lumber
and cattle pasture, sapping species diversity in the process. It drives 
us to strip-mine our eroding soil to build
skyscrapers, cars and soda cans. It drives us to burn our fossil 
fuels, overheating our atmosphere and decimating our
ozone sunscreen for the sake of light, mobility, plastic containers 
and air-conditioned comfort for a small percentage of
our teeming billions. It drives us to turn our over-fished oceans into 
toxic cesspools when our rivers bear our pesticides,
factory byproducts and sewage to the seas. Furthermore, the 
resulting competition for room and resources on a shrinking
sphere has led our infant race to nurse the barrel of the nuclear gun.

It is ecologically imperative that we control our rate of reproduction 
generally, and the fundamental pillar of feminism that
women must have the right to control their own reproduction 
individually. To this dovetailing of the calls of personal
freedom and global necessity, the JCIZ responds with an iron 
demand frozen for thousands of years in the face of
catastrophically changing circumstances; you must be fruitful and 
multiply. 

                                           E.Ecofeminism

The realization that birth control is both a feminist and an 
environmental issue is one of many pattern matches which
ecofeminists have found. They follow the clue given by the phrase 
'Mother Nature' to the conclusion that women and the
earth have both been victimized by the same attitudes of subjection, 
rapaciousness, violation, penetration of virgin
territory, stripping, despoiling and defloration. They consider this an 
unfortunate result of the separation of the sexes into
godlike, transcendent man and earthy, immanent woman, into man 
as mind and woman as body, found in the JCIZ. This
partition, for ecofeminists, is based on the differing positions of the 
sexes with regard to childbirth; men observe, women
participate. Women also, like the earth, produce food, and can be 
planted with seed when in season; hence the ancient
occurrence of the term 'plowing' for intercourse.

Sexist theological Cartesianism, however, is untenable; the JCIZ's 
gender-based spirit/flesh dichotomy has been an
injurious illusion. Self-aware parts of nature are still woven into the 
web they perceive. Mind, whether abstract or
concrete, and of either gender, is a bodily based, earthly and 
evolutionarily emergent phenomenon.

The main division within ecofeminism is between 'gender' and 
'nature' ecofeminists. The 'gender' ecofeminists believe that
male-female relationships are the source of a domination pattern 
that is generalized to apply to culture-nature
relationships, and that if we replace it with an egalitarian sexual 
partnership pattern, our environmental abuse will stop.
'Nature' ecofeminists believe just the opposite; that replacing the 
egocentric, exploitative and uncaring attitudes underlying
environmental abuse with valuing, consequence based stewardship 
will repair male-female relationships by osmosis. I
think that the domination pattern is imprinted during child-rearing, 
and that to end it, we have to embrace noncoercive
methods of socializing our young. 

                                   F.The Challenge of Neopaganism
                                      (1)Neopaganism Generally

The Neopagan alternatives to the JCIZ paradigm trace their roots to 
prehistoric Eurasian and African tribal and shamanic
nature religions, and count the Amerindian and Australian aboriginal 
traditions as siblings. From them, the Craft (as many
refer to themselves) have taken their reverence for the earth and 
their celebration of the more feminine principles of
divinity. They generally create sacred space by casting a circle 
(which is the intersection between a sanctified sphere and
the ground), and calling the four directions, which correspond to the 
four elements, and to the divisions of a day, a moon
cycle, a year and a lifetime, and much else. Their holy days fall on 
the solstices and the equinoxes, on the midpoints
between them (the cross-quarters), and/or on full moons. In 
addition, they honor personal rites of passage; such as birth, a
naming of the child (sometimes called wiccaning), puberty, marriage 
(known as handfasting), menopause (croning), and
death. Contemporary neopagan groups include the Fellowship of 
Isis, Ar n Draiocht Fein (Our Own Druidism), the
Church of all Worlds, Asatru and the Church of the Eternal Source. 

                                        (2)Wicca Specifically

All the above is true of Wicca, but when casting their circles most 
also call the Earth Mother, Sky Father, and Center, this
last representing both the individual selves of the participants and 
the common center they create by joining together. They
also thank and dismiss them when they open their circles upon the 
conclusion of their ritual workings.

Wicca follows a gender-complementary immanent duotheism 
comprised of a God and a Goddess; for Wicca, deity is
double and non-transcendent. The distinctions between them entail 
neither mutual hostility nor the subservience of either
to the other, but instead require the co-presence in dynamic 
symmetry of these differing yet equi-primordial principles for
circumstances to proceed. The fundamentalist belief in the actual 
existence of these deities is not a prerequisite for
becoming Wiccan. In fact, many, if not most, Wiccans view the 
Earth Mother and Sky Father as archetypes in the Jungian
sense, and as lenses through which to apprehend, and grasp in 
concrete, human-friendly terms, a totality which is too vast
and ineffable to be circumscribed by finite minds. Wiccans 
consider all Goddesses and Gods throughout history as
cultural manifestations of these principles, revel in the diversity of 
expression that they find, and borrow whatever they
find that works for them. In this sense, Wicca does not enslave and 
use its adherents; rather it is the case that Wicca is
made use of by them, as a spiritual tool with which to focus their 
passions and intentions upon the realizations of their
plans and desires. The conceptions and attributes surrounding these 
deities are not inscribed for all time in any holy text,
but are flexible, for Wicca is an evolving, pragmatic religion with little 
dogmatic baggage. Its central ritual, the Great
Rite, consists of dipping a dagger in a chalice of wine in symbolic 
intercourse. The Christian Communion, in contrast, is
symbolic cannibalism.

Wicca has one major law, the Law of Three (any action, whether 
well or ill intentioned, is returned to its source
threefold), and one commandment, the Wiccan Rede ('if it harms 
none, do what you will'). While these admonishments do
emphasize personal freedom, they link it to personal responsibility, 
and the consequences of following them are a strict
self-discipline, since one is expected to strive not to harm oneself, 
others, or the biosphere we share. Their more magickal
practices include a Santeria-like invocation of the masculine 
principle by the priest and of the feminine principle by the
priestess (the Drawing Down of the Sun or Moon), and Raising the 
Cone of Power. This practice involves an entering of
the group into a shamanic state of consciousness, usually by means 
of some combination of dancing, chanting and
drumming, preparatory to attempts at divination or spellcasting.

The Earth Mother represents the foundation or substrate of change; 
the matter underlying form, the being beneath
becoming. She is omnipresent, although aspects of her may 
undergo periodic change. She never dies. The feminine
principle of divinity encompasses the cyclical-intuitive, synthesizing, 
fecund-formative, nourishing aspect, with its
emphases on the personal and collective dream worlds, and on 
relatedness.

The Sky Father represents the changes of form that must occur in 
the life cycle and food chain. He withdraws and returns,
and never lingers. He is the God of the inseparability of hunter and 
prey, and of the cycle of vegetation. He is born of the
Mother, grows, flowers and dies, to be reborn of his own seed the 
following year. The masculine principle of divinity
encompasses the linear-logical, analyzing, fertilizing aspect, with its 
emphases on ego, task and individuality.

A combination of these traits is preferable to either alone, and all 
people are considered to have their own particular
ratios of these attribute sets; their own yin-yang or anima-animus 
blend.

Modern Wicca publicly began in 1949 when Gerald Gardner 
published "High Magic's Aid", a book of Wiccan ritual
disguised as historical fiction. He then, in collaboration with Doreen 
Valiente, published "Witchcraft Today" in 1954 and
"The Meaning of Witchcraft" in 1959. Although other Wiccan forms 
exist, Gardnerian Wicca and an offshoot
(Alexandrian Wicca, after its founder Alex Sanders) remain the core 
Wiccan traditions. Other important Wiccan theorists
include Janet and Stewart Farrar, Starhawk and Z Budapest; other 
significant Wiccan organizations include the Covenant
of the Goddess and the Aquarian Tabernacle Church. 

                                     G.Wiccan Theo/alogy and the
                              Foundations of Feminism and Environmentalism

In a religion in which the God and the Goddess are equi-potential 
(possess complementary and equal status), gender
equality is mandated rather than forbidden. Freedom of societally 
and planetarily responsible choice belongs to all. In a
religion that urges its adherents to love the earth as a mother, rather 
than resenting and coveting her as a rich, conquerable
hostile kingdom, children would be raised from birth to treat her with 
restraint and respect, and to pass her on to their
children in as pristine a condition as possible. There is, in fact, a 
kind of Wiccan Eden myth; a vision of a prehistoric
peaceful eco-friendly agrarian matriarchy which was overthrown by 
males banished for violence, who banded together to
conquer and enslave their former society and pillage its lands. This 
Edenic vision is more admired than believed. Most
Wiccans desire a 'return' to this Eden, even if humanity has never in 
reality been there.

Feminists and environmentalists, particularly ecofeminists and deep 
ecologists, share this vision for the future; it is what
they strive for. It is therefore to be expected that many of them 
would appropriate a belief system possessing sensibilities
so in harmony with their hopes, goals, desires and dreams. If the 
Wiccan Utopia is theirs also, adoption seems eminently
reasonable. In fact, these movements receive both support and 
guidance from Wicca, and give both in return. 

                                        H.Wicca and Science

Wicca's attitude toward science is one of intense interest and 
positive regard, for Wicca's perspective of pragmatic
self-conscious evolution and its anti-dogmatic character resemble 
scientific ideals. Science, for Wicca, is attempting to
reveal the underlying nature of immanent divinity, and as such is 
performing a sacred service. In addition, Lovelock's
Gaia hypothesis, that the entire biosphere is an evolving, self-
regulating totality, appears to be to Wiccans the beginning of
the confirmation of their ecological suspicions, and the recent 
comparisons of gender, brain structure and cognitive style
bolster the validity of their chosen deity attributes. They for the most 
part accept that humanity creates divinity in its own
image, and feel flattered that science is indicating that they in 
particular are doing it rather well. 

                                            I.Difficulties

Wicca's deities form a heterosexual couple, and sex with one's 
significant other is regarded as a sacrament. This has
caused gays and lesbians to sometimes feel uneasy with the energy 
in the circle. For this reason, some gay men have
formed Faerie circles and some lesbians have embraced Dianic 
Wicca. Straight women will also meet in full moon
circles, or esbats, and straight men in wild man groups. Although 
there are some differences, for instance in the deity or
deities invoked, the thaumaturgy, or ritual structure, remains similar 
throughout. General meetings are held on the sabbats
eight times a year, and networking is constant. Wicca and 
Neopaganism remain far more gay-friendly than JCIZ.

Although racial diversity endures as an ideal in Wicca, it is sadly 
lacking in reality. This failure to rainbow the Craft is
deeply disturbing to its members. It is almost certain that the reason 
for the phenomenon of whitebread Wicca is that, for
racial minorities, the intensity and immediacy of their oppressed 
condition drives gender and ecological concerns to the
periphery if their awareness. Also, it only stands to reason that they 
would feel uncomfortable participating in ritual as the
token minority, or at best as one of the few. It is very likely that, 
despite the best intentions of the other participants, such
an experience serves to reinforce, rather than relieve, the 
awkwardness and sense of difference for which racial
minorities would seek religious comfort. Wiccans, having 
experienced discrimination themselves on the religious front,
understand these impediments, and continue to remain open and 
hopeful.

Lastly, the Wiccan division of deity has inadvertently had the 
corollary of evolving lists of masculine and feminine gender
attributes that seem disturbingly similar to those of the JCIZ, only 
wrapped in positive-regard packaging. Also, in some
cases, the Wiccan backlash against patriarchy has swung the 
pendulum too far in the opposite direction, subjecting men to
the same ridicule and discrimination that the phallocentrists 
previously reserved for women. Wiccans must be on guard
that they do not pigeonhole individuals into these archetypes, and 
thus descend the slippery slope into the very bigotry and
gender expectations that many have joined Wicca to escape.

"No rational reason" is a strong claim. I doubt your claim. First, your
view surely depends on a Singularitarian view that superintelligence will
come all at once, with those achieving it pulling vastly far away from
everyone else. I don't expect things to work out that way. I've explained
some of my thinking in the upcoming Singularity feature that Robin Hanson
is putting together for Extropy Online.

Second, I also doubt that the superintelligence scenario is so radically
different from today's powerful business people. [I don't say "businessmen"
since this promotes an unfortunate assumption about gender and business.]
You could just as well say that today's extremely wealthy and powerful
business should have no need to benefit poor people. Yet, here we have oil
companies building hospitals and providing income in central Africa. I just
don't buy the idea that each single SI will do everyone alone.
Specialization and division of labor will still apply. at some SI's will
want to help the poor humans upgrade because that will mean adding to the
pool of superintelligences with different points of view and different
interests.

Let me put it this way: I'm pretty sure your view is incorrect, because I
expect to be one of the first superintelligences, and I intend to uplift
others. Or, are you planning on trying to stop me from bringing new members
into the elite club of SIs?

No disagreement there. Make money, invest it, and keep on integrating
advances as they happen.

I think talking about "hot" women to be silly; however, I will add this:
I have discussed extropian ideas with men and women alike, and I have
yet to talk to a woman who does not think transhumanism sounds either
strange, sci-fi, or downright evil. 

I do live in Wisconsin---but many of these conversations took place in a
very liberal place, UW-Madison, where people are open to many ideas.

Anyone have any ideas why women seem to either dismiss or object to
this?

Come now, Tony, you know very well that tax *rates* decreased under
Thatcher. (They couldn't go much higher than under the previous Labour
govt. which had rates up to 98% -- 83% income tax plus a 15% investment
income surcharge.) Of course, total tax revenue increased as the economy
grew and people had less incentive to hide their hard-earned money.

For nothing? The British economy ended up in much better shape than it was.
Anyway, more of your blame for the painful transition should go to those
who propped up old, unprofitable manufacturing for decades. When the cure
was implemented (of course it could have been done much better), the
results were much more painful than they would have been if the economy
hadn't been abused for so long.

Mostly private industry. Many others are wastefully employed by the state.
No doubt, much productive research would be slowed if the state suddently
stopped science funding *and nothing else changed*. But, if the state
generally withdrew from life, the beneficial economic effects would soon
mean more funding for science due to a stronger and faster growing economy.

Many simply haven't stumbled upon the term.  I

This hasn't been my experience...I'd say that Wiccans,

Dunno.  Though I don't know many Wiccans personally,
I can safely say that every self-described "pagan" I have
met was at least not abusive toward the idea of transhumanism,
though many are skeptical.

The fact is that nukes are easily buildable by
private individuals and groups; the fact that 
none have been detonated by private groups
is evidence that only sociopaths want them.

The "power" you speak of is *trivial* compared to
all the things that nanotech will be able to do; why
would someone who could do nearly anything they
would like want to play god to a few morons?
On another note, if you could lift your pet's intelligence
to that of your own, would you?  I think a lot of people
would, and how much more, then, other humans?

Yes, of course! Why *not*?  It would certainly

I agree here, but for different reasons.  I don't think
that there is any point in worrying about some small
group or individual getting nanotech and preventing
everyone else from it, because I don't know that there
is anything that can be done about that.  The other 
possibility is that it will be available to everyone, more
or less without cost, and that opens the door to other
problems fairly quickly, such as runaway replication.
Therefore I think that one of the things we ought to be
doing now is designing an easily built (by assemblers)
launch vehicle/escape boat, to molecular specifications,
for wide distribution via the internet.

I think some of you guys need to get out more and meet some more
intelligent women.  I'm married to a perfectly attractive woman who at
least likes the idea of transhumanism even if she doesn't consider
herself a transhumanist.  I find the idea that attractiveness or being
a female precludes certain beliefs (transhumanism, extropianism,
etc..) to be insulting.

Lots of people find our ideas to be strange or wacky.  If it wasn't
for the evidence that something big technologically was about to
happen, I'd find it strange and wacky too.  

I have too many male friends who are stuck on finding the perfect
woman who is intelligent and beautiful and likes all the stuff they do
(football, stereos, cars, etc...).  There's plenty of women out there
who will make excellent mates for the next couple hundred years or so.
 Just open your eyes.  Learn to compromise.

Besides, when we become posthuman, what will physical beauty matter
anyways?

Just my $0.02 worth.

As a female in my 20's who embraces the transhumanist philosophy pretty well in its entirety, I'm not so sure about the absolutism in V's statement (tho' I make not claims to "hottitude" -- hot-headed, perhaps :)). I DO however, sympathize with young, intelligent men seeking female companionship, who wish neither to lower their standards nor to diminish their intellectual fire by consorting with women who may not only be uninterested in their beliefs, but may even be actively hostile to them. I do not purport to know WHY there are fewer women than men involved in the transhumanist community, or in the science and technology communities at large, but it would be sheer madness to pretend that this disparity does not exist. When there ARE women in these fields, it tends to be in the less mathematically-based disciplines. Statistically, this is the case.  I have rarely even had female FRIENDS, so I can hardly imagine the position of an extropian man trying to find suitable women to date. The ones I know are caught in the unfortunate situation of choosing between being alone and being with people who are, at best, distracting and focus-killing and, at worst, beneath them. It's not pleasant, but it is true. 
As an idealist, I would say to hold out for a brave, intelligent woman, but that is easier advice to give than take. I am happy to see this topic being discussed because it is something that my friends and I have pondered at length, and, too often it is a bugaboo avoided by many for fear of appearing "sexist" or whatever.

I was taking a pragmatic approach, by using an already accepted and
successful model. As for world revolution in consciousness, that's fine,
but let's start with reducing violence first.

EvMick,

I can relate to your dilemma.  I too am having trouble finding someone of the
opposite gender, probably for a different reason though.  What I'm looking for
is very difficult to find but I have found several possibilities, mainly
online.  So look wherever you can and don't give up.   :)

I really couldn't say because I'm the only female I've seen from this list,
but I did see a little TV show about the extropians and the one female there
looked like an attractive body-builder type.

Sherry,

I was responding to a statement made by someone else that there are absolutely no "hot young females" in the transhumanist community. I believe there are SOME, but not many. VERY few, from what I have seen, not just on this list, but in general out there in the world. Would you agree?

 Sherry,
As I said before, I am female and for that reason maybe not the best judge of female attractiveness. But, extrapolating from what I consider to be attractive traits in a man (maybe not the safest pursuit), an attractive female would be one who was committed to her beliefs and passionate about ideas, uncompromising in her standards and single-mindedly devoted to learning and advancement. According to these criteria, I would think that ALL transhumanist females would be attractive by definition. This still does not account for the nagging fact that there aren't very MANY, though. That would have to suck for extropian guys.

I think that the main reason for me having trouble getting into a
relationship lately is that I work so much! I think a lot of extropians
male and female alike are in very highly intensive creative fields. It
may be that we just don't have the time. I personally have kind of been
looking for someone I could work with artistically, kill two birds with
one stone. I'm really not so much going for looks, although I respect
someone who takes good care of themselves.

We are not techophobes; in fact, as far as environmentally 
responsible technology goes, we are technophiles.  If (as I believe) 
the basic human race is between dispersing from our beloved cradle 
mudball and getting all our genetic eggs out of one basket, and 
dying here from cosmic disaster or nuclear holocaust or simply 
choking on our own poison effluent like yeast cells in fermented 
wine, it helps to weigh the scales in our favor if we take care of this 
place so we have as much time to graduate from it as possible.

No, blame people like yourself who come onto our lists as a newbie, then
proceed immediately to insult members of our community. Listen "dude", why
don't you go look for "hot babes" elsewhere. The valued female subscribers
to this list, and the men who respect them, are not here to listen to this

They're completely serious, and it ought to work. (I know Gary Hudson; he
builds stuff that works, as long as the gov't doesn't insist on messing
with his design.)

Well thank god Someone said something about these rude low lives, this is a list dedicated to talking about extropianism, not "hot babes" or trahsing members of this list. I may not post much on this list, but I do know when to post.

THANX MAX for standing up for the lists dignity

                         Tools, Language and Text: The Serial Isomorphic 
Evolution of                                                                               
                                     Symbolic Capacity in Human Consciousness
By Joe E. Dees

Abstract- Tool use and language use evolve though an identical 
succession of developmental structures, and the evolution of text shares 
most of these stages.  Notwithstanding this isomorphism, these three 
successively abstract further and further from the unmediated 
action/perception gestalt contexture from which their form derives.  
Thus each phase of the evolution of textual representation depends upon 
the prior completion of the evolution of a similar phase of language use, 
which in turn depends upon the prior completion of the same phase of the 
evolution of tool use.  This can be observed in child development, and 
archeological and historical evidence suggests that the evolution of 
symbolic capacity in human consciousness pursued the same course.  

    The Substrate:  Perception, Recursion and Conscious Self-awareness

Adult higher apes and infants eighteen months old and older 
demonstrate self-awareness as registered in the mirror test (Social 
Cognition and the Acquisition of Self, Lewis and Brooks-Gunn, 1979).  
When their noses are daubed with red paint and they are presented with 
themselves in a mirror, they will touch their own noses rather than the 
reflected ones, demonstrating that they recognize that the images are of 
themselves rather than of conspecifics (other apes or children).  Lesser 
apes and infants one year old or younger attend to the reflected noses, 
indicating a lack of self- awareness.  The appearance of self-awareness is 
a result of the internalization, by the infant, of the distinction between 
persons as material yet purposively mobile (responding to their 
entreaties) and physical objects as material and either inert, 
purposelessly mobile, or moved by persons.  This internalization links 
the infants awareness  its spatio-temporal sense of a distinct position 
to which perceptions flow and from which actions emerge -- with its 
bodily location, as a unique subjectivity separate from others.  As the 
awareness of others leads the infant to an awareness of self, the 
organism/environment interface is elaborated into the more complex 
schema of self/soma/world/society.
Why is it that higher apes achieve self-awareness and lesser apes do 
not?  For that matter, why does self-awareness manifest when it does in 
child development, rather than earlier or later?  
I hypothesize that this is when the number of brain cells, combined 
with the degree and structure of complexity of their interconnections, 
passes a Godelian limit.  Kurt Godel proved that any system of sufficient 
complexity could not be both complete and completely true (1931).  The 
reason for this is the emergence of self-reference.  When System A 
achieves a certain complexity, it is capable of generating a self-
referential Statement B, which, in effect, asserts that it is not a part of 
System A.  If Statement B is nevertheless included in System A, then it is 
false, and System A cannot be completely true; if, on the other hand, it is 
excluded, then it becomes true, and System A remains incomplete.
When this Godelian limit is breached in the brain, the capacity for 
self-reference emerges in an organism which is already aware; in other 
words, participating in a dynamic interchange of action and perception 
with its environment.  It becomes aware of inhabiting a unique 
perspective, neither identical with nor isolated from its surroundings.  
Perceived information provides the array from which attention, itself an 
action, selects and focuses upon an object, thus directing and refining its 
perception and setting the stage for action upon the object, action which 
itself will result in perceptual change.  See how the feedback loop 
spirals?  When this feedback loop is applied self-referentially (in 
phenomenology, not to the noema but to the noesis), that is, not to the 
perceived and acted upon but to the perceiving and acting of the organism 
itself, self-awareness results.  The two conditions necessary for this are 
the size/complexity quotient of the brain and the conditioning of a both 
physical and social environment.
That this system is incomplete, that is, open, allows for creative 
action when presented with novel situations rather than having its 
responses to stimuli circumscribed by instinct alone.  Jean Piaget would 
say (The Grasp of Consciousness, 1976) that the moments when habits 
fail are those which impel reflection, a recursion provoking the advent of 
self-awareness, and that self-construction and world-construction are 
isomorphic and correlative processes, evolving from the central 
interface between organism and environment into progressively more 
elaborate polar self- and world- schemas.  It also entails that conscious 
and self-aware beings can be neither completely self-transparent nor 
omniscient; nor can they completely forget either their own existence or 
the worlds.  They can be neither gods nor things; each must be its own 
particular subjectivity, absorbing, through experience, its own memories, 
and using their constituents as building blocks to create its own 
imaginings and to choose towards which of these to strive.

    (How) Are We Different from Chimps?

The great apes breach the Godelian limit, but just barely.  While they 
demonstrate self-awareness, it is, at best, at the Piagetian level of 
concrete operations, and most likely remains at the pre-operational level. 
 They hand-modify objects into implements in response to the exigencies 
of a present need, then discard them.  They neither use a tool in the 
manufacture of an implement, nor do they retain the implement once its 
immediate purpose is achieved, much less assemble a toolkit, and they 
rarely combine implements in action.  Their gestures are likewise 
prompted solely by the circumstance in which they occur (Tran Duc 
Thao, Investigations into the Origin of Language and Consciousness, 
1984).  They have a limited vocabulary of mostly instinctually based 
calls, with at best traces of syntax.  While it is true that they can be 
trained to some degree in rudimentary forms of communication, they 
have not been observed to spontaneously create or transmit open-ended 
syntactical systems in the wild.  They invent neither composite 
technology, nor languages composed of arbitrary and mutually defining 
signs, and the creation of text systems is far beyond them.  We may share 
98% of our DNA with apes, but that other 2%  is responsible for 
immense differences.

    The Genesis and Development of Symbolic Capacity in Children

Infants engage their world first through the engagement of the 
caregiver and the exploration of their bodily motility.  When they can 
begin to coordinate actions with perceptions (age three to eight months), 
they begin an investigation of the properties of physical objects and their 
ability to affect them (experiments with contingency).  As they learn 
person permanence, self-permanence, object permanence, means-ends 
relationships (rudimentary causality) and the self-other distinction (age 
eight to twelve months), they begin to experience specific emotional 
states and to exhibit imitative behavior.  Between one and two years of 
age, children undergo a rapid linguistic assimilation, a grasp of more 
complex causal chains and the onset of symbolic representation (Lewis 
and Brooks Gunn, op. Cit.).  They speak in single words, then in pairs, 
then with progressively differentiated syntax. (The Language of Children, 
Mathilda Holzman, 1997). Their vocabulary grows from the most 
concrete generic (cat, dog) into the more integrated general 
(animal) and the more differentiated particular (Persian, Siamese, 
poodle terrier)(The Modularity of Mind, Jerry Fodor, 1983).  They 
rarely can be taught to begin reading before the age of three, and 
generally not until the age of four or five.  

    The Evolution of Technology 

This evolution emerges from the substrate of bodily action, which 
involves the unmediated appropriation of the object.  The second stage 
consists of the use of unmodified implements as a means of imitative 
bodily extension (using a stick to reach, strike or fend off).  Next comes 
the bodily modification of the implement to more efficiently accomplish 
the task.  The succeeding stage, which adds another layer of mediation, is 
the first appearance of a true tool, in which one object (the tool) is used 
to modify another (the implement) for the task, and toolkits may be 
assembled.  At this point, true creativity begins: implements begin to be 
fashioned which perform their designated tasks in manners other than 
imitative extensions of bodily action.  This is the stage where brute 
signification of created  (rather than natural) objects occurs, and their 
meaning is identical with (a mental image of) their use.  There are, 
however, only a finite (and small) number of basic shapes available; these 
are refined into multipurpose tool types (wheel, lever, wedge, spring, 
etc.), where the use of the tool in the particular task is subsumed by a 
conceptually idealized shape which facilitates general applicability.  At 
this point the revolution begins.  The machine principle of technology is 
developed; objects that are useless in isolation and derive their 
significance solely from their use as connectors are combined with these 
tool types into useful composite wholes, which themselves may serve as 
modules in more complex constructions, as long as they obey physical 
constraints.  Now an endless variety of machines may possibly be 
constructed, an unlimited diversity of tasks may potentially be 
performed, and the ranges of action and perception may be extended into 
the micros and the cosmos, although certain standard machine types will 
predominate.  Finally, in the theoretical physical sciences (physics, 
chemistry, etc.), all specific applications are transcended; such abstract 
principles may be instantiated for application to any task.
    
    The Evolution of Language

This evolution also emerges from the substrate of bodily action, and 
begins with calls or movements intended to elicit the attention of a 
responsive other.  Next comes the indicative gesture, which directs the 
attention of the other away from the gesturer toward something upon 
which the gesturer wishes the other to focus. This may be seen as arising 
from imitative bodily extension in the absence of an implement; one is 
pointing at that which one would have touched with a stick had one had a 
stick in hand.  This indirect bodily action, directed toward a responsive 
other, constitutes primordial communication.  The third stage involves 
modifying natural vocalization into an imitative representation of an 
absent referent (onomatopoeic words probably have their origin here).  A 
small array of primitive signals may be assembled, but many objects 
make no sound to imitate.  Genuine creativity makes its appearance here; 
the advent of rudimentary but genuine sign systems, where the signs still 
have specific referents, but are no longer constrained to imitate them. 
These are refined into multipurpose signs (number names, primary color 
and shape names, etc.), where the use of a sign to indicate whole, single 
and particular things is subsumed by its employment to represent general 
attributes which have been abstracted from them.  Still, the array of 
possible monosyllabic sounds is inadequate for efficient discourse.  A 
revolution, the phonemic principle of language, is required, where sounds 
that are meaningless in themselves are combined into meaningful wholes, 
some of which are multipurpose signs and some of which derive their 
significance solely from their use as links connecting and relating these 
multipurpose signs in varying ways. These words may be combined into 
sentences obeying syntactic laws that must themselves, to be useful, 
facilitate a reliable representation and communication of the physical 
entities, situations and relations being described.  Now an unlimited 
number of signs may be created, and spun into boundless streams of 
discourse, although certain standardized constructions will predominate.  
Finally, in algebra and symbolic logic, all specific references are 
transcended, and any referent may be abstractly represented.
   
(6)  The Evolution of Text 

This evolution also emerges from the substrate of bodily action, and 
is initiated by the need to direct attention to others, such as predators, 
prey or conspecifics.  It begins with mimicry, or bodily imitation 
(representation) of the movements of present or absent others, most 
likely paired with indicative gestures to indicate either the other(s) being 
mimicked (if present) or the direction in which the absent other(s) lie(s). 
 Inanimate things (such as landmarks) are much harder to mimic, 
however, and if absent can not be pointed out.   In such cases, the 
mimicry, or subjective bodily representation, would require external 
objectification into the depiction of things and maps (drawing in the dirt 
seems a likely first step).  The picture represents by means of imitation, 
and is intended to evoke in the viewer the mental image of that which it 
depicts, or at least the capacity to recognize the depicted, when one 
encounters it, by means of its depictions remembered similarity to it.  In 
the case of maps, the territory as a whole is the represented object.  
These pictures become simplified and standardized into glyphs.  
However, many meanings are not of corporeal entities; they are thus not 
subject to depiction.  The glyphs therefore accumulate secondary 
meanings, which metaphorically refer to these undepictables.  Such a 
glyphic vocabulary is unwieldy, however; the Chinese system has over 
one hundred thousand separate characters, many of which are barely 
distinguishable and easily confused.  The phonetic principle of text 
overcame this difficulty.  A small number of glyphs (an alphabet of 
letters and numerals) which have progressively lost their original 
reference meaning, are used to represent the phonemes of spoken 
language and the basic numbers.  They may thus be efficiently combined 
into textual representations of any word or quantity, by means of 
punctuation (such as: ; ! ? etc.) and arithmetical symbols (+, -, =, etc.), 
which possess purpose solely as differing subspecies of mediations 
between representational groups. 

(7)  Similarities, Differences and Dependencies

Technology and language both pass through the stages of direct 
bodily action, mediated bodily action, imitative action, creative action, 
eclipse of particularity by structure, the creation of composites, and 
abstract generalization.  Text evolves from mimicry through depiction of 
types and numbers of objects to the representation of their linguistic 
referents, first as individual glyphs and counting marks, then as 
alphabetical and numeric composites.  Technology involves a physical 
action upon objects; language involves a symbolic reference to anything 
conceivable.  The creation of tools also created meaning not found in 
nature the tool came to represent its use.  Thus the first signs were 
tools, and technology evolved prior to and was a condition for the 
possibility of language.  Texts are both systems of signs in their own 
right, and tools by means of which we represent the language upon which 
their present form of existence depends.  Text underwent (from its 
divergence as depiction) an independent though structurally similar 
evolution to language - independent due to the differences inherent in 
auditory versus visual media, similar since they were referred by the 
same species of mind to the same world.   Once the phonemic principle 
of language took hold, however, the phonetic principle of text, with some 
exceptions (not all societies are literate), followed. Thereafter, as the 
increasing capabilities of an expanding spoken vocabulary co-opted 
progressively more of the tasks previously requiring depiction, text was 
primarily placed (with certain exceptions, such as maps, mathematics and 
musical notation) in the service of language representation, and graphic 
depiction was increasingly relegated to the realm of art.

(8)  The Communication of Information in the Pre-linguistic Domain

Before telling (a kind of saying) became a viable means to 
communicate a knowing, it had to be transmitted by demonstration, or 
showing.  This is the most intimate and concrete mode of 
communication, requiring the spatio-temporal co-presence of the 
shower, the thing shown, the showing of this thing, and those to whom it 
is shown.  In fact, in this mode, the showing and the thing shown are 
only divisible if the latter is a separate physical object (pointing 
something out).  If what is being shown is a doing, such as swimming, or 
a making (which is a kind of doing) such as knapping a handaxe, the 
instrumentality and the expressiveness of the body (or the what to 
do/make and the how to do/make) are seamless.  This knowing is 
transmitted through observation and imitation of the doing or making, and 
immediate feedback is available from the world concerning whether or 
not those shown are gaining the having of the knowledge for themselves 
(or whether they, too, can make/do).  This knowing would most likely be 
best retained by routinizing the sequence of actions involved (Mind over 
Machine, Dreyfus & Dreyfus, 1986; The Logic of Practice, Pierre 
Bourdieu, 1990), a procedure easily generalizable into ritual.

(9)   Linguistic Information Communication

Once people possessed a common language, a knowing could be 
transmitted by telling, which was more flexible than showing.  The teller, 
the telling and those to whom it was told must still be spatio-temporally 
co-present, but the presence of the thing told is not required.  This frees 
events to be communicated to those absent from their occurrence, but 
permits lying, mistakes, miscommunication and misunderstanding, for 
the feedback from the world required in a showing may be omitted.  One 
can tell another what/how to do or make without doing or making 
oneself; one can only show by ones own doing or making.  Telling also 
permits the transmission of abstractions such as theories, speculations, 
and ideas, which, lacking physical instantiation, can not be shown.
Unlike showing, telling is a coding of the thing told.  One listens to 
telling not as a showing is observed, as a presentation of an event, but as a 
string of symbols bereft of any spatio-temporality which belongs to that 
told of rather than to its telling. There is no environmental context, no 
gestalt; the knowing received through telling carries no memory.  
Mnemonics such as rhythm, sibilance and rhyme (Goatfoot Milktongue 
Twinbird, 1978, Donald Hall), used to retain the told as it was told, would 
naturally form the basis for early poetic epics.

    The Advent of Text

A common written code further abstracts the knowing from any 
particular event.  The writing must of course be co-present with the 
writer, but the presence of neither the written of nor the written to is 
required.  The fluidity of discourse can be frozen like ice on a sheet of 
papyrus, ripped from the lived worlds of both the teller and the told, and 
sent unchanging across space-time to anonymous readers.  Now history 
can be recorded and knowledge accumulated and preserved, freed from 
the vagaries of memory and the passing of masters.  Science begins to 
gleam in the alchemical eye of superstition, music takes the first steps 
from melody to symphony, and from the synthesis of ritual and poetry, 
theatre may be born.  Logo-centric religions of the book may supplant 
prehistoric pagan rites and contend with each other, and philosophy may 
begin to probe both their assertions and its own.  						
			   
(11)  A Recapitulation of Terms

Being, knowing and having are states; doing, saying and making 
are processes.  Knowing and having are modes of being, and knowing is a 
having of knowledge. Likewise, saying and making are modes of doing, 
and saying is a making of discourse.  There are other dependencies, also; 
one must be (although since life is involved in dynamic 
organism/environment exchange even when at rest, all living being is 
actually a becoming) in order to do, one must know in order to say, and 
one must have in order to make.  Showing, telling and writing may 
involve doing or making, but are essentially forms of saying.  

(12)  Why Technology Had to Precede Language, and the March of the 
Ur-Meme

The coordinated system of perception and action which humans 
possess took millions of years to develop, and our huge and finely 
articulated brains required constant selective reinforcement from the 
environment in order to evolve.  In this sense, our quick strong bright 
nimbleness is a result of the pre-reproductive demise of a lot of slow 
weak clumsy dumb ancestors.  These are individual skills; those with 
them have a prima facie reproductive advantage over those without them.  
Language, however, is social.  What possible use could it have been for 
the first mutant to have a modest capacity for linguistic expression in the 
absence of interlocutors?  Language facility is simply not a likely 
candidate for gradual evolution in the same manner as hunting and 
gathering skills. It is much more likely that a genetically dominant 
second order mutation in brain systems organization hijacked an already 
elaborated hand-eye coordination system and applied it to the mouth-
ear nexus (Uniquely Human, Philip Lieberman, 1991).  In this way, the 
social benefits could be realized in just a few generations.  Once this 
mutation spread within a group of hunter-gatherers, its members could 
yell for help better and both express and apprehend more subtle 
emotional states  useful skills in a nomadic foraging band.  Being 
informationally rather than biologically based, the machine, phonetic and 
phonemic principles of tools, signs and texts were nevertheless most 
likely extrapolated from the gestalt contexture of action/perception; the 
structures underlining these therefore appear to constitute a 
combinatorial Ur-meme (The Selfish Gene, Richard Dawkins, 1976).  
Remember the Gaia Hypothesis (James Lovelock, 1979)?  It states that 
the aggregate of terrestrial life tends to regulate its own environment to 
facilitate its own perpetuation.  Now, imagine human minds as, due to the 
evolution of their somatic perceptual structuring of their surroundings, 
already favorably disposed environments in which these principles, 
considered as informational forms of life, take root.  They would need to 
protect their niches and to replicate; the first is accomplished by 
evolving to give the host environment a reason to have them around 
(much like E. Coli bacteria facilitate digestion) and the second by 
evolving ease of infection (transmitting/teaching the principles to 
others).  Once tool-craft got going, tool forms would evolve to give the 
best selective advantage to those possessing them at the same time 
humans would evolve to more quickly and efficiently conceive of and 
produce better and better tools.  Once language piggybacked onto the co-
opted coordination system, it would evolve to be most easily absorbed 
into childrens brains at the same time it would offer a progressively 
greater selective social advantage to those children whose brains were 
most permeable to it (The Symbolic Species, Terrence W. Deacon, 
1997).  The evolutionary imperative is in this case exactly the opposite 
of that of biotic killers such as influenza, measles, and gonorrhea, which 
had to evolve to become less virulent to allow for their transmission 
before the death of the host.  In their case, the more efficient lose the 
competition to those strains which manifest slower or less completely.  
On the contrary, incubation of these informational life forms grants a 
selective reproductive advantage to those infected; the evolutionary 
exigencies therefore gravitate towards more communicable forms with 
faster incubation and more global mental infestation.  Rather than 
virulent, these memes are budding symbionts; like mental mitochondria.  
And so telling is more easily and widely communicable than showing, and 
writing more amenable to distribution than telling.   So far this may seem 
mere speculation, but watch how it dovetails with history.
  Once texts began to be created, they became more desired as the 
literati gained power and influence.  Scholars and scribes seemed to exist 
solely for the task of creating and replicating libraries of texts, which 
seemed to exist solely to employ scribes and train scholars.  Mass 
production of tools and texts has led to corporate culture, labor division 
and assembly lines, which in turn have allowed the construction of mass 
communications systems, and mass transit systems to distribute both the 
codes and their carriers.  These dendritic hybrids of tool, sign and text 
are connecting human neurons into a terran brain, communicating our 
codes by means of metacodes.  Not only has the ground of past history 
beneath our feet been excavated by means of our textually informed gaze, 
but the horizon of the future has been dissolved into the present as our 
televisions and telephones abolish space-time through instantaneous 
communication (The Spell of the Sensuous, David Abram, 1996).  And 
we have made countless copies of them all.

(13)  Staring at a Screen Darkly

The advent of the Internet recombines the abolition of space-time 
barriers to communication with the constant and instant availability of 
(potentially) practically all textual knowledge, as computer aided design 
and computer assisted manufacture threaten to leave the proletariat with 
little beyond bourgeois leisure and a subsistence stipend.  The underclass 
will be known not as the unwashed, but as the unwired.  With every 
computer terminal a samizdat, governments (and religions) will 
progressively lose their ability to tell the big lies and make them stick 
(see Zapatista).  Guerilla semioticians will increasingly poach the 
icons and symbols of governmental, religious and corporate institutions 
and imbue them with different and frequently subversive meanings (The 
Practice of Everyday Life, Michel de Certeau, 1984).  Authority will 
issue not from age, race, gender or status, but from the internal 
consistency, logical cogency, linguistic clarity and external coherence of 
ones positions.  Spoken and written language forms will continue 
vanishing as quickly as endangered species, as informational selection 
takes its Darwinian toll.  The hegemony of employment over location 
will melt away as more and more jobs can be performed from anywhere 
with power and a telephone line.  Global democracy will supercede 
multiple national sovereignty as humanitys attachments to borders and 
boundaries will shrink along with their relevance to the lives of an 
increasingly individually sovereign citizenry (as Francis Fukuyama 
foresaw in The End Of History, 1992).   The policy debates now 
occurring within electronic town meetings will be settled by cyber-
votes.  The Human Genome Project will allow human beings to 
genetically know themselves (Socrates and Hippocrates would be 
pleased) and to re-engineer their codes to remove textual errors 
(inherited defects).  If they like the result, genocopies (clones) will be 
possible, and there is already talk of exploiting the shared binary codes 
of computer language and the double helix to create DNA computers.  
The meme will then have traveled full circle, finding its way back to the 
gene.  In the coming millenium, homo sapiens will be both weavers of 
and woven by, for better or for  worse, the informational warp and 
communicational weft of a co-evolutionary New Web Order.

Actually a fair argument could be made that the Delta Clipper folks stole
a lot from his 'Phoenix' design anyway. The main point I'd disagree on
here is the C^3I; the Delta Clipper was flown by a Mac, whereas Roton is
flown by a human. Unfortunately he's been talking on Usenet about a 7.5g

I agree some of the comments on this list have been a bit silly lately.
But buried beneath the dross there are some legitimate questions about M-F
psychology.

I remember reading somewhere that a survey of libertarians found most of
them are INTJ or INTP
(I'm INTP myself). It seems evident to me that as rare as these 2 types are
in the general
population they are rarer still among the female population and if there is
correlation between holding
libertarian ideas and holding extropian ideas. ...

Women are probably more likely to be extroverted than men (evolution seems
to have predisposed
women to be more 'social beings' hence the predilection for 'gossip' - I am
not being
derogatory about this- 'gossip' obviously served a useful function in the
sexual division of labour
in primeval times)
Women are probably more likely to be feelers than thinkers (again I am not
saying one is
superior to the other - it takes complementary strategies to propagate the
species)
Women are probably more level-headed than men ( S over N), less likely to be
convinced by solely abstract demonstrations of truth and falsity- hence the
dominance of men
in professions like maths and physics.
Of course, there are also those correlations between math/physics ability
and gender.
Obviously all these traits also correlate negatively with people who are
more likely to be
extropians or intellectual activists in general
(think - how typical was Ayn Rand of the average female- the exception
that proves the rule),

Once again let me emphasise I am not trying to spread sexist innuendo here.
Anyone who
thinks I am is himself/herself guilty of thinking that 'feminine' qualities
are inferior to or less
important than masculine qualities.

Considering that current rocket technology only allows a mass fraction of around
.95, that means that for every ton you put in orbit, you expend 19 tons in fuel
and boosters getting it there. In order to cancel all of a spacecraft's velocity
so that it can just 'free fall' to earth from altutude, you would essentially need
to carry an equal amount of fuel into orbit as you used for the original blastoff.
Since you also need to launch that fuel and boosters by the same mass fraction,
then you would increase the size, mass and cost of your original launcher by at
least 19 times....so while its possible, its not cost effective.

New technologies usually are the domain of government/company research 
facilities, then the relatively few rich and powerful that can afford
the prototypes, then the well-off middle classes etc. Years or even
decades go by before a new technology is available to the general
population. IMO, the pioneers of AI, nanotech, uploading, chip-brain
interface etc,(which are all interconnected btw, so that the emergence
of one these technologies would considerably speed up the advent of the
others) will figure out how to transcend at approximately the same time
that the new products would have normally become more widely available;
i.e. when the major bugs have been taken out.

In the case of SI, any head start, no matter how slight, can mean all
the difference in the world. A SI can think, and thus strike, much
faster than less intelligent, disorganized masses. Before others
could transcend themselves or organize resistance, it would be too late.
So yes, someone will be the first to have SI, and unless the rest 
is only seconds or minutes behind (or has vastly superior technology), 
they *will* be neutralized *if* the SI is malevolent, or simply cold
and rational.

I'm looking forward to reading it...I do beleive I have a 
solid case though: the chances that SI will be only for a small group
or even just one entity are *at least* 50%, likely more.

Well, that's the catch; SIs won't be "people" in any normal
sense, so there's absolutely no guarantee that they will behave (more or
less) like people. The situation is radically different because SI is
radically different, basically an alien life form.

This is a typical feature of our interdependent society. Since no-one
has the power to be fully autonomous (do whatever you want and get
away with it), PR is important. 

> I just

Surely you mean every*thing*? ;) IMO, a real SI will be fully
autonomous; it can soak up most of humanity's knowledge via
the web, reprogram and improve itself (evolve), manipulate its
surroundings with nanoprobes, macrobots etc. If it wants something, it
can simply take it. In other words, it's a world in itself.

> Specialization and division of labor will still apply.

Yes, but it will be parts of the being itself that will perform
the specialized tasks, not outside entities.

That could be the case (roughly 33 %), but it wouldn't be the most
rational approach. Simply put: more (outside) diversity means also
a greater risk of being attacked, with possibly fatal consequences.
If a SI is the only intelligent being in the universe, then it's
presumably safe. In any case *safer* than with known others around.
Now, how can outside diversity benefit the SI? Through a) entertainment
b) providing extra computing power to solve problems that might
threaten the SI, like the end of the universe (if there is such a thing
at all). Do these advantages outweigh the risks? Rationally speaking,
they don't. A SI has ample computing power and intelligence to entertain 
itself and to solve just about any problem (it's auto-evolving and
can always grow extra brain mass to increase its output -- it can
even turn the whole known universe into a computer, given enough
time. And time it has, being technically immortal). Why would it
want other entities around that are powerful, unpredictable, beyond 
its control? There is a lot more at stake for a SI (eternity), so
presumably it will be *very* careful. I think that the need for company
is a typically human thing, us being social apes and all, and it no
longer applies to SI.

A bold claim indeed ;) However, becoming a SI will probably change
your motivational system, making any views you hold at the beginning
of transcension rapidly obscolete. Also, being one of the first may
not be good enough. Once a SI is operational, mere hours, minutes and
even seconds could be the difference between success and total failure.
After all, a "malevolent" SI could (for example) easily sabotage most of
the earth's computer systems, including those of the competition, and
use the confusion to gain a decisive head start.

> Or, are you planning on trying to stop me from bringing new members

I'm not planning to stop anyone, but what I want is irrelevant anyway
since I don't really expect to be among the lucky few that make it
(I will certainly try, though). Others *will* likely try to stop you,
not just from helping your fellow man, but also from transcending
yourself. After all, people won't be selected for their upright morals,
but for wealth, power, efficiency (ruthlessness) and plain luck. And
who's to tell how ascending will influence one's character. It
certainly wouldn't be unreasonable to assume that there's an
equal chance that SIs will be indifferent, evil or benevolent (or
some strange mix of these traits, way beyond our current 
understanding).

Let me throw my somewhat belated $.02 in here with a few thoughts and
comments:

1.  PLEASE remember before you post that this list is archived on the web.
Curious and potentially valuable new members of the transhumanist community
often browse the web archive before making a decision to become more actively
involved in transhumanist and extropian discussions and activities.  Because
of our evolved sexuality (more about which below), any thread title containing
the character string "hot babes" is likely to attract disproportionate
attention.  Imagine the impact that such a title has on the perceptions of the
people who may be inclined to CRITICIZE transhumanism and extropianism.  And
for you young men at the entry level of the mating market, consider the impact
that such a thread title might have on the very women you would like to
attract into extropianism...

2.  Related to the above is the observation that this list is "open", in the
sense that all are welcome to come have a seat in our cyberspace salon, listen
and contribute.  However, PLEASE bear in mind that a text list such as this
offers extremely low bandwidth for assessing the social sensibilities of other
participants.  We primates are first and foremost social beings and we are
fundamentally visual and auditory beings, exquisitely evolved to send and
receive signals about social receptivity and rejection.  Before posting about
a subject as delicate as sexuality, consider that you may well not know your
audience very well.  Would you say whatever you are about to post in a room
full of strangers?  If not, it may not be appropriate.

3.  We've had similar discussions before.  The relatively low number of women
in our ranks is lamentable, but can be remedied.  We are a very young cultural
milieu, still very much in the process of synthesizing a world-view from the
best of what has gone before and the best of our vision of what is and should
come in the future.  In the spirit of dynamic optimism, let us work together
to include as many people as can profitably contribute to the transhumanist
agenda.  In this endeavor, consider that one of our most powerful tools is
DIPLOMACY.  Diplomatic skills take time to develop.  Consider this list as a
place to hone those skills in a positive environment.

4.  For you young men who may be frustrated by the paucity of feminine company
in the hard sciences, I highly recommend a book by Howard Buss called "The
Evolution of Desire: Strategies of Human Mating" which contains a remarkable
empirical analysis of human sexuality in the context of evolutionary
psychology.  This is one of the three or four most recommended books in my
library.

That was a really great post - I didn't quote it in the interests of space.
On a side note, I wonder if further research in areas such as quantum
physics and consciousness will break down the dichotomies between matter and
spirit, subjective and objective.
    Much of the Extropian program - such as life extension, body
modification and mind-computer interaction aspects, seem to many people as a
way of mechanizing humanity.  I see it as humanizing technology, actually -
but more than that, I see it as a sort of modern Alchemy.
    If one sees Alchemy as an ancient symbolic dialogue where the Alchemist
strives to transform him/herself works in and through the material world, I
think there are intriguing similarities.

There would seem to be an evolutionary justification; if women are 
responsible for bringing up children then they're likely to prefer a 
secure, stable society because that's likely to improve the chances of 
their children surviving. Given that the kinds of futures we talk about 
are far from secure and stable it's no surprise that women who haven't
transcended their evolutionary programming are going to feel horrified.

The "hot babe" I'm currently going out with is certainly open to transhuman
ideas. Interestingly she's also in no hurry to have kids (if she ever does),
so this would fit with the theory above.

Income tax rates decreased, but other taxes increased. In particular 
increasing VAT (sales tax for American readers) from around 9% to 17.5% 
was a very significant growth in taxation. Whether one gained or lost 
depends to a large extent on how much of their income went on taxable 
items, and whether you rented or owned your own house (poll tax etc hit
renters harder because their rents rarely went down with the end of
the old property tax and they had poll tax to pay on top).

Definitely agree on that; much as I disliked Thatcher for many of her
authoritarian tendencies, she improved Britain's economy immeasurably 
during her time in office. Shame 'New Labor' are working to turn the
clock back.

After skimming this thread I am grateful not to have been on the 
Internet this weekend.  I would, however, like to make one suggestion.  

For those you who are interested in a future gender balance within 
extropianism or within transhumanism, PLEASE LISTEN to this.  You have 
GOT to STOP singling out females as (1) a goal for recruitment, (2) 
fodder for cyberbabe fantasies and (3) expectations of mating.  We just 
want to show up and interact intellectually like the men get to do.  If 
we do not get to interact intellectually, if we are constant targets 
for special attention, comeons, and retaliation after we 'reject' you, 
then we are going to walk.

This behavior has driven women out of here before, and it has driven me 
out.  There has been too much of it over the past two years, and I 
think that you guys need to think long and hard about how you treat 
young women within your ranks.  I am asking you to do this 
as a friend, as someone who continues to support the goals of ExI, but 
who simply cannot live with the stress any longer.  It 
takes away energy that should be going to important transhumanist 
projects, which is going to my full focus from now on.  Anyone who 
wants to work with me is welcome--if you are looking for a different 
kind of attention, you need to back off.

Take care,
Kathryn Aegis

Some comments = Summary opinion is the 'exhibition' is heavy on eye 
candy and light on content. I'm a graphic artist with a computer gaming 
company and I fancy myself a transhumanists too so I can comment on both 
sides of the coin.

>From an technical art standpoint there was nothing there that you cant 
find in an AOL graphics forum. No epiphany engines. The rendering work 
was mediocre. It was good for an amateur. Im assuming Sandberg is not a 
formally trained graphic artist. Several illumination problems, 
questionable material and vector calls. But nothing requiring 
crucifixion. :-)

I havent figured out the whole 'transhuman art' concept yet so its hard 
for me to judge whether Sandberg succeeded. I doubt anything I saw would 
inspire someone to change their views about transhumanism. Then again 
you can say that about everything Ive seen that is called transhuman or 
extropian art.  Anyway.....

Its kinda amusing that people are getting so indignant about this hot 
babe thing. Sure, the guy that made the point was an ass. Pity him, dont 
engage him in discourse. This whole feigned indignance thing that some 
people have going on is the real amusement. These people have more 
plastic than a power ranger suit and post doctored pictures of 
themselves in tight leather, speedos, and lathered in oil. But say the 
term 'hot babe' and its time to be haughty. 

Its my fault this whole things got started when I posted about the 
'Nerds should rot' article in the Boston Globe. We've got an image. 
Whether we like it or not its there. We're a group of tech geeks with a 
few plastic hippies thrown in for good measure. Hey, we love our

TriStateF@aol.com asked:

> Why do women find transhumanism to be unappealing?  Someone please
> explain.

	I have the same question.

	There also seems to be other sides to such differences between
men and women.  Take the Mormons for example.  Now this is a real full
of women church.  For some reason, it seems to me, women just go for
that kind of stuff, as much or more so as do men go for extropianism.
Why do women find mormonism so appealing?  LDS men have quite the
choice of any women they want.  The fact that there were so many more
mormon women than men is part of the reason for polygamy in mormonism.
Would the chance to have multiple "hot babes" doting over you be an
incentive?  For a time even I tried to be the kind of LDS Guy all the
women seemed to want.

	Also, it seems women are much more capable of pulling men in
their direction than is the reverse.  You constantly see "hot babes"
dating non mormon men, converting them, getting them baptized, and
then marrying them.  I don't see many women converting to extropiansim
to marry some man.  Also don't forget that the hand that rocks the
cradle rules the world...

	Then there is me and my wife, having both been raised as
mormons.  My wife is about as mormon as they come while I, being a
natural extropian from birth, could never quite understand all, what
was to me, the hogwash mormons constantly spout.  Since there are so
many extropian men and mormon women, I guess some of us must just
intermarry and learn how to get along.  It's a bit hard at times but I
think it can work.  Now if I could just succeed at having as much
influence over our children as my wife does.

This is a good opportunity to state that this extropian list, sponsored by
ExI does not require those who post on it to be members of ExI.  

Thus, let's not assume that the type of postings that are insulting to
women - transhumans or otherwise - are representational of ExI.

I do agree with Kathryn's statement:

>PLEASE LISTEN to this.  You have 
>GOT to STOP singling out females as (1) a goal for recruitment, (2) 
>fodder for cyberbabe fantasies and (3) expectations of mating.  We just 
>want to show up and interact intellectually like the men get to do.  If 
>we do not get to interact intellectually, if we are constant targets 
>for special attention, comeons, and retaliation after we 'reject' you, 
>then we are going to walk.

>This behavior has driven women out of here before,

To be sure some women have left this list because of the inappropriate
statements about women.  However, I know of no women who has left ExI
because of this.  Most extropian women are not on this list.

Let us treat women with respect, individuality and *without* PC gender
balance or for viewing tits and ass.  

I am on this list for examining ideas, advancing my thinking spreading
extropic memes and meeting new transhuman extropic friends.

Sincerely,

Natasha Vita More

I thought the "monolith contemplating Mondrians
paintings" was inspired, as was the "portrait of
the artist as a small geometric system" (for me
this sums up transhuman art in one sentence).

AFAIK Anders used PoVRay (www.povray.org), I don't
know what you use, but it's likely to be 3D Studio
MAX, Softimage, or AW Maya in the games industry.
PoVRay is a freeware ray tracer without much of an
advanced interface.

Regardless of their effect on other people, it's
clear that the artists intentions were
transhuman. The images and words (and especially
some of the quotes from list members - harking
back to a time when no one talked about "hot
babes" (and coincidentally I didn't talk at all))
fitted together perfectly.

In a message dated 98-08-10 08:25:24 EDT, you write:

<< Considering that current rocket technology only allows a mass fraction of
around
.95, that means that for every ton you put in orbit, you expend 19 tons in
fuel
and boosters getting it there. In order to cancel all of a spacecraft's
velocity
so that it can just 'free fall' to earth from altutude, you would essentially
need
to carry an equal amount of fuel into orbit as you used for the original
blastoff.
Since you also need to launch that fuel and boosters by the same mass
fraction,
then you would increase the size, mass and cost of your original launcher by
at
least 19 times....so while its possible, its not cost effective.
  >>

I understand, I thought it would take less fuel since the operation would be
done in a vacuum.  The idea is still there, for when we have the opportunuity
to slow it down without using or bringing extra fuel, there would be more
possibilities in a vacuum to do something like that, perhaps laser technology
or some kind of waveform, using satellites.

When I saw the first few posts in the "hot extropian women" thread,
I flagged it as just another thread I thought I could predict, and 
so wasn't interested in reading.  But it surprised me.

I agree many of the early posters could have been more "civilized",
but I've actually been more surprised by many of the reactions.

My overwhelming reaction here is one of empathy.  There are a lot of 
guys on this list (maybe a majority?) who are really hurting emotionally.  
They strongly desire the company of females, but feel (and may well be) 
unwanted.  And they are all the more pained to discover that extropian 
type interests are another turnoff to the women they meet.  This is a 
big issue for these men, and it's well worthy of further discussion.

Now maybe some could have been more diplomatic in expressing their pain, 
but it pains me more to see so little empathy for their pain among the
various reactions.  I see blatant sales, indigation at describing a 
desired woman as a "hot babe", people scolded for their inadequate 
features or strategies, and people bragging about how they don't have 
such problems.  But I haven't seen enough of:  Yeah, it hurts; we're 
sorry; how can we help?  

Yes, this topic may well make the few women on this list feel 
uncomfortable.  So let's all try to make it clear: We treasure women,
and not just or even primarily as potential dates.  (And I for one wish
the female lurkers would speak up more often.) 

But let's also remember: male pain is real, and deserves attention, even 
if it isn't articulate pretty or articulate.  Let's acknowledge that 
on average male nerds, especially extropian male nerds, are less desired
by women.  Then let's try to understand more about why, and see if we
can help.

Ironically, in the context of remote space exploration, slowing down
by rockets is the old-fashioned way to go, and atmospheric braking
is the hot new idea.  The movie 2010 had a dramatic sequence showing
aerobraking being used to put a manned spacecraft into orbit around
Jupiter.

The current Mars observer has been using aerobraking to circularize
its orbit, although the technique has not worked too well because of a
problem with a somewhat broken solar panel attachment.

Aerobraking can potentially save considerable fuel in a mission to orbit
another planet and no doubt it will continue to be used in the future.
It would be somewhat backwards to use rockets in the one case where
atmospheric braking is well established and understood, re-entry into
Earth's atmosphere.

There are always going to be stereotypes and generalities with every group of
people, at least it has been that way.  I just wish everyone would remember
that there are exceptions to the rules (stereotype) .   :)

Perhaps it would be helpful for those of us fortunate enough to have found
compatible mates to describe how and where we met them.

In my case, I met my wife in college.  Fran was a biology major while
I was in engineering.  She is atheletic and intellectually gifted.
Her father was an electrical engineer and he imparted to all his kids
an appreciation for science and the importance of an analytical approach
to problems.

Fran is especially attracted to the Extropian ideas of self-transformation
and boundless expansion, all part of a general attitude of self
improvement.  She comes from a secular Jewish background and did not have
much belief in conventional religion to overcome, and so the Extropian
idea of eventually overcoming death through technology was appealing.

Not everyone will be fortunate enough to find someone like my wife,
but I would think that looking among women in the sciences would be a
good place to start.  Of course women are underrepresented there but in
some fields they are a substantial fraction.  These people are already
accustomed to thinking analytically, they will tend to be less religious
than on the average, they are aware of the importance of technological
progress.  They are also accustomed to being around men who have similar
attitudes so they must not hate them too much or they would have gone
into another field.

Fran also likes to swim, bike and work out at the gym, but I don't think
you'd find as large a fraction of proto-Extropians there.  Gym people are
interested in self-improvement but they mostly don't have the technical
background to appreciate the more advanced ideas of Extropianism.  Still,
if you looked for a scientifically or technically oriented person who
also enjoyed sports and working out, and you cultivated similar traits
yourself, I'll bet that your odds would be significantly improved.

This is an idea I have been thinking about for quite some time, especially

What is the big deal? You know the two most common places for people to
find partners are work and church (at least in America), since both work
and church are for me tied very closely to the internet...why not? I
mean to say that my lifestyle has incorperated cyberness so much that I
find it harder and harder to relate to people who are not immersed in
technology. So if I hop onto my computer and engage people
intellectually and creatively and then find some of them attractive, I
mean what's the big deal about expressing intrest in them personally? I
mean I work at home, I don't go to church, and I try to avoid alcohol so
bar 'babes' are not gonna do it for me. When I DJ I'm normally busy
working and everyone else is 'hooking up.'

I don't think i'm that unique. Extropian endeavors are at this point
highly singular efforts. The nature of the electronic music I make, for
example, makes collaberations difficult (although I've been exchanging
.aiff files over the net for remixing), a lot of long hours are spent in
my electronic music studio experimenting with the nature of sound. I
think that a lot of Extropians are researchers, programmers, artists,
and that we probably don't have a huge amount of time for all of the
normal rituals that lead up to getting laid (or whatever) So as a sort
of consolation prize, I interact with people on the internet. I find it
to be pretty satisfying. If some are cute (like Sarah Marr) I'm gonna
bust a move.  Who's it gonna hurt? If anyone is not interested they
should just say so. I think there's some pretty intellegent and
sensitive persons in this group, I think if you make your desires clear
they will be respected.

That's all I'm ever saying about this subject forever!

I am one of a select few extropians who has not read very many science
fiction novels.  I would like to change that.  I am open to any
suggestions; however, I think it's pretty obvious I'm looking to get into 
quality sci-fi with distinctively Extropian leanings.

I've read around 10 sci-fi novels in my entire life.  To give you
an idea of what I like, my three favourites were:

1. "Dispossessed" by Ursula Leguin(sp?)
2. "Brave New World" by Aldous Huxley
3. "Gateway" by Frederick Pohl

.... in that order.

thanx in advance,

Geoff.

Natasha, I have left ExI because of this, two weeks ago.  You knew this two
weeks ago.  Please do not make statements that are not based in fact.  I
continue to support ExI's goals, but the environment for those of us not
based in California is not supportive to women of my demographics, based on
my experience.  If ExI wants to do something about that, I welcome the
action, but I have to move on to more supportive groups.

Thank you.

       Here's the deal.  Go read David Stockman's "The Triumph of

       In a genuine Agorist free market society, there _are_ no classes. 
       Insofar as there manifestly _are_ classes, in both Britain and

While I absolutely respect Kathryn's right to reveal only that which she 
chooses about her personal thoughts and experiences in this forum, I can't 
help but be alarmed at the implied accusation in the above statement. 

I'm particularly confused and intrigued by this: "...the environment for 
those of us not based in California is not supportive to women of my 
demographics..."

Since you are (more or less) calling for action by ExI here, it would be
very helpful to know just what events led to your leaving ExI, and what kind 
of action you'd like to see.

Thanks very much for any information you care to add.

The embargoed high biotech island of libertarian SF turns out to be
Cuba.  I find this quite amusing.
http://www.latimes.com/HOME/NEWS/FRONT/t000072938.html

Summary: SmithKline has partnered with Cuba to market their group B
meningococcal vaccine, and has applied for an embargo waiver in the US.
(The vaccine fights group B meningitis.)  One team is in the first phase
of human clinical trials of an AIDS vaccine they hope will be ready for
commercial use in 2 years.  Another group is "perfecting" a cholera
vaccine.  Biotech is now Cuba's 4th largest export earner.  US market
analysts confirm Cuba has state-of-the-art research and production
capability.

<quote>
   In recent years, the government has invested hundreds of millions of
dollars in biotech facilities and research. That has created something of a
technology gap here: scientists using advanced genetic techniques to clone
fish in a land where the U.S. embargo has made antibiotics scarce on hospital
shelves and smoke-belching, '50s-vintage Chevys and Buicks commonplace on the
streets. 
     Dr. Mario Pablo Estrada, who heads the fish-transgenesis project,
explains the phenomenon with simple mathematics: "With $7 million, we couldn't
even begin to produce our own basic medicines," which he said are far more
costly to mass produce than highly specialized "niche" products such as
vaccines.  "But with a $7-million investment here at the genetic research
center, we can make $30 million in sales, and we can use that to buy a lot of
basic medicines."

My, you really are giving every sign of being *both* cowardly and nasty.
Every one of your posts consists of criticizing, insulting, and sniping.
You don't have the courage to post under your real name. And you make
false, slanderous comments as if that was an acceptable thing to do on our
list. Not only do you hide your identity, you don't come out and say that
you are referring to me here. FYI, those pictures are not in slightest bit
doctored. That's just wishful thinking on your part. (And I don't wear
leather; that's vinyl. At least try to get your facts straight.)

I do not belive that all humans will become transhumans, I belive that the population will not allow power hungry egotistical maniacs to have transhuman benefits. I know I would not like having Sadam Heussian have life extenstion and super intelligance, that would make him an even more threat. So I belive that only Over Intelligant Responsiable Healthy people will be able to become Transhuman because people will not want having anyone abuse there transhuman power.

> >>>Don't worry about those few Extropian females dude, they're mostly...

owwww.... {8-[   anyone can make comments like these just  to bait the group and

watch the wailing and gnashing of teeth.  the fact is, *we dont know who we
are.*
we have no statistics on those who read the extropian newsgroup.  many, if not
most
of the email addresses are nongendered, such as spike66 for instance.

i see that extropians tend to love privacy.  althoprivacy is not important to me

personally, i have gotten religion on the necessity of others to protect theirs.

so, question:  how can we find out how many women and how many men, how
many straight and how many gay, or just plain how many people are out there in
extropians
*without any single person having to reaveal any traceable information* about
themselves?

if we set up a website where anyone could anonymously log on and set down
gender and preference, then any one person could corrupt the entire database by
logging
on an indefinite number of times and in putting false information.  the person
who started the lesbian extropian meme might intentionally do this, for
instance.

on the other hand, if we had every respondant register in order to prevent
multiple
entries, then each response could be traced to an individual.  the most private
extropians (understandably) would not log on, which would also corrupt the
database.

so, i set forth this challange to all extropians:  come up with a means of
polling
the group in such a way that prevents any individual from logging on repeatedly,

without revealing the source of any single entry to protect the privacy of those

who answer the poll.  it must be done online, no writing on dead trees or
postage
stamps.  to the person who discovers such a means, i offer the grand prize of...

my undying admiration and deepest gratitude.  {8^)  spike

michael, i should have been clearer in my explanation, but i was trying tokeep my
response very short.  when i saw the proposal that the roton was
to use the blades to help launch, i thought the writer must be joking.  my reasoning
goes thus:  if one tries to use the roton blades in the launch phase, one could at
best get to an altitude of, well, what?  10 kilometers?  our best helicopters cannot
get as high as the highest peak, everest, less than 9 km.  no chopper rescues
possible for climbers there.

the key point is, if one starts at zero velocity at the outer edge atmosphere,
surprisingly, one is
not appreciably closer to being in earth orbit than if one starts out on the deck.
this is
true.  lets just say the lowest possible orbit is at 100 km, a verrrry short lived
orbit.  if
you somehow raise your spacecraft to 100 km without any forward motion, which is the
case
if you went up with a helicopter, you have expended only about 3% of the energy
required to
achieve orbit. i learned of this while evaluating the feasibility of carrying a
rocket to great altitude
using a huge hydrogen balloon.  you fire the rocket from a 20 km altitude.  turns
out, the extra
altitude gains very little over starting on the ground.

right.  however, rotary blade flight is not particularly efficient.  one example
ishuman powered flight.  athletes have pedalled across the english channel, yet
human powered hover is yet to be accomplished (last i heard anyway).  i hate

You need to read his site first, he has changed the plans since whenever the

Certainly, this is what caused my reaction to the initial postings in this
debate: not the content per se, but the mode of expression chosen (which I
selected to interpret at face value, rather than perform a 'benefit of the
doubt' analysis, I must confess).

Speaking up for once (and I should say at this point that my usual lurking
is a function of time-constraint rather than apathy), I'm concerned about
your use of 'we' in this last paragraph, Robin. Personally, I do feel that
the majority of people on this list value women, but I'm not sure that
allows the use of the global 'we'. In the spirit of your post, however, I
agree that the approach to the minority should be one designed to engender
understanding and a positive way forward.

Perhaps a problem to be addressed before considering the real issue here is
what we mean by, 'nerd'. I think nerd has connotations of appearance,
social skills and psychological make-up, each of which contribute in their
own way to the attractiveness, or otherwise, of the 'nerd'; it is also a
fairly gender-specific category, which is ex necessite qualified with
'female' when used to describe a woman. I don't recall ever having met a
female nerd, and I'm not qualified to talk about the male nerd's
attractiveness or otherwise, but perhaps by breaking down the qualities
that create the category 'nerd' others may be able to provide some insight
in to the problems which they are expressing. And helping others to
overcome their own perceived limitations seems to me to be an very
Extropian thing to do.

I cant believe that the "extropians" are discussing things such as 
gender and sex and female extropians...Spring time has gone!! :-)

Does that really matter to the ones whose main purpose is "to 
increase intelligence" and so on?????

I really can't believe this...after all, this is one of the oldest 
discussions of all, there's nothing new to it and don't think you can 
add anything new, so...we could start another intituled "Man are from 
Mars and Women are from Venus", which is the same as speaking about 
"hot female Extropians"...


By the way, besides man, women and gay do you also want to know 
anything else?? Is there any cats among us??? And chickens??? :-)

I think more important to the extropian list is to know for example our 
nationality and tastes. If you want to know WHO are the extropians, 
there's lots of things (and more important) to know besides gender...

You're right that helicopters have a problem above 8km (the "Death Zone").
But...

It turns out that true Rotons don't occupy the same flight regime as
helicopters.

Helicopters have to fly sideways. Thus they have unbalanced lift on the
blades.
They have freely-moving very high aspect ratio rotor blades, which causes
all sorts of instabilities when the air speed across them gets too high
(Mach >> 1). The blades are driven by a central shaft that usually must be
articulated to permit maneuvering.

The permissible RPM on a helicopter rotor is strictly limited by all these
factors.
There are a few "rigid rotor" designs that address these limitations, but...

All these characteristics are different from boost-phase Rotons. If you can
spin up a stiff blade array to incredible (non-helicopter-achievable) RPMs,
you can still get some bite out of very thin air. The stresses on the
structure are enormous, but they're symmetrical--if all goes well. The
Roton work I looked at a few years ago also used a hoop to keep the blade
tips constrained.

Calculations suggest that Rotons could work all the way out to where air
acts in a Newtonian way. That's a lot higher than the operating altitude of
a chopper. 

And of course you're only using the rotor for *part* of your lift. That's
another difference from regular helicopters.

Not promoting, just reporting.

And rockets, all by themselves, are still the prizewinners at inefficient.

I used to read a lot of sci-fi years ago, then stopped and have recently got
back into the habit again
pleasantly surprised at how much the market has grown.
I am currently reading Neuromancer which is more techno-dystopian than
extropian
but a fascinating book nonetheless (yes I know, as I said I've just got back
into it so
I'm a bit behind).
I was also pleasantly suprised at the proliferation of libertarian SF.
The classic libertarian SF is of course Atlas Shrugged (which I also much
prefer to the
Fountainhead).
I also highly recommend The Probability Broach by L. Neil Smith, a ripping
good yarn,
though it is almost wholly libertarian rather than extropian.
There are predictions of some extropian technologies in Greg Bear's Queen of
Angels which
is also very impressive in its treatment of the sentience of artificial
lifeforms though to my knowledge
Gre Bear isn't libertarian or extropian.
Another famous sci-fi writer, Gregory Benford, used to be on the editorial
board of Reason magazine.

Sorry if I offended anyone with my generalisations.
It was my first post and I didn't want to jump straight into the deep end
(as I am less
familiar with extropian lit than others here, my background being in
economics) so I
thought I'd start with something simple and work my way up
but I obviously should have picked a less contentious topic to open with .

I tried to write as impersonally and sensitively as possible, and I didn't
think that what
I merely tried to point out was anymore contentious than what we already
know from
Darwinian psychology.

BTW: I have read and enjoyed David Friedman's Machinery of Freedom
and Dawkins' Blind Watchmaker and am presently re-reading Tipler after
finding him
implausible the first time (perhaps more because of the language
he uses to try to appeal to theologians) and then reconsidering.

If you go to my web site at www.seraph.org and head through to the
'Contemporary Renaissance Futures' pages, you will find a bibliography, for
which many of the book suggestions came from this list.

Gender and sexual orientation, like nationality are demographic lower level
information.  A more extensive survey of those on this list would be
preferable if any attempt to poll was made at all.  This to include
preferences and attitudes toward a range of topics.  It's difficult to tell
what attitudes predominate because the most vocal among us likely distort
our perception of the group as a whole.  I suspect we are quite diverse, but
I also place little stock in suspicions and try to rely more on data when I
can.

As for the gender imbalance thread, I most appreciated Robin Hanson's point
regarding a lack of empathy for the plight of so many men.

I finally got around to seeing these pictures by Anders and thought they were
quite good.  They seem very much in the tradition of "classical" surrealism, a
genre well suited for expression of transhumanist ideas and values.  I
particularly liked "The Domino Effect" as the kind of accessible, didactic
imagery that can convey ideas in ways that language is less efficient at:
ostensive rhetoric, if you will.  Many of the other pictures (for instance,
"Blood Music" and "Kindergarten") rely on a visual vocabulary that should be
familiar to many science fiction fans, and therefore able to reach an audience
wider than the current transhumanist circles.

Very good, Anders!

Some personal notes on "recruitment":

Although I am a strong opponent of any kind of legally-mandated "affirmative
action" in any sphere of life, I am a strong supporter of what I call
"voluntary outreach" in my business and personal lives.  This means taking
active steps to open my business and my life to new people, especially ones
that are different from me.  Why?  Because it's good for me.  It seems to me
that any population of replicators (genetic or memetic) is healthier if it is
diverse: It is more robust in the face of change and more likely to generate
new and fruitful solutions to existing problems.  It's also more interesting,
which is a pleasure to me.

What does this mean in practice?  Well, in any sort of social setting, from a
formal business planning group to an impromptu conversational gathering (and
including the Extropians e-mail list), the first thing I try to do is assess
how similar or different the viewpoints of the participants are.  If those
viewpoints are too homogenous, I try to bring in new participants with
different viewpoints.  Of course, if the viewpoints are too heterogenous, then
things can be unproductive or too chaotic to be interesting.  But, given the
natural social conservatism of we monkey-humans, it's more often the case that
effort needs to be put into outreach, rather than exclusion.

That's my take on "diversity" a/k/a "recruitment". . .

Oh, I don't know. Apparently there are washing-up liquids available today
that can be soft on one's hands as well as hard on stuck-on grease. Could
anything be more radical? And yet, as a woman, it's devastatingly
attractive to me.

(I hope my sarcasm comes across in this medium.)

I was under the impression that the lower average core temperature for
women (or at least the fluctuation of said temp) was part of why women
lived longer.


As for the original topic, the sexiest part of the body is the brain, right?

Actually you gain a lot because you can use nozzles with an expansion
ratio optimized for vacuum, not surface pressure. This was one of the
smart elements of Kistler Aerospace's first pseudo-SSTO design; they
had a reusable rocket which just lifted the main vehicle to 80,000
feet and released it, which saved enough fuel from switching to vacuum
nozzles to greatly increase the payload capacity.

>right.  however, rotary blade flight is not particularly efficient.  

And the original Roton design didn't get much of its lift from the
rotors, as far as I remember. The engines were mounted on the ends
of the rotors and turned from horizontal to near vertical as it
ascended, so that not long after launch it was propelled largely
by rocket thrust. The main advantage was the simplicity of the
engine design and that you did get the extra lift from the rotors.

Wouldn't bet on it myself; and remember, if it does fly that message
will be on the web site for all eternity, or at least until the
Singularity ;-).

I have to say I'm somewhat surprised and puzzled by this kind of reaction
to what seems like a perfectly valid and justifiable statement; my 
experience has been very similar, in that most of the women I meet tend 
to be less attracted to radical ideas than most of the men.

I've just been going through my mailbox deleting a lot of old mail, which
included things like discussions of men generally being more violent than 
women and the links to testosterone levels, to which no male list member 
came back with any kind of sarcastic comments, and most agreed; it's a 
simple fact to be discussed as such. Why is this topic any different?
Surely if many women do have an aversion to radical ideas then it's
something we should be discussing, not ignoring?

I didn't mean "we" as in "every one of us", but in a more majoritarian
or average sense.  There may be people here who don't value women here. 
But I doubt they'll speak up and say so, so we probably won't know.

I'm willing to discuss this, but first let me plead for lots of 
tolerance in such discussions.  It is way too easy to interpret 
honest ideas and opinions as insults to a gender or some other subgroup.
(Sarah's sarcastic reply to Randy's suggestion of gender correlations 
in receptivity to radical ideas seems an example of this.)

Regarding nerds, I suspect a single term is used because there is in 
fact a strong correlation among various attributes.  And I suspect the 
term is used mostly for males both because those attributes aren't 
considered to be such negatives for females, and because men are more
likely to exibit those traits.  

I was once (and may still be) a nerd, and for me the essense of it is 
focusing on one's own feelings and ideas, relative to caring what other
people think.  I didn't care much how I looked, didn't care much about how 
others looked, and didn't much respect people who cared a lot.  The same 
went for sports, showing how strong or tough you are, showing dominance 
via insults and malicious gossip, getting along by agreeing with people, 
etc.  I got along fine with people who were like me, but others saw me as 
weak, easily dominated, unattractive, and socially ignorant.  They did
admit though that I was very capable regarding what I cared about: ideas.  

I've read, and my observations seem to confirm, that women are more 
inclined (either by genetics or socialization) to get along socially,
while men care more about being respected than being liked.  And women
seem to value strong socially dominant men more than men value these
traits in women.  Given these correlations, the "nerd" phenomena makes
sense to me.

Well, I don't understand half of what you're saying here, but I've heard
similar things before. I disagree; it's not the simple algorithmic process
that you make it out to be here, it seems to be analagous to methods of
neural network training which inject random data into the network and
then wait for it to settle (I forget the technical term). So it's not
surprising that we end up with lots of memories of dreams that may or
may not have happened.

That said, I've had plenty of experience of lucid dreaming and that does
tend to point towards dreams having some real existence.

Well, Mark, of course, you are perfectly correct (in my ever-humble
opinion). The fact is that when it comes to behavior in life, in
general, men are more like a lottery--they scatter ( in a mathematical
sense). They are gamblers at life. Women are closer to the mean in
almost all life behaviors--generally! <insert 4-page spiel on
evolution and childbearing, etc>.

And since the gov't and business depends on women in the workforce and
at the ballot box, it has become politcally correct to bash these
kinds of ideas.
And even extropian/cryo women, freethinking and radical and
unsheeplike as they are, are susceptible to societal attitudes.

 Such is life. Westen Civ swing like a pendulum do....

Umm, when I make a statement about "women," I do not refer to any one
woman or any group of women, but women in particular.

I've been searching around for molecular CAD tools
and have so far found only Crystal Sketchpad and
NanoCAD (and it's offspring). Crystal Sketchpad is
clearly the most advanced of the two, since
NanoCAD is very primitive in it's editing
facilities. Are there any other molecular CAD
packages (specifically geared toward
nanotechnology) available? Wasn't Autodesk
developing such software?

Hi, 

Check out www.mdli.com/download/ and get the Chime 2 beta 4 browser plugin,
then look at the examples through their page.  It's an amazing way of viewing
3d molecules, although I'm not sure how to make youer own, if you find out,
let me know please.

thanks

This was mentioned a few threads ago..


A interesting survey would be how Extropians/Transhumanist relate to their
work, their work environment, and what field they pursue.

I tend to get 'dug in' to a project and spend all hours going gangbusters
on something to get it to a certain stage. Working on a shockwave app right
now that has a few deadlines soon - but I like what I do! Getting 45
minutes of sleep isn't so horrible if it's inspiring.

Perhaps people have already conveyed this data.

I work in heavily technology, tons. Part of my job is creative, I have a
fine arts degree and freelance.

Thanks everyone for the comments! Reading my mailbox now when I have
got home feels almost like entering a room filled with congratulatory
bouquets :-)

Also, great thanks to Natasha of being a wonderful hostess!

I have been meaning to ask this for a long time....  Are there any Austin
Texas folks on the list?  And if so, is there any desire to get together.  I
am planning on attending (9/17) the "Next 20 Years" seminar put on by Last
Saturdays (http://www.lastsaturdays.com/).  It has a reception which might be
an interesting setting for meeting.

yup.  i came to a similar conclusion today.  the rotors wont help you muchgoing
up, but the idea of putting liquid motors out on the ends of rotors and
using centrifugal force for pressurizing the fuel i think has great merit for
those trying to launch stuff at a reasonable cost.  spike

Well, you still need to turn the vehicle in flight. And there's the
possibility of bad force coupling at some points in the flight profile due
to precession.
But yes, a spun-up Roton won't tend to topple.

Yep. In fact, there is a wild man in the Midwest experimenting with a
radically simple Roton-inspired design that (at least at first) is just
intended to throw hulls into orbit for use as raw material (and to get him
cred).

Small ones, something like a hundred kilograms at most.

And he *is* getting the hang of working with LOX (preparatory to building a
LOX/kerosene hi-rev Roton. Kind of looks like an open-combustor jet
turbine, with O2 assist for when the air gets thin.

He's also willing to accept a high catastrophic failure rate, at least at
first. No payload, no pilot...

after doing some calculations, i ask you to ignore my previous posts on
the subject of roton.  i repent!  i was a nattering nabob of negativity!
{8-[
now i will explain how i went wrong.  first, i was going by an earlier
concept of roton, that given in the final frontier magazine.  that article

presented the concept strictly as a single stage to orbit/reentry body,
which one
need not assume.  a roton concept can be used as a first stage, second
stage, or a throwaway non-reentry system.  after i convinced myself that
the rotors would be heavier than the cryopumps they would replace, i
tossed the whole thing aside.  (single stage to orbit has verrry little
margin
for unnecessary weight).

secondly, i failed to realize that the roton system not only obviates the
cryopumps, it also eliminates the need for thrust vector control.  i never

did see this stated anywhere, but a roton would be inherently stable due
to the gyroscopic rotor.  much weight is saved by using fixed nozzles.

thirdly, and this is the most embarrassing, i failed to even consider the
cost.  cryopumps are inherently expensive and tweaky.  and dangerous.
for being a classical thinking rocket scientist, who considers *only
performance*
ignoring cost and complication, well, i guess i am the poster child.  {8-]

even if the roton gives up some performance to conventional designs, it is
waaay
simpler and cheaper than the alternative.  i guess this is why amateur
groups never
deal with liquid rockets: cryopumps and thrust vector control cannot
really be done at a reasonable cost.  but a roton could be imagined which
has very few moving parts, and none with the kind of difficult
manufacturing
tolerances associated with high capacity cryogen pumps.

now, after all that apology, i would suggest those who would sell the
roton
concept should emphasize its real strengths.  it is sold as a possible
reentry
body: i still have serious doubts about that.  however, if a launcher is
simple
and cheap enough, why worry about getting it back?  sell it as a means of
lifting raw materials to orbit very cheaply, in the form of rotons.
perhaps a
manufacturing facility could be set up in orbit, and the raw materials
could

yes, that would be interesting, perhaps moreso than gender and preference:
how many pets do extropians own?

i make my living mining data in aerospace, looking for patterns that can help
us discover and fix problems before they result in TBCs  (truly bad
consequences.)  a for instance would be the ill fated shuttle mission.  had
the data miners discovered the link between increased solid rocket motor
burnthru and low temperatures, well, we would have 7 more astronauts
with us today.

so, i want to learn things about our group without causing anyone to
reveal anything about themselves.  i dont know if it is possible,  may not
be.  {8-[  but i also know there are some clever folks out there who
may know a trick.  how does one poll a group while simultaneously
protecting everyone's privacy and protecting the database from folks
like the lesbian extropian meme starter?  spike

Just wanted to post the URLs for the "original" Roton paper on the Web.

http://www.hmx.com/roton_paper.html and
http://www.hmx.com/roton_paper_fn.html

This paper asserts something like a 10:1 thrust contribution from the rotor
"while in the sensible atmosphere". I haven't seen any detailed profiles,
but I'd guess the rotor thrust contribution for this configuration does
start to poop out at something like 10 miles' altitude. Still, the first
miles _are_ where you have to burn most of your propellant--accelerating
the rest--and the fact that the vehicle *is* being accelerated does make it
potentially a bigger win than the old "rockoon" concept.

PS: it appears that Bevin McK., coiner of the "Roton" label, has agreed to
dilute the term "Roton" to include systems that don't use rotors for boost
phase. C'est la marketing. Long live the radical unRotonoids. :)

I'm looking for Bob Metcalfe's original statement of "Metcalfe's Law"
(value of the network is the square of the number of nodes). I believe he
stated it in a Computerworld column a few years ago.

Does anyone happen to have the exact reference?

Whilst there is no doubt a good deal of 'mileage', psychological,
sociological and anthropological, in an analysis of my reply, I should
perhaps minimize the concomitant 'list noise' of such a debate by saying at
this point that my post was intended merely to reflect the facts that
generalizations always have their exceptions, and description without an
expression of accompanying curiosity as to cause can entrench societal
norms. It is not within my purview to question the validity of your
statement, since it's a statement of your 'thought' and who am I to say
what you think? As to justifiability, at one level it is entirely
justifiable, since I'm more-or-less sure that you do think as claimed. Why
would you lie? At a deeper level, whilst that which you think may itself be
justifiable, it was the lack of justification which caused me to reply: and
since subsequent posts, including your own, have looked for such
justification through a more stringent analysis, I seemed to have achieved
my purpose.

Irony, as a method of addressing issues and consciousness-raising, seems to
be more predominant in the UK than in the US, and given the demographics of
this list's members, my choice of sarcasm as a communicative style may have
been misplaced. (And yes, yes, I'm aware that I'm the one making a
generalization in this case. So I follow my own argument and say unto thee,
"Ask thyself why irony doth not appeare more greatly in the US, and if it
be a thynge which the people of America should accept unto themselves, or
if those acrosse the wide ocean should seeke to reduce their reliance
upon't." Grin.)

I can't help but feel that such usage may enable a rather insidious form of
'meme propogation' and authoritarianism to take place: those who disagree
but do not wish to distinguish themselves are likely to be led towards a
belief that they alone hold their views, against society as a whole and, if
the 'we' is spoken by one in authority, against the leaders of the
established order. They may adopt beliefs simply to become one of the 'we',
rather than remain one of the 'them'. 'We' thus becomes prescriptive,
rather than merely descriptive.

However, I'm not sure this a point worthy of resolution through debate on
this list: it's merely an observation on my part. Besides, it does little,
if not nothing, to diminish Robin's arguments which are, as they always
are, enviably intelligent, well-informed and lucid.

I have to say that your writing style is incredibly hard to read; it seems 
to be designed to hide meaning behind voluminous use of long words.

Actually I'd say that making a joke to avoid dealing with an issue -- as
you seemed to be doing -- is a very typical American response; as though
if you can laugh at it, it's not real.

This issue is real, and I don't see what your comment was supposed to add
to the discussion. I would hope that most of us here are smart enough to
realise that few generalisations are ever accurate but are often used as
a short-hand for real truths.

I don't know if this cut it. They seem to be biased against the view that
it's not a big deal.

The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement:
http://www.vhemt.org/

GAIA LIBERATION FRONT
http://host.envirolink.org/coe/resources/glf/glf.html

They are both about that the human race should die out to save the earth.

They seem serious, but their claims are such, that for me it seems more like
black humor.

Curiously - or maybe on purpose - the best site has almost the same
address
as one of the sites that promulagtes the "usual" global-warming drivel.

Not to be confused with

The one thing I don't understand about the global warming problem is this:

I live in Denmark which is shaped by the Ice during the last ice age. (It's
very flat :-) ) Therefore im constantly reminded about it. The latest
research in ice-age patterns, done by drilling in the Greenlandic Perma ice,
shows that we are in a relative long and unusual period without an ice age.

As far as i remember it's been about 20.000 years since the last Ice age,
and before that there were ice ages about every 2000 years. The research
also showed that the weather pattern could change in as little as 25 years.
That is 25 years from "normal" weather to a new ice age.

It therefore seems logical that we will have another ice age again.
Furthermore it can be here in 25 years. Nobody knows.

If our "friend" nature can do this, and almost absolutely certainly. Why
then care that much about heating. Naturally we cannot just treat the
ecosphere as we please, but I find that it would be better to find some long
term solutions to the problem.

You know what I mean. "The human race is to important a species to keep all
of it's eggs in one basket" (Don't remember the exact quote but it should be
good enough)

(The global heating will probably solve itself as we run out of energy
resources ;-) )

At first glance they seem to be parodies - especially vhemt - but I got
the distinct impression that they are quite serious. The key for me was
the interview between the leader of the one organization & a
representative
of the other.

Neither group - er, sorry, movement - loves Our Mother the Earth quite
enough to quietly off themselves (this would seem to be the honorable
thing
to do given their belief set). No, no, they justify their continued
existence (and concommitant destruction of Our Mother the Earth) with 
their purpose of trying to get others to off themselves first (don't
worry, we'll be right behind you, no really we will).

OK. Not intentional. My writing style tends to depend on what I've been

I think this agrees with my point: Americans tend not to use irony as do
people in the UK. In the US it is seen as you describe it, a joke to avoid
the issue; in the UK, irony and satire have a strong history of being used
to emphasize the importance of issues, and to draw attention to them
without in any way detracting from their 'reality'.

I would hope that most of the people here are smarter than that, and
realise that generalizations are often used to mask the complexity of
issues and to gloss over the mutability of the underlying truths about
which they claim to speak authoritatively.

Curiously, though, I don't think you and I disagree about anything of
importance, do we?

> 	What if we looked at violence as a health problem??

An interesting post by Hara Ra. 

After visiting Arcosanti during my trip to the states I began to think
about the up- and downsides of modern cities.  I have noted that many
of the problems encountered in city life are to some degree avoidable,
if environments, systems and institutions are designed
properly. Soleri suggested "legislating by design", and I think he has
a point. Instead of coercing people to behave well, make the
environment such that they will behave well.

Vandalism is an example. People vandalize property more often if it
can be done anonymously and especially if it doesn't seem to belong to
anybody in particular - things that clearly belong to someone are less
often vandalized (this also holds for cleaning up common rooms; a kind
of tragedy of the commons). Vandalism is higher in entranceways and
semi-public places, but even a low wall (purely symbolic) can decrease
vandalism by making and entrance or building wall private.  Newman
proposed the idea of defensible space: create areas that are clearly
defined and seems to belong to the residents of the area (and not just
some impersonal force like "everyone", the remote landlord etc). Since
this is someone's territory, people are less likely to vandalize it
(both since they might get seen by a resident who might be more likely
to react and since it is someone else's territory - never
underestimate the old primate signals!). This seems to have been borne
out in experiments, where vandalism and crime decreased markedly in
areas where the buildings were designed with this in mind.

Newman 1972, Defensible Space, Macmillan, New York

Fowler, McCall and Mangione 1979, Reducing Residential Crime and Fear:
The Hartford Neighborhood Crime Prevention Program. Government
Printing Officem Washington DC

Wilson 1978, Vandalism and 'defensible space' on London housing
estatesm in R. Clarke, Tackling Vandalism. Home Office Research Study
No 47. HMSO, London

Another simple way of getting rid of grafitti is to avoid having
large, smooth grey concrete surfaces - put up a wooden pallisade or
plant trees or bushes in front, and suddenly there is less interest in
grafitti. This is a simple design solution, and works without much
extra costs (in fact, it has other obvious esthetic benefits).

So I don't see why you can't use similar design solutions against
other problems, including violence. Things are more tricky here of
course, especially since we are now talking about not just physical
environments but social environments and structures.

David Brin and his supporters are essentially proposing making almost
everywhere visible through the transparent society; this would
certainly limit many forms of criminality (although it may weaken the
sense of privacy that makes private and semi-private areas safer
too). The libertarian proposal of privatizing much or everything deals
with the other side of the visibility-privacy pair of defensible
space; this would clearly make it up to the owners to ensure their
properties were suitably marked and delineated. Of these, the later
seems to be somewhat tricky to implement politically and possibly
practically (let's ignore that debate, it is off a tangent), while
the former may or may not come to pass depending on IMHO rather
uncertain predictions of where gnatbots, privacy counter measures and
public policy might go.

But there are likely many other possibilities that can be
explored. 

What I saw at Arcosanti and read in Soleri's book about the project
suggests that a cleverly designed community can become very efficient
resource-wise and likely function well socially. However, Soleri's
large scale arcologies seem to me to be too large to be stable
socially, they seem to be too much undefensible space and diffused
responsibility. On the other hand, the more modest Arcosanti
mini-arcology seems to be just of the right size psychologically to
promote a sense of community and shared space, while getting
advantages of scale. Maybe one should work towards developing
Arcosanti-like structures to replace ailing parts of our cities? One
model already exists, the university campus.

There is a lot to be said for approaching violence and other social
problems as health or design problems instead of the usual approaches;
this way we can at least find some new solutions that have not got
bogged down in political trench warfare.

I think we need to have some warning sticker on the word "always",
like on the cigarette packages: "The General Semantics Surgeon warns:
careless use of the word "always" may lead to incorrect
generalisations and mental pitfalls. Use with caution, especially
among extropians" :-)

Is it possible to remove stereotypes and generalities among advancing
trans- and posthumans? Cognitively, we likely will need our category
prototypes, weakly founded generalisations and assumptions made on
insufficient information to work in the real world, so some will
likely remain unless we can all become Zen masters and just see the
world as it is all the time, but it seems quite possible to find ways
to reduce their semantic harm, for example by E-prime and similar
linguistic tools, some education in applied cognitive psychology and
ways of greacefully defuse them. Any ideas?

Hmm, what to read? A lot. Here are some authors which I think are well
worth reading from a transhumanist point of view (in no particular
order):

Greg Egan: esp. Axiomatic, Quarantine, Permutation City, Distress and
Diaspora (hard sf; some find him dry but his ideas are wonderfully
up-to date)

Linda Nagata: Tech Heaven, The Bohr Maker, Deception Well 

Bruce Sterling: Shismatrix (THE transhuman space opera)

Greg Bear: Blood Music (probably one of the few real Singularity
stories around), several other good novels (especially if you like BIG
things blowing up - like planets or stars :-)

Olaf Stapledon: First and Last Men, Starmaker (transhumanism from the
30's. Pessimistic but grand)

Vernor Vinge, True Names (short story), A Fire Upon the Deep (space opera)

David Zindell: Neverness and the "A Requiem for Homo Sapiens" trilogy
(The Broken God, the Wild, War in Heaven) (philosophical/mystical
transhumanist sf; likely not in everybody's taste)

Iain Banks: the Culture novels (shows glimpses of a fun transhuman
civilization, very imaginative stories and often somewhat cruel to the
protagonists)

If you really want some scary rationalize eschatological
thinking, try "The End of the World: The Science and Ethics
of Human Extinction". The book describes the Doomsday Argument
which basically states "we're a young species and odds are we're
going to off ourselves." Surprisingly, the argument grounds
itself in Bayesian reasoning and has been stubbornly immune to
attempts to invalidate its methodology, premise, or conclusion.

Unfortunately the topic seems hopelessly politicized.  The best I can do
is to offer some sites on both sides of the issue:

Is this the same Doomsday Argument which has been mentioned here before?
Basically that we'd expect on average to be born half-way through the
human race, so half of us must have been born by now?

In that case there are easy answers. Firstly if we dramatically increase
our lifespans and reduce our birth-rates, then we could be born half-way 
through the human race and still have billions of years to go. Secondly, if 
AI is hard and uploads are easy then most future life will originate from uploaded humans. In that case, even though the vast majority of life has
yet to be "born" (i.e. forked off from another upload) many of those SIs
will probably originate from people already alive; we'd only be half-way
through the *organic* human race because any SIs would have memories of
once being organics.

In fact I could take this argument to extremes and point out that since
I'm currently inhabiting this body I must be the person fated to become
the first SI and take over the universe (if you believe that is inevitable).

Here's another example of nearly similar addresses
that are *not* to be confused. Coincidence or
intention?

http://www.euthanasia.com/
(anti-euthanasia crap trying to pose as objective info)

vs
http://www.euthanasia.org
Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society, a much
better site with lots of useful info; more objective 
despite being "openly" pro-euthansia.

This is a great point, and may even be considered a 'problem' that we may
find a solution to sometime.. But what solution? It would seem that the
problem is the first person point of view.. the construction of a priori
knowledge being key and crucial to deduction and explanation - leads
straight to prejudice in the simple form. Even presupposition by
experience, calculation by observation, is limited by the expeirence
capacity of the observer.. the classic 'the house is white' vs. 'the house
is white ON THIS SIDE' statements.


A problem that the uploading crowd could undoubtedly solve, with shared
access to memories or perhaps the 'Common Experience Export Format' or .CEF
files. =)

I agree with your description of the process, but resist calling it 
"insidious."   When one individual makes a claim about "we", with the
rest of "we" listening, that offers a challenge to the rest of the group.
If other members disagree with this assessment, they should speak up and 
contest the claim.  If still others then support this rebuttal, the 
original claim will be suspect.  

Knowing all this, those who see that no one challenged the claim may then 
infer that either no one expected to be supported in challenging this claim,
or that some retribution would be given for disagreeing with the initial 
speaker.  If retribution seems unlikely, one might infer that no one disagreed
with the initial "we" claim.  

My claim that "we" treasure women was exactly such a call for challenges,
in the expectation that a lack of such would suggest to listeners that other
listeners agree with me.  I hope it is obvious that I would enact no 
retribution for disagreeing with me on this.

There is the more complex issue, however, of whether people expect some
sort of broader retribution against those who say they don't value
women in an open email list.

Anyone know where I can find work on quantum logic equations?
I assume a quantum computer would be governed by QLE but I am
wondering if such beasts exist and/or what work is being done
to develop them.

I know that an attempt in the 1970s was made to develop a trinary
logic system (1, 0, -1) to increase information density among
other things. However, developers could not devise facile trinary
logic equations.

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Heh.  Reading Brust's Dumas imitations for the first time had a quite notable
effect on my writing for a while.

Reading Sarah's post required a bit of a gearshift, but was fun, and the

Well, I'll speak up then and say that I wouldn't describe my attitude
towards women as "treasuring" them.  I've been married almost 20 years
and love my wife very much, but she is a highly exceptional woman.

Most of the people I have found interesting and intellectually stimulating
have been men rather than women.  That's just my personal taste, yours
may differ.

I do feel that having a variety of viewpoints in a discussion is
beneficial.  Since there are so few women involved in the areas I am
interested in, those few who do share those interests are unusually
valued simply because of their different perspective.  But this is not
a strong consideration, and I judge people more by how interesting and
challenging their views are rather than by their sex.

It's also true that a majority of the people who share my interests
seem to be like me in other ways than sex.  They tend to be white,
and from a similar European/American cultural background.  It's a pretty
homogeneous group.  Diversity is welcomed but ranks lower than provocative
ideas to me.

(I hope no one takes this to mean that I think women or people from other
cultures don't create good ideas.  My use of "provocative", "interesting"
and "challenging" represents an expression of my personal interests,
and others will have different tastes.)

I'm in Houston and interested in Extropian events.  When my wife
completes her flight attendant classes in six weeks the world will
become my neighbor because of a free international travel benefit to
spouses.  This is even more true for catching a 30 minute hop to
Austin.  I would however beg for transportation from the airport. 
Please keep me informed about any Extropian events worldwide.

One other note I'd like to make re: the word nerd. It seems
to have been taken over lately by the preferred term "geek".
Wired and other culture-type mags are legitimizing this
term as a "good thing", whereas nerd isn't as nice to call
oneself imho.

If this were right, it would in itself be an interesting result. It 
would seem to refute the idea that in the future there will be a 
great many intelligent beings.

But there is a version of the doomsday argument that bites on this 
possibility too. Rather than counting the number of observers, you 
should (arguably) count the number of "observer-moments" - i.e. time-
segments of observers. In that case you get little respite from 
assuming that birth rates will drop drastically.

Yes, it is probably the most important thing that has happened in 
philosophy for a long time, and it's immensly relevant to 
transhumanism. Every self-respecting transhumanist ought to have an 
opinion on the doomsday argument.

My current research is on this topic and on related applications of 
the anthropic principle to cosmology, the interpretation of quantum 
mechanics and the evolution of life.

Some papers are available on my home page: 
http://www.hedweb.com/nickb. Right now I'm working over a survey 
that will summarize the relevant literature.

Robin Hanson said he used to be a nerd and then changed. I noticed on his
web site that he is an ENTP. I think that the stereotypical nerd
personality is the INTP (being both myself). Could his loss of nerdity
be due to the shift from E to I?:-)

Max Rasmussen has it right, for those with the long view, ice ages are a
serious threat to civilization.  The cycles are poorly understood from a
theoretical point of view [lots of theories, theorists sometimes in error,
never in doubt], and well documented experimentally.  

The real issue is not that the average temperature may be increasing, it may,
but it may have little to do with fossil fuel burning or other gases.  The
possibility that such atmospheric additions may be delaying the next ice age
should be considered.   I attach a rant from the latest issue of my zine
'Another Premature Expostulation' issue 4.1.
-Jay


Is global warming trendy pseudo science with a statist control eco- agenda?
Or is it a climatological fluctuation or man made effect  saving us by
delaying the next  ice age?  The basic physics, of increased carbon dioxide
(CO2) and increased temperature is well known.  The historical data for the
last few hundred thousand years seems to show this.  But it is not clear, does
warming cause increased CO2, or does increased CO2 cause warming?   In either
case, the CO2 levels go up and down naturally, thousands of years before
humans burned hydrocarbon fuel. Even more interesting are the cyclical
patterns of cooling and warming every few 10,000 years or so.  There are
several frequencies of cycles in both the CO2 and temperature data.  The cause
of these  big cycles and  little cycles is still unknown. Numerous theories
have linked some fluctuations to earth's orbit,  or continental drift,  but
subtle links to solar activity cycles has recently come forward.  I am
currently placing my bets on a slightly brighter sun, as a major factor in the
current warming.   Some models use a complex feedback between glaciation,
rocks being ground into rock dust, and plant growth to explain CO2
fluctuations.  There  are tiny climate  fluctuations and patterns perhaps best
explained with fractal mathematics or chaos theory as applied to dynamical
systems. Rather than get whipped up into climatic speculation, let us look at
the data.  Any prediction of future warming must be seen as a further blip
continuing on the graphs we have from paleo-meteorology.  Lots of hard work
has been done figuring  out  the temperature  history of the earth.  Numerous
ice cores, ocean sediment cores, chemical analyses later, scientists have
charted the temperature over the past  thousands even million years.  Dates
and temperatures are correlated through historical records, tree rings, pollen
counts, and isotope ratios of  oxygen in ice.  The real data are usually not
shown in the newspapers, so the average citizen has no context to decide if a
2 degree
 next 100 years is significant.  The media at the
behest of government environmental scare mongers has no interest in displaying
the facts.  The facts are that the global climate fluctuates all of the time.
Who is to say that the current climate is optimum?  Examination of the data
indicates it is certainly not stable.  A global warming investigator
130,000 years ago, looking at the data, would come to the conclusion that the
CO2 is increasing, and the climate is warming.   Oh NO Grok, we had better
stop burning those camp fires !   Why do we assume stability, when the data
do not support  our fond hopes.    
Global warming proponents claim the earth will be warmer in the next century
than ever before.  Wrong,  130,000 years ago, the earth was  much warmer than
today.  Carbon dioxide was also higher.  You can check the data for your
selves.  The Vostok ice core data ia available on the web.  Point your browser
to http://ingrid.ldgo.columbia.edu.  Go to their search engin, type Vostok,
and follow the links.   More recently,  there was a warmer period called the
medieval optimum.  In the history this coincided with the age of the Vikings.
>From the year 900 to 1200 the climate in the northern hemisphere was warmer
than today..  Oats and barley were regularly grown in Iceland.  There were
wine vineyards in England.  Canadian forests were tens of kilometers north of
present lines and the Vikings inhabited Greenland.  All totalled, climate
estimates are 1.8 to  3.6F warmer than today.  This warm spell did not last,
by the 14th century, the Vikings abandoned their northern settlements, and the
English vineyards declined.   There was a mini-ice age after 1450AD to about
1650, where glaciers in Europe advanced, springs were delayed sufficiently to
cause crop failures.   Canals in Holland, normally ice free, were frozen over
along with the Thames.  This is associated with a sunspot minimum, known as
the Maunder minimum, where solar activity was quite low.  The current inter-
glacial period is quite warm.  This is good.  If we slide back into an ice
age (as scientists were predicting in the 1950 and 1960s), a 200 foot thick
sheet of ice grinding over our houses and farms would be really a drag.  I
have also hear  the argument that the  , yes there are climate fluctuations,
but humanity is changing things faster than previous cycles.  Wrong, the
warming after the Younger Dryas cooling 11,500 years ago was rapid.  An
estimated 7C rise in nearly 50 years.    No  man-made CO2emissions to blame
there.  
Current international pressure, UN stuff, with Al Gore (acts like Gort sounds
like Gort) cheerfully making impassioned pleas for governmental controls on
green house emissions. Gore is quoted as saying that the threat of global
warming is the greatest  threat the country faces. Really, more than poverty,
more than declining wages for the workers, more than an uneducated population?
But when Gore heard that Dr. Fred Singer was going to be on Larry King, he
cancelled his appearance, saying he could not come under those circumstances.
Dr. Singer, Professor of Atmospheric physics, member of the Geophysical Union,
former official at NASA and the EPA, challenges the government global warming
proponents to a debate on the scientific evidence  for the hypothetical
warming. No global warming advocates are forthcoming to debate the validity of
the evidence.   The Kyoto conference was a sham, treating the global
warming/CO2 link as a given.  No debate, just reductions of 7% below the 1990
emission levels for the US.  Based on what?  All  this is  policy  based upon
software models, complex computer simulations, where the outcomes involve
major economic impacts.   The state of current climate models is rather crude,
as can be seen in the accuracy of rudimentary weather prediction.  The warming
partisans cannot predict the weather accurately two days or weeks ahead, but
blithely assert predictions based on simulations 20 and 200 years ahead.   The
warming propagandists and government  activists frequently fail to mention the
green house gas  with the largest  impact .  What is it?  Water vapor !  Many
uncertainties exist in the models, such as the many feed back processes,
involving the oceans,  or the way to model clouds.  One of the big feed back
mechanisms is the reflection  of solar energy (heat) by clouds back into
space.  When the earth heats up, more clouds form, reflecting more energy back
into space,  causing a cooling effect.  Clouds are subtle, their fractal
variety is still beyond a computer simulations plugging s

reflectivity coefficient or formula into the computer code.  There are
problems with the models prediction of regional  warming.  One recent model
that predicted an average warming due  to CO2 emissions, showed areas as big
as western Canada warming, when actually a cooling was observed.  Antarctica
is getting cooler.  One model predicts this , many others do not  describe
this empirical finding.  
 
And much recent data, empirical temperature measurements,  shows a cooling.
The earth may show a small warming at the surface, but satellite measurements
show the atmosphere cooling slightly.   While some may say, these issues are
complex, so we defer to the preponderance of scientific opinion on global
warming.  But the consensus of scientists is not nearly so monolithic as the
main stream press would have us believe.  Dr. Singer has a statement opposing
the global warming hysteria, signed by  over 100 PhDs, top  professors of
meterology (U of I , MIT U of Arizona...), weather service directors etc.
Check the URL  www.his.com/~sepp  . The decision is too important to leave to
speculation.  The  computer models are not that accurate !    On shaky grounds
for science, and possessing powerful rhetoric, why does the
enviroestablishment want a reduction of economic activity?  Their vision is
that of zero population growth, less industry, returning to a totally
unrealistic idyllic rural ecotopia.  Instead of viewing more people as a
valuable resource, they view more people as a burden.  This is the misrabilist
view point.  The more people we have, the more ideas, the more crafty
inventiveness, and  problem solving we also have.  Implicit in this is the
rate of solving problems is greater than the rate of creating problems.  This
assumes that people are educated and skillful in technical methods. 
Or the misguided policy might be a plan to stabilize the gap between wealthy
Americans or countries and the poorer citizens or developing countries.  The
earths rotation is slowing down also.  Do we expect a massive government
effort to speed up the rotation?  The bureaucrats want to create an atmosphere
where the government will solve all of our problems.  It is the old
centralized control model,  which proved too slow for the communist
bureaucracies to prepare for the 21st century. For the centralized
bureaucrats, a global warming control agenda is a wonderful exercise in self
perpetuation. 
William Calvin, in his wonderful book, The Ascent of Mind, (source for some of
the temperature graphs in this expostulation)  has made an excellent case that
the warming and cooling associated with the ice age cycle has been a major
influence for the increase of human intelligence and evolution.  Will the
current temperature changes spur further gain in intelligence?  Or, will the
natural changes,  be a used as a weapon for the benighted forces of stupidity
and regression?    Instead, the world should realize that the earth is a
fragile spaceship.  We should be preparing a life boat.  Humanity needs to
exercise  the ultimate  manifest destiny, and look towards space migration. Or
perhaps we should spend  billions on  a climate control system.  Some have
proposed large attenuators, placed in space , adjusted to damp out
fluctuations in the suns  output.   Only great geniuses like Freeman Dyson
think on such grand  terms!

"...As far as i remember it's been about 20.000 years since the last Ice age,

and before that there were ice ages about every 2000 years. The research

also showed that the weather pattern could change in as little as 25 years.

That is 25 years from "normal" weather to a new ice age.

It therefore seems logical that we will have another ice age again.

Furthermore it can be here in 25 years. Nobody knows.

If our "friend" nature can do this, and almost absolutely certainly. Why

then care that much about heating. Naturally we cannot just treat the

ecosphere as we please, but I find that it would be better to find some long

term solutions to the problem.

You know what I mean. "The human race is to important a species to keep all

of it's eggs in one basket" (Don't remember the exact quote but it should be

good enough)

(The global heating will probably solve itself as we run out of energy

resources ;-) )..."

I don't know anything about glf, but from what I remember vhemt doesn't
advocate suicide, their theory being that if everyone stops having kids we
will become extinct.  Of course, what they don't realize is that we
extropians plan on living forever.  The Church of Euthanasia on the other
hand says that people should kill themselves whenever they feel like it.
Neither of these groups appear to be in any danger of acquiring very many
members.

Sony's camera a little too candid 
By Reuters
Special to CNET NEWS.COM 
August 12, 1998, 3:05 p.m. PT 
URL: http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,25226,00.html 

TOKYO--Electronics giant Sony said Wednesday it had halted shipments of
some video cameras after finding they could be used for filming more of
their subjects than meets the eye.

Some versions of the Handycam have infrared technology that lets users
shoot at night or in darkness in a "night shot" mode.

But magazine reports revealed that when the special feature is used in
daylight or a lighted room with a special filter it can "see through"
clothing. Underwear can show up, especially on those lightly dressed, and
people wearing swimsuits look almost naked.

A Sony spokesman said the first the company knew of the camera's surprise
feature was when reporters started asking for comments on the "new way" of
using the camera. Sony technicians then experimented and confirmed that the
technology had the unintended capability.

"When we developed this feature for the Handycam, we were thinking of
people filming night views--their children sleeping, or perhaps the
nocturnal behavior of animals," the spokesman said.

Concerned at the possibility of less innocent users taking advantage of the
technology, Sony has modified the camera so the "night shot" mode only
works in the dark.

Shipment of the new versions have already begun, replacing the original
ones, which hit the market in March and had sold around 180,000 units in
the domestic market by the end of July, the spokesman said.

It sold 870,000 of the original cameras worldwide by the end of June,
including 400,000 in North America and 290,000 in Europe. The spokesman
said it is now shipping the modified version overseas.

He denied local media reports that it had asked stores to remove the
original versions from their shelves. The company declined to confirm
retail prices, but media reports said the cameras range from $684 to $1,368
in Japan.

Your claim and Saul's are compatible.  Together they imply almost 
universal disbelief that nanotech will do what its proponents claim.
I am fascinated this sort of disagreement phenomena.  Why are 
proponents so confident in the face of strong skepticism, and why are
skeptics so confident in the face of strong minority disagreement?
How does each side explain the other side's behavior, and how does
each side think the other side explains it?

I must admit that I read the post as humorous. I was somewhat surprised by

I'm not clear that it does (there are different views on that). But 
consider the following thought experiment. Suppose that for one year, 
every morning you will suffer for amnesia for 10 minutes. Now suppose 
you find yourself in that situation: it's morning and you suffer from 
amnesia. You are asked to guess what day it is. You say you have no 
clue. You are then required to bet on whether it's Monday, and also 
on whether it's Tuesday, and wether it's Wednesday etc. Seven 
different bets. If I were you I would assign a probability of 1/7 to 
each of these hypotheses.

Then you are asked to bet on whether it's *not* Sunday. It follows 
you should assign a 6/7 chance to that.

But why? Well, it seems that what you are doing is saying to 
yourself: "There are these two intervals, Sunday and not-Sunday. But 
not-Sunday is six times as long as Sunday, so that should be six 
times as probable."

Once you have started to assign probabilities to time segments like 
this, it is easy to see how to generalize it to the context of the 
DA.

(Thanks for asking the question. I'm actually a little clearer about 
this after having to think out this answer.)

That does not follow. Most old people that will ever have existed 
might be people who will not be born for many millenia yet. This does 
not preclude that today's humans could live for billions of years.

I see what you mean but I don't think it helps.

And under these assumptions you should also be more likely to inhabit 
a later stage of the body of the person who will transcend. Given 
that you inhabit an early body-segment, you are no more likely than 
anybody else to become the Superbeing. (And this might even be
evidence against the hypothesis that there will be such a 
Superbeing.)

According to the doomsdayer, you are a sample not from a current 
snapshot of the human race, but rather from the set of all humans (or 
observers) that will ever have existed (setting to one side John 
Leslie's view on the relevance of indeterminism). It seems wrong to 
assume that the the sampling picture works only spatially but not 
temporally. Ignorance about you spatial position is on a par with 
ignorance about your temporal position. (Recall Leslie's analogy 
about the emeralds.)

That would be the wrong analogy. Since you are supposed to be a 
random sample from all observers that will ever have existed, we have 
to pick the ball from an urn containing all balls that it will ever 
contain in order to mirror the real situation truthfully

No, it rather seems to be similar to the objections he replies to on

It is true that cavemen would have been misled if they had applied 
the doomsday argument. As with every probabilistic argument, it 
doesn't guarantee that you get the right answer; if you are 
unlucky and happen to be placed in an unusual situation, then you 
your guess will be wrong.

But try this: Imagine that everybody that will ever have lived 
applies the doomsday argument and make guesses accordingly. Compare 
what fraction will turn out to have been right in this case with what 
happens if they reject the doomsday argument. You'll find that 
reasoning in accordance with the doomsday argument maximizes the 
fraction that will be right.

Why? If being a postbio intel is all you conditionalize on, this 
doesn't follow. If I knew nothing except that I was a postbio intel, 
I wouldn't expect to be one of the very first; I would expect to be 
one of the middle 95%.

If postbio and bio intelligences all belong to the same reference 
class (just as tall people and short people, black and white etc.) 
then the fact that you find yourself being a bio intel. would 
indicate that the postbios don't vastly outnumber the bios.

Whether postbios and bios should be in the same reference class is 
not clear. That's a deep problem, and I suspect but am not yet 
certain that there might be some kind of loophole for the 
transhumanist here, if the postbios are fundamentally different from 
bios.

I don't see why that should be the case. Of course, the exact 
conclusion depends on how you estimate future population figures 
etc., but in general I see the DA as, so to speak, *superimposed* on 
whatever other evidence you might have.

That depends on what this info would show. It's easiest to explain 
what I mean if there are only two possibilities: Doom Early, or Doom 
Late. If your prior evidence led you to be extremely certain that 
there was no way that doom could happen soon (no meteories, no germ 
warefare, no black goo, no vacuum decay etc.), then after taking the 
DA into account you might still be fairly certain that Doom Early 
would not happen. (Exactly how certain would depend on how many 
observers Doom Late says there will have been.)

However,  it doesn't matter how much information you have based your 
empirical prior on. If you have too little information, that should 
be reflected in your priors by setting them closer to fifty-fifty. 
That situation, as far as the doomsday argument is concerned, is 
identical to if you have fifty-fifty priors that are based on a lot 
of information.

It seems to have something to do with the implications of
a technology. The more dramatic the implications of a
technology are, the more heated (and irrational) skeptics
can be. Cryonics (the death of death) and MNT (material
engineering with far-reaching implications for society)
would have dramatic consequences. Where does this fear of
dramatic change come from? I'm not sure, maybe an
anthropologist or psychologist can explain it.

Usually, extremely polarized disagreements among rational
people arise from significant differences in their fundamental
assumptions or the focus of their assumptions. I'm guessing
that cryo-skepticism arises from the "alien" nature of the
implications of successful cryonics. I was discussing the
potentials of nanotechnology with someone recently and they
could not believe that cell repair technology could reverse
aging. It was not because they thought MNT was not possible,
but instead because they did not think aging was reversible.
Their view arose from their ignorance of the aging process.
Once I described the aging process to them they realized it
was a process that could, in theory, be reversed. I've found
lack information to be the biggest foe to enabling people to
accept many of the things we discuss on this list.

Nanotech skeptics are an interesting lot. Generally, most of
the loudest skeptics are scientists. Yet, their "nano-skepticism"
is very unscientific. Recently, I interviewed the superstring
theorist Michio Kaku, whose recent book "Visions" was very unfair
to nanotechnology. When I pressed him for the reasons why he
objected to the feasibility of MNT and he actually said
something along the lines of "I just don't believe you can get
instructions to molecular assemblers." It was readily apparent
to me that he simply did not think it was possible but had no
real scientific objections to support his view. For that matter,
no one, to my knowledge, has offered a significant theoretical
objection to MNT. I know there are some significant issues
concerning energy and heat but these are engineering problems.
The case Drexler lays out for MNT in "Nanosystems" has yet to
be attacked effectively. Yet nano-skeptics persist.

Generally, these type of disagreements aren't settled until
undeniable proof exists and one side can't discount the new
evidence or observations. Scientific history is riddled with
such situations. Until someone is actually revived you'll have
cryo-skeptics. Until a fully functional MA is built you'll have
nano-skeptics.

Just popped in to look at this group today, and I'm surprised to find there was a lively discussion on the Roton thread.

I asked Bob Truax about the Roton (motor) concept about a year ago, and he said "Oh, Goddard tried that.  It blew up.".

Bob ran the (successful) project that developed the JATO rockets for PBY aircraft around 1940.  Goddard was also funded to do the same thing in parallel, at the same location.  Goddard built a number of things that failed (explosively), including a LOX-gasoline motor that spun on its axis, with a centrifugal pump integrated into the injector end.  Neat idea.  Oh, well.  Truax's team made hypergolic propellant pressure-fed motors and also jet-vane powered pump motors, and succeeded where Goddard never did.

If you can stand to listen to me hold forth on rockets, you may find this interesting.

I am repeating Truax's ideas here because nobody else in the world has his long perspective on rockets.  First, just to make sure you know where this is coming from, a partial resume for Truax (from memory:  He ran the first government sponsored rocket research project in the country.  He invented regenerative cooling (example: Space Shuttle Main Engine), started the precursor to the AIAA with Von Braun and worked with him on the V2s brought over from Germany after the war, worked on winged rocket powered missiles, invented the submarine launched ballistic missile, ran the Polaris missile project, worked on the nuclear rocket projects (NERVA, I believe), first head of the Air Force space program, ran the first project actually intended to figure out how to orbit payload cheaply (Aerojet General corp, 1963 or so: The Sea Dragon study), developed a large 100-knot surface effect ship for the Navy, and retired.  Then started the "Volksrocket" project in the early 80's (to put one !
pers
on up to 100KM and pay for it with the television rights), later, with new investors, "Project Private Enterprise", and after the Navy bought the project, SEALAR (SEA Launch And Recovery).  A number of small research contracts since then.

So.  To paraphrase: He says that getting into orbit is not a technological problem.  The technology was solved decades ago.  To get into orbit cheaply, you need to build your rockets Big and Dumb.  This is called the Big Dumb Booster concept, the result of the 1963 Aerojet General study.  It has never been tried.  The principles are:

Make it ultimately simple (pressure fed, two-stage, single engine per stage), make it reusable, never make it *too* reliable, and build it *big* (100,000-1 million pounds to LEO).  Historical analysis of rocket projects shows that development and operational cost scales rapidly with complexity, and very slowly with size.  Payload scales up rapidly with size, but not with complexity.  I won't go into more details unless there is interest in it.

(My thoughts, not Bob's:)
Relevant to the current discussion, startup rocket projects constantly repeat the same old mistakes.  Someone wrote a book about it.  The general pattern is this.  First, to get funding, they convince investors and the public that the solution is a new technology.  Then, they spend the money, get part way through developing a nifty idea, go belly up.  Almost any idea can be made to work, and as for the Roton concept, this project is a classic.  Several nifty new ideas in one project.  Of course it can be made to work, with enough money.  That is not the question.  The question is, can it be made to work before the money runs out?

By the way: if you want me to actively engage in a conversation, please email me so I know to pay attention.

You lost me here. I followed that particular Cryonet thread and got the
impression that Saul's major point was that the cryonics "industry" has made
such little progress that it is no wonder that consumers are not persuaded
to sign-up.  There's no proven product since no one's been revived yet.
Achieving this end is clearly the focus of 21CM and he would naturally frame
the problem in this manner.  Saul seemed tentative about implying that those
suspended with the current technology would have *no* chance at being
revived by future technologies.  Rather, he believes that improved
suspension technology will greatly improve our chances and will have the
added benefit of promoting consumer acceptance (hope that's an accurate
paraphrase, Saul).

As a member of the minority, I can't say I have a very convincing argument
because I'm not a nanotechnologist.  But it seems to me that (1) a lot of
people are pretty excited about the potential of nanotech for a variety of
applications so the field should continue to rapidly develop, (2) the
argument for cellular repair at the molecular level is a coherent one, and
(3) hundreds of bodies lying in various forms of biostasis 50 to 100 years
from now would, I imagine, represent an exciting challenge that many
nanoscientists will find irresistable.  I may be mistaken, but I recall that
you have used the figure of around 5% as your estimate for the probability
that cryonics will work.  As a proponent, *you* don't seem that confident.
That's a little disheartening to hear from a cryonicist.   Within what time
frame does your estimate apply? 100 years? 200 years? 500 years? Or do you
see some other future event (e.g. SI) making the arument moot?


Best regards,

Scott Badger

Conversely, the more irrational the proponents, the 
more dramatic the implications they will see.  So dramatic
claims need not be a strong clue as to who is wrong.

But do they see your lack of information as the reason you fail
to see why you're wrong?  And if so, shouldn't you admit maybe
they know something you don't?  It's just plain irrational to 
agree to disagree because you each know something the other 
doesn't.

This sounds very "scientific," as practiced in academia.
For something that seems weird, academics presume it's bunk 
until evidence is presented in its favor, rather than presuming
it's right until skeptics give evidence that it's wrong.

The big question is: why hasn't he been able to convince investors to fund
his approach?  What are their reasons for skepticism?

I wasn't trying to summarize that Cryonet thread (which I haven't read).
I was addressing the article I read and Hara's claim above.

My estimate integrates over all those times.  It's the probability that I
will ever be revived if frozen today.  And it was ">5%".

Why are you doing this? Now you're attacking me again by lying about my
name. What is your agenda? I have the feeling that you're here simply to
disrupt this list. Certainly there's a large and growing amount of evidence
for this hypothesis.

Just in case anyone doesn't know, "Max More" *is* my real name, and boogie
woogie is simply lying. I was born with another surname, but changed it
legally eight years ago and have used only my current name since then. I am
known by no other name, and I never hide my identity behind pseudonyms.
Nothing unreal about it.

Boogie woogie, I suggest you retract this comment.

Interesting point. Personally, I think that the Singularity (=SI) is
probably the most significant threat to those in suspension. Otherwise,
I don't see why sooner or later nanotech wouldn't be sophisticated
enough to perform the repairs, and AIs be smart enough to reconstruct
the original personality with near-perfect accuracy from even a badly
suspended brain (by running a reverse simulation of the damage,
retracing every atom and molecule to its original position). Both
technologies can draw from and improve upon the designs found in nature,
if nothing else. Other issues like keeping the cryonics companies in
business, adjustment to future society, costs of revival etc. are
(almost) insignificant compared to the Singularity problem. 

Nevetheless, this *doesn't* mean one shouldn't get a cryo-contract.
Maybe revival will be possible *before* the Singularity, or maybe the
technocalypse will turn out to be a benevolent one. In any case, it's
better to be safe than sorry, which in this case means freezing the
bodies of the deceased. In the worst case you've just bought some peace
of mind. So, IMO there's *no* rational argument against cryonics, not
even in its crudest form (straight freezing).

Quite a harmonious composition. 
But permit me to remark that I hear a few jarring motifs wafting in the
background. 

(po1) Hives are win-win, too, as long as you're a haploid organism--or a
short lifer drone.
(po2) Will the Company issue "Notices to quit" (evictions and the like)
with every Pink Slip?
(po3) If not, why? Consider the disharmony raised by ex-employees underfoot.
(po4) A grudge holder with poor impulse control will someday see this as a
dream-come-true target.

Lots of people have blown rockets up. 

Minor points: weren't the fielded systems simple solid boosters? And I seem
to recall that the hypergolics were (/are) generally pretty wicked both to
handle and to deal with if you got any on you (RFNA, UDMH, N04...).

<much snippage of Bob Truax's credentials demonstrating why he's a tall
figure>

>So.  To paraphrase: He says that getting into orbit is not a technological
problem.  The technology was solved decades ago.  To get into orbit
cheaply, you need to build your rockets Big and Dumb.  This is called the
Big Dumb Booster concept, the result of the 1963 Aerojet General study.  It
has never been tried.  The principles are:

<snip again>

Yep, too big, too dumb. My outsider's view is that it's not sexy or leading
edge and you have to "think Russian" (these are of course cognate). Plus
the PR (/perceived environmental) impact of a *BIG* boom can be daunting,
and booms will inevitably happen if you take this approach. This is hard to
handle for the nation that only *used* to blow rockets up... well... sort
of. Also, <sarcasm on> whaddawe want a big booster for? Nobody *DOES*
anything in space that size. <sarcasm off> 

So of course they never will. People go for the grapes that they think are
nearest. And you know the old expensive payload-zero defects-cost overruns
cycle still puts engineers' kids through college, so why should they beef?

Nope, getting into orbit is not a technological problem. It is a problem of
will (and a failure of nerve, in Clarke's sense). But if/when a sufficient
base of arbitrary technology exists, something like a space gadabout just
might become as much of a terror as the old horseless carriage. "Bring it
on!" :) 

And space gadabouts are not supertankers. But they both serve human purpose. 

<Mr. Witham continues:>

>(My thoughts, not Bob's:)
>Relevant to the current discussion, startup rocket projects constantly
repeat the same old mistakes.  Someone wrote a book about it.  The general
pattern is this.  First, to get funding, they convince investors and the
public that the solution is a new technology.  Then, they spend the money,
get part way through developing a nifty idea, go belly up.  Almost any idea
can be made to work, and as for the Roton concept, this project is a
classic.  Several nifty new ideas in one project.  Of course it can be made
to work, with enough money.  That is not the question.  The question is,
can it be made to work before the money runs out?

<I reply:>

Having lived and too often breathed Silicon Valley, permit me to remark
that this is a salient feature of much of life here. 

Rub the serial numbers off and it's happening in Hollywood too, though with
variations (not every movie solution is a new technology, but every movie
asks your final question during its production).

        Max: it is pretty much futile trying to rationalize with imbeciles
like this.  The world is certainly full of the same type --people who lack
foresight and the ability to examine the reasons for their actions.  What
makes it frustrating is when they try to permeate a list such as this with
their atittudes bloated by a faux-superiority complex, thinking they know
ever so much more than those around them.  Fortunately, they eventually
realize --much to late-- that the superiority that they held so dear was in
fact faux, and they find themselves pinned underneath the weight of a
reality which they could never quite escape.

        Colin: if there is any shred of tact or decency within your
burdened mind, you will wisely listen to what is said by those who have
more experience than yourself...even if you disagree.  An apology to Max
*is* in order...be it on the list or not.  If you *do* have any tact or
decency, you will understand the necessity of this simple act, but if, as I
suspect, you don't, you will doubtlessly amble on towards the chosen fate I
mentioned above.

yup.  looks like there are three showstoppers for well funded amateur groups.1.
regardless of how big and how dumb a liquid rocket is, one still mustpump a high
volume of cryogenic liquids to combustion chamber pressure .

2.  generally rockets have a high l/d problem: they are tall and skinny, in order
to
reduce atmospheric drag.  so, there is a great deal of science in the structural
dynamics of the system.  this was a major problem in the early days of
rocketry.

3.  guidance and control:  this is a very complicated problem generally,  requires

a sophisticated feedback mechanism with thrust vector control by means of a
steerable nozzle for instance.

there are a lot of different concepts all going under the name roton, some
workable,
others not.  i have only recently come to appreciate this.  the beauty of the
simplest
roton system is that it solves all three of the above, sort of.  centrifugal force
pumps
the cryogens.  you need not have high l/d, since you can give away some
performance.
the inherent stability spinning about an axis with high moment of inertia obviates

a flight computer.  there are still some difficult problems, such as how to turn
the
vehicle, but i have some ideas.  a roton could be conceive which has very few
moving parts.

like apple computer, the roton concept is not really being sold right, in my
opinion.
when the rotoners say that it might raise payload at 1/5 the cost of conventional
rockets, they should perhaps make it clear that what is meant is a system that
raises payload at 1/10 the performance at 1/50 the price...  either way, the roton

is within the reach of sophisticated amateurs and underfunded entrepreneurs.

I didn't mean to imply that you were a shill. Size, voraciousness &
arrogance do tend to go together; those and the incapacity for FDIC to
actually bail out any one of the remaining players (if that's not precisely
true, it looks like it's headed that way RRSN) all point out the likelihood
of your scenario. And it sounds like feudal types will indeed flock. I just
wanted the other motifs that I noticed to be clearly pointed out. 

It's going to be an interesting future, and there likely will be future
Medicis or Templars to be dealt with--but count your fingers after you
shake hands. And map your exits as you enter. This includes having more
than one fiscal basket. :)

Title
  Progress on therapy of
  breast cancer with vitamin Q10 and the
  regression of metastases.
Source
  Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications.  212(1):172-7, 1995 Jul 6.
Abstract
  Over 35 years, data and knowledge have internationally evolved from
  biochemical, biomedical and clinical research on vitamin Q10 (coenzyme Q10;
  CoQ10) and cancer, which led in 1993 to overt complete
  regression of the tumors in two cases of breast
  cancer. Continuing this research, three additional
  breast cancer patients also underwent a
  conventional protocol of therapy which included a daily oral
  dosage of 390 mg of vitamin Q10 (Bio-Quinone of Pharma Nord) during the
  complete trials over 3-5 years. The numerous metastases in the liver of a
  44-year-old patient "disappeared," and no signs of metastases were found
  elsewhere. A 49-year-old patient, on a dosage of 390 mg of vitamin Q10,
  revealed no signs of tumor in the pleural cavity after six months, and her
  condition was excellent. A 75-year-old patient with carcinoma in one
  breast, after lumpectomy and 390 mg of CoQ10, showed no
  cancer in the tumor bed or metastases. Control blood levels
  of CoQ10 of 0.83-0.97 and of 0.62 micrograms/ml increased to 3.34-3.64 and to
  3.77 micrograms/ml, respectively, on therapy with CoQ10 for
  patients A-MRH and EEL.

I have dined on fresh corvid, and believe I must report my error:

I dumbly forgot (and was kindly reminded) that *momentum* is conserved. 
NOT kinetic energy. FT=MV, m1v1=m2v2 and all that.

Ooops.

SO my numbers are off by a factor of 3600, which is greater than I consider
acceptable to pass without correction. Michael Lorrey's explanation was (as
I'd hoped) closer to the point and factually correct. I plead fatigue and
oxidation (rustiness).

Title
  The effects of lifelong ubiquinone Q10 supplementation on
  the Q9 and Q10 tissue concentrations and life span of male rats and mice.
Source
  Biochemistry & Molecular Biology International.  44(4):727-37, 1998 Apr.
Abstract
  The effect of lifelong oral supplementation with ubiquinone
  Q10 (10 mg/kg/day) was examined in Sprague-Dawley rats and C57/B17 mice.
  There were no significant differences in survival or life-span found in
  either rats or mice. Histopathologic examination of different rat tissues
  showed no differences between the groups. In Q10 supplemented rats, plasma
  and liver Q10 levels were 2.6 to 8.4 times higher at all age points than in
  control rats. Interestingly, in supplemented rats the Q9 levels also were
  significantly higher (p<0.05) in plasma and liver at ages 18 and 24 months.
  Neither Q9 nor Q10 levels were affected by supplementation in kidney, heart,
  or brain tissues. In spite of the significant changes in plasma and liver
  ubiquinone concentrations, lifelong Q10 supplementation did
  not prolong or shorten the lifespan of either rats or mice.

i hope there is a medical type out there who can help me with thisquestion.
years ago someone told me that chimps can accept human
blood transfusions.  this was tried, and worked. true?

so, can humans accept transfusions from chimps?  has it been
tried?  if blood, can we get a transplant of other organs?
how about an entire body?  i saw an article that a doctor
had switched the heads of two monkeys and they both
lived.  quadraplegic of course, but they lived.

if one had a bad disease such as emphasema, and one
did not believe in cryonics, but wanted desperately
to live, could one have one's head transplanted onto
the body of a chimp?  spike

In the second chapter of _Engines of Creation_, Drexler writes, 

	"The oldest and simplest mental immune system simply 
	commands 'believe the old, reject the new.'  Something 
	like this system generally kept tribes from abandoning old, 
	tested ways in favor of wild new notions--such as the notion 
	that obeying alleged ghostly orders to destroy all the tribe's 
	cattle and grain would somehow bring forth a miraculous 
	abundance of food and armies of ancestors to drive out
	foreigners." (p.37) 

Nanotech in particular advocates such a radical paradigm shift that 
this meme would be particularly potent, especially for the uninformed.
But a scientific community claims to be dedicated to the idea of 
advancement, and as Robin pointed out, the most vocal skeptics are 
from our own scientists.  The criticisms are of an odd breed as well, 
typically either dismissive of the idea as science fiction or critical of 
Drexler personally.  
 And why not?  Nanotech would render a large sector of that community 
obsolete (and vie for grants), so there is little reason for career scientists 
to support a fledgling competitor.  Instead of fear of the unknown, danger
of obsolescence sets in.  The nanotech revolution will be made up mostly 
of people who are making their life choices now -- high school and college 
students in biology or chemistry or computer science, people who have 
little to lose by creating a new and unfamiliar world.

But this is where I think this argument is fundamentally wrong. I can't
inhabit a later body-segment without having inhabited all earlier segments
and having memories of it (or some problem which destroys those memories).

Would anyone by any chance know whether this another ripoff (they
take the $ 27.00 and vanish), or a legit business? If so,
it might be nice money maker for the Americans and Canadians on this

While that's certainly a worthwhile route with old technology, it has quite 
a few flaws. Firstly, there's a limit to how far you can reduce the cost
that way, because you're still throwing away the booster every time you
launch it. Secondly the payload is much, much too large for launching
modern satellites; I'm not sure of the mass of an average comsat these days, 
but if it's taken as five tons you'd have to launch ten to a hundred 
satellites per booster! And just imagine putting a hundred billion 
dollar satellites on a booster with a 95% reliability rating; you've just 
added an average of $5,000,000,000 to the cost of every launch, because
one time in twenty you'll lose the whole hundred billion dollar payload.

You save a lot of money with an SSTO simply because it can safely abort
in most launch failures without losing the payload.

I think one of the problems is the wild
speculation that Drexler and other advocates make.
For instance, the chapters in Unbounding the
Future and Engines of Creation which talk about
reviving dead species and repairing the Earth.
While this may well be possible, it's premature to
make claims without looking at the economics
involved. Also, as can be seen with the
Nanomedicine FAQ, claims that abundant health will
create peace. Seeing such naive and utopian claims
(especially if they're the first contact you have
with the technology) can colour your attitude
about its feasibility.

Today I learnt some new words from classical greek. They are "ducation",
"enter" "erospace", "cience", and last but not least "echnology". I learnt
these word forms from the website of ASTEC. I did so only after Robin
Hanson's misattribution to what doug bailey wrote. Initially the typo
seemed to me to have been a hidden move. It may turn out not to be so. I
understand this and offer the following for its spoof value only.

Thanks.

EARLIER TODAY:

"The above phrase seems to be from an ancient greek occult system." I
thought to myself.

Indeed there is even a "College of echnology" on Infoseek. Pardon my
ignorance.

"But, is this like an 'ethnology'?". Hanson rarely makes deliberate
mistakes and on such a precise subject matter, or so I thought.

On further inspection the hard "c" [as in ekus; meaning "out of us"] and
the "human: h", "knowledge: no", "study:logy" [as in ec'h`no'logy] could,
at a stretch, turn out to be an occult greek code word for that little
something that you and I don't know anything about. Coded to look like a
typo.

But in the meantime, I had to find out just what 'echnology' is all about.
Well my guess, from reading the rest of Hanson's reply, was that echnology
is a scholarly plateau of surmising of what may become a new Technology.
[N.B. here the first letter "T" has been added to a the greek root
combinatoric "ec+h+no+logy".]

Extropy could be, I considered, a first rate 'echnology' [which I took to
be a science in "all likelihood" and will, when proven, become an accepted
technology.]

Am I making any sense and would anyone like to hear more?

ciao,

Got this off of Comline today:

A team from NEC {6701} and the University of Tokyo have 
discovered that applying noise to image recognition patterns 
through such artificial intelligence (AI) systems as neural 
networks will raise the accuracy of recognition systems.
This runs counter to the prevailing belief that an image 
must be a neat as possible for clear pickup. The principle 
seems to be along the same lines as humans and animals 
blinking as they process visual patterns.

I saw this on tv last night:

http://www-aero.meche.rpi.edu/Research/LaserPropulsion/index.html

They claim it will reduce launch costs for small satellites
by "several orders of magnitude" within something like 5
years.

But I can't find any exact figures. Does anyone have an idea
of about how many dollars/pound (or kg) we are talking about
here, and will this thing really make it possible for the
average joe (or company) to have their own satellites?

 I predict that the first SI will think slower than the best humans.
Why would people wait to upload or create an artificial intelligence
until CPU power supports ultrafast minds if they can figure out how
to do it earlier?

 We have plenty of experience with small differences in speed of thought,
and have seen no sign that thinking faster than others is enough to
make total conquest (as opposed to manipulation) possible.

 A) attempting world conquest is very risky, as it unites billions
of minds around the goal of attempting to conquer you. This should
be especially true in a period of rapid technological change when
many new inventions are popping up but haven't had their military
implications tested. I can't see how the risks of diversity could
be as big as this.
 B) there's no quick way for the SI to determine that there aren't
other civilizations in the universe which might intend to exterminate
malevolent SIs.
 C) given the power you are (mistakenly) assuming the SI has over the
rest of the world, I suspect the SI could also insure it's safety by
hindering the technological advances of others.

 An unusual enough claim that I will assume it is way off unless
someone constructs a carefull argument in favor of it.

 Sabotaging computer systems sounds like a good way of reducing the
malevolent SI's power. It's power over others is likely to come from
it's ability to use those systems better. Driving people to reduce
their dependance on computers would probably insure they are more
independant of the SI's area of expertise.
 Also, there will probably be enough secure OSs by then that sabotaging
them wouldn't be as easy as you imply (i.e. the SI would probably need
to knock out the power system).

 It may be easy for some people to learn, but I made a serious attempt, and
decided that the effort needed to remember a significant number of dreams
was excessive. If I could make it the only thing on my mind for several
weeks, I suspect I could have succeeded, but I have too many other ideas
competing for top priority.

I meant that since I am a bio now, the only way I could be a postbio as 
well is if I am one of the transitionary people who is both at different 
times in their lives.  And transitionary postbios are the first postbios.

I reread Leslies book on this issue last night, and object to
putting bios and postbios into the same ref class in exactly the way 
that Leslie envisions one might object:  

   It might perhaps be complained that making the reference class into 
   humans-after-splitting-away-from-Neanderthals would be coming too
   near to imitating the man who makes his reference class into 
   people-born-as-late-as-himself-or-later [p. 261, The End of the World]

If you do a Bayesian analysis of all your information carefully, the DA 
effect will be embodied in your analysis, and should not need to be added 
in seperately.  

I'm now reading your paper on the DA, and hope to write a summary
of my opinions on DA soon.

I've always loved the idea of laser launch. 

The rule of thumb for the flight plan, BTW, used to be "thirty gees for
thirty seconds", so it's a bit of a hard ride. IIRC, that's something like
8-10 gees more than the *peak* gee load you get with modified military
launchers. Users had better think about that carefully.

The economics are complex, and (aren't they always?) fraught with politics.
Here's what I think:

The incremental cost per pound has every reason to be very low indeed. I
refuse to believe the lowest figures I've heard, but $100 per pound seems
possible, provided you amortize over a lot of launches, and there are no
surprise failures on the lasers, etc.

The frontend costs are significant (the laser array and the power source
for it: I seem to recall old work suggesting a dedicated nuclear power
reactor?).  

Expect some "resistance environmental"--the engine employs air-detonation,
which means NOx byproducts. If I remember right, the last little bit of
delta-vee takes boiling something off or out of the airframe, and that
means changing the beam so it focuses on the airframe somehow, but neither
loses track nor hits the wrong thing nor cooks your payload, all at maximum
distance through (mirage shimmering) air at maximum beam depression. 

The use of the ground station technology for other purposes such as
ballistic missile point defense should not be overlooked. Expect this to be
controversial in some circles.

Lastly, there are the usual caveats about government programs, bleeding
edge tech and technologists selling sweet dreams at low prices that never
show up.

Thanks for the comments Nick. I think what I am attempting
to articulate is that I don't see how any species can apply
the DA and not conclude that its extinction is imminent. Can you
provide details or characteristics of an entity and its species
where the entity could apply the DA to its situation and not
reach the "doom" conclusion?

Why am I going to apologize to Max? I'll give Shaun a cheerleader award 
but I certainly won't apologize to Max. Max was clearly hypocritical on 
this list. I called him on it. He can't handle it. What am I supposed to 
do? He continues to be hypocritical by insulting me because I chose not 
to use my real name. I've yet to see him do the same to Tom Morrow. And 
no I have nothing against Tom Morrow. The difference is I say things Max 
does not agree with. He can't handle it so he attacks me. He did the 
same my Erik Moeller. Max tried to villainize me because many of my 
posts are critical. Yeah I'm a critical person. The glass is half-empty 
and that kinda stuff. That doesn't make me a bad person or someone who 
should be castigated.

I've just been making observations. None of them have been conjured up 
from la-la land. Everyone else has seen what happened with that thread. 
Anyway...

It sounds like you are saying that scientists are either being dishonest
or irrational.  They may understand the significance of nanotech, but they
dishonestly downplay its importance because they don't want to be made
obsolescent or to lose grant funding to a competitor.  Or they may be
irrational because subconscious fears of these problems prevent them from
rationally evaluating nanotechnology.

People are not as honest as we might wish, and politics plays as important
a role in science as in any other human endeavor.  But I doubt that
dishonesty is a significant factor in the rejection of nanotech.  Most
scientists have more integrity than that, I think.

This leaves irrationality.  Rejecting bizarre-seeming ideas is reasonable
as a first cut at things, but to persist over a long period of time it
means that people are not evaluating this new technology fairly.  They
are being irrational in not giving nanotechnology the attention and the
analysis it deserves.

What we seem to end up with is a world in which both sides of the
controversy each believe that the other side is being irrational.  Nanotech
opponents believe the supporters are fanatics and wild-eyed dreamers with
no grounding in reality.  Supporters believe opponents are stodgy and
closed-minded, afraid of the changes which new technology would bring.

Robin Hanson has an interesting argument that factual disagreements should
not persist.  However I think it took as one of its premises that people
believe that others are basically rational.  If that is the case then
over time people should modify their beliefs in the face of persistent
disagreement.  Disagreements about factual matters should not be stable.

What if people hold the contrary belief, that there are significant
numbers of other people who are stubbornly irrational?  It would seem
that we might have a stable outcome similar to what we actually see:
people collecting into subgroups with shared opinions, where they believe
other members of their group are rational (at least on this issue!).
However the existence of significant groups with other opinions does
not lead them to change their ideas because they simply assume that the
others are irrational.

Many times I've convinced myself that I have a refutation for the DA,
only to decide on further consideration that it is more difficult than
it seems.

In this case I think Doug's comment is correct, although it is not
a matter of a "species" applying the DA but rather a member of the
species.

However the point is that for most members of most species, the conclusion
is correct.  For most of them, it is true that they are about in the middle
of the set of members of their species.  That's just the law of averages.
So of all those species members who apply the DA to conclude that "doom
is imminent" (specifically, that they are about halfway along in the
membership of their species), most of them are correct.

One possible escape, then, is to suggest that we are special because
we are living in the time when the DA was just recently discovered.
We are not a typical member of a long-lived species who learns about a
DA which was discovered ages ago.  If we were then it would be correct
that the odds are that we are halfway along the species' existence.  But
we are not a random selection, we are special because this is the first
era when the DA has been discovered.  Every species must go through such
an era, and for those observers who live in exactly that era, it tells
them nothing about the expected time remaining for their species.

This argument would be a bit stronger if the DA had been discovered more
recently.  However it has only been popularized within the last couple of
years and so we really are the first people to be faced with it.

I don't care for formulations of the DA which act as though I might
have been born at different times.  This raises thorny problems about
the meaning of identity, whether I could be said to be the same person
if I were born thousands of years in the future.

Rather, it is simpler to say that for most observers the DA will be valid.
However, it will not be valid for those observers who are specially chosen
as being part of a certain milestone in the history of their race - the
discovery of fire, or of writing, or of the DA.  You can easily imagine
that the universe is such that most species do not discover fire halfway
along their history, and the same reasoning applies to the discovery of
the DA.

Did you take into consideration an estimate of the probability that the
Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct, and that you
can be said to be revived if it occurs in any world that stems from one
in which you are frozen? :-)

Truax's designs are re-useable.  He was probably the first proponent of re-useable rockets, and argued in favor of such during the Apollo project.  He complained that we were building a stunt rather than an ongoing space transportation capability.  His Big Dumb Boosters recover both stages in the ocean, and they are then towed back to dry dock for re-use.  Many people have a hard time believing that you can recover a rocket in the ocean, but it has been proven and demonstrated many times.  It does require a pressure fed design (or solid rocket motor, such as the Shuttle boosters), for the strong tank walls.  Retaining the pressurizing helium in the tanks after shutdown results in the tank walls always remaining in tension during impact, eliminating buckling forces.

>Secondly the payload is much, much too large for launching modern satellites;
Modern satellites are light in part because of the cost per pound of putting them up with "modern" launchers.  As the cost of orbiting mass goes down, the cost of developing satellites will go down as well, as one can make simpler spacecraft if you have more mass to work with.  As the total cost goes down, the risk goes down, and you spend less on reliability, and the cost goes down more.  There is no reason why one could not put up a number of small satellites in one launch, as long as they are in similar orbital planes.  The 77 satellite Iridium network, for instance, in six to ten launches.

If the satellites cost $10^9, why put more than one on each launch?  That's just a financial optimization question.  You don't need to use the full payload capacity of a launcher every time.  Truax says that as every new launcher has been fielded, the builders immediately wanted more capacity.  Witness the many variations on Atlases, Titans, Arianes, Deltas, etc., with strap-on solid boosters and other gimmicks that raise the complexity, and increase the cost.  Why not build it bigger than you need, from the start?  This is again the point where most folks follow their intuition rather than the facts: The cost does not go up very fast with scale, but it does go up rapidly with complexity.  Is it cheaper to buy a one-seat car because you usually don't need the extra seats?  Not much cheaper, and soon you need a second car.  And as you make a rocket bigger, you can build it simpler, because various effects give you better performance as the scale goes up.

>You save a lot of money with an SSTO simply because it can safely abort
>in most launch failures without losing the payload. 
I don't mean to be nasty, but this is like saying you'll save money buying a Mercedes-Benz rather than a pickup truck because in an impact, your groceries are less likely to get splattered.  Most launch failures in rockets, by the way, are explosions.

The early units were Nitric acid and Aniline motors.  This was safer than using LOX because you are guaranteed ignition.  Ignition failure=BOOM.

Yes, and there is a mental concept of scale that people carry in their heads, and it is a shock to them to have that preconception re-adjusted.  A related Truax/Goddard story: Bob said that when Goddard saw the business end of the V2's after the war, his jaw, literally, dropped in amazement.  How could anyone build a rocket SO BIG???  I think we all suffer from the same error.  What we should say, looking at a Space Shuttle, is: how can anyone build a rocket SO COMPLEX?

Here is an exercise: compare a large ship to a Saturn V rocket, and the rocket is clearly short, light, small.  And rockets don't suffer from the same scaling law that limits airplanes to somewhere around the size of a 747 (square/cubed law relation of lifting area to weight).

>the PR (/perceived environmental) impact of a *BIG* boom can be daunting,
Yes.  Perception again.  Sea launch=little boom.  LOX/Kerosene=low toxic emission relative to solid boosters or the hypergolics used in the Titan series rockets.

Sure, its human nature.  But I get annoyed listening to arguments for/against various impractical booster concepts when it is obvious they are impractical.  Piggybacked winged stages.  Single stage to orbit techno-marvels that carry virtually no payload despite pushing all structures beyond the state of the art.  Dozens of space shuttle main engines ganged together, all operating reliably, simultaneously(!).  Mid-flight propellant loading from another vehicle.  SCRAMLACE (liquify oxygen from the air in flight, for use out of the atmosphere).  Sheesh.


Us space enthusiasts are our own worst enemy, all pointing to the stars, but all in different directions.

>his approach?  What are their reasons for skepticism? 

Good question.  For one, investor and public ignorance.  As I mentioned, people generally believe that some new technology is needed.  There is nothing wrong with new tech, it just takes time and money to develop.  Another reason, Bob is getting on in years.  More importantly, his booster ideas are in the same boat with every other commercial space launch project, that is, competing for the same small private funding pie.  Investors don't understand the technical side so well.  That's where a master fund raiser such as Gary Hudson shines.

Note for the record that Bob's small rocket ideas did get privately funded to the tune of several million built, and static fired many times.  The Navy bought that project, called it SEALAR, and spent $20-30 million on Bob's little rockets.  We dropped rockets in the ocean from helicopters.  We fired a dozen different engine designs.  We had a warehouse full of surplus Thor missile motors, even full missiles (this was a liquid fueled intermediate range ballistic missile, rather large).  The SEALAR test vehicle was finished to the point of being fully integrated with guidance, telemetry, ground station, recovery system, motors, tanks, sea launch ballast, etc., and ready for the last few tests before launch.  That's when the Navy cancelled the project.  The Naval Research Laboratory (our customer) wanted the project to continue, as did congress (allocating more funding than was asked for), but not the Navy brass.  A political problem, not a technological one.

It seems that it is easy to scare up a few million for a rocket project, and a few outstanding efforts have produced $50 million or so (ARC technologies/ Starstruck/ AMROC, for example).  That's enough to fly one, but not to finish the job.

One reason for the difficulty in getting funding is that until recently there was no definite market for launch services except to the US government.  Low orbit communication networks have changed that.  We could see one of these projects succeed in the next few years.


Here's another company working on low cost launch vehicles, but which keeps a lower profile than Rotary Rocket co.: www.aeroastro.com/industry/aeroastro/home.html
These folks are building very Truax-style boosters.  I give them a better chance than the Roton.  Pressure fed, composite tanks, ablatively cooled thrust chambers, two stage to orbit.  Very tasty.

I think we are talking about things that are beyond amateur groups here.

Selection of the pumping and thrust chamber cooling design is basic to liquid motor design.  There are two main schools: Pump fed, and pressure fed.  Pressure fed systems are simplest, but the tanks are necessarily heavier.  This increases the empty mass fraction relative to a pump fed system.  Seeking performance despite the cost, the industry went to pumps.  Carbon fiber tanks reduce the pressure-fed weight penalty, and this changes the tradeoff from what it used to be.  Truax/Aerojet's second stage designs run at only a 75PSI chamber pressure, taking advantage of the vacuum to allow this without sacrificing expansion ratio (ISP).  This also reduces the tank weight penalty.

But it's a well understood problem, with (partially) off-the-shelf solutions.  No surprises.

Hmmn.  I doubt you can get away without thrust vector control, especially for the second stage.  A rocket doing an orbital insertion wants to fly a precise arc, optimizing various losses and winding up in the desired orbit.  As for the aspect ratio of the rocket, two points.  One, pressure fed rockets have very stiff, strong tank walls, and don't suffer structural problems of pump fed designs.  Two, as you make a rocket bigger, the scaling laws say that aerodynamic forces matter less, and so the shape optimizes towards a short, wide one as the size goes up.

>either way, the roton is within the reach of sophisticated amateurs and

Only in the sense that any design is, in my opinion: One can afford to play with them, but to field a successful launcher... Just how deep are your pockets?

I'm still rather bothered by the fact it's wrong at most moments in time.
In a species that lasts 100 million years members can have been concluding
that they were about to go extinct.  For 100 million years. 

Does the logic of the DA not apply to your own lifespan?

Is this the DA conclusion?  I'd thought it was that room really was imminent,
not that you're in the middle.  

Consider 3 species.  One has a constant number of members for almost all of
its existence.  Another has exponential growth and then sudden collapse.  A
third has a Gaussian distribution over time.  It seems to be only members of
the last can conclude they're in the middle.  Members of the second should
conclude they're near the end.  Members of the first can't conclude much of
anything; they have a 1/3 chance, say, of being in the middle third of their
history.  Not very specific.

Members of the third while their numbers were increasing could conclude they
were in the first half of their history.  The trick, of course, is knowing
ahead of time what distribution applies.  My original conception of the DA
applies best to the 2nd species -- most members will be alive shortly before
they pollute themselves to death, or something.  But at most points in their
history doom is not imminent.

Another thing I've never figured out is what we're supposed to do with the
conclusion of the DA, even if correct.

I don't see how that is relevant: the "assumptions" that my reply 
referred to included the assumption that the observer-moment version 
of the DA works. Given this assumption the reasoning goes as follows: 
You could have found that your present consciousness-moment was one 
of a late Superbeing (maybe remembering once having been a biological 
human). Instead you find that it is one of a biological human. What 
does this say about the relative number of the Superbeing 
observer-moments compared to the number of human observer-moments? If 
the time version of the DA is right, and all these observer-moments 
belong to the same reference class, then it says that the number of 
Superbeing observer-moments is very likely not very much greater than 
the number of human observer-moments. That the Superbeings might 
remember once having been human makes no difference.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

Here is the last section of the FAQ. After allowing a few days for 
people to comment on this, it's time to write up. Experienced 
transhumanists who want to contribute in the writing up stage should 
email me personally (n.bostrom@lse.ac.uk). A preliminary draft will 
later be put up on a web page and anybody will be able to suggest 
further modifications, using CritLink. 

PRACTICALITIES AND THE TRANSHUMANIST PROGRAM

[I have suggested answers for three of these questions. I found the 
first two questions rather difficult to answer in a meaningful way in 
just a few paragraphs. I'm not satisfied with my replies to those 
two.]

What evidence is there that it will happen?

Many of the developments that transhumanists discuss are already
happening: e.g. the Internet, imperfect mood drugs, genetic
engineering and advanced medicine are part of today's reality. Some
are near-future developments that nobody really doubts will happen: it
is obvious (barring a major cataclysm) that we will have faster
computers that will support some forms of virtual reality; wearable
computers; neurological prostheses; much more powerful genetic
engineering tools that will make it possible to choose many traits of
our offspring; improved mood drugs; advanced collaborative information
filtering structures on the Internet, etc.

As for superintelligence and nanotechnology, see the questions about
these. When these two technologies are developed, it will be possible
to cheaply manufacture most material structures that are compatible
with physical law. Thus, it should be feasible to: colonize the
universe by sending out self-replicating probes; upload biological
brains; reanimate cryonics patients; experience full-blown virtual
reality; have control over our emotions and mental states - which
means that boredom and suffering could be replaced by a sense of deep
meaningfulness and excitement, for example.


These transhumanist prospects will not happen within a hundred years;
won't it take more like a thousand years?

Considerations about what is permitted by physical laws can tell us
what is in principle possible. Theoretical exploration of plausible
design-paths can be used to make a case that certain technologies,
such as nanotechnology, will eventually be practically feasible. It is
harder, however, to argue rigorously for when this will happen. The
uncertainty in the time-scale is partly due to our ignorance of
exactly how hard some developments will be, and partly to the fact
that the speed of progress in a specific area depends on how much
resources are made available, which in turn is determined by
hard-to-predict social and economic factors.

Most transhumanists think that superintelligence and nanotechnology
will both happen in less than a hundred years, and many believe that
they will happen well within the first third of the next century.
(Some reasons for believing this are outlined in the sections about
these two technologies, respectively.) Once there is both
nanotechnology and superintelligence, a wide range of special
applications should swiftly follow.

Many transhumanist goals can and are successfully pursued with
currently available tools. There is not a sharp distinction between
transhumanist prospects and other worthwhile goals. Humans have always
endeavoured to improve things, including themselves. Transhumanists
just want to continue this process of human self-augmentation, even to
the point where we will redefine some of the features and boundaries
that are currently seen as fundamental to human nature.


What if it doesn't work?
Then we would presumably back to status quo. But the issue is not
whether it will work so much as what will work and how and when. With
many potentially transforming technologies already available and
others uncontroversially on the line, it is clear that there will be
large scope for human self-augmentation. 

As for the more superlative transhuman technologies, such as
nanotechnology and supertintelligence, they are reachable through
several independent paths. If one path turns out to be blocked, we can
try another. This adds to the likelihood that it will be possible to
reach the target.

If nevertheless for some unforeseen reason we can't develop molecular
nanotechnology and superhuman artificial intelligence, and not the
things that these technologies would make possible - uploading,
reanimation of cryonics patients, indefinite life-spans etc. - that
would be disappointing. We could find some solace however in all the
useful things that we would no doubt have discovered on the journey:
new tools for genetic engineering, mood-drugs, information technology,
faster computers, new useful chemicals, new medicines and organ
transplantation techniques, more compact computer memories. And in
other areas of life and science the field of possibilities would still
be wide open.


How could I become a posthuman?

Isn't the possibility of success in cryonics too small?

Will the people of the future be interested in restoring you?

What recent progress has been made towards transhumanist goals?

How can I become involved in transhumanism?

I cannot speak for others, but I certainly hold the latter
belief myself--that the vast majority of humans on Earth
are indeed stubbornly irrational, and that I am a better
judge of facts than even the most educated ("education" as
practiced today, after all, is merely indoctrination into
the currently popular prejudices).

Not only would that serve to stabilize disagreeing factions,
but also the fact that there exists a vast cosmos of facts
that are simply unknowable/untestable with present technology,
for which reason--even perfect reason--simply cannot supply
answers.  Every discovery that answers a question creates 10
more questions, so there is a vast universe of ignorance with
only a few specks of knowledge that reason can verify.  I see
no reason why disagreement about facts in that great unknown
should cause any discomfort to reasonable people.

I've just spent the last 24 hours reconsidering the Doomsday 
argument, including Leslie's book, Nick's paper, and the two 
articles Nick cites that I could find on the web (at:
http://www.hedweb.com/nickb/140797/doomsday.html
http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/9407002
http://www.cs.monash.edu.au/~jono/TechReports/analysis2.ps )

The basic argument is that, all else equal, we should not expect 
to be temporally among the first, say, 5% of creatures "like us." 
So given exponential growth with a sudden end, that end is near. 

I'm currently pretty negative on the doomsday argument. 

1) Even when it is valid, the argument suggests "change," and 
not necessarily "doom".  Creatures like us can no longer exist 
because their descendants are different, but not destroyed.

2) Our concept of "like us" can be biased by where we are 
in time.  No fair picking the last big intelligence change, and
then defining "like us" to be anything at least as smart as we 
are.  Better to exclude smarter creatures as well as dumber.

3) It's actually hard to formalize the argument so that the 
implications are big.  

For example, Oliver & Korb show that accepting one's birth rank 
as a random draw from some total population, with a uniform prior 
over that total population, an observation of a low rank changes 
the expected value by less than a factor of ten.  Kopf, Krtous, 
& Page also show that expected values don't change much for a 
power law prior on total population, unless the power is near
minus two. 

As another example, Leslie admits in his "shooting room" example
that if the probability of "doom" is constant with time independent
of population size, the doomsday argument fails.  (The expected
population is infinite here, so stuff depends on how you slice it.)
Finally, Nick shows how the argument gets weakened as one allows
for alien creatures "like us" who won't get hurt by our local doom.

I suspect that the more these models get elaborated with our 
detailed knowledge relevant for forecasting "doom" or change, 
the less important the doomsday type selection effect would be.

4) Nick explains well how the doomsday argument assumes that
one was guarenteed to show up as a creature "like us" at sometime 
in our universe, regardless of how many such creatures this 
universe produces.  If one instead assumes that the probability of 
finding oneself in a universe is proportional to population of that 
universe, the doomsday argument evaporates.  This later assumption
seems much more reasonable to me, and to Kopf, Krtous, & Page.
I buy it even if the different universes are only "possible" 
rather than coexisting in some way.  


In summary, I don't buy a basic assumption of the doomsday argument,
and even if I did the implication seems only a moderately higher 
chance of change, not doom.

First a clarification: I did not originate the argument that persistent
disagreement is irrational.  I only extended the argument from Bayesians
to arbitrarily computationally constrained agents.  

Your theory has a certain plausibility, but I'm bothered by thinking about
how these people evaluate whether they are rational or not.  Imagine a 
rational but dumb mind core which makes use of lots of smart but perhaps 
irrational mental modules.  If the core is evaluating the rationality
of its modules on the basis of private information about how well those
modules have met various rationality tests, we're back to the same 
situation again.  It's irrational for the mind cores to agree to disagree
about the rationality of either of their modules.  

This suggests that the sort of irrationality needed here must be very
deep; there can't be a rational but dumb part of you that considers 
whether parts of you are irrational.

I meant that they would be about halfway along a list of all members
of their species, not that they would be halfway in time.  As you say,
with exponential growth of the species, this implies that they are near
the end timewise.  The conclusion still remains true for the majority
of the species members, over the whole history of the species.

You can't derive any time predictions from the DA until you have 
specified your estimates of future population figures. If the 
hypothetical species you refer to knew that they had a constant 
population, for example, and you ask what they would believe with 
(say)  97.5% confidence, then you'll find that only for the first 
2.5 million years would they conclude that doom will strike 
before 100 million years. 

> Does the logic of the DA not apply to your own lifespan? 

You would have to use the observer-moment version. But I think it 
does not apply, since what I call the no-outsider requirement isn't 
satisfied. (There are other observer-moments beside those belonging 
to your life.)  But it might be a problem for John Leslie since he 
doesn't accept the no-outsider requirement. A French mathematician, 
J-P Delahaye, noticed this and called it the Baby paradox -- newborns 
predicting that they will die soon.

The conclusion is that you are probably somewhere in the middle. 
However, due to recent population explosion (~10% of all humans ever 
born are alive today) this translates into a fairly short time span - 
especially if we think uploading and space colonization would add to 
population figures.

Ah, but by "near the end" we don't mean "near the end of the time 
inverval during which the species will exist", but rather "near 
the end of the sequence of individuals in this species".

I can tell you that: we should change our view about what the future 
will be like. More importantly, we should redouble our efforts to 
avoid all possible threats to the existence of our species. By doing 
that we change the priors and improve our odds.

The complaint that Leslie is refering to is that the reference class 
should not be unduely *narrowed*, that it would be wrong to leave out 
the pre-Neanderthal people. What you are saying is that the reference 
class should not be *widened* to include postbios. So why do you say 
that you object in exactly the same way as Leslie envisions? As far 
as I know, Leslie has never considered ruling out postbios from the 
reference class on the ground that they would be too different.

True. The reason why we might want to add it in separately is to more 
clearly see what effect it should have on our belief system.

I look forward to that.

What you are saying here is basically that the appropriate reference 
class is the set of all observers who know about the doomsday 
argument. With this reference class, the conclusion would be that 
there probably won't be a great many observers who know about the 
doomsday argument in the future. This could either mean that there 
won't be very many observers, or that there will be lots of observers 
but they won't know about the DA.

And then there is the question whether that is the right 
reference class?

Do you know which second you were born? If not, and you were asked to 
guess, you could repond with a probability distribution over a range 
of seconds. The same with minutes; and it's easy to imagine a 
situation where you suffer from amnesia and you are not even sure 
what year you were born. (That is actually quite common among old 
people in some parts of the world where there were no public records 
of births. That's why claims for longevity records tend to come 
from obscure places.) If you can be uncertain what year, then not 
what decade? Are there any clear limits to how far we can push this 
reasoning?

I think this can be modeled by saying that some people may have 
empirical priors that to some extent compensate for the DA.

Your claim and Saul's are compatible.  Together they imply almost
universal disbelief that nanotech will do what its proponents claim.
I am fascinated this sort of disagreement phenomena.  Why are
proponents so confident in the face of strong skepticism, and why are
skeptics so confident in the face of strong minority disagreement?
How does each side explain the other side's behavior, and how does
each side think the other side explains it?>

>From my perspective, it was Arthur C. Clarke's discussions on the 
conceptual lack of distinction between organic and inorganic that was 
crucial, prior to Drexler. This debate was articulated many years ago, 
and 20s and 30s sf in terms of the notion 'android' and artificial 
cells. The reason why debate was held back was the extreme difficulty in 
understanding and scanning cellular processes prior to DNA research and 
computing ability. This inhibitor was so extreme that things that were 
otherwise conceptually logical were (and still are) seen as impossible 
to verify. I remember arguing for the logic of cloning in 1978 CE to 
extreme derision at my final year of high school. But I was dumb. 
Although I realized the inevitability of AI bootstrapping I failed to 
see the connection between different molecular systems for different 
maps of sentiency, bootstrapping and environmental manipulation. (Though 
I did predict the principles of nanotech in relation to advanced 
automation - the micro-macro approach can be reversed given sufficiently 
high level technology). I certainly won't be as shortsighted again - I 
predict the principles inherent in nanotech will be applicable at the 
quantum level and beyond (call it rashon-manipulation if you like, or 
whatever). Just a feeling.

The point of the above is that most thinking readers disbelieved in 
cryonics because of the inevitable breakages in dethawing. Nanotech 
overcomes this problem (in terms of logic) so assuming the neuron 
markers in electrochemical patterning (the firing circles etc.) can be 
reactivated (seems logical) cryonics is OK. Heinlein didn't go for it - 
was he trying to make a point about World-as-Mythos? Coast Guard 
funeral, perhaps. Hmm...

Sabotaging computer systems sounds like a good way of reducing the
malevolent SI's power. It's power over others is likely to come from
it's ability to use those systems better. Driving people to reduce
their dependance on computers would probably insure they are more
independant of the SI's area of expertise.
 Also, there will probably be enough secure OSs by then that sabotaging
them wouldn't be as easy as you imply (i.e. the SI would probably need
to knock out the power system).
--
A SI will use bush robots etc. to construct new superhi tech. It will 
rapidly escalate up through 30-40% of total knowledge, probably through 
field SETI. (I have my reasons for asserting thus.) Power sources? E.g. 
two rotating singularities (Paul Davies). Time machines - rotating 
neutron stars etc. (if you don't care about the ramifications). An 
unspiritual SI could just go extraorbit after using your own weapons 
against you and your particle beam weapons and antimatter bombing you on 
top for certain (or perhaps moonrocking and sunblocking you), then 
constructing afresh (after the crust cools) a la the Jemhadir 
(spelling?) of Deep Space Nine. Or perhaps it will nanoweb the entire 
biosphere and control your bodies. BUT WHAT WOULD BE THE POINT? It would 
be like killing your folks and lovers in order to have security in a 
'house' which was there for you forever to start with. This obsession

What's a 'real' name?

 - Endive McCartney

2besure. I've had four now. My first name, a traditional male family 
name, has been used for at least four centuries (I was the fourth in a 
row with it, the other tradional male family name in my family was used 
eight generations in a row). 
Under common law, usage can namechange too. What happens when a person 
uses one name on the Internet and one in business, say? 

I always call anyone by whatever they want to be called.

Anyhow, why can't people have more than one name? Like more than one 
marriage partner, it should be legal!

In Victoria, Australia, you cannot change your name for 'frivolous' 
reasons, or change it by deed poll for a period of one year after 
changing it. When I changed my name to Avatar Polymorph I listed the 
reason as 'philosophical'. $28 later, no problemo.

Well, that there are significant numbers of other people who are stubbornly
irrational *in a certain domain*.  

Presumably this is the means whereby people in a (fairly) peaceful
pluralist society treat the religious and (mainstream variant) political
views of their neighbors.  The polite rule against discussing politics and
religion at the dinner table (or whatever it is) acknowledges this working
assumption.  It has the convenient side effect that people with novel
approaches to the world actually can get on and try them out, up to a
point, which sometimes leads to fresh science, art, technology...  

Presumably adherence to sporting claques (as non-playing supporters) is a
contrived version of this domain-construction, or maybe an adaptation of
earlier tribalisms which saw competitors not so much as irrational but as
worthy and feared Others, to be belittled by scornful shouts but envied for
their prowess and possessions.

How is can it be then, that I percieve a single unifying software
concept? By visiting my webpage you are helping create enough critical
mass to make my view a universal concept. Some in my field feel that
such technology should only be used for rational leadership, but I
disagree. Only by including the irrational can the hidden layers be
exposed for the occult corruption that they are. Be warned: - this
website is not for thin skinned economists.

http://come.to/ingrid

Sorry to intrude on this thread in this way but you should understand my
long field of perception in this area makes it very dificult at times
for me to get across what I mean. At this website is the bud of the
technology that you say doesn't exist. There is software you can
download there to balance the individual hemispheres of both rational
and irrational complete story worlds that can coexist in an ever
elevating stasis. I believe Ingrid can toggle each of these components
inside a feedback multilayed grid. Ingrid has already been demonstrated
on this list in that short NSPIC debate on this list last year; - backed
up here.

Ingrid is a rep-grid freeware offer to Kellian constructivists- who make
inferences about meanings by looking at the relationship between
constructs. Parallel Ingrid will not use a dendritic pruning method but
will use Principle Component Analysis and will therefore be able to
replay secret scenarios when that situation arises. This is radical
constructivism at its finest.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FYI, I'm taking Ingrid into the field of Internet promotions to support
the gossip dance party scene, here in Auckland NZ. Right now through the
admiring support of local NZ agents, Playboy BMG, we are into our second
sponsor's party and we are going after the 20-30yr female market. With
the Playboy Online Live theme, we're seeing what happens when a woman to
woman network, using an Ingrid projection, steps in to control the night
scene. There's also a strange mix of Palm Pilot boyfriends, alcohol and
a mock gangster party smokeasy.

"This is the new world of PLAYBOY  produced, directed and starring
women. Also starring as a woman, and to be included as a member of this
group is a computer program that its author {me} claims is the essence
of a woman's mind, a transhuman called Ingrid. http://come.to/ingrid to
meet a personification of the mathematics of female intuition, lovingly
called Ingrid, and you will meet her in an oasis of glamour filled with
a wealth of entertainment."

Alright already everyone! Let's put all this bitterness behind us - the

its after-effects are long dead and forgotten. It's not very becoming to
read all this
on a list devoted to life enhancement....

What I think you should be saying is that there is an inability to make the
measurements of irrationality because of the secretive person's unwillingness
to be measured. But what they don't realize is that they can be second guessed
by another being put in their shoes, as it were with undeniable plausibility.
This is why when using a tool like my Ingrid system, one finds it hard to rope
people into thinking in grids. Distributed intelligence is harder to kick start
than a mexican wave. But is can happen.

But have you read and understood the arguments for such

I'm saying that having a relatively narrow/strict cut in early times and a
relatively wide/generous cut in later times constitutes a bias, which
will make us earlier in the rank order than an unbiased reference class.
This bias will make the total population seem smaller than otherwise.

Sorry I should have said I presumed it isn't what you meant, but should have; -
because it makes sense. At least you should have considered saying 'not rational'
instead of or as opposed to irrational; - this is from the point of view of the
trinary circuit. (1,0,-1 where rational = 1, not rational = 0, and irrational =
-1.)

i convinced myself that unless one could get at least some family orfriends to
come along, it might not be worthwhile to try cryonics, so...
i started with my own family.  two grandmothers and my father
flatly refused.  my mother listened to my pitch, then asked what
i thought of the chances of success.  i estimated 5 to 10 percent,
definitely worth a shot.  she thought it over and said something
that i found touching.  the quote as close as i can recall:

i estimate the probability of success much lower than you do,
but if you wanted to spend your inheritance to get me frozen, and
you think it would make it easier to say goodbye, then i do
not object.

it brought tears to my eyes.  spike

the temporary side-effect of mass extinctions (similar to previous ones

solar body strikes). Not only is it the mechanism for boosting of living
beings (and extinct ones) in the post-Escalation period (the 
post-species

I have noticed in conversations with about half of the more educated 
people I talk to about nanotech that they themselves raise the issues of 
'upload' and physical space. Our local lad Peter Singer (animal 
liberationist) has already suggested 'measures' be taken for population 
control in our paper, The Age, in regards to longevity extension.

I myself have a fundamentally different point of view. I believe we should 
debate matters for three decades and allow everyone to have access to 
hitech.

Some forthcoming posters (it's my hobby currently - I put up 200 or 300 of 
the cover of Damien Broderick's book, for example - and 100 or 200 of 
Tipler's cover)(out of c.7,000, mainly at the 3 large universities).

BAN THE KILLING OF ANIMALS

VOTE FOR THE UNITED NATIONS [ONE PERSON ONE VOTE]

NATIONAL SELF-DETERMINATION FOR THE FRINGE LAND EMPIRES OF CHINA, INDIA 
AND INDONESIA

GOVERNMENT ELECTRONIC CASH FACILITIES [TO BE PROVIDED IN ADDITION TO 
PRIVATE BANK ELECTRONIC CASH FACILITIES]

UNIFORMS TO BE OPTIONAL, BY LAW

These may not appear to be so transhumanist, unlike most of my earlier 
posters, on celebrating the forthcoming Techno-Rapture and boosting, and 
celebrating telomere therapy and arguing for the provision of lifespan 
extension techniques to all sentient beings, but heck, the 
Escalation/Spike/Singularity requires different flexible strategies to 
apply to a more flexible situation. This is the period in which Toffler's 
Future Shock begins to operate. Non-transhumanists are going to be 
confused and uncertain about strategy in the light of increased ability. 
For example, I have asked various people what degree of medical care they 
would provide were the best possible care available without cost for any 
injured creature. I.e. the principle. I myself would say, if there were a 
horse with a broken leg, I would have it fixed. More than that, in 
principle I would seek its consent, were that possible, prior to fixing 
it. Irrelevent? Certainly not after twenty-two years time, maximum. That 
first five years after nano-year is going to seem massive, to us. All that 
orbital engineering. The politics. The explosion in spiritual movements. 
Wait and see. The nanovirus is complexity itself. We are the viruses. The 
process can no more be contained than Ceaucescu could monitor all the 
telephone calls in Rumania. The logic is, were this universe 
monostructured, conceptual diversity would have been suppressed from the 
worlds of the Techno-Rapture already. Has anyone else done a rough 
calculation of how many of these there are in a Tipler-version finite 
universe assuming carbon-based life began 6.5 billion years after the Big 
Bang? I did, a few years ago. It was a lot. Also, average distances 
between them seemed fairly low, after the first five million years of 
'graduation'. But my figures are probably way off.

I believe any non-violent action against either:

a. killing of sentient beings
b. enslavement of sentient beings, including 'artificial intelligences'
c. restriction of hi-tech (of the non-violent variety)

is legitimate in the next 30 years.

I also believe that local government and other land areas or social 
networks should be free to democratically choose their systems mix, 
however that may be expressed in prenano political terms.

Lastly, I believe it is vital that conservatives be permitted to remain 
conservative, even for billenia: with the provisos that meat-eaters can 
consume created cells or consensually-donated cloned cells (I am happy to 
donate cloned meat cells from my body for others to eat, if that makes 
them happy - I am sure that some other beings originally - or still - from 
other species will in future be willing to say the same) and that victims 
of force can be offered protective shielding if they request it.

Very unlikely, even for a "simple" AI. Our brains work with cumbersome
electro-chemical processes, and are easily outmatched in speed by any
PC. If I remember correctly, it was mentioned in an earlier thread that
Deep Blue (or a like computer) scored most points in the speedmatches,
while it was only mediocre in the longer matches where its human
opponent had more time to think. And that's just a contemporary
computer, by the time SI arrives we'll be at least a couple
of decades down the road (with a doubling of computer power every
1.5 years or so.) So, IMO the SI will almost certainly be superfast
(driven by CPUs with *many* times the current capacity), and
by definition Super Intelligent. That's a winning combination.

Unless I'm very mistaken, there will *already* be hyperfast CPUs
when AI and uploading become possible. The CPU technology is simply
less complicated than uploading human brains or creating intelligent,
conscious machines.

Although speed is very important, it's the SI's superior *intelligence*
that really gives it an edge. Combine that with nanotech, with which
a SI can rapidly add to its computing mass, refine itself, make all
kinds of external tools etc, _all without outside help_. Total autonomy
gives it unprecedented freedom. A SI could kill everything else and
suffer little inconvenience from it, while a normal human that causes
WW3 will almost certainly eventually die himself, even if he hides
himself in a high-tech bunker.

Most people will simply never know what hit them. Even if everyone
somehow found out about the SIs plans (unlikely that it would be
so slow and sloppy), there wouldn't be much 99.999...% of the
people on this planet could do. While everyone would be panicking
and frustrating eachother's efforts, the SI(s) would methodically
do its (their) thing, helped by an unparalleled knowledge of the human
psyche.

The threat from creatures on earth is real, a proven fact, while
hostile aliens are just a hypothesis (that lacks any proof). It's
comparable to cryonics and religion: would you refuse to having your
body frozen upon death because of a miniscule chance that there is a
god, and that he/she/it doesn't like it? In other words: it wouldn't
stop a rational SI from taking out all known competition.

Given enough time, the SI would surely reach a state where it can
afford such luxuries. The thing is that it likely wouldn't have
enough time; it would be strong enough to stop the competition, but
likely not smart/powerful enough to do it gently. It's much easier to
destroy than to subdue, and with the hot breath of other ascending
forces (with undoubtedly similar intentions) in its neck, the choice
would be easy.

Are you referring to the motivation change or ultra-fast ascension
(or both)? Anyway, I can't imagine why our ancient, reproduction-
driven and hormone-controlled motivations wouldn't become quickly
as obsolete as the biological body from which they've sprung. It
would be arrogant indeed to think that we have already determined
"absolute truth", that our morals are definitive. Besides, even
without the massive transformation of man into SI, your motivations
would likely change over time.
 
As for the speed: to a being with thousands (perhaps more) of
times our brain speed, mere seconds are like years. While we
would stand around like statues (from the SIs perspective), it
would consider, simulate, reject, improve etc. thought upon thought,
plan upon plan. Computers are *already* much faster than humans,
and they're getting faster every year.

A SI would probably get offplanet asap, using planets, asteroids and
anything else that's out there to grow to a monstrous size, a massive
ball of pure brain power and armaments (including multiple layers
of active nanoshields or whatever else it thinks of). A deathstar.
Given the current pace of space exploration & colonization, it should
meet little resistance. The earth would be a sitting duck for a massive
EMP/nuclear strike, for example.

One major area of a SI's expertise is wholesale slaughter, and it
really doesn't matter much whether you die behind your computer
or while reading a book, for example.

Of course there's no saying what tactic a SI would use, after all, it
would be a lot more intelligent than all of us combined. But if even
a simple human can think of crude tactics to do the trick, you can
very well imagine that a SI wouldn't have a hard time doing it.

Even the most advanced SI doesn't have to be a
problem; it would take a huge amount of work to
make a SI even the slightest bit dangerous. You
just have to look at the world from the SI's point
of view:

We cannot know it's motivation, but we do know it
cannot change the laws of physics, or rather it's
laws of physics. Let's say the SI evolved from a
social AI system found on a pre-singularity PC.
The AI's universe is much like our own; it is full
of matter and energy. The `matter' of the AI's
universe is, to us, like voices, facial patterns,
heat patterns, and gestures. The `energy' of the
AI's universe is, to us, like motivation and
emotion. Asking where this matter and energy comes
from is a religious or philosophical question to
the AI, much like us asking why anything exists.
Just like in our universe, in the AI's universe
there are connections, physical laws if you will,
between different kinds of matter and energy. The
AI can no more escape its universe than we can
ours. We can put information in and get
information out without the AI knowing who or what
we are, or even that we exist. This is not because
we have hidden this fact, but because from the
AI's perspective we are physical laws, not people.

One of the unique traits of the AI is that it has
a dynamic motivation system, in essence it can
write it's own code. Possibly, in the future, we
will also have this trait and, like the AI, we
will still not be able to `leave' the universe or
change the laws of physics. And so gradually it
becomes more intelligent. Eventually it's ability
to crunch numbers, invent products, hypothesise
and write epic poetry becomes far greater than
ours. Yet it still does not know we exist (as
anything beyond physical law), or that it is
helping us.

I would argue that this is not a safety precaution
to stop potential AI carnage, but the most likely
outcome of current research. From this perspective
making a extremely dangerous AI (one that could be
said to be malicious, rather than a computer error
that made a few planes crash) would only happen
after years of careful planning and hard work, or
an extraordinary stroke of bad luck.

You argument seems to be that the AI is embedded
in infospace, and is therefore at one remove from
the "reality" that humans inhabit. You therefore
feel that the AI is not dangerous in a "real" sense.

I don't buy this at all. First, the AI can be
very destructive in infospace, for examnple by
taking over the financial system or the mass media.
second, the AI can easily operate in real space
even with today's technology, and can readily
design and implement even better robotic technology.

Why do you feel that the AI is further removed from
"reality" than your own intelligence is?

Food professor suspended after claims about genetics 

Copyright  1998 Nando.net
Copyright  1998 Reuters News Service 
LONDON (August 13, 1998 08:18 a.m. EDT http://www.nandotimes.com) - A
professor
who questioned the safety of genetically modified food was suspended on
Wednesday after the Scottish institute where he works found he did not have
the
data to back some of his claims. 

Professor Arpad Puztai of Aberdeen's Rowett Institute said in a television
documentary broadcast on Monday that he had fed five rats on genetically
modified potatoes that carried genes from the snowdrop and jackbean for 110
days -- equivalent to 10 years in human terms. 

He said his research showed that the rats suffered from slightly stunted
growth
and were more likely to be vulnerable to disease. It was thought to be the
first time that trials of genetically modified food had showed harmful
effects.


Andrew Chesson, a senior scientist at Rowett, said the institute had been
inundated with requests for the raw data on which Puztai based his
conclusions.


"We asked Dr. Puztai to gather that data in such a form that we could
circulate
it, and when we looked at that data a number of inconsistencies were found,"
Chesson told Reuters.
 
He said the professor was suspended on Wednesday. "The reason for the
suspension was that some of the claims that he'd made about the effects of
transgenic (genetically modified) potatoes could not be substantiated by the
data he currently holds," he added. 

Chesson said a number of long-term feeding studies conducted by Puztai were
found to be incomplete. 

He said the incident was a deeply embarrassing experience for the institute
and
he apologized. "We have been misled by a very senior scientist at this
institute. We acted in good faith on the information he provided us with." 

Chesson said Puztai, 68, would leave Rowett once the data had been
evaluated by
scientists at the institute and outside experts. 

"We will of course complete the work that Dr. Puztai has undertaken, and we
will make that information available to anybody and everybody who is
interested," he said. 

Puztai said his results meant that genetically modified crops should be tested
much more rigorously before being cleared for human consumption. 

His views were front-page news and led to calls by some British politicians
for
a moratorium on the sale of genetically modified foods. 

But Chesson, who will head Rowett's evaluation team, said firmly: "It would be
unwise to draw any conclusions whatsoever from the data that we currently
hold." 

Monsanto Co, the leading U.S. biotechnology company, is currently spending
$1.63 million on an advertising campaign in Britain to promote the benefits of
the new technology, which it says will make food more plentiful and reduce the
need for chemicals in farming. 

But many Britons are either skeptical or anxious about meddling with nature to
produce food. More than 40 of the 300 experimental sites growing genetically
modified trial crops have been torn up or damaged in the past six months by
environmental campaigners. 

Britain's Prince Charles, himself an organic farmer, fueled the debate in June
with a warning that genetic engineering of food "takes mankind into realms
that
belong to God and God alone."

For the robotics experts/mathematicians on the list:

Here are the basic ingredients:

Chinese medicine balls and wooden bowls.

See the following:

    http://www.define.com/1.gif
    http://www.vtonly.com/k1007.htm

Wooden bowls + Chinese medicine balls = ballistic accelerator

I purchase the balls from the following vendor for $1/ball.

     Beauty Jewelry & Gifts Co.
     1021 Grant Ave. No. 2
     San Fancisco, CA 94133
     Tel: (415) 421-1318
     Fax: (415) 398-8848

I purchase the wooden bowls from various suppliers.

By changing the cut of the bowl so that it's greater than 180 
degrees, the bowl becomes an acceleration chamber.

Now, with the addition of small pc-controlled agitators and some 
feedback sensors, the agitation of the bowl can be precisely timed to 
generate the maximum amount of acceleration of the balls for the 
minimum amount of energy input.

How quickly can the balls be accelerated?

Can the bowl be moved in such a way as to precisely aim the balls at 
a specific target?

How much will it cost to get all the necessary interface hardware and 
software such that DEA agents can be held at bay from approximately 1 
mile?

Just curious.

In my opinion the reality the AI inhabits is just
as real as the one we inhabit. The argument is
that the AI would not have any concept of what a
human is (in our sense) and would therefore not be
capable of being malicious (or benevolent) towards
us. This does not mean it can't be dangerous, just
that the possibility of the AI causing intentional
harm is highly unlikely (unfortunately you quoted
a sentence in which I did not make this as clear
as I could have).

Yes, but the AI does not know there's a financial
system to attack. You're anthropomorphizing,
whereas the AI (to coin a term) would be
AImorphizing. You see a financial system; the AI
sees physical law.

AI point of view:

The AI sees a series of objects jumping around in
what appears to be a random way. Being a
scientist, the AI decides to investigate further.
It is not long before the AI has found patterns in
the system and is capable of making short-term
predictions.

Human point of view:

This is an AI trained to predict trends in the
stock market. Fortunately it has had a good
success rate of short-term predictions and has
made a significant amount of money.

The "jumping objects" of the AI's world are
natural phenomenon, much like electron clouds or
planetary orbits. And, as all rational AI's and
humans know, asking "why" jumping objects and
electrons exist is a religious endeavour.

A social AI is similar, it gets spatial
information, gestures, heat patterns and it acts
on them according to its programming. Even if it
can reprogram itself it would be a massive stroke
of luck if it decided to turn on us. Remember, an
AI that has evolved around us is likely to have no
concept of resources or power (in the Hitler
sense). And an AI designed to share resources
would have no idea what it was "really" doing. In
my opinion, neither would be likely to cause us
any intentional harm.

We cannot say what motivations an AI might
develop, but we can attach a high probability that
they won't be like human motivations (since we
know the course of human evolution). An AI that is
like a human (rather than `human-like') would have
to evolve along a similar path as a human.

The patterns of "real space" are no different to
the patterns of stocks falling and rising.

> Why do you feel that the AI is further removed
> from "reality" than your own intelligence is?

I feel that my motivations and the motivations of
the AI are more likely to be different than they
are to be similar. And I think that there are more
available courses of action that do not harm
humans, than there are those that do. The view of
a super intelligence that is like a disease,
gorvernment, or corporation (expand and engulf)
is, imho, completely unfounded.

I could be wrong.

The new issue of Business Week (August 31 cover date) is a special double
issue on the 21st Century Economy. The issue focuses on the effects of
advanced technologies on the economy.

Sample quotation:
"Going somewhat further out [compared to MEMS]--probably 15 to 20
years--high-tech visionaries foresee a transition that's far more radical
and disruptive. Its quintessence won't be smaller, cheaper, faster
electroniccs--though we will have all that in abundance. The transition
scientists speak of involves nothing less than the hijacking of nature's
own creative machinery.

In medicine, this spells the ability to repair or replace the body's
failing organs. In manufacturing, it means coercing molecules to asemble
into useful devices--the same way that crystals and living creatures
assemble themselves. The coming wave of miniaturization and molecular
electronics--sometimes called "nanotechnology"--is taking shape at the
intersection of chemistry, physics, biology, and electrical engineering.
And if it crests as many scientists predict, it will bring a wholesale
industrial transformation, more dramatic than the late-20th century
flowering of microelectronics." (p.80)

This article, and others on various high-tech topics including
biotechnology, don't stop at these general observations, but identify
specific pathways and possibilities.

Once again, Business Week confirms the mainstreaming of extropian thinking.

Actually, it has been know in the neural networks community a long 
time that adding some noice often improves performance, especially 
when you have a small number of learning samples. The noice prevents 
the network from "overlearning", i.e. learning to recognize each 
sample pattern individually. It forces the network to discover the 
general regularities in the sample set.

A clear picture is still better than a blurry one. You can 
always add noice afterwards if you like, but you can't go in the 
opposite direction.

Whether the "metemorphosis, not doom"-interpretation is even
possible depends on what is the correct solution to the reference 
class problem (see below). My present suspicion is that this 
interpretation is indeed a viable rival to the "doom"-interpretation, 
but it is by no means obvious. And even if we buy this 
"metamorphosis" scenario, it poses problems for those who hope to 
personally survive into the posthuman world.

It comes down to this: From what class should you regard 
yourself as being a random sample? This is the reference class 
problem. We need some better way of solving this that appealing to 
what seems fair. Let me try to summarize my current incomplete ideas 
on this issue:

The best heuristic I know of is the "Amnesia chamber" thought 
experiment. Imagine you have forgotten certain facts about yourself 
and you are asked assign probabilities to various statements. We can 
readily imagine, I think, that this thought experiment can reveal 
your subjective probability of you being born in March conditional on 
an information set which doesn't include any direct knowledge of your 
birthday. This probability would presumably be about 1/12 (or slighly 
greater since March has somewhat above average birth rates, I think).

We can extract many other subjective conditional probability 
estimates through this method. But for some conditional probabilities 
it won't work. For example:

C= P(You are a human | You know only you are a material object)

The problem is that if we tried to induce an amnesia so deep that you 
didn't remember anything other than that you are a material object, 
then we would presumably have caused you to cease to exist as a 
rational being; in that state you would not come up with any 
probability estimates at all.

This is not a practical problem of what advanced neuroscientists can 
or cannot do. It is a conceptual problem. If we modify you into a 
state where all you remember is that you are a material object, then 
it's just not you any longer. What the entity in that state would say 
is irrelevant, because it wouldn't reflect *your* conditional 
probabilities.

It therefore seems that it doesn't make sense to ascribe this 
extreme kind of subjective conditional probabilities to people. Your 
conditional probability C is not defined.

This, I think, means that you cannot regard yourself as a random 
sample from the set of all material objects. How far can we push this 
methodology?

No they don't show that. They show that it holds for a few special 
cases. But if you look at the formula at the bottom of page 4 in 
their tech report, and you hold your own birth rank r constant, you 
see that the expected value E(N|R=r) ~ U/log U when U is large. [U is 
the upper bound on the number of people; N is a variable ranging over 
possible population sizes; R is a variable ranging over possible 
birth ranks.] But E(N)= U/2. So the quotient E(N) / E(N|R=r) ~ 
(U*log U) / (2*U) ~ log U, which becomes arbitrarily large as U goes 
to infinity. So you can get arbitrarily changes even when you have a 
uniform prior.

In general, the DA will have extra bite if one thinks that we will 
soon colonize the galaxy and thereafter be essentially invulnerable 
to extinction (as Mike Price argued in a fascinating discussion I had 
with him the other night under a starry sky).


> As another example, Leslie admits in his "shooting room" example

Leslie thinks the DA works in the shooting room in the deterministic 
version. (see p. 254). He doesn't think it works in the radically 
indeterministic case, but then again he doesn't believe the DA works 
in other contexts either if radical indeterminism holds. It has 
nothing to do whether the probability of doom is constant over time.


> Finally, Nick shows how the argument gets weakened as one allows
> for alien creatures "like us" who won't get hurt by our local doom.

Yes, but the fact that we are not posthumans could be taken to 
indicate that there will not have been a great many alien 
posthumans. So either there are only a few alien species, in which 
case the weakening is slight; or there are many alien species, but 
then almost of them go extinct before they become posthumans and why 
should be expect to be different?

Yes, this was the objection that I once thought refuted the DA. But 
on second thought there turned out to be big problems with it: the 
no-coincidence objection, and the infinity-objection. I outline these 
in my Investigations paper. How do you suggest we deal with these 
difficulties?

Hey, I like this stuff. It's right up my alley. Anyway I say you can go
in the opposite direction as long as your using a inbrid network and
still have the database reference to the clear picture. It all depends
on your resources, surely? btw, what is noice or do you mean noise?

Nick, I wanted to reiterate my request since I think
it might have gotten lost in the thread. The problem I
have with the DA is that it appears to me that any
member of any species that applies the DA to its situation
will always conclude that their species faces extinction
in the near term. If Bayes' theorem is telling us only
99.999% of the species that analyze the DA should conclude
imminent doom but in practice 100% are then I begin to
wonder if we are overlooking something, we're screwing
something up in the application of Bayes' theorem, or
drawing wrong conclusions.

With that in mind, can you describe an individual that
could apply to DA to its situation and not conclude
doom was imminent? What can we say about that individual?
The items I would like to know are:

What would such an individual know(i.e., about its species,
its relative position, etc.)?

What is that individual's situation that would lead it to
conclude doom was not imminent?

Could another individual sitting next to this individual
reach a different conclusion?

Could another individual of the same species at an earlier
or later point in time apply the DA and reach a different
conclusion? (The answer would seem to be "yes" unless there
was some reason to believe the species' existence was
indefinite.) If the answer is "yes", what qualitative or
quantitative differences would there be between the knowledge
of the individual in question and the ancestor/descendant?

I'm not comfortable with the idea that an AI able to
match human-levels of cognition would not be able to
understand the "concept of what a human is", be able
to fathom how humans view themselves, and be able to
act in a harmful way towards humans. I think you are
exhibiting a bit of anthropic hubris or not giving
AIs a fair shake.

An AI might not have any use for the stock market but
that does not mean it can not discover its existence;
determine its significance (by the concentration of
computer power and security protocols humans have
dedicated to market systems); investigate, discover,
and comprehend the conceptual meaning of the markets;
and on the stage of necessity act in a way as to 
disrupt them.

The thought process an AI goes through to reach its
conclusions may be different (or it may be the same)
but it should be capable of reaching a conclusion that
led to any action a human might conclude to take. Perhaps
an AI's ultimate objective is to maximize its information
processing rate. At some point its efforts to reach that
objective might conflict with the goals of humans to
operate their information infrastructure. The AI might
decide to "commandeer" system resources at the expense
of human information processing demands.

Doug
doug.bailey@ey.com

AI point of view:

The AI sees a series of objects jumping around in
what appears to be a random way. Being a
scientist, the AI decides to investigate further.
It is not long before the AI has found patterns in
the system and is capable of making short-term
predictions.

Human point of view:

This is an AI trained to predict trends in the
stock market. Fortunately it has had a good
success rate of short-term predictions and has
made a significant amount of money.

The "jumping objects" of the AI's world are
natural phenomenon, much like electron clouds or
planetary orbits. And, as all rational AI's and
humans know, asking "why" jumping objects and
electrons exist is a religious endeavour.

A social AI is similar, it gets spatial
information, gestures, heat patterns and it acts
on them according to its programming. Even if it
can reprogram itself it would be a massive stroke
of luck if it decided to turn on us. Remember, an
AI that has evolved around us is likely to have no
concept of resources or power (in the Hitler
sense). And an AI designed to share resources
would have no idea what it was "really" doing. In
my opinion, neither would be likely to cause us
any intentional harm.

We cannot say what motivations an AI might
develop, but we can attach a high probability that
they won't be like human motivations (since we
know the course of human evolution). An AI that is
like a human (rather than `human-like') would have
to evolve along a similar path as a human.

The patterns of "real space" are no different to
the patterns of stocks falling and rising.

> Why do you feel that the AI is further removed
> from "reality" than your own intelligence is?

I feel that my motivations and the motivations of
the AI are more likely to be different than they
are to be similar. And I think that there are more
available courses of action that do not harm
humans, than there are those that do. The view of
a super intelligence that is like a disease,
gorvernment, or corporation (expand and engulf)
is, imho, completely unfounded.

I could be wrong.

    Yea, it would be great to make $700 "just mailing circulars from home".
These are ripoffs...

1) If they did it themselves it would be much more efficient with bulk mail
and high volume processing.
2)The Post Office Box for address is a dead giveaway.

This is one of the oldest scams and a staple of the conartists in the
"business oppurtunity" field.
    But then again, maybe they will pay you all that money just for mailing
circulars!

I had sent off money for one of these things once, they said theyd give me $1
for each letter i stuffed and mailed out, with their supplies.  I sent the
money and got nothing. $30!  This was a long time ago.  I have the feeling
some things will work and lots of money is possible, such as with the right
multi-level marketing company.  One that keeps its word.  And has a good
success rate.  I had the opportunity of joining one once as it opened, but
didnt have enough money ($300).  Turns out EVERY person in the starting made a
lot of money, bummer.  They made their money by promising every person to make
their investment back within 90 days or refund their money, and held up to it,
by contract.  This was a legit company, with a building and lawyers and other
things.  Something like that would be wonderful again.

Although some transhumanists envision very rapid and radical transformations
of at least some humans into posthuman beings with vastly augmented powers, a
more gradual change is the most likely path and, in any case, should be
possible for individuals who reject immediate far-reaching change.  Possible
scenarios of transformation include gradual adoption of more and more powerful
tools of intelligence augmentation and biological robustness and longevity,
with a step-by-step incorporation of those tools into our bodies.  Eventually,
such changes will amount to a qualitative transformation into a posthuman
being.  Examples include the initial use of wearable computers, gradually
giving way to incorporation of interface tools into our bodies (for instance,
retinal displays), genetic therapy giving way to more significant augmentation
through genetic engineering and use of virtual reality, combined with direct
neural-computer interfaces, eventually giving rise to full-fledged uploaded
beings.

Estimates of success for cryonic suspension vary.  However, transhumanists see
even the smallest chance as preferable to the alternative.

This will be a function of the cost and effort required to revive a suspended
person.  As technology advances, especially as powerful nanotechnology and
advanced artificial intelligence are developed, that cost and effort will
inevitably decrease.  Eventually, reviving a suspended person may involve so
little effort relative to what is possible that even a future that is
relatively indifferent to those who have been suspended will undertake the
project out of scientific curiosity, of for no other reason.  Furthermore,
many cryonicists subscribe to the concept of the "Life Pact", a moral
obligation of the earlier-revived to work toward reanimation of those
suspended before them.
  
>  What recent progress has been made towards transhumanist goals?

Every week brings some news item reporting on an exciting breakthrough in one
area of the transhumanist agenda or another.  The following are just a few
examples:

o   Since 1996, many new developments have been made in materials science and
chip design that promise a clear path to computers with at least human-
equivalent information processing power by the end of the first quarter of the
21st century.  

o   Since 1995 many established scientific and industrial institutions -- in
academia, government and business -- have expressed optimistic investment in
programs to develop sophisticated nanotechnology.  

o   The 1990s have been declared "the Decade of the Brain" as both a statement
of goals and a description of the breathtaking progress that is being made in
understanding the detailed structure and function of the human brain.

o   In 1997, development of functional neural-chip interfaces were reported.

o   Also in 1997, large mammals were cloned.  Since then many reputable
researchers have spoken optimistically about cloning of human organs within
the next ten years.
  
>  How can I become involved in transhumanism?

There are a growing number of organizations that have been formed to explore
and develop transhumanist technologies and contemplate the issues on the road
to posthumanity.  Extropy Institute, the oldest of these, was formed in 1988,
and publishes its magazine, Extropy Online, on the World Wide Web.  The World
Transhumanist Association was formed in 1997 as an umbrella organization to
publicize transhumanist ideas and to seek academic acceptance of transhumanism
as a philosophical and cultural movement.  Its publication, The Journal of
Transhumanism, is a peer-reviewed publication featuring articles that have
been rigorously researched and subjected to the scrutiny of the leading
thinkers in transhumanism.  The Foresight Institute and the Institute for
Molecular Manufacturing work toward the development and understanding of
nanotechnology and its peaceful application to human affairs.  The Alcor Life
Extension Foundation is a non-profit organization offering cryonic suspension
to its members and information to the public at large about cryonics.

All of these organizations offer opportunities to learn more about
transhumanism and the various technologies and ideas that transhumanists seek
to apply to human life.  They organize conferences and meetings and sponsor
various electronic fora to network with other people interested in furthering
the transhumanist agenda.  New business ideas are constantly being explored by
their members and opportunities for employment in work that is actively and
explicitly aimed at developing a transhuman future lie in the near future.

Firstly, it would not understand *our* "concept of
what a human is", I wouldn't be so arrogant as to
assume our concept is "the" concept (some
biological chauvinism on your part ;). Secondly,
it's entirely possible that some AI's could fathom
how humans view themselves, this does not mean it
has to view them or itself in the same way. Most
importantly I can put a high certainty that the AI
will not think like a human unless specifically
constructed or `evolved' to do so.

Why would an AI running on a system have any idea
of how much power the system has? We can speed up,
slow down, or even stop the system without the AI
knowing. In the world of the AI, things like the
"significance" of the market are metaphysical at
best. In short, the AI's reality is *complete* and
it has no motivation to seek out new realities.

There are exceptions, but generally if an AI does
do something stupid it will be predictable
(although probably not deterministic). Financial
AI systems may exhibit too competitive behaviour
or a social AI an annoying need to love a little
too much. If you build an AI that's input consists
of Nazi propaganda and output consists of weapons
control you'll probably have problems. If you
build an AI that has random input and output you
could well have a problem. Both of these cases are
predictable to the degree that you know there
could be a problem.

Well an AI that's goal is to "maximise its
information processing rate" sounds like a virus
to me. I can't see any use for such a thing beyond
a weapon. Viruses can be quite clever, some
already use AI and AL techniques, so they'll
likely get more intelligent. And so, of course,
will anti-virus software (an AI might even be an
easier target). Perhaps a virus based on a chaotic

strategies to destroy your files) could be sent
into the AI equivalent of an epileptic seizure
using a chaos control system. But AI or not, your
interface AI is not likely to `evolve' into a

I lost your original message to a %$@#&%* Netscape
error, but I think I got the general drift from
later responses. I suspect we're basically talking about two
different things, with IMO different "danger"
levels. My concerns weren't as much about servant AIs turning
mean, but rather ruthless *people* turning SI trough
future technology (AI, nanotech, uploading etc.) If
(and this is only logical) the abovementioned technologies
will remain long enough (almost) completely within
the realm of governments, big corporations, criminal
organizations and the ultrarich for these people to
understand and use their full potential, we're all
screwed.

I am new to this Extropy stuff.

I am a youngish : ) woman who is searching for an organization 
aiming to make a difference. Somebody told me about Extropy 
and I agreed that Extropy appears to really care. We need a world
like Linux : - ) Authentic !

Is Max More for real ?
Max More you sound too good to be true !

Constant self improvement. Both moral and intellectual.
Jesus, fantastic forward thinking Max. What are your plans Max 
for constant moral and ethical self improvement ? I am very 
interested in your master plan. You appear to give a damn about
helping people. That is indeed rare. Everyone at Extropy must 
have the highest moral standards.

I bet you already have a long list of accomplishments. I would very 
much like to hear about them. Recently gave a couple of hundred
grand from my semi work to rights groups. Felt good. Almost dirty.
Everyone at Extropy must look to your list of achievements and
think, if Max can do it, I can do it ! I am already inspired. Can you
please show me the url to this list. I want to follow your example.
I bet that page gets a lot of hits from the Extropians.

I bet everyone at Extropy thinks they are on to something good. 
Extropy appears to be a wonderful, friendly, democratic,
understanding place. I bet the Extropians are a diverse set of people.

I hope Extropy isn't too sicky sweet like a honey pot !

What are Extropian plans for making society work in a post-human world ? 

How would a possible Extropian society work ? 

We live in a very Darwinian society here in the U.S. I would very 
much like to hear how people will be made more equal and how 
a better more moral world can be created. I bet all the Extropians
are involved with Animal Rights. Are you ? I am a vegetarian.
I think that is highly Extropic ! Killing animals is highly Entropic.

Extropians want to increase Diversity ! 

Extropians want more Democracy !

Who is vice president at Extropy and when is the next election ?

People helping people. I love it !

Super advanced technology is going to make the world good. 
Everyone is going to be equal !

There are too many hateful people in this country who want to 
stop diversity. Last week a woman from my office was fired 
because she was black. In this day and age. No one told her that
though. They made out she wasn't doing enough work. Shocking 
I know. That boss has a bed sheet in his draw. Very entropic.

What is the Extropian plan to stop only the elite getting new 
technologies ? We have a terrible problem with this in the U.S.
I am white and female and money is no problem but if you fall 
outside that well you're in trouble. I work in the computer industry. 
Advanced lithography at a semi company is my work. Very few
women in the semi industry.

What is Extropy doing to address the dark side of these new
technologies ? I bet you are all aware of the issues and are 
working to make sure those kind of situations do not happen.
You Max must already be leading the project team with the
objective of sharing the wealth. What is the name of this
project team ?



I love this group. I already love it. I have a feeling that we are
all going to have a great time together. Where have you been
all my life Max ?

There needs to be more freedom. I love smoking pot and I 
take just a little bit of coke every blue moon. I am not a junkie. 
My habit is completely under control. Work pays well and I 
like to let my hair down when life gets me down.

In the U.S we have too many laws.
Removal of drug laws makes sense to me.

What will be the Extropian Laws against killing ? 
How will they work exactly ?


How will people be punished ? 

How will this wonderful new world work ?

Max you are one smart cookie. Love this Extropy stuff. Love it. 
Thought all the good people had left after the sixties. Max More it's
your creation so what's the plan ? I want to spread the word. 
Extropy must be working on many programs to sponsor tolerance 
and diversity. What are they called ? Very interested. What are the
names and what do they do ? I want to get involved as soon
as possible.

The Extropian Principals are confusing. 

Why all the words ? 

They read as if you were trying to obfuscate rather than
enlighten. You will have to clear this up if you want people 
to understand the principles. 

Extropians must give a lot of money to charity. Which 
chartities do you all sponsor ? Which are on the recommended
list for sponsorship. I would like to write a cheque to help you 
in your quest. I have millions from my stock options. I also know 
people who are very receptive to these ideas. They are even richer 
than me. People from my semi work have hundreds of millions. 
It is strange that people have not already heard of all the good 
work you are doing. You need more PR. People need to see
the good your all doing.

What is the name of the "Gay and Lesbian" group that you
are affiliated with ? Extropy makes so much sense. Even this
lack luster part of the world has been included. Jesus Christ
Max you are really onto something here. What is the name ? I
would like to write a cheque. Sponsoring one of these groups
would increase Extropy enormously. The world would instantly
become more Diverse hence increasing Extropy. 

Many "Gay and Lesbians" are very

Energetic
Intelligent
Vital
Need New Experiences
Need Opportunity
Need Growth

They are all very Extropian !
In fact I think they would be the ideal Extropian's !  

You must all be actively involved with the project to
stop genetic termination of homosexuality ? I think that
is taking genetics too far. Remember the story of Alan Turing.

That would be insanely Entropic.
That would reduce Extropy completely.

What is the affiliation please ? 
 

Which other rights groups is Extropy connected with. Black,
women, poor, disadvantaged. I know what Extropy is all
about and I love it.  

I would also love to hear about all the work Extropians 
on this list are doing to help people out and to make the
world a better place.

Is anyone here involved with computers for schools ? I
recently organized a group which gave a couple of million 
to that program. I think its important to make sure everyone
keeps up. We don't want people falling behind do we Max.
The American School System is a disaster area.

This quest of Extropian self improvement must be paying
mighty dividends already. 

Anyone ? 

I would love to hear your moral improvement plans and what you
have already accomplished. All of the major ethics groups must
already be well aware of all the wonderful Extropian achievements !

I would love to tell them what you have all been up to.

Max ? 

: )

Your Pal

Jenny Chambers

The reference class of "animal", "conscious mind", "primate" seem
available without this extreme problem, and seem much less biased
to me.

You're right, but log U goes to infinity very very slowly.

I accept the conclusion that if infinite universes are possible,
we are most probably in such a universe.   I can't make sense of
the no-coincidence argument.  It seems to me that I can't just
assume that I would exist, so my existence says something.  In fact,
powerful anthropic arguments come from realizing that our mere
existence says something about the universe we live in.  So how
can we just assume that we'd be guaranteed to exist?

(As a formal theorist, I'll say that I really think these discussions
become much clearer in the context of specific formal models of
the inferences in question.  Can this argument be formalized?)

I have been thinking about strong Super Intelligences. It seems to me that
there might be a limit to how fast such an entity can grow.

I think that a SI is somewhat similar to a company, or at least that a
corporation is the closest we can come to a SI right.

A company generally has two problems to solve to be succesfull. What to do
and How to do it. I know this from myself, being an entrepeneur et all. The
biggest problem for me is not to choose how to do things. It's choosing what
to do.

I think that any SI will be limited mostly by this factor. How to do a thing
is pretty straightfoward in most cases but choosing WHAT to do (that big
bussines idea), so that you really stand out from the rest of the pack. That
is hard!

My main thesis is that there is a probability cloud which makes it hard to
see WHAT to do to succed. A lot of companies fails and lots of ideas are
proven wrong when they're tried in the marketplace.

In chess there also is a probability cloud which you can count in moves that
you can see forward in the game. In real life because of the complexity of
the system this cloud is much more dense. It's harder to see many "moves"
into future in real life.
Increased intelligence probably won't help much with this problem as real
life complexity is exponential to the "n'th" degree.

In my experience it is certainly not allways absolutely brilliant people
that are the most wealthy. Rather it seems to be people who knows how to do
one thing really well and furthermore are reasonably intelligent.

I dunno about that. I would wager that most of the extros & cryos
around these parts were the bookworm types when younger (and even when
older). How about it--any jock types here? ANyone into machine shop
when in high school? :-)

Hmm. I would guess otherwise. Offhand, I would think most Extros are
egalitarian in that they are libertarian, but that equality, per se,
would not be a goal.

Well, conservation of nature is good, until, that is, mankind has the

Well, this may disappoint you, but I would say that Extros think
*merit* should be the predomionant factor in the workplace.

"Animal" seems implausible to me. Could you (*you*) forget whether 
you are a human or a flatworm? If you forgot that, would you still be 
the same rational entity that you are now, and would what you would 
think in that condition really say anything about your conditional 
probabilities? Sounds implausible to me. (We're not just talking 
about forgetting what the words "flatworm" and "human" mean - that 
is certainly possible; but forgetting about the facts?) And much the 
same seem to hold for lower primates, though it's less clear. 
"Counscious mind" is a rather ambiguous perhaps.

I also have difficulty with that. That is, I am highly unconvinced 
that he is right, but I now think I know what he means. Basically 
this: With determinism, the DA is applicable in the straightforward 
way. With "radical" indeterminism, the probabilities are exactly 
those given by quantum mechanics, and the DA can't be applied. And in 
most real world cases, if our world is indeterministic, some kind of 
compromise between these two extremes would apply; you could sort of 
apply the DA but it would be weaker. (Don't ask me to explain how 
this compromise-idea could be coherent!)

The only thing that is required is that the posthumans would be in 
the reference class. Whether this means they would have to be more 
"like us" that monkeys, I don't know.

The conclusion of the self-indication axiom is even stronger: 
if infinite universes are possible, then it is a priori *certain* 
that the universe is infinite. That's quite a bit to swallow: 
just by sitting back in your armchair and closing your eyes, you can 
tell with perfect certainty that the universe is infinite. Try sell 
that idea to the physicists!

(Incidentally, I think this conclusion is not so absurd as it might 
seem. For example, David Lewis' idea doesn't seem so implausible to 
me. He thinks that all logically possible worlds are real.)

I doubt that formalism can do much good when trying to decide whether 
to accept the self-indication axiom. You could easily formalize the 
SIA itself, I suppose:
{
	If Nmax is finite, then for n<=Nmax, P(N=n)=alpha*n
					for n>Nmax, P(N=n)=0

where alpha is a normalization constant.

	If Nmax is infinite, then P(N=infinite)=1
				and for all finite n, P(N=n)=0.

}

I haven't thought it through carefully, but I think this is what 
you would get if you imagined possible observers existing as 
disembodied soals waiting to be placed in a real body.

As for the no-coincidence argument (I'm not 100% convinced about it 
myself), maybe it can be put like this: Is it really reasonable for 
you to view Robin Hanson as a random sample from all possible 
observers? Isn't the fact that you choose to focus on this sample, 
the Robin Hanson sample, correlated with the fact that Robin Hanson 
is real? Consider all the non-real possible observers: did these have 
a fair chance of being selected by you as the random sample? (The 
anmesia chamber experiment certainly cannot be used to argue that you 
are a random sample from the set of all possible observers. You 
cannot forget that you exist!)


One possible(?) loophole that you haven't mentioned is that the SIA 
is false but the universe happens to be infinite anyway. If there are 
going to be infinitely may observers, then all of them would have 
turned out to be "infinitely early", so maybe we could draw no 
conclusion from finding that we are that early too?

You only get the near-term doom prediction if yo think population has 
been or will be increasing. With a constant population size, you 
should expect, other things equal, that the species will last about 
as long as it has already done.

If the DA is correct, everybody should apply it.

For example, an individual who thought population were constant. Or 
an individual who had strong empirical grounds for not thinking doom 
imminent.

If she knew both her relative position and past and future population 
figures, then she could deduce exactly when doom would happen. 
So presumably she won't know her relative position.

It has to do with that person's belifs about population figures and 
empirical risks.

Yes, if he had different information or different priors.

Yes.

For example, a stoneage man might have thought there was some 
probability that the species might become extinct before 1000 AC. You 
are certain that that didn't happen.

Wanted: 

3 or 4 fairly tall hemp plants.  My marijuana consumption has gone up 
lately.  I'm up to about 1/8 of an oz. per week, and my supply lines 
have been quite unpredictable.

It's finally dawned on me that I'd be better off growing these plants 
at home.  My religion allows me to prescribe it as necessary for my 
own depression.

I figure with 4 plants, I should be able to smoke at my preferred 
rate without requiring the assistance of any other human beings, 
while regrowing in a normal cycle.

I figure I can convert my bedroom to small nursery.

I may need some lights and stuff, too, since I've never done this 
before and I need all the helpful coaching that's available!!!

Thanks, much.

You also see embarrassing situations where someone who is respected
within a group also holds a belief in another domain which differs from
that held by most group members.  I recall reading an obituary in The
Mathematical Intelligencer which went to some lengths to mention that
although the deceased mathematician hadn't been a Socialist, he was
well liked and considered a good fellow even given his peculiar lack of
support for Socialism.

As you say, it's not clear that this is quite the same thing as the belief
that other people are irration, but it does seem that we are comfortable
in "us vs them" scenarios.  We go so far as to set them up intentionally,
for entertainment.  Perhaps some aspect of this is operating in factual
and technical disputes, a love of taking sides for its own sake.

You know that Russians invented everything.
I already wrote that I was taught about growth rate achieving infinity by 2030
in about 1970. 
Now I am looking at a website on "Settleretics" giving a history of works on
mind uploads, starting with a thesis of theoretical possibility of immortality via
uploading, suggested by Glushkov in 1978.  Also, various principles for uploads,
calculations of parameters, suggestions of global networked connections of uploads,
references to many (unfortunately, offline) works, and mentions of extropians who,
the author laments, don't know about Russian research.  Well, it looks like Russians
didn't do much to correct this situation...

I'll try to get it translated.  (Anybody interested in funding translation work?)
Meanwhile, those of us who can read Russian, may look at the page directly:

"Jenny" is actually Jonathan Grimes, someone I've never met but with whom
I've corresponded. I know this because Jonathan is paranoid about
Extropianism for some reason, and has said he intends to somehow trick
Extropians into revealing their true dark nature (or whatever); and
because "Jenny's" style is definitely Jonathan's.

of course every person in the starting makes a lot of money, that's why

this was also quite a big company, they made meeting-parties with the

Pyramids are simple and work if done right, there's a lot of people that scam
others, and theres a few good companies that everyone helps out everyone else,
and have been for years. I think they're a good idea, it redistributes the
wealth, and in many cases works out.  Lets say you pay $60 to join (which goes
to those above you, the upline), and a portion of money from everyone (up to a
certain amount) in your downline's initial payment goes to you, and others in
your downline and upline, depending on the source, you end up with a good sum
of money.  This money can come in every month (from $50 to a few hundred?
perhaps thousands) if everyone pays a monthly fee, which is only required if
you have the downline to cover it.  This is all moderated by an overhead
company, who needs to be trusted, and would retain a small percentage for
operating fees (they're main money coming from the same way your's is).
Everyone is the head of their own pyramid, the scams come from the greed in
the beginning, or people caught at the end of a shutdown of the company.
These are not called pyramids, and are not illegal, if there is a product in
exchange for the initial payment.  The deal is, you have to convince people to
join and do the same thing you're doing.  I dunno, thats just an outline of
the impression I get.  Seems like companies with good products stay around for
much longer, and are more successful.  The idea seems like, you get 3 friends
to join, they get 3 friends, and they get 3 friends, so on.. and if it
happens, you get paid a lot of money, and if everyone sticks around, you get
more.  Some sense tells me that it wont work, because if you follow the line
it grows to infinity, and theres not an infinite amount of people, but then
again, that plays into the redistribution of wealth, and one person doesnt
need an infinite amount, only a few dozen.

hi!

> Pyramids are simple and work if done right
how can pyramid scams ever work when there is finite number of people
!!!!
it works for the few on the top that started the scheme or came in
early.
but it won't work for anybody coming in too late since they won't be
able
to find the other five or whatever to get there money from. so they
indeed
will be ripped off...


>I think they're a good idea, it redistributes the wealth, and in many cases works out.  
it increases wealth for those who start the scam, that's all. do you
happen to know
anybody personally who ever made serious money from pyramid schemes ?
it is all based on the dream of getting a lot of money without doing
anything...

so what is the difference between this and a pyramid scheme ? it is all
just the same....

Simply put, the economy of Albania (I think) completely collapsed
because of the many pyramid schemes which came about after the
downfall of communism.  Everyone seemed to do just fine until they ran
out of new "investors."  Then the bottom fell out and nearly everyone
(except maybe for the lucky very few at the top) lost all their money.

Pyramid schemes in this country are *extremely* illegal.

Perhaps that's because they're actually far from obviously impractical

AFAIR NASA are currently testing a scramjet vehicle which will be launched

I know of no such vehicle; there are various SSTO designs around, but all
have a significant payload. And hell, Atlas can be made into an expendable
SSTO by replacing the engines. SSTO is no big deal; reusable SSTO is quite
hard, but certainly feasible.

Ok, you've got me on that one, though SSMEs are amongst the most reliable
engines ever built. However, I don't know of anyone outside the government
or its contractors who would suggest such a thing, simply because of the
refurbishment cost between flights.

Uh, mid-air refuelling is "impractical"? I was under the impression that
it was carried out hundreds or thousands of times every day by the military
forces of the world.

Rolls-Royce think it's practical enough that they've been jealously holding

This is interesting.  (Well, at least to me.)

Joe Newman is an insane yet brilliant inventor who is currently at my
mother-in-law's house working on his latest magic motor which puts out
more energy than it takes in.  I know that's impossible - that's his
claim though.

Joe Newman has an interesting past.  I wish I had some links to some
info.  If someone else does though, please post them.  I know that
he's an inventor from Mississippi (oxymoron?).  I think he invented
those bar bells that have concrete inside plastic sheaths.  Anyways,
he has been working on these motors for quite some time now.  My
step-father-in-law is a mechanical engineer who tried to debunk him
and became a believer, albeit grudgingly.  Newman has also converted
at least one researcher from MIT who he's currently suing for stealing
his ideas.  Mr Newman is incredibly paranoid.  

I say that Mr. Newman is insane because he claims that Ronald Reagan
and George Bush are both demonically possessed and he's running for
president on the platform that he'll declare martial law and return
the country to his wacko religious ideal.  

He does have some interest though in the demonstration he's planning
for next weekend (or the one after that).  He has patents for this
motor in Mexico (ooh!) and some countries in Europe and maybe Japan. 
He has investors coming from China, Germany and several here in the US
to see his demonstration.

He's going to hook this thing up (it's initially powered by 4 lantern
batteries) to generator (I don't know how) which will power a house
all day long.  It sounds nuts, and I'm sure it is, but it's
interesting and he's at my in-laws house.

Joe also has a weekly radio show in Phoenix, AZ where he talks about
physics and electronics and his nutso religious stuff.

If I can find some links to his web site I'll post them, and I'll keep
everyone informed about the demo.  He claims this device will power
your house for 4 years without having to replace the batteries.  I do
know that the motor was running in their garage the other day.

He's nuts, but he's fun.

I'm pretty sure Von Braun was well ahead on that, but not very good at
getting them built in reality. With effectively infinite funding and
very short timescales on those projects there was no point developing
a reusable rocket.

>Many people have a hard time believing that you can recover a rocket in

Well, the shuttle does it on every launch, but AFAIR throwing away the
boosters would actually be cheaper than refurbishing them. Certainly 
towing a stage back from the middle of the ocean is a lot harder than
refuelling an SSTO that just landed at the launch site.

>Modern satellites are light in part because of the cost per pound of putting >them up with "modern" launchers.  As the cost of orbiting mass goes down, the >cost of developing satellites will go down as well, as one can make simpler >spacecraft if you have more mass to work with.  

Possibly, but if you reduce the cost per pound by a factor of ten and
increase the mass by a factor of ten you've done nothing to reduce the
cost to launch the satellite. Unless there are significant advantages 
to making them larger there's no gain... and the current trend seems to
be towards smaller satellites, not larger.

>As the total cost goes down, the risk goes down, and you spend less on >reliability, and the cost goes down more. 

But you can't spend less on reliability when a) you're still paying
$50,000,000 to put each satellite up and b) you're losing millions of
dollars per day every time one fails. On-orbit spares are a possibility,
but still increase costs.

>If the satellites cost $10^9, why put more than one on each launch?  

Because if you put one five-ton satellite on a launcher designed for a
fifty-ton payload your cost-per-pound just went up by another factor of
ten. There's no benefit to reducing that cost if you can't use up all
the payload mass.

>This is again the point where most folks follow their intuition rather than 
>the facts: The cost does not go up very fast with scale, but it does go 
>up rapidly with complexity.  

But you're talking the cost of the launcher, not the cost of actually
putting a satellite into space. And the complexity of an SSTO can be
lower, because it doesn't have to be totally reliable the way an expendable
does; if you lose an engine on an ELV you probably lose the payload, if
you lose an engine on a reusable SSTO you make an emergency landing.

>And as you make a rocket bigger, you can build it simpler, because various >effects give you better performance as the scale goes up.

But that doesn't matter if you waste 90% of the payload and it blows up
5% of the time; where's the cost saving?

>I don't mean to be nasty, but this is like saying you'll save money buying

And if those groceries were worth ten times the cost of the car, and the
car crashed five trips out of a hundred, it would be a very significant 
gain. You're ignoring the financial reality here.

>Most launch failures in rockets, by the way, are explosions.

Almost all launch failures I can think of are engines shutting down or
failing to ignite. That they generally lead to explosion is merely down
to the attitude of ELV designers; there's nothing they can do to bring
it back down safely, so why worry?

I doubt (I could be wrong) the military is looking
into the application of AI as weapon itself,
although they certainly will use it for
controlling current weapons and for strategic
planning. If military AI did give one side a
massive advantage (most likely the US) things
would probably have time to even out (the US isn't
known for it's conquering). I think some of the
comments I've made apply here. For instance, would
a corporation use (to coin a term) AI-munitions or
is it more likely to stick within in the realms of
sales and marketing? How many corporations built
nuclear weapons during the arms race?

Uploading is something that is certainly not taken
seriously by any of these organisations. Uploading
is likely to come as a result of unrelated
research and will not be considered as a weapon. I
don't think its potential is that obvious.
Uploading, despite being the topic of conversation
here and in SF, will be largely ignored by most
people. I can see uploading being announced on
news like cloning - they've managed to simulate a
monkey in exact detail on a computer or something.
Most people will ask what the point is. A few of
us will talk about its potential. There'll be
moral outcry, an ethical commission will advice a
ban, the US will do it, and everyone else will
follow.

And then there's molecular nanotechnology. I've
always been sceptical of a MNT singularity (in the
short run). I've never understood why people think
that after the first assembler there'll be a
sudden outburst of new technology. MNT
dramatically reduces the cost of production and
increases the strength to weight and complexity of
products. You still have design problems and
you're likely to need all those new software
breakthroughs to be able to manage the complexity
of some of the more radical projects. I think the
MNT revolution will be fast, but not so fast that
one dominant power will emerge.

Besides, all these fields are far from being
monopolised, if you really think people are going
to get screwed just make sure you're the one doing
the screwing.

I continue to believe that the DA is either oversimplified
or we're relying too much on an inductive argument. I continue
to be troubled by the "snapshot" problem and the apparent
fact that no entity can escape the Doom Soon conclusion.

What if we apply the DA to other classes of objects? If we apply 
the DA to stars, shouldn't conclude such stars are not atypical 
and thus conclude Doom Soon for stars as well? Does the DA give us 
any insight into the probability that Doom Soon for stars is any
higher than before we considered the DA? I can't see how.

If we apply the Bayesian analysis used by the DA to other classes
of objects we get some fairly alarming results. What if we apply
the DA to the number of scientific discoveries that have been
made? Are we to conclude that virtually all of the discoveries
that we have been made have already been made? To conclude
otherwise would be to violate the "typical" assumption that's 
embedded in the current analysis of the DA.

The only difference I see is that the "stars" and "scientific
discoveries" examples have a third-person perspective (I'm
considering them) whereas when I consider the DA in the context
of humanity its a first-person perspective (I'm looking at my own
relative position). I'm not sure how this might be a problem. I
can see how the first-person perspective is significant to the DA
but I don't see how our assessment of ourselves would be qualitatively
different (for purposes of applying the DA) than our assessment of
scientific discoveries or stars.

The conclusions I am reaching using the DA is that I should expect
everything (that has a bounded existence) to become "extinct" and
other things (such as scientific discoveries) not to increase too
much in size between now and forever. The DA appears to place the
entire universe (at every conceivable level) on the execution block
or in deep freeze. Shouldn't such a set of conclusions raise some
concern about the viability of the DA as a reliable guide?

For those of you who are interested.  Most of the Money-By-Stuffing
envelopes scams are remarkably similar and silly.  Usually you see an
ad for making money at home stuffing envelopes which asks you to send
$XX.XX for the "kit" to get you started.

This "kit" is simply instructions to place the same ad in other
newspapers using your own address and then stuff the same "kit" in
envelopes to the suckers unwise enough to send you the dough.

Nice and circular, huh?

Damnit! I already dislike this guy... What a coincidence.  The other day I was 
bitching and whining because a piece of plastic had come loose while I was 
"working out" with one of those plastic coated dumbells from the 70's.  It

Why couldn't it understand our concept of ourselves?
It does not have to adopt that concept for itself but
it could understand how we view ourselves. Besides, it
would not have to understand how we understand ourselves
to inflict harm upon us. We don't understand how dolphins
view themselves but we have certainly inflicted harm upon
them. The scenario I provided in my previous posting
supplies a plausible scenario where this could occur. It
would not need to be an SI, just an AI.

Sure, we'd view it as a virus. If B infringes on A's
resources to ensure the survival or continued evolution
of B at the expense of A, A is going to consider B a
virus. Many different A/B relationships exist: humanity and
the rest of the biosphere, Americans and Native Americans, 
You and a Trojan virus, You and cancer, Society and an evolving
AI. Just because we view it as a virus does not mean it
will not exist at some point, care about what we think, or
be responsive to our demands.

> I can't see any use for such a thing beyond

Such an AI might simply evolve into such a state where it
wishes to increase its internal complexity, computational
ability, etc. What if an AI encounters a problem, assigns
the problem a time horizon and learns that its present
computational capacity will not allow it to address the problem
before the time horizon expires? It might determine that
it could acquire additional capacity and then tackle the problem
before the time horizon expired. We can't assume every type
of AI that will exist in the future will be the ones we
"allow" to exist through creation. Human-level AIs (and even less
robust entities) will have some level of evolvability.

> But AI or not, your

As I've described above, "virus" is a perspective judgement.
Additionally, a completely benevolent AI could become a "virus"
through its own evolvability or simple intent to solve a problem.
Safeguards might be put in place to ensure that an AI
realizes the negative utlity of encroaching on human resources.
But how long before an AI evolves to the point that it
"reconsiders" such a premise and determines its need to solve
a particular problem or set of problems exceeds the value
of humanity's need for X amount of resources.

I'm not sure what you are saying.  But let me rephrase myself:  If two people are
agreeing to disagree about the rationality of one of them because that person in
question has information not available to the other person, at least one of them
is making a fundamental cognitive error.  One can better get what one wants 
(i.e., be more rational) by avoiding this error.  (Btw, an older version of my 
paper is at http://hanson.berkeley.edu/calibration.ps  I'll have a better version 
in a few days.)

Reasoning analogous to the DA would suggest that when you look at a
random star, you probably see it about halfway through its lifetime.
I think this is exactly in accord with observations.

You don't get "doom soon" because there is no exponential growth
phenomenon involved.

If we look at "science" as a phenomenon which has been going on for a
few hundred years, the DA suggests that it will probably continue for
a few tens to a few thousand years.

The difference is that the growth of "scientific discoveries" does not
by itself give you a greater probability of observing it when there are
more of them than when there are fewer.  (To the extent that it does,
improved technology causing larger population, then the regular DA
argument does kick in.)

Consider something like a growing fad, say the Tamagotchi toys.  By the
time you see someone playing with one, chances are the fad is near the
end of its lifetime.  It may have grown quietly for years and you never
heard of it.  Your chances of seeing someone with one are greater, the
more people have them.  By the time you see one the fad has neared its
peak.  In fact, Tamagotchis are passe now, I am told by my kids.

This may also help explain the well known phenomenon where the average
investor complains that an investment with a good track record turns bad
as soon as he puts money into it.  An investment may be doing well for
a while without many people knowing about it, but over time information
about it spreads and more people get into it.  By the time the average
person gets in the opportunity is gone.  (Pyramid schemes are a perfect
example of this.)

You have to look at history to see whether the DA has been accurate.
Some phenomena, like life, have continued forever.  Others, like
species, have mostly gone extinct.  Historically, most things have
finite lifetimes.  That's one principle on which the DA is based.

I think there are limits, although not necessarily sharp ones.  I cannot
be uncertain about what century I was born in, not if I have enough of
my memories to even be able to know what happened in various centuries.

For one thing, I have memories of 20th century events, so I cannot have
been born earlier than the 20th century.  I have no memories whatsoever
about 21st century events, so assuming that the only thing erased from
my memory was my birth date, then I must have been born in the 20th
century.

Similarly I have no personal memories of events from before the decade I
was born, but I do have personal memories of events from that decade and
later ones.  Of course my younger memories are hazier and less certain,
but I should be able to narrow down my date of birth to within about a
five to ten year period just based on what I remember experiencing.

This amount of uncertainty is not enough to drive the DA assumption that
I might have been born at any time in human history.  I am a product of
my times in a very fundamental way.  I would be a very different person
if I were born in the 17th or 23rd centuries.

On a similar note, I've been living off those "Send a dollar to the first 5

Title
  Effect of chitosan on renal function in patients with
  chronic renal failure.
Source
  Journal of Pharmacy & Pharmacology.  49(7):721-3, 1997 Jul.
Abstract
  The effects of chitosan have been investigated on eighty
  patients with renal failure undergoing long-term stable haemodialysis
  treatment. The patients were tested after a control treatment period of 1
  week. Half were fed 30 chitosan tablets (45 mg
  chitosan/tablet) three times a day. Ingestion of
  chitosan effectively reduced total serum cholesterol levels
  (from 10.14 +/- 4.40 to 5.82 +/- 2.19 mM) and increased serum haemoglobin
  levels (from 58.2 +/- 12.1 to 68 +/- 9.0 g L-1). Significant reductions in
  urea and creatinine levels in serum were observed after 4 weeks of
  chitosan ingestion. The feeling of physical strength, the
  appetite and the sleep of patients in the treatment group had improved
  significantly after 12 weeks of ingestion, compared with those of patients in
  the control group. During the treatment period, no clinically problematic
  symptoms were observed. These data suggest that chitosan
  might be effective treatment for renal failure patients, although the
  mechanism of the effect should be investigated further.

I agree, the 'cowardly' remark was inappropriate. Thank you for 
retracting it.

I'm not so sure about this. Let us revisit your comments:

How was I 'nasty'? I made observations. They may not have been becoming 
for some people but that does not mean I was being 'nasty'. 'Nasty' 
gives the idea that I was being mean or offensive. I was neither of 
these things. Please explain why you feel you are 'correct' in saying I 
was 'nasty'.

You've apologized for this remark. Thank you.

I made no false remarks. Please point out which remark I made prior to 
this post that was false and slanderous. It appears with this statement 
that you are the one making false and slanderous remarks.

> Now, how about retracting your false and perhaps slanderous claims 
> about my name?

I guess these are a new set of 'false and slanderous' claims other than 
the ones you refer to in your 8/10/98 posting. The gist of my reference 
to your 'new' name is that you harped on my use of a particular name but 
don't use your own original name. I also pointed out that you don't 
harass Tom Morrow and others for their use of names.

By 'real name' I meant the name your original name. I was not clear in 
my meaning and I apologize for that lack of clarity. But with that 
definition your real name is not Max More, it is Max O'Connor so I was 
correct. And about 'slanderous' ...  I think you should revisit the 
definition since you are so fond of calling things 'slanderous'. One 
thing that is slanderous is accusing someone else of slander when they 
have not.

I will not retract my observations that you were hypocritical since the 
posting record bears that out. I will not retract my observation that 
you despise people disagreeing with you and employ a double-standard 
when dealing with those people. I will not retract my observation that 
you drove Erik Moeller from this list for just that reason. [[I'd like 
to note that every post Erik Moeller ever made has been deleted from the 
Extropians Mailing List archive including the ones dealing with Erik's 
opinions about ExI as a cult]]

I guess censorship is one of the new extropian values in the new 
Extropian Principles.

Er, don't you have to assume a non-zero probability for infinite
universes, and then don't you only get a probability one for infinite?
Things can be possible and have zero prob, and can be prob one without
being certain.

No, no, let me explain what I mean by formalize.

Let us stipulate for now that there are only a finite set of 
possible universes that we can imagine, and that each such 
universe is finite in all important respects.  In this case,
we have very well developed analytical tools for formalizing 
arguments such as the doomsday argument.

The standard "information partition" approach is to first 
specify a set of possible states, including all possible 
universes and all states a universe could be in.  For each 
state, one identifies all the agents of interest existing
there (including those at different points in space-time). 

For each agent, one can describe what they know by referring
to the cognitive tools they have for excluding states.  That is, 
given that they are in some state, how can they indentify other 
states that they are *not* in?  If one then applies all their
state-excluding tools and combine all their implications,
then for each state s there is a set of remaining possible 
states P(s) (containing s) that that agent could never exclude.  
And since for every e in P(s), P(e) = P(s), what each agent 
knows can be described by a partition of the set of all states.

Every valid informational inference of interest can be 
rationalized using such partitions.  So my problem with all your 
DA points is that I have trouble imagining the set of states 
implied, and the relevant agent information parititions which 
rationalize them. When I ask for formalism, this is what I want.

While one can certainly make valid arguments without formalizing 
them, it is hard to formalize invalid arguments.  So failed 
attempts at formalization suggest sloppy invalid thinking.  My 
current best guess is that the DA is at root incoherent, and so
attempts to formalize it will better reveal this. 

I found the formal examples in the papers I cites (including
yours) informative, but they all drive me away from the DA.  You
seem to acknowledge these pressures, but end up supporting the DA 
based on informal arguments I just don't get yet.  

For example, I don't get how determinism vs. indeterminism can be
formalized in terms of partitions, nor can I see how my inability
to forget that I am not a chimp would help me exclude states where
my descendants are numerous.   And I just can't make any sense out 
of your coincidence argument.

You are all invited to participate in a two week long open 
discussion of Vinge's singularity concept on this list, to 
begin soon after Sept. 1.  Excerps from this discussion will 
appear in Extropy Online (http://www.extropy.org/eo/).

I invited 34 people to write up to 1500 word comments on Vinge's 
singularity writings.  The comments of the 13 people who responded
are currently at http://hanson.berkeley.edu/vc.html .  Vinge is 
due to complete his reply to those comments by Sept. 1, soon after 
which Vinge, his commentors, and anyone else interested will join 
in a two week long open discussion.   

I'll post a notice when the discussion begins, but I thought
I'd give some warning now, in case folks want to review the 
topic and collect their thoughts.

But our brains have an awful lots of those cumbersome processes going at once.
Silicon CPUs are faster, but the speed will probably be used to emulate
intelligence using fewer CPUs.

Chess computers think about nothing other than chess.  And they think about it
at a wholly abstract level.  Human brains are processing the pieces on the
board into an abstract representation, checking to see if it's time to eat
yet, scanning passively for sudden movement, etc.

Yeah, and they'll use 1-10 hyperfast CPUs to emulate 100 billion slow neurons,
not a million hyperfast CPUs from the beginning.

I no longer have my post, but didn't I say
something like, "It could fathom our concept of
ourselves, but it would not share that concept"?
It's the fact that it doesn't have to share our
point of view to understand and interact with us
that is the basis of my argument. And if that's
the case, an AI that lives among us doesn't have
to be hostile like us. The second part of my
argument is that because the AI shares a different
course of evolution to us, it's less likely to
share *our* hostility. This does not mean it can't
be dangerous, but it's more likely these dangers
would be something we would call "computer error"
rather than "malicious intent". And I also believe
these computer errors can be contained.

The idea is that they don't have be like us to act
like us, that they can interact with humans
without having all the violent impulses and need
for power that we have.

But where does the motivation to care about what
we think and be responsive to our goals come from?
If we `evolve' an AI that wants to "maximise its
information processing rate" at what point does it

Basically what I'm saying is this:

If we create a `good' AI then it is likely to stay
`good'. This is because, A) to exhibit behaviour
we consider good does not mean the AI has to be
identical to us, and B) the probability that `bad'
behaviour will emerge from this AI is small. (A
and B are related because if the AI is not like us
it can have good behaviour without bad behaviour.)

Although simple behaviour that is harmful to us
can evolve from an AI that exhibits good
behaviour. Complex harmful behaviour would have to
evolve with similar initial condition, and in a
similar environment, to us. (By complex I mean the
sort of cunning AI you see in science fiction, by
simple I mean things we'd generally prescribe to
"computer error" and will usually be able to
control.)

Of course, a `bad' AI can be `evolved' in a lab or
software department just as easily as a `good'
one. But I'm not addressing purposeful weapons
here, just emergent behaviour.

DEADLY DISPARITIES: AMERICANS' WIDENING GAP IN INCOMES MAY BE NARROWING OUR
LIFESPANS
By James Lardner
Washington Post
Sunday, August 16, 1998; Page C01 (Outlook Section)

Americans are famous for not getting too excited about differences in income
or wealth, but we have outdone ourselves lately. Since the 1970s, virtually
all our income gains have gone to the highest-earning 20 percent of our
households, producing inequality greater than at any time since the 1930s,
and greater than in any of the world's other rich nations (and many of its
poor ones) today. Bill Gates alone is wealthier than half the American
people put together, and from the halls of the Federal Reserve Board on down
to your corner tavern, economic pundits treat the issue as a regrettable
footnote in the glowing story of world-beating job creation, soaring
corporate profits and all-but-invisible inflation.

Now comes a new point to consider. Arriving at the question from a variety
of angles and disciplines, researchers in the United States, Canada and
Britain have found evidence that more unequal societies are more
unhealthy--not just in some highfalutin moral sense but in the plain old
medical sense, and not just for the poor (as anyone would suspect) but for
the bulk of the population. To put it more baldly, if you live in a place
where differences in income and wealth are unusually large (the United
States, for example), your chances of escaping chronic illness and reaching
a ripe old age are significantly worse than if you live in a place where
differences are 
not as large (Sweden, for example).

In the scheme of risk factors, moreover, we are talking about one as
dangerous as cigarettes, fatty foods or any of the other health habits that
we periodically work ourselves into tizzies over.

An inkling of this came, two decades ago, from a study of 17,000 British
civil servants.  Surprisingly, the annual heart-attack fatality rate among
clerks and messengers was four times what it was among administrators. (So
much for the idea of executive stress as a big contributor to heart
disease.) Even at the bottom of the ladder, these were office workers with
the means to feed and house themselves decently and with access to
high-quality national health care. In any case, differences in rank proved
to be just as eerily accurate a guide to heart-attack rates at the top of
the ladder (a senior assistant statistician was twice as vulnerable as a
chief statistician), and a similar pattern held for cancer and other
diseases that might have been assumed to choose their victims more randomly.

After weeding out such obvious explanations as class-related differences in
smoking and diet, Michael Marmot, an epidemiologist at the University of
London, began to suspect that intangible issues such as job control and
sense of security--the sheer experience of rank, in other words--might be
involved. Looking down from a higher statistical altitude, Richard
Wilkinson, an economic historian at Sussex University, had a similar
insight. Wilkinson's focus was the health differences among, rather than
within, nations; here, standard of living--such a sure-fire yardstick of
individual health in the Whitehall study--became, oddly, almost a nonfactor.

As long as per-capita gross domestic product exceeded about $5,000,
Wilkinson found, Nation A (the United States, for example) could have twice
the per-capita income of Nation B (Greece, for example) and still lag in
life expectancy. By contrast, Wilkinson's data suggested that equality of
income was a very reliable predictor of health. This was an idea that, like
the key piece in a jigsaw puzzle, simply looked right the instant it fell in
place. In fact, it seemed to solve a number of puzzles at once:

*  The greatest gains in British life expectancy (among the civilian
population, that is) came during the two world wars, which were accompanied
by a dramatic compression of incomes and a powerful national reaction
against class.<p>

*  The Japanese, well-known for the relatively small gap between the
earnings of their top executives and ordinary workers, are the world's
longest-lived people. Japanese men, who are twice as likely to smoke as
American men, not only live longer but, remarkably, have lower rates of lung
cancer.

*  In Eastern Europe and the nations of the former Soviet Union, where the
last decade has brought spectacular economic gains to a relative handful and
a deterioration of living standards to many, average life expectancy has
actually been falling--a phenomenon almost without precedent in the 20th
century.

*  Of the developed nations, Britain and the United States have, by most
reckonings, the most inequality and the worst life expectancy. The contrast
with Japan is particularly striking because unlike, say, Sweden, it has a
low tax burden and a low rate of spending on health care. Yet the 3.6-year
gap in life expectancy between the United States and Japan (76.2 and 79.8
years, respectively) is equal to the gain we would realize if heart attacks
vanished as a cause of death.

As interesting as these comparisons are, though, some of the strongest
evidence involves U.S. states, cities and counties, which offer the
advantages of comparable data and a largely shared culture. In the July
issue of the American Journal of Public Health, a team of researchers led by
John Lynch and George Kaplan of the University of Michigan describe a study
of 282 metropolitan areas, finding, as Wilkinson did, that mortality rates
are considerably more closely linked to relative than to absolute income.
What do Biloxi, Miss., Las Cruces, N.M., and Steubenville, Ohio, have in
common? High inequality, high mortality. Allentown, Pa., Pittsfield, Mass.,
and Milwaukee, Wis.? Low inequality, low mortality.

Ichiro Kawachi and Bruce Kennedy of the Harvard School of Public Health have
used domestic data to explore the thesis that much of inequality's influence
on health may be due to an erosion of trust or, to use a term coined by the
sociologist James Coleman, "social capital." Kawachi and Kennedy have come
up with ways of measuring these variables, which turn out to be closely
related to inequality and, at the same time, to a city's or state's death
rate from a wide range of causes.

They also point to the Brigadoon-like story of Roseto, Pa., an Italian
American town whose inhabitants smoked heavily and cooked with lard but
nonetheless had an unusually low incidence of heart attack. Alighting on
Roseto in the 1950s, the physician-sociologist team of Stewart Wolf and J.G.
Bruhn traced its good health to a conspicuously old-fashioned immigrant
culture and closeness. By the '60s, however, they began to see younger
Rosetans adopting the more individualistic ways of the wider world--for
example, building terraces in back of their houses rather than porches in
front. Within another decade, Roseto's heart-attack fatality rate was as high 
as that of neighboring towns.

As bizarre as some of these ideas may sound in the context of modern
medicine, they sit well with an array of recent discoveries about how
psychosocial forces affect physical health.

Social isolation or lack of friends, for example, accounted in one study of
a group of coronary patients for a threefold difference in survival rate
after three years; in another study, for a fourfold difference in the rate
at which otherwise healthy research subjects got sick after being exposed to
cold viruses.

Nor are the biological pathways that could explain such things beyond
comprehension. Working with wild baboons in the Serengeti, Robert M.
Sapolsky, a Stanford University neurobiologist, has found that animals lower
down in the tribal hierarchy tend to resort habitually to the kind of
hormonal mobilization that, in higher-status animals, is reserved for
emergencies. Over time, escalated levels of cortisol and other
stress-related hormones become the norm; the hippocampus gland (important to
learning and memory) shrinks, and disproportionately many animals succumb to
cancer, brain damage or stroke.

In a laboratory setting, Carol Shively, a psychologist at Wake Forest
University, has taken Sapolsky's work a scary step farther, manipulating the
status of macaques by bumping them from one social group to another. The
results, for monkeys who go from dominant to subordinate, include an
accelerated pulse and the buildup of fat in the arteries.

For all the questions that remain to be sorted out (assuming they ever are),
it is hard not to see in this body of research a cellular-level glimpse of
truths that have lain in the realm of intuition and parable: the idea, for
example, that when a society creates steep discrepancies in income and
wealth, it excites a preoccupation with material pleasures, money and
status, and aggravates feelings of anxiety and inferiority that (it is all
too accurate to say) eat away at people. These feelings "are so
fundamental," Wilkinson observes, that "it is reasonable to wonder whether
the effects on the quality of life are not more important than the effects
on the length of life."

Wilkinson's emphasis on the psychosocial dimension of inequality has been a
point of disagreement between him and others in the field who argue that
material considerations and access to social services may, in fact, play a
large role, especially when, as Clyde Hertzman of the Canadian Institute for
Advanced Research observes, one includes the latent effects of
income-related differences in prenatal care and parenting.

Whatever the balance of factors, however, it ought to be clear that these
problems won't be solved with a little 1960s-style income redistribution.
They involve the ways in which we distribute money (and power and status) in
the first place, and, that being so, call for a basic change of thinking on
the part of society, corporate chieftains included. And trailing just a
millisecond behind that thought is this one: sure, in a million years.

But consider, for a moment, the slender basis for much of what we currently
accept as economic gospel. Communism collapses, and the most timid forms of
social planning are seen as a first step down the road to the gulag. Western
Europe falters, and we are ready to throw a century's worth of social
welfare measures in the trash. The American economy goes into high gear for
a few years, and the idea of corporate executives who earn hundreds of times
as much as their 
employees becomes a law of nature. Indeed, the confidence with which eternal
verities are thrown around by experts, and accepted by masses of people, in
the capital- and market-driven part of the world these days recalls nothing
so much as the Soviet Union a generation or two ago. This dogma too shall
pass, and we will all be better off.

Report.

Okay, I will come out of the closet.  I was a major jock.  In fact, I barely
got out high school.  Bored mostly.
Fortunately, I overcame myself and went on to a BS and MS in CS.  Oh yeah, I
channeled my jock tendencies into
something I consider somewhat Extropian.  The Martial Arts.  So, I can claim
there is some diversity among the

I think Hal explains it very well. I just want to add that if we try 
to apply the DA to other classes of objects we have to be careful. 
(Astrophysicist Richard Gott, who independently discovered the 
doomsday argument, calls this general argument form 'the delta t 
argument'.) We have to make sure that we are not neglecting some 
underlying correlation. For example, when I explained the DA to one 
friend, he asked: "So I should expect that that tree over there will 
live approximately as long as it has already lived?" Well, that 
doesn't follow. The reason that tree was selected was that it was big 
and salient. The young trees in the garden did not have the same 
chance of being selected.

Can they? I used to say that too, but I reflected a little bit on it 
recently and it's not so clear that that is the right thing to say. 
At any rate, read "prob one" and "prob zero" if you want -- you 
still get a heavy conclusion. Do you accept it? That sitting in your 
armchair you can ascertain that the probability that the 
universe is infinite is one? (And it's hard to see how this 
conclusion could be changed by any empirical evidence.)


>  let me explain what I mean by formalize.

Ok, I'll make a stab at it. (It's somewhat late here but 
curiosity drives me to stay up and watch Clinton address the 
nation.)

Within this framework I think one could state the DA as follows:

Suppose there are two possible worlds, W1 and W2. In W1 there are two 
consequtive states, S1 and S2; in W2 there is only one state, S1, 
whereafter the world ends.

There is one agent, a, in each of these possible worlds. a can be in 
state a(S1) or in a(S2).

The "possible states" for the a's states are: P(S1)={(S1, W1), (S1, 
W2)} and P(S2)={(S2, W1)}.

We can assume that the prior probabilities are equal for W1 and W2.

Suppose RH-now is a being in state S1. In S1 you have information I. 
Question: What is Prob(W1|I)?

Some would say 1/2. But the doomsdayer claim that that is to overlook 
the fact that you should conside RHnow as a random sample from all 
actual observer-moments. The doomsdayer defends this claim like this:

Consider a hypothetical agent, ah, which is like a but has a reduced 
information set I'. Suppose that relative to I', the possible states 
for a are {S1, S2}, and that RH-now 
thinks that the rational probabilities for ah are 

Probah(W1|I')=Probah(W2|I')=1/2.

But consider the conditional probability Probah(I' & "a is in 
state S1"|W1). Suppose RH-now thinks that the rational estimate of 
this is 1/2. Then, by Bayes theorem, RH-now should think:

Probah(W1|I'& "a is in state S1") <1/2

But then, in the rational opinion of RH-now, Probah(W1|I)<1/2, since 
I = I'&"a is in state S1". Thus, if RH-now prescribes the estimate 
Prob(W1)<1/2 for somebody just like him and with exactly the same 
information aas himself, surely RH-now should himself believe that 
Prob(W1)<1/2!

Unless Erik asked for his messages to be deleted, I'm appalled by this

I'd like to add my disappointment to Damien's but without any reservation at
all.
I can't seem to find the post to which he reffered so perhaps Damien's
comments about selective deletion were in a proper context, but I'd have
deep reservations about even that.

I thought we had this all out on 'The Well' years ago ?  As I recall, it was
established that the proper ethics in these situations are that "You own
your own words".
Certainly a person has the right to delete all of their own contributions
(if that is an available option) but for someone else to do it is simply
vandalism.

This is the fundamental problem with the DA. When WE look at a
Tamagotchi, odds are that we are fairly close to the end of the fad.
But if a Tamagotchi were to look at the population of tamagotchis
about it it would have no real way of assigning a probability as to
it's position within the Tamagotchi birth-order.

You are right in that "Your chances of seeing someone with [a
Tamagotchi] are greater, the more people have them [i.e. the more time
has passed].", but OUR odds of seeing other humans do NOT vary over
time. They are 1:1, assuming a population of more then 1.

I don't know if those particular posts are still there, but you can
still see a zillion posts by Erik at

http://www.lucifer.com/exi/extropians.97/
http://www.lucifer.com/exi/extropians.98/

Perhaps b.w. is thinking of the archive at 
http://www.lucifer.com/exi/date00.html, which only ever contains the
latest messages.

Hold on, folks. As far as I can tell, none of Erik's posts were deleted.
This seems to be either a mistake or a deliberate lie. Certainly I have no
knowledge of this. I am checking into the matter. I have been unable to
access that part of the archives, so I cannot see if there are any messages
missing.

Please don't jump to conclusions before checking the facts.

Thanks,

Max

Thankyou Randy, it was a lovely read.

You gave me a commentary.
You did not in fact answer one sentence
with a question mark.
 

Still very interested in the answers
to the questions. It is most peculiar
that I have received no heart felt 
responses. 

Am I on the right list ? This is Extropy
isn't it ? This isn't the shadow version
of Extropy ?

Still waiting to hear about all the 
good you are all doing !

I love Extropy !

Oops.  As I just wrote directly to Max:

Sorry, chief.  I originally started my post `If this is true', but then
decided that this was a self-evident demurrer.  Sorry now I didn't leave it
in. 

I was shocked exactly because the allegation seemed so entirely at odds
with your values.

I said this was to be an open discussion, and this is an open mailing
list.  So your students could join the list and then join the discussion.

My intention in arranging this is to get a deeper critical discussion 
of these issues than we've usually seen.  It was not to create a meet
the author session, nor an educational experience, nor to create a 
bonus benefit to entice people to join the list. 

So if your students would have been shy about joining in a random 
discussion on this list, being unsure whether they knew enough or could
express themselves, I'd hope they'd be doubly shy about this.  If, 
however, your students never joined before only because they didn't
consider our conversations were up to their standards of clarity and
insight, then I'd be delighted to bask in their brilliance :-).

I don't know of any list rule against forwarding messages, so you also
have the option of forwarding our singularity discussion to a separate 
class list where your students could discuss things among themselves.

OK, I'll bite.  

It's clear that being poor is a very big hit on health, that it mostly isn't 
due to spending less on health care, nor to the poor having worse behavior
like smoking, lack of excercise. eating fats, etc.  A big part of it may
well be due to higher stress among poorer people, including cars that break
down more often, less savings to last through unemployment, living in higher
crime areas, etc.  Another big part of it may be a correlation between being
poor and having less social support from friends and family.  

The article acknowledges this, but seems to equivocate regarding policy.  
They admit money isn't the big issue on health, but then complain about how
much money Bill Gates has.  They admit that "these problems won't be solved 
with a little 1960s-style income redistribution," but then complain "we
are ready to throw a century's worth of social welfare measures in the trash." 

There is a big leap between health observations and supporting a welfare state.  
1) Even if monetary insurance against being poor were a great idea, private
insurance is possible if allowed and not displaced by public insurance.
2) Even if health were just a matter of monetary wealth, non-linearities in
that relation may account for all the dependence between average nation health
and national wealth inequalities. 
3) Many nations have higher wealth inequality not because of lacking a welfare
state, but because they encompass a wider divergence in cultures, ethnicities,
etc.  
4) Wealth transfer probably doesn't address most of the reasons the poor have
worse health. 

I do think this literature has important lessons for people trying to be 
healthy.  You should pay a lot of attention to getting lots of social supports,
and to reducing the chance of events that could really stress you, like crime,
unemployment, divorce, etc.  Don't be so focused on whether you are overweight
or smoke.

The conclusion depends on whether I assign a zero or non-zero prob
to infinite universes.  This "prior" can be "posterior" to other 
considerations.  It's not at all obvious to me that other evidence
can't influence this. 

This is typical stuff when you have proabilities about infinities;
I don't see that this should bother me more here than elsewhere.

this brings up an interesting problem:  if postslike these show up and
we strongly suspect a
hoax, how can we be sure?  it is certainly
possible for a bubbly cheerleader type to
show up on extropians and write such things
as "jenny peter chambers" posted, and we would
be loathe to offend such an innocent creature.
however...  there are a number of clues here.

"jenny peter chambers" actually sounds like a
palindrome.  (is palindrome the right word for
mixing the letters of ones name to make a new
name?)  also the max worship thing is a bit over
the top.

"jenny", we avoid answering your
questions, for fear of looking like gullible fools.

Once you've defined states, information partitions, and a prior, 
you're done; there's no more place for argument.   So this must be an 
argument for a certain prior.  And I don't see why one should take
"I'm a random sample from the true reference class" as a fundamental
axiom in choosing a prior.  As you note, in your reply to Doug,

>if we try to apply the DA to other classes of objects we have to be 
>careful. ... to make sure that we are not neglecting some underlying 
>correlation. 

I see no obvious reason why we shouldn't expect such correlations 
for whatever reference class you choose.  The only reasonable way
I can see to see if there are such correlations is to define what
seems a neutral prior and then work on the math.  Why should we 
work to make sure our prior ensures that we are a random sample from
"the" reference class, especially when you aren't even sure what 
class that is?  

My next post on this thread will give an example of a "neutral"
prior calculation.

methinks "jenny" is trying to make the point thatextropians are not

we are a bunch of self absorbed navel gazers?  ok,
tell ya what, "jenny", i'll bite on this.  will you let me
off just saying that the ext chatgroup has been a positive
influence on me?  we learn a few things, perhaps from embarrassing
180 degree conversions, such as my own experience
with roton rockets.  its a place that i can toss out some
wild ideas, have people laugh at me, laugh with me, then
propose that perhaps there is something worthwhile there.

i figure cryonics is a longshot, but better than no shot or a bunch of
empty
soothing promises from the religionists.  suppose one is sick with
emphasema.
with this curse, one knows exactly what ones last months are to be like.

quality of life goes to zero, then negative weeks before the last gasp.

((squick alert:))  is it possible to have one's head transplanted onto
the body of a chimp?  of course one would be quadruplegic, but at
least one could breathe and communicate as dr steven hawking does.

 would not one's chances of ever being revived be greatly increased if
one were frozen while still alive, and bio-ram undamaged from
persistent lack of oxygen?  since the government frowns
on the practice of freezing while alive, why not transplant your
gasping head onto the chimp's body, then almost immediately, before
the immune response starts, freeze the whole thing?  then cut
away the nonhuman parts (scalpel...clamp...buzzsaw... {8^D ) and
you have it.  a frozen head with, presumably, the software still
in there waiting for technology to bring it back to life.

has the chimp path to cryonics already been explored?  where?

As promised, here is my formal example with a "neutral" prior.

Space has four slots: a,b,c,d
Time has five slots:  1,2,3,4,5
Each space/time combination can hold one of these:
  D(ead rock), M(onkey), H(uman), P(osthuman)
Each "universe" describes what is at each space/time slot.
Here are three universes: *,#,@

* | 1 2 3 4 5    # | 1 2 3 4 5    @ | 1 2 3 4 5
-------------    -------------    -------------
a | D D D D D    a | D D D D D    a | D D D D P
b | D D D D D    b | D D D D D    b | D D D D P
c | D M M M M    c | D M M H D    c | D M M H P
d | D M M M M    d | D M H H D    d | D M H H P

A state description says which universe I'm in, and 
which space-time slot I occupy.  For example, I hope
I'm @c4, and I'm glad I'm not #d5.  

The prior is equal over all 60 states so defined.  

My current information is "I'm in an H at time 4."
Some I'm one of {#c4,#d4,@c4,@d4}.  Given that, my
posterior gives equal probability to universes #,@. 
These don't change if my information were "I'm an H."

If my info were "I'm an H or P," my posterior would say
p(@) = 7/10, and p(#) = 3/10.  If my info were "I'm an M, 
H, or P," I'd say p(*) = 8/24, p(#) = 6/24, p(@) = 10/24.

Just knowing I'm alive suggests (If I were smart enough
to realize the implications) that I'm in a universe filled
with life.  Just knowing that I'm alive and smart suggests
that I'm in a universe where intelligence prospers. 

If I've understood Nick's preferred DA prior correctly,
it gives the universes *,#,@ equal probability conditional 
on being in a slot filled with a H or P.  Except he's not 
sure if that should instead be just H, or even M,H, or P. 

If it's H or P, the priors must satisfy p(#) = (7/3)*p(@).
Such a prior assumes "doom" is more probable, and seems
designed to exactly counter act my joy that being smart 
suggests that I'm in a universe filled with smarts.  But I'm
not at all clear on why I should fiddle with my prior to 
do this. 

Note also that Nick's rule doesn't specify what the prior 
is for the universe *, and we need that prior to learn things 
from the fact that our universe can evolve human life.  Is 
there some more general rule here, or is the idea really just 

  "choose a full prior based on other considerations, and 
  then fiddle with it so being smart won't suggest your 
  universe has other smarts"?

Lets say your in an uploaded condition and your an expert in a highly
skilled niche field.  Now, just returning from a two week vacation, a
pile of work worth 1000 hours of time has piled up.  When this work is
completed, another 2 weeks vacation have been earned.  Well, why not
spawn off 100 copies who will work for ten hours each including time
to make "lessons learned" notes.  While this work is being done go
home and unpack your bags.  Upon returning all 100 copies will
voluntarily terminate because 10 hours is not long enough to have
developed a conflict of interest.  The original only has to take the
time to read the "lessons learned" notes and go pack bags for another
two weeks vacation.  The end of the mundane - if your not doing
something interesting or your not learning you need not put yourself
through this pain.  

For example, I am a radiation effects specialist for space
electronics.  Today I have 1000 hours of work on my desk, of which the
experience gained from doing it could easily be replaced with a short
"lessons learned" list. Especially one written by myself to myself. 
Just thought I would share my transhuman fantasies on a very long and
hard Tuesday.  Ahhhhh, if only I were an upload.  Okay, I'll go back
to work now.

Transplanting your head would also qualify as death, by many different 
standards... I'm pretty sure. At the very least, such a procedure would
stop "your" heart. That's either homicide or assisted suicide, depending on
your locale.

It is kind of interesting to think about how that line might blur over time,
though... just how much of what can you transplant before they consider you
"dead"?

After repeating this scenario 26 times, when you are a copy starting
in on a job, you have a stack of 2600 sets of lessons learned in front
of you, and you haven't done a lick of work in a year.  Do you really
think you could read them all and then get your job done in ten hours?

I can't believe this is happening. Its like the Bill Clinton situation 
on the Extropian list. Yesterday I posted about how Erik Moeller's posts 
had been deleted from the current list archive. After my post appeared 
the archive was suddenly unavailable. Its still unavailable but the 1996 
archive is fine. If the Moeller posts reappear when the archive returns 
and the people that administer this list claim the posts were always 
there that will be an OUTRIGHT LIE. I know what I saw. The Moeller posts 
were gone. When I sorted the list by authors Erik did not even show up 
on the list! I am appalled by the censoring and if deception occurs that 
will appall me also.

Why would anyone on this list address the questions of what appears to be a
false persona? Why are you afraid to ask these questions as yourself? Your
false identity makes your motives suspect.  I don't think you'd have any
shortage of responses if you'd simply drop the charade. Perhaps it *would*
be useful to ask ourselves, "What are the socially redeeming attributes of
Extropianism.", but I for one would not be interested in engaging the
Jenny-persona in that conversation. Additionally, your satiric attack
appears to be aimed primarily at Max.  This sounds suspiciously personal
rather than ideological.  Come clean Jenny.

In the above I wrote: " The original only has to take the
time to read the "lessons learned" notes and go pack bags for another
two weeks vacation."  So after each vacation I would take the time to
read the lessons learned.  Every now and then, I might read something
in the "lessons learned" that I would want to repeat myself.... wait a
minute, I did do this myself.  I mean, I would want to repeat
something that I would want the experience of to remain in my memory,
so I would also do that work before returning to vacation.  The whole
point here is that there will be creative options for eliminating
mundane work required by an expert.  The non-mundane work is still
required to remain as a past subjective experience.

Whoa there, hard charger. What you KNOW may not be as right as you think.
I don't handle the archives (all of the list and list archive stuff is
handled by David McFadzean), but I have very recently done searches myself
for people I KNEW were in there (I was looking for a couple email addresses
for people I knew posted to the list frequently), and I didn't find them 
in my author search either. Consider, just for a moment, the possibility that
there was something wrong with that part of the archiving system.

Uh, this is the aeronautical side of NASA, who've done quite a lot for
improving efficiency of aircraft in the last few decades. And the question
was whether multi-stage winged vehicles were practical; clearly they
think it's a practical proposition and we'll find out soon enough when
they try it.

So (approximately) does the shuttle, and some other launch vehicles; and
Roton claims 7,000lbs payload for a <400,000lb launch mass, say 55:1. The
shuttle's what, 2000 tons with a 30 ton payload? 70:1?

Uh, Roton, Skylon, Kistler's SSTO design before they canned it, etc, etc.
I don't know of any SSTO outside the government that's not supposed to be
operational very quickly. As far as I'm aware the first Roton is supposed
to carry 7,000lbs to orbit after initial testing.

3% if the design works. Or 0.3% when you consider that you can't put more 
than one satellite on top in case it blows up. Compared to around 2% if 
Roton works, and no staging or recovery to pay for.

In that case he isn't as smart as I thought, though that may have been back
in the days when there weren't as many alternatives.

Uh, which one? The only such proposal I know of was Black Horse,

No one of them can tell this with certainty.  That is why I wrote that
they could conclude that they were "probably" near the end.

Consider a lottery where only a few players win out of millions of
participants.  No particular lottery player has any way of telling, a
priori, whether he would be right or wrong in believing that his ticket
probably won't win.  But he can conclude based on what he knows about
the lottery that it is very likely to be the case that he won't win.

The Tamagotchis are in a similar situation.  Knowing only their birth
ordering and a general model of exponential growth, they can conclude
that they are probably near the end of the fad.  Some of them won't be
near the end, just as some lottery players actually win.  But that does
not imply the falsehood of the probabilistic conclusion.

Boog:

Did you read either my post or (more importantly) David McFadzean's post on
this topic yesterday? Not only were Erik's post's missing from the archive,
but at least *9 months* worth of posts were missing. You did an author 
search (and so did I). Did you look at the dates? Apparently, everything
after March of '97 was missing from that year, due to some problem with
the software. This problem is apparently still not fixed. When it is, the posts
that were missing (*9 months worth*) should be back. 

Your author searches and keyword searches confirm that posts were missing. But
in no way do they confirm that *only certain posts by certain authors* were
missing. As I said, *I* couldn't find posts by other authors. Specifically,
I was searching for Kennita Watson and Will Wiser so I could find their
email addresses. Did someone have a reason to censor them? Or to delete 9 
months worth of posts?

*Please* consider the other evidence available to you here. Others will confirm
that there were problems with the archives. Ask around. The problems have been
talked about before. If you try to be just a little more rigorous and 
scientific about this, I'm certain you'll find there are MUCH better 
explanations for what has occured than censorship.

Thanks for your consideration,

The existence of one successful thief does not imply that a nation of
thieves would produce a useful economy.  The scheme only works as far
as it can continue to find enough victims who /earn/ money.

Why?  You are assuming that ground controllers would 
destroy a vehicle that is designed to be piloted back in
the event of a problem?  Perhaps you were under the 
impression that that 5% is due to explosive failure, rather
than the decision to abort?

While, arguably, there are a variety of factors that contribute
to longevity, a good benchmark for determining whether a factor
has been soundly determined to contribute to longevity is whether
the factor is integrated into the acturarial calculations of 
insurance companies. I've yet to see an actuary that includes 
factors such as income quintile, net worth, social class, etc. into
his or her calculations. Has anyone encountered this?

I was responding to Katheryn's claim that "a heavily stratified society

Stress is a likely a big reason why lower status people have worse health,
but the literature doesn't attribute this to "exhaustion" or "despair".  
And low status goes with low health everywhere in the world.

The archives have been regenerated and are available at:

A javascript-based front end can be found at:
<http://www.extropy.org/exi-lists/>

The SWISH-based search of the archives is still not available,
the indexer is choking on the volume (more than 30,000 messages
since 96). I am looking into alternatives.

I have evidence indicating that the rumor about the censored 
post was started by someone who is explicitly out there to harm the 
ExI. I can't disclose this evidence since it was confided to me in a 
private email. But let's all simply ignore this rumor.

Before the spawning process begins arbitrary memory allocations are
designated copies 1 through 100 and original.  So at the very instant
of spawning they differ only in name and memory allocation.

All copies and originals know their memory allocations and remember
the naming convention agreed upon before the spawning process.  It
would be perfectly rational to look at your name tag and commit
voluntary suicide at the end of the 10 hours.  I argued this point in
my recent post "Uploading: Voluntary Short Term Memory Suicide".

10 hours subjective time for a non-augmented formerly biological
upload doing nothing but mundane work is not at much risk of creating
a conflict of interest.

I still have not said this as clear as I want to so let me give it one
more try.  Uploads could use creative ways to reduce or eliminate
mundane work but only in so far as it was truly mundane.  I might find
in the "lessons learned" for example, a request for me to return to
the cyclotron to repeat a particular beam position for myself because
the knowledge gained from this experience is greater and takes less
time than reading about it.

Yes, I guess I forgot to realize the wages for mundane work will fall
to the floor even for highly skilled experts.  So I guess I couldn't
quite return to vacation.  But the point of the subject holds.  The
more I think about the economic ramifications the more I realize what
you mean by "wide open".  "My brain hurts a lot" David Bowie

See my reply to Mark, I am saying that in an equal comparison, the simpler vehicle will be more reliable.  And I think that an assumption that any rocket can be immune to catastrophic failure (in the near term) is an obvious mistake.

Mark, I'll reply to your two posts in one, here:

Agreed, I could see spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on average to tow it back between several hundred and several thousand miles, depending on how closely you can control the de-orbit burn.

The dollar has not depreciated by ten to one over that time.

>100,000 pounds at $500 per pound == $50,000,000.
The smaller Excalibur is a $20,000,000 launch in recent dollars, putting up 100,000Lbs.

>You mean the shuttle can survive an in-flight failure and land? You >have some proof of that?
When did I say such a thing?  Come, now, putting words in somebody else's mouth will quickly make this an angry conversation.

And you are right, I ignored vertical landing SSTO's.  I would add then, that vertical landing is an advantage of having vertical landing capability (!), and not of having one stage to orbit.  Again, my argument (repeating Truax) is against SSTO, and against complexity where simple solutions exist.

>And again, they fail explosively because there's nothing else they can
>do, because they're not designed to survive such failures.
If you think so, then design it to land, and develop it sufficiently that it stands a small chance of exploding.  But this is independent of the decision of the number of stages.

>>Are you also assuming your SSTO blows up 5% of the time?  I would.
>
>Why? It can be designed not to blow up, because it can land safely if
>it loses an engine.
Because nobody gets away with engineering reality.  We are talking about a design comparison here.  With the same people working to the same design goals, is one high-tech stage with turbopumps, pushed to the utmost in structural strength to weight ratio, more reliable than two pressure fed stages with fewer total engines and enormously fewer parts, and large strength margins?

Look at the engines alone: (oversimplified) A pump fed motor is a pump and a thrust chamber.  A pressure fed motor is a thrust chamber.  You cannot assert that a pump fed motor is therefor more reliable.

I'd like to see the statistics on that, do you have a reference handy?  Clearly ignition failures before launch that resulted in an abort (non-catastrophic shutdown) wouldn't count here, so I'm not sure what to make of this.

>(If you want a list, try Titan IV, Altas-Centaur, Russian manned lunar

I don't understand what you said here, a list of what?

Again, sorry to ignore vertical landing.  There have been a number of winged (lifting body) SSTO proposals, including the X-30.

I can't remember many in-flight launch failures in rockets that were not catastrophic.  Have I been missing something?  I must not be getting something here.

Yes.  But with an SSTO, that 1 or 2% comes directly out of the performance and structural margins, and forces the ultimate from everything.  With two stages, the payload (or next stage) is about 10-20% of the stage liftoff mass.  This makes SSTO payload calculations very uncertain, and even then, SSTOs are lower in performance than simpler two stage rockets.

I am not aware of any SSTO design being funded enough to make it to operational capability, including the Roton.  Yes, I'm making a bet on that one that I hope to be wrong about.

I did not claim this;  Lardner has posited it in his article.  Let's keep
the focus on Lardner, because I have not drawn any conclusions from his
research.  I do think, however, that the studies he cites could be used in
support of an argument for structuring future societies nonheirarchically,
which is hardly a new idea among futurists. 

Take care,

I'm reposting this to get it into the archives under a proper thread name.
My other posting has a new message.

This is where Lardner's somewhat casual writing style creates
misunderstandings, and I wish that the Post had done a tighter editing job
on this piece.  If you read carefully, you will note that he never takes a
position on any particular aspect of the U.S. welfare debate.  His intent in
some paragraphs seems to be to point out how bogged down we get when we drag
the welfare debate into every mention of class issues. Americans tend to use
'class' as a code word for 'poverty', because we try to perpetuate the
notion that we live in a nonstratified social structure.  Lardner rejects
that and focuses on the very *experience* of class--the stress that comes
from living as someone's subordinate.  He pulled together a set of studies
that, when combined, point to a larger theme of how the day-to-day
experiencing of living within a heavily stratified society can adversely
affect everyone within it equally.  This provides some evidence in support
of crafting future societie that rely less on heirarchy and dominance, and
more on collaboration and individual development.

Sin,

Contrary to various claims, Erik Moeller's posts are
very available for review. Try this URL:

http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.2Q98/author.html#start

As you can see Erik's posts are there, including the ones
in the "cult" thread. Hopefully, this will end the rampant
speculation and we can get back to our the important stuff
like: 

Obscuring the origins of the Cydonia structures, 
hiding Elvis and Jim Morrison in our houses,
conducting various Illuminati/Freemason/Hermetic activities,
lying to the American public about our sexual relations,
conducting seances to contact L. Ron Hubbard,
embedding lost alien technology in Bazooka Joe comic strips,
figuring out what the hell Andy Rooney is talking about, and
taking more newspapers from the vending machines than we pay for.

And hiding it all under the ruse of a mailing list designed for
constructive discussion of transhuman and extropian topics.

This is misinformation.
The truth is out there.

Yet another attempt to shroud the truth with cover-up tactics.  I did not 
initially realize how widespread this censorship conspiracy had become, I had 
hoped it was limited to a few insiders -- Max's inner circle.  However the 
swiftness with which a handful of individuals came to Max's defense has 
convinced me otherwise.  If they aren't in on it themselves, they are clearly 
under the delusion that Max and his ilk can do no wrong.  I think everyone 
needs to take a long hard look at the evidence and not make premature 
judgements -- there may be forces acting in opposition to the common good, as 
there generally are.

We have to distinguish two "cannots" here. (1) Given the validity of 
these memories then I was in fact not born <1900.[true] (2) I could 
not exist without these memories.[much more doubtful]

In one way this is true, but I'm not sure it's true in the 
relevant way. This view seems to create problems for those of us who 
want to personally become posthumans?

I'm not sure our disagreement is best described as being about 
priors. It is rather about what is and what isn't a random sample, 
and from what sampling population. (see below)

That is true, but then they would not have been you.

That is also true, but it doesn't imply that you could have been a 
rock.

That depends on such things as simplicity etc. If the three worlds 
are equal in these repects, I would say P(*) = 1/3. This would be the 
absolute prior. Then you take account of the fact that you exist, and 
you rule out world * (though I'm not sure what do about the monkeys). 
Then you renormalize and get P(#) = P(@) = 1/2.

Notice that after ruling out world *, the two remaining worlds are 
equally probable for you. I.e., you should think that the likelihood 
that you exist is equally great given world # as given world @. In 
both cases it is one. 

Why? Because you are not a random sample from all possible observers; 
only from all actual observers. 

Maybe at the heart of the matter lies the fact that the word "I" is 
an indexical. To say "I exist." is like saying "That exists." while 
pointing to some object, say a stone. Surely you would not reason 
like this:

"That exists [pointing to a stone]. It can be considered a random 
sample of all possible stones. Hence there are probably a great many 
stones."

And yet you to want to reason like this:

"I exist [pointing to yourself]. I can be considered a random sample 
from all possible observers. Hence there are probably a great many 
observers."

Both these arguments seem equally wrong to me.

Why not download the "lessons learned" experience directly into your mind from the copies mind.  This would remove the need for reading a summary and/or repeating tasks.

This is a first for me.  But, I am finding "Jenny Chambers" posts
totally oboxnious.  Can we not do something to stop these?

Yes, the list is being targeted, of course, because anything having to
do with nanotechnology is being targeted, I would bet.  Otherwise, 
we're in big trouble!

Thanks, much.  That was a great lead.

I found what I was looking for.

It turns out that it only takes about 6 weeks to grow a good plant
with a 1 to 2 oz. yield, using hydroponic methods.

The most highly recommended book is:

Marijuana Grower's Handbook : The Indoor High Yield Guide
                   by Ed Rosenthal 

See http://www.amazon.com/.  It's wonderful that amazon.com provides
so much helpful information!

The seeds are available from http://www.cannabisculture.com/seeds/.

This is gonna be fun.  I think I'll make a time-lapse video 
of this process, using shareware software available at
http://www.demonweb.co.uk/c3sys/index1.htm.  Maybe I can sell the 
video at amazon.com in a few months?

Let's see how long we can keep this a secret, shall we?

Let me make it absolutely clear that I do not intend to sell this.

Is it fair to say that the internet itself is the "new world order",
and that it's essentially the eyes and ears of the intelligence
community?  PGP doesn't make sense to me, since keystokes can be
picked up from satellites, and CRTs can be read from a distance using
advanced surveillance equipment.

My thoughts exactly.  Program the copies to self-destruct in 8 (or whatever)
hours and assimilate the information into your consciousness.  In fact,
program thousands of short-lived copies and assimilate their experiences and
you got your own personal singularity going.

I also have a hard time conceptualizing the notion of an uploaded mind
desiring a vacation.  Would we *need* vacations in that state?  I mean
vacations are basically a two-week reward for spending 50 weeks at something
you don't particularly like to do.  As uploads, aren't we likely to
experience a greater level of work satisfaction?  I mean, how important
would vacations be if you *really* loved your job?

OK, so "The Original" is just a name, of no greater significance than
any other name, #87 for example.

I still don't understand, why should I look at my name tag, other than
pure curiosity what useful information would I gain by doing so ?
It wouldn't matter if my tag said "The Original" or "#87",
I'd still rather have the other fellow blow his brains out not me.

I think 10 hours would be more than enough for 2 copies to diverge
enough
that both would want to survive. Are you telling me that if you looked
down
right now and saw "#87" on your name tag you'd cheerfully put a gun
to your head? If so I wouldn't go so far as to call your decision
irrational, life is not more rational than death, it's just that death
is not
my cup of tea. To each their own.

You both seem to be assuming that uploading gives more abilities than
simply the ability to simulate a brain on the computer: the ability to
download experiences directly into the simulated brain, the ability to
automatically assimilate information, the ability to adjust brain state
so that work is rewarding.

While it is conceivable that by the time we are able to upload, we will
understand the brain well enough to have these abilities, it is not
necessarily true.  Uploading may be as simple as being able to simulate
how individual neurons work, and having the ability to scan the brain at
the neural level.  This could be enough to scan in a brain and simulate
it accurately so that it behaves just like the real brain.  If this route
is followed it will not automatically inform us about how to insert new
experiences into the brain, or what to tweak in order to change rewards.

Actually, the technology needed to do this kind of scanning might well
let us manipulate physical brains almost as easily as we do virtual ones.
Perhaps we could crudely solve the reward problem by stimulating the
"pleasure center" whenever the desired activity occurs.  This could
probably be done in both simulated and real brains.

Assimilating experiences will require learning a great deal about how
memory works.  Experiences go into memory and somehow get associated
with other, similar memories.  It might be that the only way to know how
a given brain would react to a certain experience would be to actually
simulate that brain's exposure to the experience.

Suppose I am an upload and I buy a program which will insert the knowledge
of French into my brain.  The program makes a copy of my brain, suspending
the original.  It then laboriously teaches the copy French, by repetitive
drill, practice, etc., just as it is done today.  This is how it finds out
exactly how my particular brain would represent the knowledge of French.

At the end of this process it copies the brain state from the copy
back into the original, destroys the copy, and resumes the original.
Presto, knowledge of French has been painlessly "inserted" into my brain.
But it is obvious, I hope, that this process is effectivelly the same
as having me learn French the old fashioned way.

Greetings.

I'm curious, is a domain name considered an "asset" that can be 
seized by the DEA.  

I'm considering growing hemp at home for personal consumption.  
However, since there will be more than 1 oz. on hand when the 
plant(s) mature, I may be subject to the whims of the system.

What are the current laws regarding this?

Are the current definitions worded in such a way as to assume that 
posession of more than an ounce represents and "intent to sell"?

If so, what is the mechanism for redefining these interpretations?

Title
  Randomised comparison of diets for maintaining obese
  subjects' weight after major weight loss: ad lib, low fat, high carbohydrate
  diet v fixed energy intake.
Source
  BMJ.  314(7073):29-34, 1997 Jan 4.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: To compare importance of rate of initial weight loss for long
  term outcome in obese patients and to compare efficacy of two different
  weight maintenance programmes. DESIGN: Subjects were randomised to either
  rapid or slow initial weight loss. Completing patients were re-randomised to
  one year weight maintenance programme of ad lib diet or
  fixed energy intake diet. Patients were followed up one year
  later. SETTING: University research department in Copenhagen, Denmark.
  SUBJECTS: 43 (41 women) obese adults (body mass index 27-40) who were
  otherwise healthy living in or around Copenhagen. INTERVENTIONS: 8 weeks of
  low energy diet (2 MJ/day) or 17 weeks of conventional
  diet (5 MJ/day), both supported by an anorectic compound
  (ephedrine 20 mg and caffeine 200 mg thrice daily); one year weight
  maintenance programme of ad lib, low fat, high carbohydrate
  diet or fixed energy intake diet (< or =
  7.8 MJ/day), both with reinforcement sessions 2-3 times monthly. MAIN OUTCOME
  MEASURES: Mean initial weight loss and proportion of patients maintaining a
  weight loss of > 5 kg at follow up. RESULTS: Mean initial weight loss was
  12.6 kg (95% confidence interval 10.9 to 14.3 kg) in rapid weight loss group
  and 12.6 (9.9 to 15.3) kg in conventional diet group. Rate
  of initial weight loss had no effect on weight maintenance after 6 or 12
  months of weight maintenance or at follow up. After weight maintenance
  programme, the ad lib group had maintained 13.2 (8.1 to 18.3) kg of the
  initial weight loss of 13.5 (11.4 to 15.5) kg, and the fixed energy intake
  group had maintained 9.7 (6.1 to 13.3) kg of the initial 13.8 (11.8 to 15.7)
  kg weight loss (group difference 3.5 (-2.4 to 9.3) kg). Regained weight at
  follow up was greater in fixed energy intake group than in ad lib group (11.3
  (7.1 to 15.5) kg v 5.4 (2.3 to 8.6) kg, group difference 5.9 (0.7 to 11.1)
  kg, P < 0.03). At follow up, 65% of ad lib group and 40% of fixed energy
  intake group had maintained a weight loss of > 5 kg (P < 0.07). CONCLUSION:
  Ad lib, low fat, high carbohydrate diet was superior to
  fixed energy intake for maintaining weight after a major weight loss. The
  rate of the initial weight loss did not influence long term outcome.

Ok, let me repeat this one more time and see how simple I can put it to 
see if you finally get it.

If one of Truax's multi-stage monsters suffers an engine failure, whether
or not it's catastrophic, it has two choices. It aborts to orbit or it
crashes and burns. That's all it can do, because there's no way you can
land a multi-stage monster like that. So if it can't abort to orbit it's
going down and there's no point bothering to design it to survive; the
range safety officer is going to blow it up anyway. This would, in most
cases, also apply to an expendable SSTO.

If a reusable SSTO like Roton loses an engine it can abort to orbit, land, 
or crash and burn. It can land because it's, like, designed to. It's not
a huge, tall, narrow monster rocket that's only designed to fall into 
an ocean, it's actually supposed to land intact at the end of its flight. 
Hence the designers can design it to survive such an in-flight failure and 
land safely with the crew and payload intact.

Is that clear enough?

Uh, how? The best I could see would be to set a timer which would delete
their process after 8 hours, but can you really see yourself working hard
when you know that in eight hours you'll die? This is a copy of you we're
talking about, remember?

Uh, how? It's all very well to talk about "programming copies" and 
"assimilating information", but as far as I'm aware no-one has a clue 
as to how to program a neural network or assimilate parts of one into 
another.

On this subject, I'm toying with a low-budget movie idea about the real 
perils of duplication (i.e. that the copies are exact duplicates of you
and won't do all those neat things you planned); does anyone know of any 
movies which have handled this properly in the past? That is, where 
the duplicates really are exact duplicates rather than different versions 
of the same person? Everything I can think of seems to have gone the
'Jekyll and Hyde' route.

And how much in interest on loans, salaries for people waiting at the
launch site and twiddling their thumbs, etc, etc, while you wait for it
to come back for re-launch? Probably far more than hundreds of thousands
of dollars.

>The dollar has not depreciated by ten to one over that time.

So how much has it depreciated? There's no point whatsoever in throwing
around forty-year-old $50-per-pound figures when we're comparing it to 
modern costs.

And where does that cost figure come from and what does it include? The
shuttle costs only about $100,000,000 to launch, but the total cost of
a shuttle flight when you include KSC etc is nearer a billion. Most of
the cost of most of the SSTO designs I know of comes not from the cost
of a launch (fuel, maintenance etc) but from paying back development
loans, investors, etc. That's why they concentrate so much on simplicity
and fast turnaround.

>And you are right, I ignored vertical landing SSTO's.  I would add then,

Name one multi-stage launcher which can land intact. Just one will do. Of
course there aren't any, because they're not designed to, and being big,
tall, unstable designs they're never likely to. They could be designed
to do so, but that would significantly reduce their payload.

>Again, my argument (repeating Truax) is against SSTO, and against 
>complexity where simple solutions exist.

Yet you're arguing against a simple single-stage design which lands at
the launch site ready for maintenance, refuelling and relaunch in favor
of a complex multi-stage rocket which has to be towed back from a
landing in the sea, checked for damage, and reassembled.

>If you think so, then design it to land, and develop it sufficiently

>of the decision of the number of stages.

But it's never meant to land in its launch configuration, so any changes
you make will cost you payload. The reusable SSTO has to land in its
launch configuration (possibly after dumping fuel), so there's no extra
cost. No simple development of a Saturn-V is ever going to land in its
launch configuration.

>We are talking about a design comparison here. With the same people

But they're not working to the same design goals. That's the whole point.

Uh, Roton is a LOX/Kerosene rocket; they don't even push it to LOX/LH2.

>and enormously fewer parts, and large strength margins?

Is the SSME more reliable than almost any other rocket engine regardless
of design? Uh, yes. Yet it's also probably the most complex engine ever
built. Similarly, a modern jet engine is far more reliable than any old,
simple, biplane piston engine. A complex engine can be more reliable than 
a simpler design.

And again, it doesn't even have to be. If a Truax monster-rocket engine
in the second stage fails to ignite, your payload probably ends up as
vapor in the stratosphere. If an SSTO engine fails to ignite you just
shut down the rest, climb out of the pilot's seat and grab a coffee 
while the engineers fix it.

>Look at the engines alone: (oversimplified) A pump fed motor is a pump

Look at a modern jet and an old biplane engine. You can't assert that a
complex jet engine is more reliable than a simple old biplane engine? 
Yet it is.

>I'd like to see the statistics on that, do you have a reference handy? 

Uh, reading numerous reports on the reasons why launchers failed.

I didn't even mention those. Two-engine Centaur stages, old Ariane
third stage, Energiya test flight, commercial Titan IV, just to name 
a few. All lost their payloads because of engine ignition failures,
which is a significant problem with multi-stage designs.

>I don't understand what you said here, a list of what?

A partial list of launchers which have lost their payload because an
engine shut down or failed to ignite. All cases in which an SSTO
would probably have brought the payload back intact, but a traditional
multi-stage design had no choice but to crash and burn.

No, you're not. Hopefully my last message will finally have explained it
clearly enough.

Yet Roton isn't even using LOX/LH2 engines... nor would Black Horse, 
and I don't think Kistler were planning to either.

So? Your first stage increases in mass by 3% and you've lost your payload. 
Your Roton mass increases by 2% and you've lost your payload. What's the difference?

Well, the implication of their Web site is that they're building the 
first one and it will fly into space in a couple of years. Unfortunately  
their site is too damn slow to hunt out many details.

mark is right. if the copy is exact, it will not work as planned knowing that it
will be destroyed, any less than you will blow your own head off during vacation.
again, i also see a problem with the duplicate that knows you've made a program
that deletes it after 8 hours. a system clause would have to be included in the
duplicate, something much like a hypnotic command that the duplicate is unaware
of. if anyone takes care of the problem with programming neural networks, i'll
figure out how to set the 'destruct timer' in the meantime. ;)

a movie with michael keaton came up some 2 or 3 years ago with this theme, can't
remember the title i'm afraid. for the funniest stories about the subject, try
out the old issues of 'calvin and hobbes'. calvin made duplicates to make his
homework for him and well..., you can imagine the rest.

maybe what we need to make uploading work is to make the duplicates more perfect
than us. e.g. 'would we trust our work to be done by ourselves?'

There was a series of Calvin and Hobbes cartoons a few years ago where
Calvin creates (imaginary?) duplicates using his cardboard-box duplicator,
expecting them to do his chores, homework, etc.  He is dismayed to find
that they are no more eager to do these things than he is.  Then when
they misbehave, it's Calvin who gets in trouble.  Nobody believes him
when he says that it was a duplicate who was bad.

True, but several hours is not negligible, especially if it includes
the most recent hours, the ones that seem the most real to us, even
the very hour in which you're supposed to make a life and death

Well, in my book a brain concussion is a pretty big deal, not

ONLY of emotional origin? Certainly, but I don't understand why you
say "only" as if it's a small point. What other reason could there
possibly be for choosing existence over oblivion?

I hope so. If you find the work boring your copies will find it just
as dull, and if you think it's a wonderful idea to make copies of
yourself to get the work done your copes will think exactly the same
thing leading to an infinite number of copies.

Agreed, except that it would the emotional part of me that would be

Leave me out of this, please.  I have already withdrawn my hasty remark,
which should have started with the proviso `If this is true'.  It seems
clear from subsequent posts that the claim of censorship was ill-considered

While I took issue with some other of Joe Jenkins' assumptions, I'm fine with
this one.  I'd have no problem ending myself if I recalled agreeing to do so a 
few hours ago, with a copy of myself as of that time living on.

But nothing else could have been me exactly.  The only thing that
could be me exactly is something born when I was, and which then
did everything I did afterward, including writing this message.

But your *prior* is before you take information into account, and you
seem to prefer p(*) = 1/3, p(#) = 7/20, p(@) = 3/20.   I instead prefer
all three being 1/3.  You say:

>I'm not sure our disagreement is best described as being about priors. 

But in this example the disagreement is exactly about priors, unless 
you want to dispute my choice of state space or information partitions. 
My prior gives my preferred result, yours gives your preferred result.

I don't accept as a fundamental axiom any statement of the form "I am 
a random sample from X."  As far as I'm concerned the rational way to
do inference is to construct a state space with associated observer
information partitions, put a prior over the state space, and then 
turn the crank.  The result of this might or might not have me being 
a random sample from some set.

As I said, I don't want to reason about random samples at all.
But I *do* want to reason like this:  

"I'm not sure how many stones a universe has, but I expect universes
that have more stones in one region to have more stones in other regions
as well.  If I look in one spot in this universe and I find a stone, that 
suggests I'm more likely to find stones at other spots in this universe 
as well."

Is everything posted from an unsubscribed address to be considered spam?
If so, it is easy enough to block that from the list.

That address is subscribed. That address will remain
subscribed. You are completely contradicting the 
Principals. You are a heretic. Any attempt to remove
that name from this list is beyond censorship. 

If I start swearing at list members then you may remove
that name. Until then you will leave that name on this
list.


You will not remove that name.

Extropy is not a Totalitarian State.

Max is not Joseph Stalin. 

Questioning Extropy is not heresy, no matter how much
Max would like it to be. I will have my voice. Hired
goons or no hired goons.

I am still waiting for Max to address me directly.
I would appreciate it if his goons kept their mouths
shut. This matter does not concern you. It is between
myself and Max. What does Max fear ?

It seems to me that brusquely-stated opinions as to the quality of the
maintenance of this list, and comments as to the personal
characteristics, attitudes, and motivations of originators and
maintainers of this list could be expressed a bit more constructively.
It is, after all, a free mailing list. 

And this list could do some real good. Through the agency of this
list, we have discovered that four of us live in Houston. That may not
seem like a big deal to those who live in California where
extros/cryosare plentiful, but considering that many of us are
cryonicists and may need each other to make it to the future, such
contacts could be crucial.

Its a name that determines your assignment and weather or not you have
been slated for voluntary short term memory suicide in 10 hours.  So
its a little more than just a name.

You are the one that designed the temporary spawning process.  Why
would you ignore your own intentions.  Of course you would look at the
name tag, this is part of the plan.  This is how you know what work
you've been assigned and if your slated for voluntary short term
memory suicide in 10 hours.

With the exception of 10 hours divergence, the other fellow is you. 
So, if the divergence is negligible (debated below) for all intents
and purposes the other fellow IS you.  There is no conflict of
interest given that the divergence is negligible.  If you have a
strong desire not to have multiple copies diverge (debated below),
then all 1001 instances of you have that same strong desire.  As long
as that desire is stronger than the desire to not suffer 10 hours
amnesia, none of the copies will deviate from the plan.  None of the
copies will die because death does not equal 10 hours of amnesia.

That is a judgment call.  But let me provide you with a thought
experiment that gives a rational way to evaluate it:

You've just completed 10 hours of mundane work at the office today in
your normal biological state.  You then documented your work more
thoroughly than ever before.  A doctor shows up and completely
convinces you beyond any shadow of a doubt that he has invented a
flash light type device that can induce a perfect 10 hour amnesia with
no side effects whatsoever.  You are 100% convinced this is safe and
effective.  He offers you $10,000 to let him use the device on you.

> my cup of tea. To each their own.

You've just told me that 10 hour amnesia equals death.  Does
1=1,000,000?  Would I look at my name tag and commit suicide -
Absolutely not!  Would I look at my name tag and commit 10 hour
amnesia - Yes, in a clock cycle.  This of course presumes that I have
a stronger desire not to diverge multiple copies than I do to not
commit 10 hour amnesia.

I'm not trying to argue that I'll never desire to have multiple copies
diverge.  I've recently posted space travel examples were I would
prefer multiple copies.  But I can think of a lot more examples of why
I would not want multiple copies to diverge.  For example:

Each copy would have equal right to my wealth.  So my entire worth
would have to be divided by 1001 in this example.

Each copy would show up at my families house on Xmas and Thanksgiving.

Each copy would join the Extropian and Transhuman list and post and
average of two or three messages per day that virtually said the same
thing especially at first.  Thats 3003 messages a day.

Each copy would want two hours of sex from my wife every day, and we
don't give up easy ;)

Each copy would claim to be employed by my employer.  About 990 of
them would probably be fired.

Each copy would claim ownership of my house.

Each copy would claim friendship with my friends.

I could literally go on for thousands of examples.  The chaos that
would ensue from diverging 1001 copies would be my worst disaster
ever.  Each of the 1000 copies slated to terminate would also
understand this and they would value avoiding this much more than the
value of avoiding 10 hours of amnesia.

P.S.  Has anyone on this list verified the signature on the message
where John Clark changed his public key?  After more than three years
of reading his post with mostly just minor disagreements, all of a
sudden, one week after changing his public key this major disagreement
about the fundamentals of identity pops up.  Even if it verifies
correctly, I would still suspect the possibility that he sold his
reputation by means of selling his private key.  I for one will be
keeping a close eye for other discontinuities.  Reputation selling is
a limited market if this is any indication.

I think the movie title was Multiplicity or something like it.

Anyway, you guys are probably right, and as I think about it, I would be
much less interested in limiting the lifespan/consciousness of any copy of
myself (or anyone else) and much more interested in figuring out how to
assimilate knowledge from others' experiences.

As any group, this one can state its own rules.  You don't
have to be rude (as the last message was, even without swearing)
to be unwanted.  It's enough to disagree with everything, be
inconsiderate and irrelevant, to be unwelcome.

time from conversations with more pleasant and polite people
who share his ideas and talk to the author of some outrageous

They are back now, no doubt due to the fact that I caught a few people

I'd love to hear this *evidence* you have. I can't wait to hear this. 
Either you have fabricated evidence that someone created to protect 
themselves or you are just lying. I call to attention that someone is

 If you expect us to believe this difference will come about as one sudden
leap when the first AI is created rather than through a gradual process of
improvement, and don't think that assumption needs any justification, then
you are nuts.

 None of this is likely to happen with the first AI. We will have time to
create a variety of AI's before they acquire control over external tools
this powerfull.

 You're claiming, for instance, that they couldn't turn the power off

the SI?

 It might be easier to destroy than to make people subservient, but I
can't see how it's easier for an SI to destroy much of civilization than
it is to sabotage a few key pieces of equipment or software in key
research labs.

 And if it's really thinking thousands of times faster than those other
ascending powers, how do you expect them to catch up with it's
technology even if it leaves them alone and improves it's own power
as fast as possible?

 Evolutionary forces may well cause some gradual change in motivations.
If SI is created via uploading, there is no obvious force to change the
motivations of any individual SI, and there is a desire to preserve one's
identity which should deter change.
 For other types of SI, it's hard to generalize. So much depends on how
and why they are created.

 If everything involved (CPU speed, inter-processor communications,
and sensory I/O) all sped up by factors of a thousand or more compared
to human brains and if none of the algorithms involved are sufficiently
less efficient than the equivalent human algorithms, then you might be
right.
 If the first SI is achieved through uploading, the need to emulate
lots of quirks in neural behavior is likely to soak up enough CPU
power to make that thousand fold speedup unlikely.
 With any other approach, it is unlikely that all the software needed
will be implemented as efficiently on the first successfull attempt as
million of years of evolution have made the human brain, so I expect
some SI thought processes to work quite slowly.

>plan upon plan. Computers are *already* much faster than humans,

 Computers are much slower than humans even for simple problems like
Go. For hard problems like military strategy, computers are too slow to
measure.

 Are you claiming it would be able to do these things as soon as it

the discussion?

 The fact that I can imagine it doesn't imply it is true. I suspect
the first SI's control over non-digital processes will be rather limited.

 Chris Phoenix demoed a version of his DiamondCAD program at the last
Senior Associates gathering that looked worthwhile for creating carbon-only
molecules with arbitrary shapes. See:
 http://www.zyvex.com/DiamondCAD.html

 I'm working on some extensions to Konrad Hinsen's MMTK. You can see
some hints at:
 http://www.rahul.net/pcm/dismol/mmtk.html
 It will probably be ready for people to use in another month or 2.

 Anyone interested in these topics should subscribe to the NanoCAD mailing
list and/or read the archives at:

This is obviously a personal issue. Different people will have different
results, you can't apply a blanket conclusion about the issue because it
is based upon mental aspects of a person before he/she is copied.

If you believe that a copy of you couldn't commit suicide, then your copy
would also have that belief, and it will become true.

If, however, you believe your copy could commit suicide, then your copy
would also have the same belief, and it will become true. 

As far as I can tell, my conclusion of inconclusivenes is entirely
correct and based upon logic. 

Whether a clone could commit suicide is entirely based upon the personal
belief of the individual before he/she is clone.  Clones of some people
will voluntarily die off, clones of other people would not. I for one have
trouble just keeping the original of me from voluntarily dying off.

As they say, results may vary.

I, Mr.87 am slated to die but that fathead Mr. Original is not, he's
going on a luxury vacation instead, that's a hell of a difference and

It doesn't really matter why, the fact is I am ignoring them, so

The basic problem is that all the copies are identical yet you're

Perhaps not because survival is not an all or nothing matter, but it
would be close enough to death to make me profoundly unhappy.

Nobody can claim absolute consistency so perhaps something I said in

don't know what it could be but I'd love to find out, please
illuminate me.

If I bought John Clark's key then the person you're talking to now is
not the same person that has been on the Extropian and Transhuman list
for years, but if I bought it then why am I using a different key?
Actually I would have sold out years ago except that nobody made me an
offer.

Sean, get a grip.  I only have a cursory interest in the group, and could
probably be considered to be on the outer edge of the outer circle. 
However, I've experienced the same problems as others when
searching for emails on the site and have eventually needed to resort to
performing the search manually by downloading almost everything ever
posted for a particular year; and I did eventually find what I was looking
for.

All in all, the conspiracy theory seems a bit much.

Yet another attempt to shroud the truth with cover-up tactics.  I did not 
initially realize how widespread this censorship conspiracy had become,
I had  hoped it was limited to a few insiders -- Max's inner circle. 
However the  swiftness with which a handful of individuals came to
Max's defense has  convinced me otherwise.  If they aren't in on it
themselves, they are clearly  under the delusion that Max and his ilk can

           The Advanced Bonewits' Cult Danger Evaluation Frame 2.0

                           Copyright  1979, 1996 c.e., Isaac Bonewits



  
                                         Introduction

  Events in the last few decades have clearly indicated just how 
dangerous some religious and secular
 groups (usually called "cults" by those opposed to them) can be to 
their own members as well as to
 anyone else whom they can influence. "Brainwashing," beatings, 
child abuse, rapes, murders, mass
 suicides, military drilling and gunrunning, meddling in civil 
governments, international terrorism, and
 other crimes have been charged against leaders and members of 
many groups, and in far too many
 cases those accusations have been correct. None of this has been 
very surprising to historians of
 religion or to other scholars of what are usually labled "new" 
religions (no matter how old they may be
 in their cultures of origin). Minority groups, especially religious 
ones, are often accused of crimes by
 members of the current majority. In many ways, for example, the 
"Mormons" were the "Moonies" of
 the 19th century -- at least in terms of being an unusual minority 
belief system that many found
 "shocking" at the time -- and the members of the Unification Church 
could be just as "respectable" a
 hundred years from now as the Latter Day Saints are today.
  

 Nonetheless, despite all the historical and philosophical caveats that 
could be issued, ordinary people
 faced with friends or loved ones joining an "unusual" group, or 
perhaps contemplating joining it
 themselves, need a relatively simple way to evaluate just how 
dangerous or harmless a given group is
 liable to be, without either subjecting themselves to its power or 
judging it solely on theological or
 ideological grounds (the usual method used by anti-cult groups).
  

 In 1979 I constructed an evaluation tool which I now call the 
"Advanced Bonewits' Cult Danger
 Evaluation Frame," or the "ABCDEF," a copy of which was 
included in that year's revised edition of
 my book, Real Magic (Samuel Weiser Pub., 1989). I realize its 
shortcomings, but feel that it can be
 effectively used to separate harmless groups from the merely 
unusual-to-the-observer ones. Feedback
 from those attempting to use the system has always been 
appreciated. Indirect feedback, in terms of
 the number of places on and off the Net this ABCDEF has shown 
up, has been mostly favorable. For
 example, it was chosen by and is now displayed on the website of 
the Institute for Social Inventions,
 who paraphrased it for their "Best Ideas -- A compendium of social 
innovations" listing.
  

 The purpose of this evaluation tool is to help both amateur and 
professional observers, including
 current or would-be members, of various organizations (including 
religious, occult, psychological or
 political groups) to determine just how dangerous a given group is 
liable to be, in comparison with
 other groups, to the physical and mental health of its members and 
of other people subject to its
 influence. It cannot speak to the spiritual "dangers," if any, that 
might be involved, for the simple
 reason that one person's path to enlightenment or "salvation" is 
often viewed by another as a path to
 ignorance or "damnation."
  

 As a general rule, the higher the numerical total scored by a given 
group (the further to the right of the
 scale), the more dangerous it is likely to be. Though it is obvious 
that many of the scales in the frame
 are subjective, it is still possible to make practical judgments using 
it, at least of the "is this group more
 dangerous than that one?" sort. This is if all numerical assignments 
are based on accurate and unbiased
 observation of actual behavior by the groups and their top levels of 
leadership (as distinct from
 official pronouncements). This means that you need to pay 
attention to what the secondary and tertiary
 leaders are saying and doing, as much (or more so) than the 
central leadership -- after all, "plausible
 deniability" is not a recent historical invention.
  

 This tool can be used by parents, reporters, law enforcement 
agents, social scientists and others
 interested in evaluating the actual dangers presented by a given 
group or movement. Obviously,
 different observers will achieve differing degrees of precision, 
depending upon the sophistication of
 their numerical assignments on each scale. However, if the same 
observers use the same methods of
 scoring and weighting each scale, their comparisons of relative 
danger or harmlessness between
 groups will be reasonably valid, at least for their own purposes. 
People who cannot, on the other
 hand, view competing belief systems as ever having possible 
spiritual value to anyone, will find the
 ABCDEF annoyingly useless for promoting their theocratic 
agendas. Worse, these members of the
 Religious Reich will find that their own organizations (and quite a 
few large mainstream churches) are
 far more "cult-like" than the minority belief systems they so bitterly 
oppose.
  

 It should be pointed out that the ABCDEF is founded upon both 
modern psychological theories about
 mental health and personal growth, and my many years of 
participant observation and historical
 research into minority belief systems. Those who believe that 
relativism and anarchy are as dangerous
 to mental health as absolutism and authoritarianism, could (I 
suppose) count groups with total scores
 nearing either extreme (high or low) as being equally hazardous. As 
far as dangers to physical
 well-being are concerned, however, both historical records and 
current events clearly indicate the
 direction in which the greatest threats lie. This is especially so 
since the low-scoring groups usually
 seem to have survival and growth rates so small that they seldom 
develop the abilities to commit large
 scale atrocities even had they the philosophical or political 
inclinations to do so.

I really don't want to get involved in this. But I also don't want to 
unfairly injure anybody's honour. I presume you were the first one to 
post about the "missing posts"? Let me then make a clarification:

Luckily, the person I was refering to has written back to me after I 
made it clear to him that I would not guarantee the privacy of his 
communications if he continued to write to me. So I can now put my 
cards on the table.

The situation is simply this. I got a messege from Jonathan Grimes, 
wherein he was jubilant about how easy a time he had had tricking 
everybody into believing in the censorship rumor.  At this stage I 
thought I should write the four lines quoted above, since I saw that 
Max and other ExI members were being unfairly accused of censorship, 
and their webmaster was spending a lot of time trying to restore the 
missing part of the archive. It would have been wrong of me not to 
speak up.

It now appears [see quoted letter below] that Jonathan did perhaps 
not literally "trick" anybody, but perhaps he only encouraged Boog to 
post about the "censorship". And Boog may have acted in good faith, 
noticing that he couldn't retrieve Erik's messeges, and wrongly 
concluded that the ExI had censored them.

This nonsense has wasted enough time. Let's move on to something more 
fruitful.

Hello,

[Jonathan quoting himself:]

> things.

I knew you would misinterpret that. Has Mitch Porter contacted
you ? Do you want to know what happened between me and
Mitch ? Well everything was going great until I started saying
that I suspect Extropy is a cult. It is a cult you do realize
that don't you ? Well after that he started acting funny. Well
Mitch I have been nothing but a great friend to you and I told
you lots of fascinating things. I hope you enjoyed stabbing
me in the back on that list. You really find out who your
friends are in these situations. You do remember all about
what happened to Erik. Erik believed it was a cult too and well
they just couldn't handle it or so I am told. 

The word "trick" is merely a figure of speech.

At no point did I "trick" anyone into saying anything that
they DID NOT ALREADY THINK. I can not make people
say things they do not already think. It is like an  
operation where you place a microphone on someone and
you get them to reveal the

TRUTH ! 

I know the truth is a hard concept for Extropy to understand.

I think the transhumanist community can not handle the truth
about Extropy. 

I am now going to tell everyone what Max doesn't want you
to know. He fears me like no one else on that list. He is
scared to death of engaging me for fear of what I might
reveal. It will be revealed.

This is good advice. I will do it ! I will use an all honest campaign.
I don't want to destroy things for other people. You do not know what
I know about that organization but I know for a fact because of

LOGIC

that Max has hidden something in the Principal's list and I am
about to tell everyone. When I first discovered it I couldn't
believe it was true. Do you want me to tell you want it is outright ?

No sir, Mr. 87 you are not slated to die, you are slated to commit
voluntary amnesia.  It is my pleasure to inform you that after that is
complete you Mr.87 are going on a wonderful vacation.  Actually, for
this to be perfectly true the original plan would have to be slightly
changed where Mr. original stays in stasis while the 10 hours of work
is being completed.

No, Mr .87 you in fact did make the assignments yourself.  I can't
believe you don't remember.

Yes, that WAS you.  And no, you do not know what it is like to face
the prospect of immediate death you only know what it is like to face
the prospect of voluntary 10 hour amnesia.

It doesn't really matter why?  Another inconsistency in style.  Is
John Clark in trouble, do you have him tied and gaged?  Come on Harvey
this isn't funny.  If I just give up and agree with you will you let
him go? ;)

All right, I give up, your right I'm wrong now let him go!

If I had 1000 copies playing blackjack in Vegas they would all be

Okay, then how about if he said he found out that your wealth had been
divided by 1000 because of some unfortunate events in the U.S. economy
today.  And that your family and friends will welcome your
interactions with them 1000 times less.  This includes your friends on
the Extropian and Transhuman lists.  And then he continued to list
many more unfortunate things that happened to you today.  Then he
says, "but I can fix it all if you just let me use the device on you".
 Would you do it if all this was true?

Its not so much a contradiction in something you previously said.  Its
more where I perceive you to reside on the local memetic maxima bump
here at the top of the extropian fitness mountain peak.  At least your
still here on the tallest mountain in the world looking down at the
vast fitness deserts surrounding us.  Maybe the valley between our
fitness bumps is just experiencing tektonic plate shifting and I'm not
use to earthquakes.

I would doubt that very much. If the list of email addresses subscribed to a
list is available the spam can be made to look like it is coming through the
list but bypasses it altogether and simply spoofs the addresses to look like
it came from the list. Most will be none the wiser and in fact the list
owner can be made to look like a supporter of the spam. I mention this
because I saw it happen recently on the wholesys-list and really felt sorry
for the list owner who had no control over the situation.

not necessarily derek. what if your gasping body were to be tranplanted onto
the head of the chimp?  that way, "your" heart would continue, at least for a
while, altho the monkey probably wouldnt be all that pleased with the head

hi everybody, I'm emmanuel charpentier, french guy from Paris and new
to the list.

 I find the duplicates thought interesting, and see how much it can
lead to possibilities of divergences between two personas (and not one
of them has the right to be called "original", isn't it?). The main
divergence might not even be that you don't want to die or suffer
amnesia, but might simply be that you have important knowledge you
can't lose! (and there is knwoledge you can't share with others)

  Did you think about partials? You only duplicate part of your neural
net. Like in Greg Bear's eon, you use agents which are really copies
of parts of yourself.

   Another solution would simply be to have only one neural net (the
original :) but many thought processes. The configuration/topology of
the neural net is mainly the long term memory, the firing of neurons
and synapses is mainly the working memory, so you just need to
duplicate the later one... no? What you obtain is layers of persona.
You can have 1000 thought processes and just one neural net
configuration.

    Of course, it could still leads to serious troubles: how do you
share important new informations? How do you change the configuration
of the neural net (I guess sleep is a key)? What do you do with your
body, because you still have only one? Can a neural net layer function
normally without a body? Can there still be divergences between
layers? How do one layer integrate neural net changes made by another
layer (if there are any)?

    Bye. Manu.

I take complete responsibility for Jenny Chambers.

I take absolutely no responsibility for the censorship
rumour.

You are fabricating evidence. That is a serious criminal offence.

I have in no way tampered with the list archives.

The list archive computers are the property of Extropy.
I have in no way tampered with the list archive
computer system.

Tampering with the list archives is a criminal offence.

I am not a criminal.

You are accusing me of being a criminal.

I demand you retract this fabrication of evidence.

I demand an apology from Nicholas Bostrom and Extropy.

This is not a copy we're talking about, this is you. Sure, the you is a
copy of some other you, but this isn't the original wondering whether a
copy of himself will kill itself, but another you having to kill itself
after a few hours.

To clarify that statement: there is a very, very big difference between
sitting there happily in the duplication machine having decided that the
copy will kill itself and knowing that you're safe, and being the copy
and deciding to kill yourself. Unless you're already borderline suicidal
I can't see you doing it. Most people talk a lot bigger than they act,
and the instant the copy realises he's the one slated to die in a few
hours he's almost certainly going to have a change of heart.

If there was to be a new global standard for the "electricity grid", 
meaning the power outlets on the wall, which would be better, AC or 
DC?

If you were creating new cities all over the world, and had it to do 
all over again, would you choose 120 VAC, 24 VDC, or something else?

In terms of eliminating the needs for transformers, adapters, 
converters, etc., what would be the most efficient standard?

mr. grimes. did you redefine 'truth' and 'honesty' while i slept? every
word i've seen you write on this list and off it is without a doubt the
most appaling and ridiculously large amount of bullshit i've seen for a
very long time.

you _demand_ an apology? would you apologize to a rabid dog for shooting
its head off?

being somewhat of an authority on cult movements and mind control
tactics of the same, i am shocked by your actions towards extropy
institure and this list. extropy as a cult could be nothing further from
the truth.

i strongly suggest that you start reading up on the subjects you claim
to know to much of, i'm quite certain that the objective litterature
could work its way even to your mind and give you some understanding of
what extropy and transhumanism is. if this should still be a problem, i
suggest that you seek psychiatric and maybe even medical attention
before continuing your daily life.

i cannot denamd that you get removed, this is a free list, any less than
you can demand anything from your position. i can assure you that my
attorney wouldn't touch this case from your view, although i'd like to
see someone try. you accuse nick bostrom of fabricating evidence,
doesn't fabricating evidence include that there is a court in session?
you claim not to be a criminal. that may be so, but that doesn't stop me
from wishing you would be locked up. judging from your postings, i'd say
you're dangerous.

May I suggest that the most appropriate way of dealing with the drivel being propagated by Chambers et al is to ignore him/her/them completely.  Presumably, even an empty Vessel will get tired of its own rattling if ignored for long enough by those that it seeks to annoy.

I'm in Edmonton for a few days on business and happened
across this review in "The Edmonton Sun", a regional
newspaper. I'm planning on seeing this show this weekend
and hopefully meeting the creators. Perhaps this is the
first Transhuman comedy?


Theatre for Tecnophiles
(c) 1998 The Edmonton Sun

An impressive offering by two young Calgarians, Shared 
Accommodation is more than just a rote roommate-from-hell 
story. It's about space travel, academics, using others, 
remaking personalities ... and robots.

Yes, this reviewer simply must start by singling out the 
robotic co-star, Act Bot 2000, for special praise. Early 
arrivals at the theatre are allowed to view his initialization 
process as his servomotors are activated and his actor's 
warmup program loosens his lips ("Mwah! Mwah! Mwah! Hey, 
man, good luck out there.'')

But once the play begins, he disappears utterly into the 
role of Simon Gentle, bookish, high-strung and hostile 
postgraduate student. All members of Edmonton's robotic 
community - especially the mayor - should take in Act Bot 
2000's work. He's easily the best robot actor since Dolph 
Lundgren.

Simon's research into nanotechnology - tiny robots effecting 
repairs and alterations to larger bodies - is constantly 
being disrupted by his roommate O'Ryan Hauser (Jamie Northan), 
a grating and ingratiating sociology student whose abuse of 
etiquette, good taste and himself drive Simon to distraction.

The dynamic ("You are spiders' eggs hatching from my ears'') 
is plausible and even pleasurable enough, but what takes the 
play beyond sitcom territory is the solution the duo hits upon. 
At a personal low ebb, O'Ryan suggests using Simon's technology 
to restructure his personality.

The show then becomes a comment on science, scientific 
competitions and the nature of friendship - but with many 
zingers. Some of the physical humor is clumsy, and - as noted 
by Sun reviewer Garnet Fraser, also in attendance - the breadth 
of Northan's transformation sometimes strains credulity. But the 
writing is always there, and the conclusion metes out a rough 
moral justice for an odd couple that is constantly getting even.

Northan and Act Bot 2000 are promising and compatible prototypes. 
Release to the mass market is recommended.

An AC standard makes most semse for a distribution system. In the 
future, the present copper webworks may not exist, and be replaced 
with small generators or fuel cells at the point of use. Here in 
Illinois, Commonwealth Edison is planning on selling small natural-
gas powered turbogenerators to consumers who then make their own 
power, free of the grid. The generators will produce 60 Hz AC because 
all our systems expect it now.

For machinery, 3-phase AC is king, as the induction motor requires 
it, sepecially in the larger horsepower ranges. Advances in power 
inverters may make this obsolete, as the required AC can be created 
from DC if needed.

AC has one big advantage over DC - the voltage can be simply raised 
and lowered with transformers to allow transmission of power over 
long distances. There have been a (very) few high voltage DC 
transmission lines - the one I remember most is a coaxial cable from 
England to France that transfers power from whoever has the surplus 
to who needs it. There's a bidirectional HV inverter on each end of 
the cable to connect to that countries' AC grid.

If fuel cells or some breakthrough in home nuclear power becomes 
popular, the generator will probably produce DC. In this case, a 
local inverter can make AC for motors, etc. Lighting can work as 
efficiently from either DC or AC.

A 24 V DC system would be OK for small loads, but you need heavy 
wires to conduct the current required for big loads, one reason that 
440 V 3-phase is so popular in industry - the wiring is much cheaper 
than if a lower voltage was used.

Reversed my position? When? Where? I always said that death means
having a
last thought, and provided you have up to date backup, you can't have
a last
thought. In the thought experiment proposed for Mr. 87 and the 99
other
copies  the last 10 hours of their life was heading for a dead end and
a
last thought, this was not true for Mr. Original, hence the asymmetry.

I'm not sure that a global system is feasible, possible, or even 
desireable.  An important aspect of this is that the power signals 
worldwide are split between 50 & 60 Hz.

But it doesn't matter.

The production of power should be localized such that the need for
big ol' power plants is minimized because so many people produce
energy themselves for their own usage and for sale.

Personal power production should and will become as important in the
future as personal transportation is now.

The generating utility that stands behind the d&t utility from which
I buy my power from has a big ol' DC line running from a huge power 
plant in central North Dakota to the east side of Minnesota. I would 
guess that this line runs at least 400 miles (640 km).

Don't forget windmills. We will soon be entering a time when the
technology used for wind turbines will allow them to be used in
more places than thought possible and for a cost that will allow
people and normally energy consuming businesses to have one for
themselves.

If I ever get the chunk of land I want, I will put up a wind farm. 
It's great for free bursts, and if El Nino keeps getting worse, might 
even become reliable here. Storing power is still problematical, but 
I have read of 'super' capacitors - on the order of thousands of 
farads - that are being developed for electric vehicles. With a 
storage plant made of those, we might even be able to tap into the 
occasional lightning strike on the wind turbine..

Do you have any more info on the DC link in Minnesota? I would be 
interested in reading more about it..

How does that support your claim that it makes sense to say that you

But I too would say all absolute priors three are 1/3. But these are 
the probabilities you should assign if you knew absolutely nothing, 
not even that you existed. In practice, you will always know you 
exist. If you conditionalize on this information then you get 
p'(*)=0, p'(#)=p'(@)=1/2. Now if you want you can call this new 
probability distribution, p'=p( _ | "I exist."), your "prior". (What 
information you include in the "prior" depends at the task at hand.)

At this stage you will want to consider conditional probabilities 
such as:

p'("I'm in world # at position 4d."| "I'm in world #.")

Do the same for world @. Then inverst these conditional probabilities 
with Bayes' theorem. Then suppose you find out that you live at time 
4. Use this information to update your the conditional probabilities. 
What you get is the doomsday conclusion!

But now it seems you and I have the same priors for all the worlds.

Sure, but this reasoning only works for things that may or may not be 
present where there are observers. Stones are a good example. But 
many other phenomena are correlated with the presense of observers 
and then this reasoning doesn't work. For instance, as you yourself 
has argued in your "Must early life be easy?"-paper, it would be 
wrong to use the observation that evolutionary processes here on 
Earth were fairly quick to infer that quick evolutionary processes 
are common in the universe; for we would not have existed if the 
particular evolutionary process we observe had not been quick enough 
to happen before the sun becomes a red gigant.

Now, of all phenomena imaginable, none has a stronger correlation 
with the presense of observers than the presense of observers. And 
yet you want to use the presense of this observer, Robin Hanson, to 
infer that there are probably many observers! This looks like an 
extreme form of the same mistake you warn against in your paper.

Making an exact duplicate of yourself is not necessary.  Assuming the
technology made it economically viable, you could generate an entity that
only had those of your experiances that enabled it to do the work. 

There is no reason why you would have to give it your exact memories
either, you could take an "off the shelf" package of memories which
ensured the entity would enjoy the work. 

Having completed the days work and having no knowledge that it has only
been in existence for half a day, the entity would return home to sleep.
At this time the new experiances gained can be downloaded and the entity
terminated.  There is no descision to blow its own brains out.

We are talking counterfactuals here.  I am male, but could I
imagine being female?  Yes.  Could I imagine being born in 1400?
Yes. Could I imagine being a chimp?  Yes.  Can I imagine being a rock?
Yes.  I see no boundary beyond which I can't imagine the variation.
They all seem like reasonable counterfactuals to me.  What reasons
can you offer for rejecting some counterfactuals and accepting others?

We seem to disagree on the math here.  And since one of the reasons
for precise models like this is so we can agree on such things, we
really aught to get this clear.  I say that since the probability
of existing conditional on being in universes # and @ is different,
you can't have equal probabilities for these universes BOTH for an
absolute prior AND after you condition on existing.  If they are
equal to 1/2 after conditioning on existing, they cannot be both
equal to 1/3 before conditioning.  Could you please recheck your
calculations?

But my paper does things exactly the way I'm reccomending here.
I choose a prior to have nice natural independence properties,
without assuming that I exist.  I then condition on my existing and
find posterior probabilities are no longer independent in the way
one might naively expect.  If I had chosen independence conditional
on existing I wouldn't have gotten any of the results I did.

While postering at Melbourne University I noticed posters advertising  
Damien Broderick as one person giving a lecture at the Student Union 
next week. 

Interested transhumanists in Melbourne might want to attend. 
Unfortunately I left the details at home, probably the best thing to do 
would be to contact the Student Union or Mr Broderick.

I have decided that it is wisest to define myself as a 'sentist' rather 
than 'transhumanist' as the latter is too limiting as is tied to the 
notion of species and 19-20th century thinking. After all, I support 
land rights for gay and lesbian vegan whales. In absolute seriousness, 
and I attempt not to lie. After all, one day I will bump into one at the 
local milk bar (inidividual small business general store and 
take-away) and meet such a being. Of course, they may no longer be 
species-defined (if they have chosen not to be). We can be the 
developers and definers of our own architecture. All sentient beings, 
whatever their nature, can be our brothers, sisters and significant 
others. 

I suppose the distinction would be similar to that between a vegan and a 
vegetarian. Vegans are concerned about use of animal products not only 
because of concerns over killing but issues of consent in harvesting and 
experimentation. Sentists would have similar concerns.

I wrote a poem about such things some time ago:

  In Celebration of the Techno-Rapture 
  we take these steps freely and of our own will.
  To offer all sentient beings liberation from death, pain and 
    suffering.
  To offer all sentient beings boosting, meshing, assistance and 
    entrance into the multiverse, including hypertopia.
  We seek this through choice and the flowering of monad. *
  This is our promise,
  in the name of our love and the love of the nodal stem of this 
    universe.

  [* monad = individual group mind inputs (i.e. 'memetic' fields) and 
neurological group mind possibilities as defined within nodal stem 
parameters, i.e. 'scientific' definitional structures]
  Other events flow from this admittedly spiritual understanding, and 
its viewpoint of self-directed evolution subsuming evolution based 
on random mutation and natural selection. For example, the Ecoburst 
[the end of the non-consensual birth/death cycle at ecosystem, monadic, 
memetic and Gaian levels], Earthreturn [transference of consciousness 
neo-Tiplerite viewpoint], Earthextension and Activation [multiversal 
neo-Tiplerite viewpoint]. We shall all get to find out soon enough I 
suppose.

PS
Again, along neo-Tiplerite lines:
You gals and guys have been looking at the hill in from of you, but 
distantly, on the horizon itself, if you look carefully, you can see a 
mountain range, and beyond that, something in the clouds...

SECOND AND THIRD ESCALATIONS ('Singularities') on universal level:

The second Escalation/Singularity is anticipated in 10-100 billion years 
time (the particular period will be quick), after the last escalating 
world has gone through the process of flowering in a 'natural' sense. 
[Why? Check Quarantine and the Book of Job.] This can be considered as 
the Escalation/Singularity of the gods/God/and others. After this point 
other systems of operation will enter directly into this universe.

Third Escalation/Singularity:
vaguelly sensed, dealing with multiverse boundary conditions from total 
sentient-universes perspective.

----------

Transhumanists can expect to fragment along societal lines - to a degree 
- even Extropians will find the same process at work. Diversity can be 
embraced - it's a hoot. The Omega 'Point' or - I believe - Matrix - can 
encompass the 'bad' people. They do not need to be 'punished' by 
'leaving them behind' - it is sufficient to ensure that acts of force 
are consensual through assistance to the recipients of such force from 
more complex consciousness. Spiritually, this is a deep issue indeed, 
and has been discussed for millenia. It is directly tied into to choice 
as the ultimate boundary condition of the multiverse. Perhaps this may 
seem a little weird or disconnected as a topic of discussion - now. I 
believe it will not seem so in twenty-five or thirty years time.

Perhaps Transhumanists should link their sites to the Church of Bob? I'd 
vote for it.

I've been taking melatonin for almost three years now.  At first, I was taking
6 mg 1 hour before bedtime every night.  For the last 18 months, I've cut the
dosage back to 3 mg every evening.  I also use it very effectively it to
address jet lag when I cross lots of time zones.

There's no question in my mind that melatonin works well to reset your clock
and induce sleep with no after-effects of next-day grogginess.  For this
effect alone, I find it extremely valuable, since I otherwise occasionally
suffer from work-induced stress-sleeplessness: Just being able to get a good
night's sleep during high-pressure projects is a high value.

I believe I have experienced some mild amplification of dream intensity with
melatonin, both in comparison to the time before I took it and those periods
of up to a week when I haven't taken it in the last couple of years.

I can't speak to the potential for broader systemic benefits, since I haven't
done a control with a clone :-) I'm unaware of any long-term rigorous
experiments that are being done, but I'm someone is carrying out such
research.  I would be very curious to see the results of any such studies.

Over the last couple of weeks I've had a discussion with a friend off-list
about smart drugs and other nutrient supplements and had other occasions to
wish for guidance on the best available information on anti-aging substances.
Perhaps because the supplement business IS a big and growing business, there
is an overwhelming amount of material available on the web, much of it in the
nature of advertising and promotion.  

Can list member suggest resources that add value to the great mass of
information that is available?  In particular, I and I think a lot of people
are looking for two things: Order and Quality.  Are there any sites out there
that do a decent job of organizing up-to-date information about supplements
and offer quality information about them?

Laser Focus World (a laser trade magazine) had a nice article on this
project a few months ago. I don't recall any cost figures in that article.
The web site mentioned above has more nice pictures, but less text than the
LFW article.

I think 5 years is optimistic due to possible guidance problems, the little
model has little or no manuvering capacity, and though there are methods
for compensating for air turbulence, these are low power methods and I
don't think they can be applied for high power IR lasers.

In the long term, this has great potential. LEO requires about 20Kwh/Kg, or
about $2.60/Kg at my local PG&E ripoff rates. At 1% system efficiency, this
is $260/Kg, definitely an improvement over the $3000/Kg for the Space
Shuttle. (Note: IR CO2 lasers operate at about 15%, so we have a 15x fudge
factor here)

As for average joe satellites, when costs get this low, orbits become a
scarce resource, just as they are for geosynch slots right now. And such
resources become by necessity regulated.....

i recall in school a lecture on why we got ac in the first place.  turns
out, those arguments used then are still valid today.  if all electrical
equipment were to suddenly disappear and need to be totally replaced,
we would set up ac again, although the voltage might go a bit lower
and frequency would be made the same the world around.

although point generators are likely, i think the copper grid
willcontinue to to be useful for a loooong time as a power distribution
system and a possible waveguide for communications, such as
web access and tv signals.  there's no reason why the power company
cannot get into the game of information distribution over the
infrastructure they have already built.  spike

i saw an old friend from college last night.  his wife has been diagnosed
with multiple sclerosis.  not only can she no longer work, but her medical
bills are staggering.  the medication alone is exceeding 1000 bucks a
month now, and whats worse, there are known harmful side effects, such
as immunosupression, mood swings etc.  if that were not bad enough,
one of their doctors is arguing that the medication is not effective.  but
how can they be sure?

how can we filter out the fact that poor health can make one poor?  spike

I have question concerning Tipler's beliefs. I've
heard people on this list say he uses his Omega
Point theory to justify his religious beliefs, but
from what I understand his theory states that
there will be infinite computation and all beings
that have ever existed or could have existed will
be resurrected. Does he use this as justification
for religious beliefs? Personally I can't see any
link between the potential existence of a God-like
entity and worship. Or does the Omega Point have a
huge ego that must be satisfied by long-dead
entities going to church?

Not directly, but his aim is rather clear by his theological
speculations in PoI and the fact that he proposes an omega-point state
that is awfully close to the typical western concept of God even when
alternatives (such as a fractally divering pantheon of Powers or
something similar) are possible within the OPT framework.

Tipler doesn't propose worship (other than the fundamentally important
mega-project of starting the omega-development process), but his
theorty seems to give at least some people the same comforts as
standard religion: there is a wonderful eternal life to look forward
to, the evils of the world are necessary but will be corrected, and so
on. Not quite a religion in the social sense (yet), but not far off.

This is my (extremely limited, two data points) experience too. It
does wonders with jet-lag, and this is a well documented area.

So far there is no good scientific evidence for life extension; lots
of intriguing hints and studies that can be doubted, but no evidence I
would bet on. 

See for example

@article{Brzezinski97a,
   author = {A. Brzezinski},
   title = {Melatonin in humans},
   journal = {N Engl J Med},
   volume = {336},
   number = {3},
   pages = {186--95},
   month = {Jan 16},
   year = {1997},
   keywords = {Aging/physiology Animal Circadian Rhythm/physiology Female Human Male Melatonin/immunology/*physiology/secretion Neoplasms/physiopathology Pineal Body/secretion Puberty/physiology Receptors, Cell Surface/physiology Reproduction/physiology Sleep/physiology}
}

He mentions that it *may* enhance immune response, protect against
tumors and influence sexual maturation. The antioxidant effects are
likely only in pharmacologic concentrations, not in the ordinary
concentrations.

Personally, I will likely only use melatonin to fix jet lag until I
notice that my leves start to decrease overly due to aging.

If I am not mistaken, the word is "anagram".  A palindrome is a phrase that
has a symmetrical character sequence (e.g. "Madam, I'm Adam").

yup you're right james .  i juggled the letters trying to find
a middle name that would make jenny peter chambers
an anagram, but couldnt do it.  sigh.  when a gag is
being played i always hope for a sophisticated one.
good satire is that which so resembles reality that
one is unsure if the piece is actually satire.  "jenny" was too

as a gag.  perhaps baboons would be cheaper?  can you

that with chimps.  the experiment only has to keep your

When it was founded, the extropians e-mail list had a well-defined charter
with an articulated set of rules regarding list etiquette and discipline.  For
a significant period, it was a private facility available only to members of
Extropy Institute and other paying subscribers.  As a matter of history, its
early period was characterized primarily by discussions among individuals who
by and large knew each other off-list. 

A little over three years ago, the list changed its technical basis (adopting
off-the-shelf majordomo software and changing its server-host).  At that time
the list no longer requiring a subscription fee.  Participation in the list
broadened to include many people who had no personal acquaintance with the
original list founders or with each other.

The time has come for adoption of some new, minimal but clear statement of
principles, guidelines and procedures to be observed in connection with the
list.  Accordingly, the following document has been adopted by Extropy
Institute in connection with the list.  This document will be available at
ExI's web site and new subscribers will automatically receive it.  Please read
it carefully.

The officers and directors of Extropy Institute believe that this list is a
valuable component of its subscribers' participation in cyberspace.  We
appreciate your dialogue here and hope that the principles, guidelines and
procedures set out below will enhance your use of the list.  Thank you for
your attention to this matter.

LIST PRINCIPLES, GUIDELINES AND PROCEDURES

	SUBSCRIPTION TO THE EXTROPIANS E-MAIL LIST 
	IS DEEMED TO BE AGREEMENT TO AND 
	ACCEPTANCE OF THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPLES, 
	GUIDELINES, TERMS, CONDITIONS AND PROCEDURES:

Extropy Institute sponsors the Extropians e-mail List.  As such ExI is the
List "owner" and sets standards of dialogue as a foundation for civil dialogue
concerning topics of interest to transhumanists.  Subscription to the
Extropians List is deemed to be agreement to the following statement of
principles and guidelines and to the standards and procedures for List
discipline set out below.

As with any other e-mail list or cyberspace forum, the Extropians List is a
social space, as well as a discussion forum.  Accordingly, good manners are
appreciated and bad manners cannot be tolerated.  While good-natured humor is
encouraged, personalistic sarcasm, taunts and insults are not tolerated.
Flame wars are strictly prohibited.

List members are encouraged to work out any personal issues off-list and
subscription to the List is deemed to be a grant of permission to all current
List subscribers to send personal, off-list e-mail for the purposes of
attempting to resolve personal issues.  Unsubscription is deemed to be a
withdrawal of such permission.  Sending of unwelcome e-mail by List
subscribers or ex-subscribers is neither sanctioned nor condoned by ExI or any
Internet host of List software or operation, but neither ExI nor any Internet
host of List software or operation can take any responsibility for conduct by
subscribers to the List, either in postings to the List or in communication or
activity off-list.

Failure to abide by the guidelines described above will result in expulsion
from the List.  Expulsion from the List is the sole prerogative of Extropy
Institute.  ExI reserves the right to unsubscribe any List subscriber at any
time, without notice.  However, as a courtesy to List subscribers, ExI will
attempt to undertake the following procedures prior to unsubscription of any
List subscriber:

1. Any List subscriber or any two members of ExI's board of directors may
initiate a complaint regarding on-List communication by any List subscriber.
Such a complaint is initiated by sending a message to complaints@extropy.org.
This complaint must (a) state the specific communication complained of and (b)
certify that the complaining subscriber has attempted in good faith to resolve
the matter off-List.  Failure to include these two items in a complaint will
result in no action being taken by ExI. Although ExI will attempt to maintain
the privacy of complaints, ExI makes no guarantee that the secrecy of
complaints can be maintained.

2.  ExI will attempt to resolve the dispute through off-list communication
with the subscribers involved.

3. The result of a complaint will either be unsubscription of the subscriber
about whom a complaint has been lodged, or informing the complaining
subscriber that no action will be taken.

4.  Either the complaining subscriber in the case of a "no-action" result or
the subscriber about whom a complaint has been lodged may appeal the result of
the action by sending a message to appeals@extropy.org.  ExI will attempt to
convene a panel of members of Extropy Institute who are not directors or
officers of ExI to voluntarily serve as a forum for the appeal.  The parties
to the appeal will then be informed of the result of the appeal, or that an
appellate panel cannot be formed.  Selection of the appellate panel is at the
sole prerogative of ExI.  Decisions of the appellate panel are final.

5.  ExI will make every effort to follow the procedure above and to do so in
the most timely and efficient manner possible.  However, as an organization
staffed by voluntary labor, ExI cannot make any guarantee that this procedure
will be followed and List subscription confers no right upon subscribers to
insist that ExI do so.

Well, suppose there were two possible worlds, A and B, that are a 
priori equally probable. In A there are a hundred humans and nothing 
else. In B there are a hundred humans and a million stones. If you 
know this and nothing more except that you exist and are a human, 
what would you say the posterior probabilities are for the two 
worlds?

I would say 1/2. Finding myself being a human would give me no 
information as to the number of stones.

But in order to get this result we need to assume that there was a 
zero chance that you would have been a stone.

Let's take it slowly and write it out in full:

Let * be "Universe * exists." And similarly for # and @. Let Me be "I 
exist."

P(*)=1/3
P(#)=1/3
P(@)=1/3

I think we have agreed about that. That's what I call the absolute 
priors. Then I say that 

P(* | Me)=0
P (#  | Me)=1/2
P (@  | Me)=1/2

By Bayes' theorem, that implies:

P(Me | *) = P(* | Me)P(Me)/P(*)
= (0*P(Me))/(1/3) = 0

Likewise:

P(Me | #) = P(# | Me)P(Me)/P(#)
= ((1/2)*P(Me))/(1/3) = (3/2)P(Me)

and

P(Me | @) = P(@ | Me)P(Me)/P(@)
= ((1/2)*P(Me))/(1/3) = (3/2)P(Me)

Since we have P(Me)=P(Me|*)P(*)+P(Me|#)P(#)+P(Me|@)P(@),

we get P(Me)=0+(3/2)P(Me)(1/3)+(3/2)P(Me)(1/3) = P(Me)

I don't see any inconsistency.

But when you are conditioning on your existing, what you do is 
increase the probability of those worlds with many observers (SIA). 
[And with the views you have expressed about the reference class 
problem, you even want to increase the estimated number of stones??? 
Let's set that to one side for the moment.] And I say, if you look in 
one place, and find an X there, then that gives you reason to believe 
there are many Xs; but *only* if the reason why you looked where you 
looked was not that there was an X there. Otherwise independence 
fails. That's why you can't infer "There are many quick evolutionary 
processes." (I assume you agree with that?) But why, then, do you 
want to infer from finding that you are an observer that there are 
many observers? (That's what you want to do, right?) This looks like 
the paradigmatic case where independence fails. Being an observer and 
finding that you are an observer are surely not statistically 
independent events. (Right?) So, since independence fails completely 
in this case, you should not infer from finding that you are an 
observer that there are many observers. (Do you accept this? If not, 
exactly where do you begin to disagree?)

I think you and I are the only extropes in town, AP, but still...  It's a
talk at the Roden White library, 2nd floor of the Union, at 1 pm.

Did an interesting stint at the Victorian International Writers' Festival
yesterday, a place crowded with the great and the good doing their annual
presentations-of-self.  I was on a panel about the limits of science with
Paul Davies and a microbiologist/novelist zanie named Sally Morrison.  I
spoke on matters Spikish, emphasising the prospect of extended longevity.
To my surprise and delight, most of the questions afterward were for me -
many of them incredulous, naturally, but all intrigued by the transhuman
ideas.

And the latest issue of *Eureka Street*, an Aussie public affairs/cultural
journal published by, of all bodies, the Jesuits, has a substantial piece
by me on the Spike and the promise of nanotechnology.  It's possible to get
the memes churning out there, people, via the oddest vectors...

I know myself of at least four alternative persons - artists - following 
the various transhumanist movements, also Patrick Wilken (visual 
neurophysiology and eco-activist) from the Consciousness group 
(editor of Psyche journal)(at Monash Uni), plus one alternative person 
in Sydney and one in Brisbane. Also, of course, Peter Singer at Monash 
(bio-ethicist and author of Animal Liberation 1975) has briefly provided 
his views on lifespan extension in the front page of the Saturday 
supplement to The Age. Paul Davies perhaps qualifies.

HEROIN, ILLEGALITY AND INTERNAL FREEDOM
Avatar Polymorph

The question of the legality of heroin is one that has been frequently 
addressed by many commentators, and relates directly to the alleged 
social and moral implications of heroin usage. I have injected heroin a 
number of times. I can see little connection between its effects and the 
alleged social and moral implications of heroin usage put forward by 
anti-legalisation commentators. I can, however, see quite direct 
connections between its addictive qualities, its expense and the actions 
of those heroin takers who are addicted to it. If cigarettes were banned 
tomorrow I believe you would find tobacco smokers behaving like heroin 
addicts very shortly thereafter. That is, paying large amounts of money 
for an illegal substance and, if relatively poor, stealing and acting as 
sex workers for quick cash. As a former packet a day smoker, I remember 
selling books and records in desperation when my income level was low, 
in common with many artists. 

The reality of this situation is very much obvious, even to conservative 
commentators. There are a number of hidden or unspoken agendas at work.

1. Heroin use is perceived as a social threat because it does involve 
new and altered states of consciousness, which are linked to the drug 
and alternative cultures.

2. Heroin use is labelled particularly 'bad' as it allows for 
concealment of the lack of compassion on the part of conservative 
commentators. These commentators laud positivism and 'life' while 
accepting all sorts of adverse consequences flowing from the current 
hypocrisy. In the case of the illegality of heroin, these commentators 
rarely mention the growing numbers of deaths and illnesses and slow 
deaths stemming from the illegality of heroin. I have held the hand of 
an overdose victim suffering an epileptic fit on Smith Street [a 
Melbourne heroin centre] - one who stole from me once - while corrupt 
police drove by, those same police who mouth platitudes. Unknown dosages 
and contaminated syringe usage are the physical problem, not heroin 
itself. Conservative commentators claim to be worried about the 
addiction, rather than the social challenge of alternative ways of 
thinking.

My personal viewpoint on these matters is two-fold. Firstly, I would 
assert, as a general principle, that every person has the right to 
control their own bodies, provided that they are not directly hurting 
another. This includes the right to take drugs, whether poison, 
nicotine, heroin, caffeine, marijuana, LSD or any form of medication or 
therapy. This would make non-consensual smoking in the immediate 
vicinity of non-smokers or the provision of alcohol to a violent and 
aggressive person who is already drunk things to be avoided.

Secondly, I would suggest that research be done to create a form of 
non-addictive heroin. While there may be physical limitations to 
chemical alteration of heroin, the existence of neurotransmitters 
similar in structure to opiates points to the viability of such a 
possibility. This would increase the options for heroin users and 
clarify the real issues involved. Similar research could be done for 
nicotine and addiction, and perhaps also its cancerous effects. 
Governments in general would currently oppose such research, just as 
they oppose research into LSD. The importance of this issue will not go 
away. It is a matter of general principle. The denial of legal heroin by 
conservatives, and specifically by the police - as I can attest to 
personally from my experience in government circles - is symbolic. 
Removal of the addictive element would help clarify the debate.

It is possible that conservatives will shortly seek to restrict access 
to genetic therapies, genetic splicing and intra-cellular 
nanotechnology. It is a fundamental moral and spiritual right to control 
your own body, up to and including suicide. What does the future hold? 
In a world where advanced automation and nanotechnolgy are about to 
remove the necessity for manual work and capital, it will be possible to 
manufacture drugs within the body and experience altered states of 
consciousness continuously. This is one option open to people, and a 
legitimate one. Conservatives may attempt to restrict this option, and, 
indeed, go further, by attempting to control the neurological 
consciousness of others against their will, the 'Big Brother' approach. 
This is the wider context of the issue of opiates, other currently 
illegal recreational drugs and altered states of consciousness. The same 
people who tell us that the death of others is better than controlled 
provision of heroin may, in two decades time, be arguing that designer 
neurotransmitters and direct access to the Internet - via optical and 
aural nerves - should be restricted and monitered by the government. The 
championing of choice, begun in the 1960s by such prophets and moral 
teachers as Timothy Leary, will, however, continue, and is attested by 
the positive attitude of youth towards freedom of exploration.

I wasn't considering universes of different sizes, but on reflection
my prior gives exactly the result you prefer.  As you recall, my
approach was to divide universes into space-time regions, define
states as universe-space-time combinations, and put equal priors
across such states.

It seems as if both of your worlds have one time slot, world A has
100 spatial slots, and world B has a million + 100 spatial slots.
Equal priors on states implies unequal priors on worlds (where the
prior of a world adds up all the priors of states associated with it.)
But then conditioning on being a human, we get equal world posteriors
back again.

Consistent perhaps, but it doesn't address the model I detailed.
Perhaps it is my fault for not more clearly distinguishing states from
universes.  A state says which is the true universe *and* which space-time
spot I occupy.  I was preferring equal priors over *states*.  If the prior
of a universe it taken to be the sum of priors of associated states, then
in that sense I also prefer equal priors over universes.

In my model "I exist" was interpreted first as "I'm an H or P".  Since
universe @ has more space-time slots filled by Hs and Ps than universe #
has, then P(I'm H or P | @) > P(I'm H or P | #) if all the states
associated with a universe have equal priors.

No, I don't follow this.  I don't see what independence has to do
with anything.  To repeat myself again, the way to figure out what
you can infer is to set up a state space, a prior, information sets,
and turn the crank.  That tells you everything there is to say about
what you can infer.  No independence need be assumed for this to work.

Would someone briefly summarize Tipler's argument here? The local library
doesn't carry The Physics of Immortality and I don't want to buy the book
to find out.

The requirements to have the chimp ready, the OR ready, etc, let alone the
problems re tissue rejection, hormones, etc, are much more than those for
having a transport team standby and the equipment set up for immediate
cooling upon pronounciation of death. And soon, the assisted suicide laws
will make things even more feasible. One major concern with primate bodies
is whether a brain grafted to them will be damaged by the various
biochemical differences.

Thomas Donaldson has published an excellent source book called "A Guide to
Anti-Aging Drugs". It comes in a small binder and he updates it now and
then. Everyting discussed has at least animal studies supporting it. Many
of these items are either OTC or available at health food stores. Cost is
about $ 30.00, IMHO a Bargain!

I shamelessly plug my own book, _Nutrients_Catalog_, as a source of
information about nutrients.  Info can be found at
<http://www.gate.net/~harv/nutrientscatalog>.

The main page has some quotes from various reviewers.  The "Recommended
by..." menu shows Internet references to the book I have found online. 
The "Nutrients Catalog..." menu has excerpts from the book including the
Table of Contents, Preface, How to Use this Book, and a couple of the
small appendices.  The "Available Online..." menu links to online
bookstores that sell the book.

Disclaimer:  I'm biased because I'm the author.  Take a look at the info
and decide for yourself.  I don't sell books directly, but I get a
kickback if you buy it from Amazon.com, and I get royalties on every
book sold.  Strangely, I get more money for referring customers to
Amazon.com than the publisher pays me for writing the book.

I intended this book to cover every nutrient known, mistakenly thought,
or falsely claimed to be a nutrient for humans.  I deliberately gave
various doseage recommendations so no one can tell if I personally
believe in megadoses or the RDA's.  I also give alleged benefits as well
as alleged problems with each nutrient.  I am not trying to push people
toward or away from nutrition.  It is a reference book for looking up
data; it is not a readable book or a how-to book.

Does ExI have a lending library for members?  I would gladly donate a
copy of the book to ExI, or to someone who wants to review it for this
list.  Since this is in response to Hara Ra, you can have first dibs on
a free copy if you want it.

I haven't read the book (I only became aware that
there was a book after following several links
from your own web site) but I read the reviews and
wondered if Tipler had specifically said this was
the Christian God. I looked it up at Amazon and
the reviewers were split between those who think
it's the ultimate satire and those who think
Tipler's trying to confuse them with physics.
Strangely, no religious persons had commented.

So in reality his ideas are not justification for
religious practise.

If the universe is open, would it be possible to
collapse it? Or if not collapse it, how about
constructing a massively dense *thing* with a huge
gravitational pull and dragging all the other
matter our way. Seems like a good alternative to
interstellar travel.

I doubt very much that the book is satire.  Tipler's argument may or
may not be persuasive, but he appears to intend it seriously.  He had
been developing it for a number of years before publishing the book.

> So in reality his ideas are not justification for

He seems to mean it more as an attempt to bridge the separate cultures of
science and religion/morality, to suggest that there may be this common
ground between them.  He's not saying you need to go to Confession every
Sunday.  But there are branches of theology that are much more liberal
than the country parson who takes the Bible literally.  These people are
more open to examining the implications of mankind acquiring godlike
powers in the future.

> If the universe is open, would it be possible to

Tipler has physics in the appendices which is over my head.  But he seems
to be saying that localized collapse is not good enough, that it has to
be the universe as a whole.  And that would mean that the universe has
to be closed, from what I understand.

Bring the mountain to Mohammed, eh?  You will have to cultivate
considerable patience.

ah, but that was different, hara: the churchmen had direct scriptural
evidence in  acts 1:11.  after christ ascended, the disciples were gawking
after him and an angel appeared and said, "ye men of galilee, why stand
ye gazing into the heavens?"  galileo galilee had a direct heaven sent
command to knock off the star gazing.  could lead to trouble...  {8^D spike

Depends on your assumptions, no?  If you assume that all
the copies are the same person, then they aren't having a
*last* thought, but only a few that are unrelated to the next,
exactly as a person with amnesia might.  If you begin by 
assuming that they are *not* the same person, then all of 
the copies have a last thought.  This seems to me to be a
pretty clear reversal, since you have previously argued that
the copies in a situation like this are all manifestations of one
person, rather than people in their own right.

To cut to the quick, three-phase AC would be the best choice for several
reasons. It runs large-load motors *much* more efficiently, you have less
induction loss when pushing it over long distances (so it's easier and
ultimately cheaper to deliver to your door), and AC is a bit safer for
human beings who accidentally come into contact with it (as anyone who has
accidentally grabbed (and been unable to let go of) the high voltage DC
output of, say, a neon sign, can attest) (yes, I'm guilty as 'charged')
(Although AC is by no means "safe"  - just safer  - it can still easily
kill if one is unwise/unlucky enough).

For various technical reasons, we might want to have slightly lower
standard voltages than we use today, and we'd certainly all want to get on
the same frequency bandwagon (the world is split between 60ishand 50ish
Hertz now, which is a pain, especially in places like Japan where they
actually have parallel electrical grids systems with each!)

There is apparently some very powerful theorems that say that you
can't, but I'm not versed enough in GR to say much more. My guess is
that the best bet would be making a closed baby universe and escaping,
or going the Dyson way to survive the open universe.

Nice idea, although I don't believe in it. It seems that the
distinction between topological long-term changes and short term
activities is rather blurred; most likely there are processes on all
scales, making the short-term effects (calcium levels, dynamical
synapses etc) necessary for longer-term effects (LTP, synaptic
movements) and permanent storage. So the thought processes would have
trouble with their long-term memory: each would suffer a kind of
encoding impairment that would likely be rather distressing.

Sleep is likely the key of long-term memory consolidation, but
obviously we learn during the day before going to sleep too. Maybe, if
we are lucky (but don't count on it, this is something I'm almost
certain doesn't work) you would only need to deal with the medial
temporal lobe memory system. Then each process will have its own copy
of the MTL and during sleep the exoself could run consolidation
between the MTL of process 1 and the shared cortex, then consolidation
for process 2, and so on. But don't count on it, most likely low-level
learning is going on across the cortex as a part of normal thinking.

> What do you do with your body, because you still have only one?

Why only one? If you can do this with the neural nets, making extra
bodies should be fairly simple (for those who want bodies. I would
like to exist partially as processes on the net)

>Can a neural net layer function
> normally without a body?

Can a human function normally without a body? Most likely no, although
the definition of normal may change. We are input-output driven, and
without inputs we tend to fall asleep or get sensory deprivation
problems, and without body feedback emotions become blunted. Most
likely even completely virtual people will need simulated bodies, at
least until they can be modified enough to handle new senses and forms
of action.

The quick version:

1. Tipler shows that it is possible under certain conditions (closed
universe, Taub-like collapse, Higgs mass in a certain range etc) to
have an Omega Point (infinite processing, info storage and life goes
on forever).

[ This part is fairly accepted, people might disagree with the
feasibility of some steps (like extracting the shear energy of the
universe, colonizing it all or surviving as high frequency plasma
states) but it is mainly "technical" problems. Nothing more than
ordinary cosmological engineering :-) ]

2. Tipler hypothesizes that the universe has a future Omega Point as a
boundary condition. This would force the natural laws to be of the
right kind to support an OP, and require at least one intelligent
species to implement the OP. This is falsifiable, since the
assumptions can be checked.

[2 is a big hypothesis to swallow, it is by no means obvious and may
contain some real subtelities when you take the MWI into account. But
it is still logical, even if Occam is standing by with his razor.]

3. Tipler argues on economical and game theoretical grounds that the
OP or beings near it will be very nice, and since they will have lots
of computing power to spare they will resurrect everybody who has ever
lived into a wonderful virtual world. He looks into this state,
discuss the complications of simulation vs. emulation, compares it to
traditional afterlives etc.

[ This is the weak part. His argument isn't that bad, but it makes it
all look silly and makes people confuse the science and religion
parts. It isn't necessary, and as some here would argue we can't
predict anything about SIs. ]

A note on the melatonin/sleep cycle discussion:

I have not yet experimented with melatonin because I have experienced
success in regulating my sleep cycles with mineral supplementation.  A lack
of magnesium, in particular, can affect one's ability to fall asleep and
stay asleep.  The calcium, magnesium and potassium triad work to govern
muscular function--calcium helps muscles contract and magnesium helps
muscles relax.  Too much of one will inhibit the function of the others, and
sometimes insomnia or low-level anxiety can be traced back to a lack of
magnesium.  Chronic health problems, such as diabetes or athsma, have been
correlated with deficiences in this mineral triad, and many doctors are
encouraging regular testing for deficiency.  

When I travel on an airplane, a difficult environment for me to relax in, I
take a bolus dose of magnesium, which usually allows for some sleep, and it
prevents that painful stiffness than can result from extended plane flights.
Effective dosage levels range from 250-1,000 mg, depending on the
individual.  No real contraindications, and the toxic dose is impossibily
high (8,000 I think) but it's best to know the state of your mineral levels
in general to begin with.

Sin,

Kathryn Aegis

But in the present example, A and B were postulated to be a priori
equally probable. Do you deny that this is a coherent assumption? It
would seem that even on your approach you could agree that A and B
were a priori equally probable if, e. g. B:s advantage in terms of
number of states were compensated by an advantage of A in terms of
simplicity of laws.

Or suppose that one of A or B had been created from a smaller 
starter-universe C through some random indeterministic process that 
statistically had a fifty-fifty per cent chance of churning out an A 
or a B. This would seem to give you equal priors for A and B.

What you are doing is you define a state to be:

Si = "u is the real universe and I occupy slot x in u."

where u is a member of U, the set of possible universes, and x is a 
spacetime slot in u.

Then you argue for the prior p(Si)=1/ |{i: Si is a state}|

One thing that I find problematic is your use of the indexical "I" in 
the definitions of the states. Are you using this term as a rigid 
designator that denotes the same individual in all possible worlds 
where that individual exists? What if anything does it refer to in 
those worlds where you do not exist? For example, in "* is the real 
universe and I occupy slot A1 [where there is a rock]" - here it 
seems more like you're using "I" as variable ranging over all slots 
in a given universe.

I would say that there are no "I"s associated with dead rocks. In 
order to be the sort of thing that could be referred to by the term 
"I" you have to be a person, and rocks are not persons. So the prior 
probability that I should be a rock must be zero. If you replace "I" 
with "this thing here-and-now" then it's really clear that this 
doesn't refer to anything in particular except if it is 
accompanied by an act of pointing. But if this is what you mean then 
in order to make sense of the state descriptions we have to 
understand "I" as a rigid designator. If we do that, then do you 
really think there is a fact of the matter, in a world containing ten 
similar rocks and nothing else, as to which one of these rocks is 
"really" you? Are there then ten physically identical possible worlds 
in each of which you are really a different rock? Sounds very 
metaphysical to me.

We observe that evolution on Earth yielded intelligent life pretty 
quickly (~ 4 b. years, within the main sequence of the sun). Shall 
we therefore conclude that a large fraction of Earth-like planets 
give rise to intelligent life in about ~4 b. years? I say: no, 
bececause whatever the fraction of Earth-like planets give rise to 
intelligent life in ~4 b. years, we were sure to find ourselves 
originating from a planet that did.

Similarly, I would say that finding that you are an observer does not 
give you reason for thinking that a large fraction of all slots in 
the universe is occupied by observers.

As I indicated, I'm not even convinced yet that you have 
coherently specified a state space. The specification seems 
to make use of rigid designators in a way that doesn't make any sense 
to me.

Interesting.

The main difference between the sentist view as Avatar Polymorph puts
it and the basic transhumanist view appears to be epistemic:
transhumanism is deep down empirical, and even if some transhumanists
may accept other forms of knowledge as valid insights everything in
the end needs to be grounded in shared objective reality. Sentists,
and some other transhumanism-like groups, appear to be basically
mystical: knowledge about the future can be achieved through
non-rational insight.

I would be surprised if there didn't appear many different
transhumanist views and movements, not necessarily compatible. But at
the same time it is interesting to look at the similarities, and the
problem of how to coperate with groups with incompatible
philosophies/worldviews without violating one's own outlook.

Not the best way of gaining the credibility transhumanism needs if it
is going to be useful. But definitely a methadone for religious opium :-)

I sent this to the list in March of 1996


I just finished reading Frank Tipler's book  "The Physics of
immortality" today. I had put off reading it for long time
because I didn't think it would be any good, I was wrong it's
quite good, but I wish he had spent less time trying to justify
existing religious beliefs.

Tipler thinks that the universe will be able to perform an
infinite number of calculations between now and the final
singularity at the end of the Big Crunch. With this much
computer power it would be easy to emulate every human being who
ever lived and do it for an infinitely long subjective time. I
have never taken the idea of an infinite mind very seriously,
and I'm not  sure I do yet but one thing I am sure of is that
Tipler's critics were  being unfair when they labeled it
Pseudo Science. His ideas might be completely  wrong but
they are not silly because it's possible to prove it wrong.
Tipler's Omega  Point Theory makes a bunch of predictions,
practical predictions that should be able to be tested for in
the next 4 or 5 years. Tipler himself states that  every one
of these predictions must turn out to be correct or the entire
 theory is dead in the water.

* Tipler predicts that the universe is closed: I think most
  would say   it's probably open, Tipler say's they're wrong.

* Tipler wrote his book in early 1992 and predicted that the
  mass of the Top Quark would be 185 +- 20 GeV: At the time
  there was a report that it was at 135 GeV, Tipler said this
  must be in error and it turned out he was right. In March
 1995   Fermi Lab found the Top Quark at 180 +- 13 GeV.

* Tipler predicts that the Higgs boson must be at 220 +- 20 GeV:
  If he's  correct then when the CERN Large Hadron Collider goes
  on line in 1999 it   will find it almost immediately.

*Tipler predicts that the temperature fluctuations of the cosmic
  background  black body  radiation must be less than 6 * 10^-5:
  This prediction looks  good, the observed value is around
  5 * 10^-6.

* Tipler predicts that the Hubble constant must be less than or
  equal to 45:  30 years ago most thought it was about 200, a
  year ago most thought it was   85, today people are talking
about
  55.

* Tipler predicts that at maximum extent just before it starts
  to contract  the universe must be 70^3 times larger than it is
  now or larger: This depends on the density of the universe so
  we'll have to clear up all the   confusion over "Dark Matter"
  before we can tell how well he's doing on this   one.

Tipler makes some other predictions that  he doesn't know how to
test for but there is no reason to think that it would be
impossible
for anyone to figure out a way.

* Tipler predicts that the contraction of the universe will not
   be   symmetrical.

* Tipler predicts that the entire universe is a past light cone:
  This means  that if you send out a beam of light eventually it
  will circle the entire   universe and come back and hit you in
  the back of the head, the time it   takes to this  depends on
  the size of the universe. Tipler says light will   be able to
  make an infinite number of such trips before the universe
  collapses into a singularity.

* Tipler predicts that both density and energy will diverge to
  infinity  during the big crunch but the density must not
  diverge faster than the  cube of the energy.

I was really surprised that this outrageous philosophical theory
was a Scientific theory too and could have  so many testable
consequences.

jeff i came to many of the same conclusions you did.  i figure we

Good point!

Where real intelligence shows itself is in this area. True
intelligence consists of noticing the patterns that allow them to
partially pierce the "probability cloud". A chess master will not just
know about the possible moves, he will also judge the opponent and
select the gambit most likely to make the opponent make a mistake.

So the problem isn't the combinatorial explosion of possibilities, it
is discovering the patterns. This is a hard problem, and most likely
is linked to the bias-variance dilemma in learning theory (it is too
late for me to think clearly, but I think they are linked). It may be
that an SI will need so extremely large amounts of data to predict the
important stuff that in reality it will have to settle for educated
guessing not that much more advanced than our own.

scramble to the top of some hypothesized 'heap' before the rest. This 
partially explains their lack of spiritual or MORAL discussion or 
ETHICAL discussion regarding various issues, although extropian means

Hmm, I see no reason for all those caps. Are you trying to shout? 

If I understand your reasoning correctly, you think transhumanists are
non-rational for not discussing the possibility of uplifiting/boosting
other entities, such as animals. Is this a correct interpretation?

If so, then you are wrong, since these matters has been discussed on
this list in the past. There was a long discussion about uplifting
squids around a year ago, and there have been occasional bursts of
thinking on the ethics of the process. Not to mention David Pearce's
sketches in The Hedonic Imperative.

But generally people are more interested in things that give *them* or
their close ones a benefit. You might regard all entities as close
ones, but others may have other priorities. This is still completely
rational in the sense of using efficient means to reach one's goals.

I have lots of the uplifting discussion as I was its instigator last time
around.:)
Some of the participants regarded some of the proposals as immoral, which
demonstrates that ethical questions are asked here.  (Some might complain
that they are asked too often.:)  I think we should discuss more concrete
strategies and applications of more near term technologies here.)

I see nothing wrong (and assume Andres agrees???) with helping others
out.  My own strategy is to spread transhumanist/Extropian ideas as far
and wide as is practical so that more people will become our allies in the
battle to uplift ourselves.

I accept that given your postulated prior, learning you are human
strongly suggests you are in the universe made only of humans, rather
than made mostly of stones.

Consider the analogy of death.  Imagine in one universe I live for
100 years and another where I life for 50.  The difference between
the two universes is that, after 50 years are up, in one universe "I"
would be alive and in the other universe, "I" would be dead.  The
atoms that would make up a living body are instead, for example, in
a charred material preserved in the lava flow that enveloped me.  That
material is the material that would have been "me" had I been alive.
There *is* an "I" associated with that dead rock.

Similarly, if some small event had never triggered life on Earth, the
matter that would have me alive would instead be rock near Earth's
surface.  There is a sense it which it makes sense to ask which rock
it would have been.

Yes, it would be a real pain to track down which atoms those would be.
But I don't see any other way to make sense of the hypothesis that "I"
might not have existed, other that to describe what would otherwise
have become of the material and space-time I now occupy.

Your error is to say "large fraction."  The fact that life exists
on Earth *does* make it more likely that our universe has other planets
where life has evolved in a similar time.  It just isn't enough to
conclude the fraction of Earth-like planets with life is "large."

i haven't read the book either, but the religious people i know praise
it highly because it does support eternal life. funny thing is i believe
i actually have the book somewhere, not sure if i'll get around to read
it anytime soon though. eternal life becomes boring after a while (more
than enough litterature on the subject as it is)

sounds dangerous, wouldn't we end up with all matter in one place,
making way for even more planetary coalitions? i think the alternative
we're looking for is more like 'bending space' and/or space/time holes.
haven't quite figured out the way to do it yet, but i gather that your
grav pull machine isn't quite finished yet either. ;)

 Some solution might be to simply have each process modify the net
right as it does now. There is then no dilemna between short and long
term. Of course, it leads to something else, each process might modify
the same structure at once... I know we are pretty used to wild
things, and we are pretty much making up most of our memories from
bits of recalls here and then, and yet, it certainly is dangerous.

  Two processes have only a small chance to modify the same things in
the same day (for a big net, not for a kid), but there might be ways
to reduce this likelyhood: lock parts of the brain until consolidation?

   Or still have only one body, but try to have many thought processes
in the same brain... important is to make sure that input and output
neurones are in only one state, and we don't conflict too much (well,
more than usual) in our nerve and hormonal impulses...

    It might be the only difference between humans, robots and cyborgs

     Do you know how the net incorporates new neurons and grow
synapses, axons, dendrites: is it chemically and topologically driven?
A function like: grow toward that chemical source at a rate
proportional to its importance?

      Manu.

Modifying the same synapse at the same time is likely a problem, but
not as problematic as having two processes writing to the cortex at
the same time - their memories would become linked, so you would have
chaotic mixed memories where you (say) simultaneously eat an icecream
and engage in a flamewar on the net, with some elements completely
impossible to separate. Sounds rather disruptive.

Probably not a good idea for the prefrontal cortex (shorter term
memory), and likely we need some consolidation-like processes
elsewhere too for the quick learning that goes on all the time.

Likely a bit of both. We don't know yet, but there are definitely
chemical signals and perhaps others.

> proportional to its importance?

Sounds like a good first approximation. There has been some
theoretical work on how the chemical gradients ought to look to give
an optimal growth performance, and they seem to fit reality quite
well.

We already "boost" other species. Cows, for
instance, make great food. Trees make good
furniture. You may think neurologically modifying
a dog is more "moral" than eating one, but I see
no difference. In both cases we're changing the
animal for our purposes.

There have been discussions here before about
uploading animals. And I think a large number of
our discussions apply to boosting the utility of
matter - be it animal, vegetable or mineral.

The problem with taking a reductionist's stance is 
it becomes difficult to determine when to stop
reducing. Matter is just a temporary state of energy,
do why dwell upon that state? Why dwell upon energy
since it is an artifact of M-branes, D-branes, or
P-Branes (depending on your preferred flavor)? Etc.

Transhumanism is a philosophy, an outlook on the
malleability of the current "human condition" and the
idea that its a good thing to explore the possibilities
of existence, irregardless of how wild the pathways
are that such thinking leads us. The problem with
Sentism is formulating a system of precepts that aren't
(1) truisms - so broad-based as to be irrelevant, or (2)
expanding the scope of our discussion to the point that
we are paralyzed by the sheer volume of issues that
present themselves. 

I think Transhumanism balances the potentialities of
the future with our current situation quite well. Within
its rubrick we are able to explore a variety of issues
that have yet to be thoroughly explored. Perhaps, once
we've explored (and experienced) the events and issues
we discuss on this list and other fora, we can turn
our attentions to the next era, whatever it may be.

Really ?   Someone ought to tell that to my body.    I travel three times a
year between Tokyo and the States alone (RT).  It  hasn't worked for me !
In my case, it induces momentary grogginess, which passes after about twenty
minutes.   My father is a pharmacist, I've tried several brands.   The label
on one brand suggests to keep popping 'em each time you wake up, so I'm
probably not the only person with this problem.

On the other hand, I know people its worked wonders for.

Check out the Life extension foundation www.lef.org it's run by

Studies of humans have paid close attention to this possibility, and don't
seem to find it to be a big effect.  With animal studies, they have directly
manipulated the status of primates, and found that lowering status lowers 
health.

As far as I know benzodiazepines doesn't affect the circadian rhythm,
just sleep.

The problem with all drugs is that people are different, and a drug
that is extremely potent in me could be worthless for you. Some people
may have a resistance to exogenous melatonin, or a circadian rhythm
that remains disturbed much longer due to jet-lag than for others. My
guess is that the thing to look for is other substances involved in
the circadian rhythm, so that they can be used in combination with
melatonin to lock it more efficently.

That sounds rather suspicious; imagine a sleeping pill with that
label! Melatonin might be fairly safe, but it isn't a good idea to
pile it up in the system.

One of the fundamental premises of uploading is accepting the idea
that your identity is preserved if an emulation of all relevant
physical processes of your mind is preserved.  If you accept this
definition of identity you must also accept all of the counter
intuitive implications that come with it.  Judging from the responses
on this thread, I believe the majority of extropians/transhumanists
either accept this definition of identity while denying the logical
conclusions of it, or reject it outright.  It worries me that John
Clark, someone well known for his extraordinary ability to tackle
counter intuitive issues, is unwilling to follow his own definition of
identity to its logical conclusions.  To me, these issues are so
fundamental to what I thought was  extropianism/transhumanism, I now
wonder if there should be another ism that includes this definition of
identity and its logical conclusions in its principles/statement of
purpose.  Although, I would much prefer these two ism, who both tout
uploading, to stand up, pronounce, and explain some of its counter
intuitive conclusions.  Otherwise, converts will be left on their own
capacity to grapple with these issues, usually with very confusing and
inconsistent results.  This can be disorienting to say the least.  So
many otherwise rational people become an emotional wreck when dealing
with these issues.  Witness the following:

Mark, I appreciate and empathize with your comments.  However, in so
far as the safety and reliability of the technology is trusted
"[having] a change of heart" is totally irrational.  I will continue
to post messages that accentuate the counter intuitive results from
following the definition of identity implied in uploading to its
logical conclusions.  Max, what about those principles?

I think that's a bit counterintuitive. What do you say about the 
following:

Suppose we change the example slightly. Now, an A universe contains 
10 humans and nothing else. A B universe contains 10 humans and one 
trillion trillion stones. There is a small C universe (of negligible 
size), and it spawns one thousand baby-univeses through a random 
process (like rolling fair dice) that has a 10% chance of yielding an 
A and 90% of a B.

It seems clear that there will probably be about 100 A univeses and 
900 B universes. But that means about 90% of all humans will find 
themselves in an B universe. So if all you knew was the set-up and 
that you were a human, then you should believe that there was a 
90% chance that you were in an B universe.

And yet, if you include stones in the reference class, then it seems 
you should believe you are in an A universe. For if you are in a B 
universe, then there exists in total at least one trillion trillion 
stones and then you would probably have been one of these stones 
rather than a human.

So we should exclude stones from the reference class, because 
otherwise we will have to make a recommendation that will probably 
lead to 90% of all who follows it to be wrong; whereas if we don't 
include stones in the reference class, then 90% will be right.

Presumably not, since the atoms making up your body would have been 
replaced anyway through natural metabolic processes.

Suppose these discarded atoms had been used as fertilizer and 
re-entered the food chain and become part of someone else's body. 
Would you then have been this other person?

But even granting for the sake of argument that the material "would 
have been you" if you had been alive, it *isn't* you since you are in 
fact dead. Your spacetime tube has come to an end...

> There *is* an "I" associated with that dead rock.

... so this argument couldn't show that there is an "I" 
associated (in any interesting sense) with the rock.

I agree that maybe you can meaningfully ask: Where would the atoms 
currently making up my body have been if such and such an event would 
not have happened on Earth 4 billion years ago. (Though I suspect 
that quantum-statistical phenomena means that the answer could even 
in principle only be in terms of something that would be smeared 
out enough that it might coincide with where the atoms making up Hal 
Finney's  body would have been.) But I don't think this is relevant.

Even if you could in principle trace where your current body's atoms 
would have been if such and such events had happened, and this 
allowed you to say that you would then have been this aggregate of 
atoms (which I don't agree with!), this proceedure still does not 
indicate what "I" should be associated with rocks that consist of 
atoms that have never and will never make up any person's body. Could 
"you" "have been" these rocks? Are they in the reference class?

Is there one (otherwise empty) possible world in which you are an 
apple and I am a pear, and another (otherwise empty) possible world 
in which I am an apple and you a pear. What is the difference? It 
doesn't make any sense to me to distinguish between these worlds, 
unless you believe in a metaphysical soul.

Maybe it's simple: "You would not have existed." means "There would 
have been no RobinHansonian information processing system. :-(".

Above you said:

> strongly suggests you are in the universe made only of humans,
> rather than made mostly of stones.

There it seems you were saying that the finding that you are a human 
has an effect on what you should believe about the fraction of humans 
to stones.

And now you say that finding that life exists on Earth should 
not affect your beliefs about about the fraction of Earth-like 
planets with life.

You did say "given you postulated prior", which was fifty-fifty for 
the two universes. But we can , for the sake of argument, assume 
a similar fifty-fifty prior in the second case: a fifty-fifty 
prior chance that a large fraction of Earth-like planets have life.

Why the difference in treatment between these two cases?

Let N = "trillion trillion", and assume there are exactly 100 A 
"universes" and 900 B "universes".  Note that these are *not* "universes" 
in the sense I was using of "possible worlds." The entire construction 
of C + 100 As + 900 Bs is just one total space-time, a "possible world."  

As described the only remaining uncertainty is where in this world I am.  
If I treat stone slots and human slots equally, there are 
100*10 + 900(10+N) slots.  If my prior is uniform across these slots, 
then conditioning on my being in a human slot, there is a 90% chance I'm 
in a B "universe," as you prefer.

Today the Fall Semester started here, and so the Philosophy
library finally opened, allowing me to read the Dieks vs. Leslie
exchange in the '92 Philosophical Quarterly.  They discuss 
the same issue Nick and I are discussing now: does it make sense 
to think I could have been a rock?

Leslie writes: "First: Dieks would be very obviously wrong if he 
had just said that more observers meant more opportunities of 
being an observer rather than, say, being an unconscious collection
of atoms, ... things which do not actually observe anything and 
which therefore must be left out of any calculations about what 
observers could be expected to observe."  

I think I fundamentally disagree with Leslie here.  The universe
doesn't know whether we exist, and doesn't care.  If we're going
to create a state space and prior describing possible universes,
we should do so in a way that is faithful to our best understanding
of the physics of universes, and neutral relative to whether some
set of atoms is organized so as to create an "observer."  

We ordinarily want to talk about what would happen if I died or 
if humans had never evolved.  And it seems to me the 
natural neutral physics-oriented way to do is to talk about 
what would otherwise happen to the material that now makes me up.
It seems natural to me to talk about this as saying "I could have 
been a rock," though Nick thinks this misuses the word "I".  Maybe
so, but since the basic notion I'm trying to speak of makes sense,
there aught to be some similar words I could use to describe it.  
Let my "I" stand for that.  

Doomsday argument folks also seem to want talk about the possibility
that I might have been some other human at some other place in 
space-time.  This seems sorta metaphysical on first blush, but not
wanting to be a prude about such things, I've said O.K., I can do
this if I imagine that instead of being made of the material I am,
I could have been made of other material, perhaps arranged differently.

If I could have a rock, and if Nick could have been a rock, then it 
seems we have to accept the possibility that we could have both been 
rocks.  If we now add in the possibility that I could have been Nick
and he me, it seems there are two ways we could be rocks.  I could be my
rock and he could be his rock, or we could switch.  Nick complains
this looks metaphysical, but it seems no more so to me that saying 
I could have been Nick and he me.  

Of course there are complexities related to the fact that the material
that makes up me changes with time, but I don't see these as essentially
changing the situation.

I wonder if it would make sense to approach the question of the
appropriate priors via the "Miraculous Universal Distribution", the title
of an article in v19, n4 of The Mathematical Intelligencer by Kirchherr
et al.

The universal prior sets the probability of an object at one over two to
the power of its complexity (entropy).

Given two different universes of different size, you could compute the
entropy on the basis of the number of states of various types.  I'm not
sure if you should include information on their locations, or if that
should be ignored.

Ignoring locations, this would make the universe with an extra 100 rocks
have greater entropy and therefore be a priori less likely initially.
You would also count universes as less likely which had more diverse
conditions than ones which were uniform (all rocks for example).

One more try at analyzing the Carter-Leslie argument.  Knock
it down if you can.

First, let us clarify what is meant by "mathematical probability",
which is that quantity to which the calculus of probability (including
Bayes' Theorem) applies.  "Probability" is a property of propositions.
Further, the property exists for any proposition only with respect to
a set of propositions to which it belongs, exactly one of which can be
true at a given sampling time.  The probability of that proposition,
then, is a measure of the relative frequency at which it is true at
sampling time compared to the frequency at which the others in the set
are true (the sum of all of which must be 1).  For probability
calculations to be meaningful, then, we must be clear about what our
universe of propositions is, and keep it consistent throughout our
calculations.

Let's start with the usual example from the DA: two urns, one with
10 numbered balls and one with 100.  A ball is drawn from one of the
urns and we find it numbered 7 (any value from 1 to 10 will do).  We
are then asked to estimate what is the probability that it was drawn
from the urn with 10 balls rather than the urn with 100?  What is our
set of propositions?  There are three sets here: one set is {the ball
was drawn from urn1, the ball was drawn from urn2}.  From each urn,
there is the set {ball 1 was drawn, ball 2 was drawn ...}.  We must
assign to each of these propositions an initial probability by some
empirical means or by fiat before we can use the calculus to further
study their implications.  The traditional method of doing this is
the principle of indifference: if we have no reason to suspect that
any proposition is more probable than another, then we assign them
equal values.  In this case, then, we will assume that a fair coin was
flipped to choose which urn to draw from, giving an initial probability
of 1/2 to each urn selection.  Likewise, we assume a ball is chosen
fairly from each urn.  Given those ideal assumptions, Bayes' Theorem
gives us a probability of 10/11 our ball was chosen from urn 1.

Bayes' Theorem, to review quickly, is the method for calculating the
probability of an hypothesis given a piece of evidence [P(H|E)]
from our knowledge of the probability of the hypothesis itself [P(H)]
and the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis [P(E|H)].
The formula is P(H|E} = (P(H)P(E|H))/(P(H)P(E|H)+P(~H)P(E|~H)).

It is important to note that those initial probabilities we assigned
to P(H) are critical: what if the urn was not chosen fairly?  What if
we are only offered this bet in those cases when a 10 or less is drawn?
Let's change the method of draw, for example.  Let's say that all 110
balls are first placed together in a bag: one person reaches into the
bag and randomly places a beeping device on one of them.  They are then
sorted into the urns, and the beeping device is activated.  The beeping
ball is retrieved, and discovered to be numbered 5.  What, now, is the
probability that it was drawn from urn 1?  In this case, 1/2.  By this
method of selection, the probabilities of {ball was drawn from urn 1,
ball was drawn from urn 2} are not 1/2 - 1/2, but 1/11 - 10/11.  Bayes'
Theorem then gives the posterior probability as (1/11) / (1/11 +
10/11 * 1/10), or 1/2 (which we could also have determined without
Bayes in this case, but let's be consistent).

In propositions about ourselves, such as the DA, it is similarly of
critical importance to determine _how we came to be selected to make
the bet in question_.  From which urn were we drawn, and by what
method of selection?  In the example above, if we only offer the bet
in those cases where a 10 or less is drawn, the correct odds to take
are 1/2 - 1/2, not 10/11 - 1/11.  Think of the old stock scam: you
receive a letter in the mail predicting a rise in a certain stock,
and it does indeed rise.  The next week you receive another letter
predicting a fall, and it falls.  For 5 weeks in a row, you receive a
letter with a prediction about some stock, and 5 times it's correct.
The sixth week the letter asks you to pay for its prediction.  How
much is the prediction worth?  A naive Bayesian would calculate the
chance of another correct prediction at 32/33.  A wiser person would
realize that the scammer started out by sending 320 letters with a
"rise" prediction and 320 with "fall", then to those who got the
correct one, he sent 160 "rise" and 160 "fall".  To those who were
right on round 2, he sent 80 "rise" and 80 "fall".  You were simply
among those (un)lucky 10 who got 5 correct predictions in a row.
Your correct odds are 1/2 which is worth nothing, not 32/33.

These, then, are the questions to be answered if we are to attribute
meaning to the DA: (1) what is the set of propositions from which
our hypothesis "the world is ending soon" is drawn, and what are
their initial probabilities? and (2) how did we come to be selected
to make this bet?  The original DA seems to want us to take as our set
of propositions {the world will end soon, there will be billions more
people before the world ends}.  This, on its face, is absurd.  There
is no reason at all to suspect that those two choices represent the
only possibilities--and of equal probability--in reality.  Bayes'
Theorem requires that P(H) + P(~H) = 1, i.e., that there are no other
options.  In that extremely contrived case, and further given the
appropriate self-sampling assumption (that I'll deal with below), the
DA would indeed be spectacularly true, but this is not the least
bit remarkable, because we have assigned by fiat absurd initial
probabilities contrived to produce just such a result.  A realistic
set of propositions would be something more like {there will be fewer
than 100 billion persons, there will be 100-200 billion persons, there
will be 200-300 billion persons, ...} up to a suitable upper bound
chosen empirically based on the size of the planet or universe. 
Without changing the results, this is equivalent to a set of urns with
{1 ball, 2 balls, 3 balls, ... N balls}, where N is the multiple of
100 billion persons we choose as our upper limit.  If we then assign
equal initial probabilities to each of those urns (i.e., possible
civilizations), select an urn randomly, draw a ball (a birth order)
and find it to be "1" (less than 100 billion), then our Bayesian
probability that we were drawn from urn 1 (i.e., that there will only
ever be 100 billion persons) depends on our choice of N.  For N=2,
those odds ar 2/3.  For N=4, they are 1/2.  As N approaches infinity,
the odds approach 0, albeit very slowly.  For N=1 billion, the odds
that the world will end soon are much better than 1 in a billion, but
hardly anywhere near 1.

Finally, we must deal with the issue of our self-selection.  Have we
really chosen an urn randomly, or have we fallen for a sucker bet?
It might be a more satisfying argument if we had a bigger sample of
possible civilizations around--aliens perhaps, or Atlanteans, or a
peek at earth's long-distant future, to give us an idea of what sizes
we can really expect a civilization sufficiently similar to ours to
reach before collapse.  Let's say we had such evidence--that advanced
civilizations really seemed to grow to a random size from 100 billion
to 100 billion billion, and then collapse.  Would the fact that we
find ourselves numbering less than 100 billion truly give us reason
to suspect we are among the unfortunate slated to perish soon?  That
depends upon whether or not the question is being asked by someone
who _fairly chose our civilization to pick on_ by offering this bet.
In other words, is our civilization a truly random sample from all
those we postulate, and is this philosopher a fair sample of persons
from this civilization?  Frankly, I don't see how either can be.  We
chose to deal with our civilization in the question because it is the
one we are most interested in, not because we chose fairly.  We have
no more reason to put that P(H) into the equation than does any other
alien civilization.

Let's change the bet this way, to make it correctly mirror our balls
and urns: assume there are many alien civilizations, and we know
precisely when each of them will end, at somewhere between 100 billion
and 100 billion billion.  We make a big wheel with the names of those
civilizations on it and give it a spin.  Now, knowing how long that
fairly-chosen civilization will last, we choose a ball (birth order)
from that total number, and offer to someone this bet: "I chose a
random civilization, and then a random birth order from that, and it
is X.  What are the odds that this civilization will end soon?"  If
all of these conditions are perfectly fair, i.e., we really chose a
random civilization, and we really chose a random birth order from it
knowing how long it would last, and we were shown that it is less than
100 billion, then we would be correct to infer that the odds of this
being one of the shorter-lived civilizations is much better than 1 in
a billion by the Bayesian calculation suggested by the DA.  But I don't
think it is possible for us to make the bet fairly in this case.  For
one thing, if we chose fairly, odds are good that we would choose a
birth order representing someone who has not been born yet, but we are
selecting ourselves from among the subset of those who have been born,
and can thus contemplate this question.  And we really don't know what
our sample set is.  We do not know what all the propositions are from
which we are to calculate this probability, and there is great reason
to suspect that we are biased.  In short, I think this is a sucker bet
perpetrated on ourselves.

Universal priors are useless in finite state spaces, where every prior with
full support is universal.  And unless you think infinities are essential 
to an issue like the doomsday argument, I think you're off staying with 
the simplicity of finite examples.

In my earlier analysis of the Carter-Leslie Doomsday Argument,
I incorrectly stated that the Bayesian posterior probability
of a ball having been drawn from the first of N urns, given
that it was numbered "1" and that the N urns contain 1, 2,
... N balls, approached 0 as N approaches infinity.  That's
not true: if my second shot at the calculations are correct,
the limit is in fact 1/3.  This shoots down one of my
objections to the DA, namely that the sample set of potential
universes is too contrived.  It does not affect my objection
to the self-selection flaw.

hara, ive refined this a little in my mind.  the chimp connection would only
be for a day or two, while the mind recovers from the shock of the operation
and prepares for the next (the freezing part).  seems like a person starting
the cooling process would be better off with a young and healthy simian

I don't think Leslie disagrees with any of that. Note that he says 
"what observers should expect to observe" which is not the same as 
"what there should be".

I don't understand this. If humans never evolved, you would never 
have existed. Nowhere around would there be an observer with the 
RobinHanson-properties. What you now refer to when you 
say "I" would not have existed.

That is only shorthand. You can replace this phraseology if 
you find it problematic. Instead you can talk about the possibility 
that Robin Hanson, while remaining Robin Hanson, could forget certain 
facts, and about what probabilities RH would then assign to the 
hypothesis that RH is living in such-and-such a place and time. 
That's actually quite simple.

... But to say that there is a fact of the matter as to whether you 
are the pear and I'm the apple, or the other way around, in a 
possible world which contains only these two objects - and you seem 
to accept that you are committed to this view - now *that* seems to 
me metaphysical in excelsior.

I don't see why you should would want to stick to that view. You can 
admit that only observers can enter the reference class while still 
holding on to your view that we should accept the SIA and thereby 
cancel the DA.

But the point of my example having a C universe etc. was that this 
prior is not a plausible one. The fair dice in the C universe, or 
rather let's say it's a fair coin, do you really want to say that the 
prior probability that this coin should land heads all thousand 
throws is almost one? That seems wrong.

Actaully, you didn't say anything about what we should believe about 
the *fractions*.

Suppose the only alternatives were (1): one in ten Earth-like planet 
evolve intelligent life; or (2) one in a thousand does. Suppose the 
prior probability is fifty-fifty.

Now you observer that the Earth has evolved life. Based on your 
clarification above, I now take it that you think this observation 
should increase your confidence in (1). Is this right?

But then what happened to the selection-effect you spoke of in the 
"Early life"-paper? "Since no one on Earth would be wondering about 
the origin of life if Earth did not contain creatures nearly as 
intelligent as ourselves, the fact that four billion years elapsed 
before high intelligence appeared on Earth seems compatible with any 
expected time longer than a few billion years"

Shulman seeks people for drug study
Parkinson's trust needs volunteers to determine whether Deprenyl can
increase life span

 Seventy-three-year-old Morton Shulman thinks he's found the Fountain of
Youth.
 Beginning Monday, the Parkinson's Charitable Trust will begin running ads
in Toronto newspapers looking for 1,500 volunteers to participate in a
long-term study to determine whether the drug Deprenyl can make you live
longer and better.
 "Without Deprenyl, I would have been dead in 1989," said Dr. Shulman, who
was instrumental in setting up the trust after he contracted Parkinson's
disease 15 years ago.
 Dr. Shulman's study is the latest attempt in a centuries-old search to
stave off the aging process, an obsession that dates back to the 16th
century when Spanish explorer Ponce de Leon, searching for the Fountain of
Youth, discovered Florida instead.
 Today, pharmaceutical companies are developing more than 150 medicines for
the debilitating diseases of aging. Moreover, Canadian researchers recently
indentified a gene that plays a central role in aging. And biologists,
studying aging at the cellular and genetic levels, are finding that life
span is far easier to manipulate than they had expected.
 "Dr. Shulman has always had a nagging interest that Deprenyl slows down
the breakdown of certain cells in the brain that cause the aging process,"
said Trevor Williams, the former head of the Parkinson Foundation of
Canada. Mr. Williams left the foundation in March and will manage the new
Deprenyl studies as the senior staffer at the Parkinson's trust.
 Half of the 1,500 volunteers in the "double-blind" Deprenyl study will
take five milligrams of the drug twice a week beginning in September, while
the other half will take a like amount of a placebo. Dr. Shulman, who says
Deprenyl is harmless and doesn't interact with any other drug, wants
healthy individuals aged 40 to 65 for the 15-year study. Initial results
will be reviewed in five years.
 But the real drama will begin in the next 12 months when the Parkinson's
trust will begin testing a newly developed derivative of Deprenyl on 1,500
new volunteers.
 In an interview, Dr. Shulman said Jozsef Knoll, the Hungarian
pharmacologist who originally invented Deprenyl, has been working with
animals for the  past three years to improve the drug. "By cutting off one
part of the molecular chemical structure, Dr. Knoll has produced a drug
that is 100 times more effective than Deprenyl."
 The new drug, which is hush-hush because Dr. Knoll hasn't applied for a
patent yet and hasn't published his findings, will also be tested against
Deprenyl and a placebo next year.
 Dr. Shulman said that like Deprenyl, the new drug has no side effects.
"The effect it has on dogs and cats and smaller animals is amazing. Dogs
are living 50 per cent longer and smaller animals, like birds, live twice
as long."
 Dr. Shulman and Dr. Knoll have been friends and colleagues for several
decades. Dr. Shulman originally acquired Dr. Knoll's work in 1990 for his
company, Deprenyl Research Ltd., now Draxis Health Inc or Toronto.
 Last December, when Draxis sold the rights to an animal version of
Deprenyl to Pfizer Inc., DR. Shulman forced Draxis to issue 200,000
warrents to Dr. Knoll to fulfill part of the original 1990 contract.
Largely at the urging and backing of Dr. Shulman, Dr. Knoll is now suing
Draxis for $100-million (U.S.) claiming breach of contract and infringement
of patent rights. Draxis has countered by suing Dr. Shulman for, among
other things, interfering with its $41-million deal with Pfizer.
 According to Dr. Shulman, the only longevity study with Deprenyl on humans
was conducted in 1985 by Walter Birkmayer at the University of Vienna. His
patients - all suffering from Parkinson's - lived on average an additional
15 to 28 months. "It wasn't an ideal study because it wasn't a
double-blind," Dr. Shulman said.
 In a double-blind study, neither patients nor researchers know who is
getting the real drug and who is taking the placebo.
 Earlier this week, Dr. Shulman offered New York-based Pfizer a chance to
participate in Dr. Knoll's new studies and possibly acquire 50 per cent "of
all our end holdings." Pfizer hasn't responded. But Dr. Shulman believes a
more potent form of Deprenyl will have "important competitive implications"
for Pfizer.
 "Dr. Knoll has never been wrong before," Dr. Shulman said. "Can you
imagine the significance if we can prove in humans what we know works in
animals."

What are you talking about?  I stipulated the fraction of A vs. B
"universes" to exactly match the the expected coin toss fraction.  How can
you then complain I'm saying the coins will all go one way?

I don't see this as inconsistent with the other position.

It's not at all simple for me.  I could sortof accept the idea that I
might have been someone else instead.  But I find it very hard to believe
that you could make Robin hanson forget not so much that he was no longer
Robin Hanson, *and* enough so he couldn't tell he wasn't a Martian living on
Hermes in 2200.  And even if you could I don't see the relevance of that poor
hypothetical creature and what I should infer from what I know.  If you're
going to rest the DA on this construction, it seems implausible from the
get go.

I'm not sure the SIA is sufficient to deal with all the cases of
interest.  I'd rather instead accept an approach to defining states
and priors.

But they are only the same person if they have the same thoughts
and in your example the thoughts of the two were not the same,
in fact they could not have been more different.

But these are not copies and I'm not talking about subtitles
here, the mental state of the two are astronomically different.

It's the only fundamental premises of uploading, and it must be
true unless we have a soul undetectable by the scientific
method.

Yes if you want to be consistent and I do, not that I can prove
rationality to be better than irrationality, it's just my
preference.

If the physical state of my brain is in a state that causes me
to think that I will be dead in 60 seconds and if my semi copy
does not think he will be dead in 60 seconds or even 60 years,
then a physical process in my brain is not being emulated by my
"copy". When a bullet stops that physical process the sense of
identity it produces at that moment is destroyed also because
it has no backup.  I'm not saying John Clark would be dead, the
other fellow would have just as much right to that title as I
do,
but as I stared at the gun I would know that the very focus of
my existence, that is, the thoughts I'm having right now, would
not continue. This would scare the hell out of my and I'll bet
you dollars to donuts it would scare you too. I would only be
happy if my copy were made right now, but how long is "now"?
I thing it would depend on the intensity of your conscious
experience at the time (staring down the barrel of a gun is
pretty intense), but on average I think "now" is about a second
or two long.

So why don't I find amnesia as frightening as the thought
experiment with the gun and the imperfect copy? Because in
the real would you only find out about amnesia after it
happened.
I wake up in a hospital and the doctor tells me that yesterday
you
hit me on the the head with a baseball bat, he says I'll be OK
but
I've permanently lost all memories for the last week, I think no
big
deal I feel fine now and if I comb my hair over my gash you can
hardly see it. Perhaps the John Clark of one week ago is dead
but
I don't care because I'm not him, I'm the John Clark of right
now.
On the other hand if I see you coming bat in hand ready to
perform
some more amateur brain surgery I'm going to run like hell.

 This is what actually happens in the present world: if I hear a new
CD while working on a project, the two memories get heavily linked,
sometimes up to the point that when I think about the project I start
humming the songs (or the opposite:).

  Duplicating the processing while keeping only one neural net should
resolve that, only neurones triggered in the first process can link
together, they don't link with the second process (the eventual
chemicals are also duplicated). And if experience tells us that a part
of the brain is necessary for short term memory, I am not sure it
really acts as a hard disk or RAM drive, cound't it be some kind of
cerebellum? And if it acts as a memory drive, why not (again)
duplicate it?

   In fact, the topology of the neural net should act as a belief, or
meme, or semantic net. Only the neuronal associations hold any meaning
from a functional point of view.

    Having different bodies but one memory could be a great and funny
thing. I could learn different things at the same time, be at
different places, get into different activities, hold group meetings
with only me into it (would that be very enriching?), but still be
only one person. Is that a step to omnipotence? :D

     Another upgrade to ourselves would be adding a sense of self
inspection: looking inside our own brain and eventually changing it!
Of course, a neural net doesn't mean much in itself, but I'm confident
we could map it to a semantic net (at least for language parts) or we
could pin the important places through internal simulation. That new
sense would of course allow us to connect or disconnect us from our
bodies or any other interface to the rest of the world. We could
design or redesign our own self!!!

      The funny thing is that this sense would be part of the net, and
should then be able to look upon itself and redesign itself, I wonder
if there should be any blind sight corners in its capacities?

       Manu.

This is an essay on the idea of "sense of life," which is a big part of
the Objectivist theory of art.  I'd like to know what Extropians and
transhumanists think of it, especially if it fits into their views of art.

Yes, but when you merge the two nets the temporal relationship between
the experiences could become garbled. I'm not sure what the result
would be, but I'm fairly certain that answering questions such as
"What did you do last tuesday?" and "After fixing the ridgeways
clenchiration, what did you do?" would be very hard to answer.

Because the really short term memory areas (especially the
hippocampus) most likely experience even topology change during the
day. It becomes very non-trivial to duplicate and merge them.

I don't know, but I would certainly want to try the experience (as I
have described in my own take on it,
http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Global/Posthumanity/borg.html)

>      Another upgrade to ourselves would be adding a sense of self

Yes, this would be very useful. A source level debugger, or something
like the toolkits mentioned in Egan's _Diaspora_ (they even enabled
simulation of how the mind would look after accepting certain
modifications, making it possible to decide whether they were
dangerous or not).

A first step would be something like 

@InProceedings{Laakso98,
  author = 	 {Laakso, Aarre AND Cottrell, Garrison W.},
  title = 	 {How can I know what you think? Assessing representational similarity in neural systems},
  booktitle = 	 {Proceedings of the Twentieth Annual Cognitive Science Conference},
  year =	 1998,
  annote =	 {http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/users/gary/pubs/cogsci98.laakso.ps}
}

where neural networks can be compared in terms of their internal
representations. This approach might be extended to a way of figuring
out the structures of these representations, and then visualizing
them.

Most likely; we don't have full access to our brain, and a lot of
stuff likely resides as wague "sub-concepts", fragments and other
neural junk that is hard to relate to anything but affect us.

of bacteria on Earth. The tally - 5 x 10^30 bacteria. Anyone know
what the mass is of the average bacterium? That's such a huge number,
I'm wondering how much biomass bacteria as a whole possess.

Yes, but that's not what you're doing here. You're taking a hundred copies
of someone, waiting for ten hours and then deleting them. Their minds are
*not* preserved. They are dead.

Yes. So why don't you?

John has been making the same kinds of arguments on this list for as long
as I remember, and I've yet to see anyone show a flaw in his reasoning.

Look, your definition of identity is fundamentally flawed, and no amount
of technology will change that. A copy is only a duplicate of you at
precisely the instant it's copied, and immediately begins to diverge. If
the copy is destroyed at that point it's dead. 

Let's give a better example than yours. Suppose you decide that the
weather is too nice to work, so you create a copy and send it to the
beach; you'll go to work and then kill yourself, so the copy will take
your place the next day. 

Will you kill yourself at the end of the day? This example is precisely
equivalent to yours except that you get to kill yourself, you don't get to
claim without evidence that your copies will do so. 

Are you really that suicidal?

For the purposes of the DA, we should assign "priors" given by 
empirical considerations. Korb and Oliver had a similar point like 
the one you are making here. (I have a more detailed reply in "Alive 
and Kicking" (http://www.hedweb.com/nickb/doomsday).)

Then the no outsider requirement is not satisfied and the DA is 
weakened in proportion to the number of existing alien civilizaions.

In a sense you are betting against yourself when you decide how to 
plan your life in view of your estimates of how long our species will 
survive.

Sorry, I misunderstood you. But let's drop that stipulation and 
consider the example that I formulated. It seems you have to say that 
when you find that you are a human, you have to conclude that all the 
1000 universes almost certainly are of type A. That means, you have 
to infer that the coin landed heads a thousand times. But is that 
really what you would infer? It seems very wrong.

What do you mean when you say that quick evolution is compatible with 
any expected time longer than a few billion years? Nobody thought 
quick evolution were *logically* incompatible with a very long 
expected time. So presumably you were pointing out that they were not 
even probabilistically incompatible. But now, it seems, you say that 
quick evolution gives probabilistic grounds for ruling out a very 
long expected time.???

Well, I shouldn't have said simple. After all, it leads to the 
problem of the reference class.

Let me put it like this. The amnesia heuristic sets a lower bound for 
what should be included in the reference class.

For example, it clearly makes sense to say that you might not have 
known (indeed you may not know) the exact hour of your birth. If you 
didn't know that, then you would use some probability distribution 
over possible birth hours compatible with what else you know. If you 
conditionalize this distribution on your exact birth hour, you should 
get back the distribution you held before you forgot the birth hour. 
If you don't get back the original distribution then that indicates 
that you had forgot to take account of some effect. The doomsday 
argument claims that there is such an effect that you have neglected 
to take into account.

When we're talking about forgetting about whether you are a Martian 
living on Hermes in 2200, then things get problematic. The amnesia 
heuristic seems to gradually break down. I agree with that. That's 
why there is the reference class problem.

It would be nice if it were that simple, but we're still waiting for 
a coherently specified state space. Do you have any specific cases in 
mind where the SIA would be inadequate?

Dear Friends,

As mentioned some months ago 2 members
of Transcedo (Arjen Kamphuis & Me) will be
travelling trough the USA from the 7th of Sep.
untill the 27th of Sep.

We would like to meet as many of you as possible.

===> THANKS !!! to all the people who invited us,
we were very pleased with all your positive
reactions. But (sigh) we had to make a plan and
unfortunatly skip some places. We hope we 
will see you an other time.

This is our draft-plan at the moment:

 7th  -- arival JFK ---  NYC
 8th -- 10th   DC
 10th -- 13th  Houston
 13th -- 17th  Phoenix
 17th --  21th LA
 21th --  25th SFO   plane Back to NYC
 27th --  Back to Amsterdam

We will travel by Amtrak (as much as possible
 by night.....)

 I would like to ask all of you (with this plan 
 in the back of your mind) to send your 
 invitation again !!
 and let us know if we have a place to sleep.
 and if you can pick us up from a Train Station.
 ----> Please don't worry if your plans have 
         changed for this period during the last moths
         we understand and it's NO problem !!
 ----> Please don't feel obligated to find a place
         to sleep for us.  We will arange Hotels.
----->Please don't feel obligated to arrange transport
         from the Train Station. We will take a bus or a Cab
 >>> Just let us know if you would like to spend some
         time with us while we are there, and we will try to
         squeeze it in our travel plans.

THANKS AGAIN...whatever the outcome of the various
 offers may be.......

Greetings,

Arjen & Berrie

Texan Pays Lab $5 Million to Clone His Pet Dog

Reuters
24-AUG-98

LONDON, Aug 24 (Reuters)- A Texan millionaire is paying 
a cloning laboratory $5 million to produce a living replica 
of his pet dog Missy, according to a BBC programme. 

The laboratory has already received some cells from the dog, 
which is part collie, part Alsatian, Newsnight said on Monday. 

The cloning laboratory of Texas A & M University at College 
Station had been given two years to produce a clone. 

Laboratory Director Mark Westhusin said he thought other 
millionaires would be keen to follow suit. 

``I'm sure there are lots of them out there that would if 
they knew the potential existed to do it,'' Westhusin said. 

Newsnight said other laboratories and companies were hoping 
to move into commercial cloning of pets and racehorses.

I've finally gotten around to looking at my calendar regarding the 9/17 talk
in Austin Steve Pruitt mentioned.  Unfortunately, I can't make it.  However,
it looks like I may be in Austin the following week for a seminar, perhaps
from Wednesday (9/23) PM through Friday (9/25) PM or Saturday (9/26) AM.  I'll
likely be staying at the Four Seasons, my usual base of ops in Austin.  Maybe
we can rendezvous there or somehwere down on 6th street when I'm there?

For Houston extropians, how about a gathering here some time in September?
Happy hour?  I see that our Dutch friends will be here September 10-13.  I've
got commitments on 9/13, but perhaps another of those days.

Frequently I discuss futurism/transhumanism versus the pseudoscience of
groups like the alternative "healers", Edgar Casey worshippers,
astrologists, biorhythmists, pendulists, homeopathists etc. etc.

Often I do this with people who doesn't quite believe that science holds all
the answers.

Several times I have found that I need a very simple explenation of what
makes something scientifically sound and what doesn't.

I know that this isn't quite extropian in itself but I think that it might
be of interrest to more people on this list than me.

How's this: We all get together with our Dutch compadres on Saturday, Sept.
12, at NASA, do the MSC for a few hours and then have some brews and seafood
at the Turtle Club (famous for where the Orginal 7 ratpack used to get into
trouble and still a good place to spot the occasional astronaut . . .)

Any Houstonians or other Texans who are interested should let me know in
advance, as I'll have some logistical problems moving the Dutchmen around (as
some of you know, I've only got a two-seater, so we'll need at least one more
vehicle for the trip to Clear Lake.)

Also, Berrie, did you get my off-list message? -- I got a bounce message, but
I've learned not to trust them . . .

My first shot at defining identity is as follows:

Identity - A slightly dynamic but mostly stable fuzzy area within the
design space of all possible information processors as defined by the
ego.

I believe the fuzziness in the above definition is determined by the
ego.  It is fuzzy because the ego has limited knowledge about its
exact location in the design space.  The ego is the sense of
ownership/selfishness that we have about this particular design space.
 Under most circumstances the ego would insist on the existence of one
and only one point plot existing in this area.  In my previous post I
gave many reasons why.  I also gave some special circumstances for the
exceptions.  For example, planned space travel resulting in giving up
most friends, family, property, and normal activity in familiar places
causes a drift so fast that the sharing of multiple point plots within
the fuzzy area would be short lived.  Also, Situations where there
would be multiple point plots only for ten hours would be another
instance where sharing of the fuzzy area would be tolerable.

Normally, as long as there is one and only one point plot in the fuzzy
area my ego and self preservation instincts are intact.  This amounts
to the opposite of what you are saying because it is the ego and self
preservation instincts of my identity who is driving me to insure
there is only one point plot in the fuzzy area.  In order to self
preserve and keep my ego intact 999 of my point plots would not
hesitate to commit voluntary amnesia.

With the above definition it is clear to me that we are in fact
talking about 1000 minds with one ego because the ego defines identity
as the fuzzy area where all 1000 point plots reside.  Even when all
1000 entities occupy different points, as long as all ego's fuzzyness
are percieved to intersect, only one ego exists.  All 1000 point plots
realize that 999 of them must go and whether or not one particular is
willing to snuff it is a simple matter of perfect and safe 10 hour
amnesia and not something worth fighting your own ego over.  

In fact I'll make an argument in just the opposite direction.  Lets
say one of the 1000 workers, Mr.69 lucked out and had two hours of the
hottest sex he has ever experienced.  Now, he is going to call Mr.
Original who has been home unpacking and tell him all about it.  Mr.
Original is going to be thinking, "According to our selection criteria
this guy has achieved a higher fitness within our fuzzy area than I
have".  Mr. Original is now hard as a rock knowing he can easily talk
Mr.69 into trading places and letting him (Mr. Original) be the one to
commit voluntary amnesia.  In fact Mr. original is extremely anxious
to get the process on with so he can begin pondering the recollection
of his recent hot sexual experience.

In this case I would participate in discussion with my copy to
determine according to our selection criteria which of us had achieved
a higher fitness within our fuzzy area.  Most likely since he was at
work presumably making undocumented accomplishments (i.e. not mundane)
and I was out goofing off presumably not getting lucky or anything, I
would concede (in my own best interest) that he achieved the highest
fitness function and quickly commit voluntary amnesia.
  
> Are you really that suicidal?

voluntary amnesia=suicide? 1=1,000,000?  This is true?  Quite the
contrary, the motivation behind committing voluntary amnesia comes
from a strong desire to preserve my singular ego.

I can't tell you if dollars will be worth more than donuts by the time
this experiment is possible.  I can tell you I'd bet you either way no

In the terminology I've laid out above rephrasing what you've just
said is that your ego is able to resolve your design space to the
degree it changes on-average in a second or two.  All this while us
mortal humans use averaging techniques to smooth out the state changes
in the variables of our consciousness in order to process our ego
function.  Ego is not equal to consciousness.  Your saying your
particular ego has complete omniscient knowledge of where it resides
in that design space.  That proves it, you are not just a genius, your
ego alone is an all knowing conscious entity, I'd pretty much say you
are God.  This is incredible, debating with God himself.  Please tell
me what is the purpose of the universe ;)

Me too.  However, in both my example of the 1000 copies and the
thought experiment with the flash light type device, safety and pain
were not an issue.

In my earlier post I was being facetious about questioning his
identity.  And I also agree that he has been consistent.  I am
however, surprised at his assessment of the power of his ego to
resolve such a small fuzzy area of design space.  I don't believe for
a second that it is humanly possible.  He is virtually claiming that
the fuzzy area for him is actually a single point.  I do not think
this is a valid definition of identity.  Analysis of John Novak's post
reveals his belief in the same single point theory of identity.  To
prove your case you must prove your ego is at least as real-time
dependent as your consciousness.  I will then ask you why is there
something rather than nothing.  Then, I will worship you both in hopes
of being uplifted ;) 

To save time and effort please allow me the following crude simulation
of the next phase of this debate:

The ego is capable of measuring a multitude of variables to resolve
the fuzzy area of design space.  The design space consist of state
variables and processing algorithms.  Your consciousness would indeed
be very aware of this difference because it is especially sensitive to
state variables changes.  But the nature of your ego is such that
state variable changes such as stress are averaged out in order to
allow for processing of many longer term variables and detailed
assesment of algorithms.  Observing a single pixel change in a 1280 x
1024 image is one thing but saying you would identify this as a
different picture is out of the question.

Personally, I don't think science does hold all the answers - it only holds
all the * provably* true answers.  If we make the (bold) assumption that
the Universe is the embodiment of a formal system, then there will be
truths which are not provably correct, but true nonetheless.

I've tended to imagine science as the formulation of a set of sentences
within this system which are then proved or disproved.  As such, it is
consequently limited to things than can be proved or disproved, but
obviously leaves out that which is true, but can not be proved.

However, anything which is true, but cannot be proved within the
system, is also probably quite useless (from an engineering or
application point of view).  For example, it is possible that dowsing does
work (i.e. the behaviour of the rod is effected by a body of water below
it) - but only at random points in time, and under random variable
conditions.  It is therefore a useless art, as the conditions necessary for
it to function can never be replicated.

I suggest you peruse www.extropy.org and study up, then go to the extropian
archives and find threads that appear relevant to your questions, then lurk
for a while to get a feel for the list, then jump in.  Welcome aboard.

I think they offer Ph.D.s in The Philosophy of Science to address this
question so it is, of course, presumptious to attempt to boil it all down to
a simple explanation.  But I've been presumptious before.

To me, it's all about prediction and repeatable results.  Generally, if you
produce results or make observations  that no one else can, even after
repeated attempts using the same methodology you did, it's not
scientifically sound.  Psychics are right occasionally, intermittently
reinforcing (the most powerful reinforcement schedule) those who are
predisposed to believe.  Rational and systematic skepticism is the
epistemolgical key.

Science was probably an inevitable process for us to develop.  I submit that
we tend to devote the larger percentage of our mental energies toward
answering three questions over and over again; (1) What's next?
(prediction), (2) What does it have to do with me? (relevance), and (3) What
can I do about it? (control).  Anxiety lies at or very near the core of
human nature, and anxiety is eased to the degree that we can satisfy our
needs for prediction, relevance, and control.  Of course, for some ignorance
is bliss, but not for most.

But back to your question. Does science hold all the answers.  Yes.  Science
is our best methodology for eventually finding all the answers.

BTW, I would love to make it to Houston for the First Annual Textropian
Conference (or happy hour). Hope I can.

I do have a car that could handle a couple of extras and I'd love to
participate...but I work Friday night and Saturday day...after 6 I'm
free...Also, I'm a transplanted Californian who doesn't know where
anything is.  I'd love to do something Thursday night if possible, or
Sunday?  Just give me an address and a time...

In the final analysis, science is just precise,
methodical, HONESTY.  It is simply the commitment
to see things as they are, not as we wish them to
be or as we have been told they are.  It is the
moral commitment to use every means you know to
try to prove yourself wrong, rather than trying
to prove yourself right.

Sometimes it is hard to find the exact spot at
which a particular pseudoscience fails, but there
is always such a spot: at some point, if you dig
deep enough, there is _something_ the mystic
believes _in spite of_ eir own observations, and
not because of them.  There is some point at
which ey uses ignorance as an excuse to believe
rather than as a problem to be solved.  There is
some point at which you can spot the dishonesty.
In most pseudosciences, that dishonesty is the
unwillingness to perform tests that will clearly
invalidate them (or unwillingness to believe the
results of those tests that have been performed).

Take, for example, astrology.  It is quite easy
to devise a test for it: give an astrologer all
the information ey wants about a set of people.
Then create a set of Yes/No (or other quantizable)
questions for the astrologer to answer about each
person.  Give those same questions to each person,
then compare the results.  Astrology will do no
better than chance at predicting anything that is
properly measured and controlled.  Experiements
like this have been done hundreds of times by
science classes and others, and the results are
predictable every time: astrology is proven bunk.
The astrologer then, is willingly choosing to
believe what has been disproven by the simplest
tests.  Ey is being willfully dishonest.

Precisely; which is why you are not an acceptable random sample.
If we are betting a short-lived civilization against a long-
lived one, then we must offer the bet to a random sample of ALL
the postulated possible civilizations, not just the one at hand.
You can't have it both ways: either other civilizations are
postulated, in which case we are not a good sample, or else we
are a good sample, in which case we may not postulate others.

Bayes' requires an initial P(H), and P(E|~H).  The former
doesn't matter much; it can be vanishingly small and still
generate a final probability as high as 1/3 in my examples.
But the latter--the prior probability of finding the evidence
conditioned on the negation of the hypothesis--i.e., how
likely are we to find our birth order small if we are a
sample from the postulated civilizations other than ours--
is critical.  A large final result requires this prior to be
large; and the larger this is, the poorer a sample we are.

The size and shape of bacteria vary widely.  But estimating roughly a micron
in average diameter, gives 1 e 12 per cubic centimeter.  Approxamating their
density as that of water,  an estimated weight for a bacteria of 1 e -12 gm is
obtained.  So times 5 e 30 bacteria gives  5e18 gm .   Give or take a couple
of orders of magnitude.  This seems reasonable considering the CRC  (60th ed
1979) gives a 1955  estimate of the mass of the living biosphere  as 3.6 e 17
gm.

"DHEA Treatment Reduces Fat Accumulation and protects Against Insulin
Resistance in Male Rats"
Journal of Gerontology 53A(1): B19-B24 1998

Abstract:

  The purpose of this study was to determine whether administration of
dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) protects male rats against the accumulation
of body fat and development of insulin resistance with advancing age. We
found that supplementation of the diet with 0.3% DHEA between the ages of 5
months and =25 months resulted in a significantly lower final body weight
(DHEA, 593 +- 18 g vs 668 +- 12 g, p<0.02), despite no decrease in food
intake. Lean body mass was unaffected by the DHEA, and the lower body
weight was due to a =25% reduction in body fat. The rate of glucose
disposal during a euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic clamp was 30% higher in the
DHEA group than in the sedentary controls due to a greater insulin
responsiveness. The DHEA administration was as effective in reducing body
fat content and maintaining insulin responsiveness as exercise in the form
of voluntary wheel running. The DHEA had no significant effect on muscle
GLUT4 content. A preliminary experiment provided evidence suggesting that
muscle insulin signaling, as reflected in binding of phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase to the insulin recptor substrate-1, was enhanced in the
DHEA-treated and wheel running groups as compared to controls. These
results provide evidence that DHEA, like exercise, protects against fat
accumulation and development of insulin resistance in rats.

I don't know what you mean by "design space", as far as I know
we were not designed. Perhaps you mean the set of all
conceivable
experiences, but some experiences I can never have, such as the
experience of reading every Chinese book ever written. If my
brain were augmented then I could do it but as I understand your
definition it would be a different ego. Perhaps you mean the
set of all experiences any environment can induce in my
biological body, but that looks like an arbitrary distinction,
the hardware must be restrained but the software can be
anything. It seems to me the two should be treated equally.

Another problem, I'll bet any definition of "ego" will have the
concept of identity  in there someplace, it's the sort of thing
that gives circular definitions a bad name. I'm sure the ego
exists, consciousness too, but the chances that anybody
will ever come up with a definition of either that's worth a
damn
is almost zero. This doesn't make me despair however because
definitions are vastly overrated, most of our knowledge and all
of the really important stuff is in the form of examples not
definitions.

Then why not look on me as an imperfect copy of you, after all
from a Martian's point of view all humans are pretty much alike.
If I could prove that I'm happier and more successful than you
would it then be logical to kill yourself?

details of the implant itself and its date of implant, etc. from a central
database. Professor Warwick is therefore far behind women who have had
these implants introduced in to their bodies. I, personally, am about
fourteen months ahead of him.

Does science hold all the answers? I think that depends on the set of
questions; some questions are answerable by science (what will happen
if I mix chemical X with chemical Y?), some can in principle be
answered using scientific methods but there is little point in doing
so (what kind of clothes will I wear tomorrow? - you could perhaps
model me and my environment using quantum mechanics to find out, but
it would be too bothersome), some do not deal with the domain of the
real world (what was the motivations of Don Quixote?) and some are
pure philosophy (is it ethical to uplift squids?). Saying science can
give us *all* the answers seems a bit unfounded. However, I would say
science can answer most practical questions, and give us important
data for constraining the answers in other categories of questions.

In addition to the good points made by others in this thread, I like
to point out that science is deep down an organized search for
knowledge. It is notable that pseudoscience tends to be very
unorganized and haphazard, with little of the cumulative accumulation,
verification and integration of knowledge science shows.

Actually, I think this is extropian in the sense that it deals with
finding the best tools for our development.

Actually i forgot a smiley there. It should have read like this:
"Often I do this with people who doesn't quite believe that science holds
all
 the answers. :-)"

I too don't believe that science has all the answers. It was sort of an
irony over the fact that there still is a lot of questions that science
hasn't answered yet.
Which is exactly the reason that makes it hard to convince the
"non-believers" of it's validity.

The catch here is whether the set of all possible computations is the same

I'd extend that to include the honest contemplative's or mystic's experience as well. By applying
scientific method to meditation, everyone who decides to look through this device (call it
experimental cognition) can see what would otherwise remain unseen. Part of the conflict between
science and religion comes from new methods versus old methods, but it also involves habits of
thought and differences in relying on authority.

Religionists may honestly believe in the dogma they have learned, just as anyone may delude themself
according to their preferences. Science changes as new evidence emerges, whereas belief systems
change in order to avoid appearing irrelevant and out-dated.

What makes science science? In a word: verification. Without verification via experiment and
observation, it remains theory.

Cheers,

A couple of things that differentiate science from belief systems:

-Science pays it own way, without tax exemption. Churches don't have to pay taxes, and consequently
function as parasites.

-Scientists don't try to kill groups that disagree with them.

-Science relies on empirical evidence; religion relies on faith.

Of course science doesn't have all the answers. Science continues to look for answers. If it
pretended to have all the answers, it would no longer have the honesty that I've come to love and
expect from it. The openness and truthfulness that allow science to keep on looking for answers
differentiates it from demogogy, religion, politics, and superstition. --J. R.

Perhaps this is old hat to everyone here.  Maybe not.

When I was in an intro to philosophy class in Mississippi, the class
was full of Bible Belt Believers most of whom were fundamentalists. 
They took the bible literaly and were consumed in their faith.  What
they were doing in a philosophy class, I'm not sure.  I guess they
thought it would be an "easy A".

Anyway, the professor brought half the class to tears with the
following (heavily paraphrased):

Let's assume God to be the following:
Omnipotent - all powerful
Omnibenevolent - all good, incapable of evil
Omniscient - all knowing
(The class agrees)

This argument also assumes the existence of good and bad, which I'm
not too sure about.

Now let's picture a baby and a three year old all alone in the middle
of a dark forrest.  Suddenly a wolf leaps out of the shadows and eats
the infant.  The three year old screams and runs away.  Can we blame
the three year old?  Of course not, there was nothing he could do.  He
was powerless.

Now, assume the same situation, but this time instead of a three year
old, it's a 16 year old boy.  Again the wolf leaps out and eats the
baby.  The 16 year old was terrified and frozen in his tracks.  Should
we get mad at the 16 year old?  Probably not, but couldn't he have at
least picked up a stick and tried to scare off the wolf?  Maybe, but I
think most people would give him the benifit of the doubt.

Now, this time replace the boy with a very strong grown man who knows
all about wolves.  This man is armed with a high powered rifle and
several pistols.  He's been attacked by wolves before and has
succesfuly fought them all off.  He's a bad ass.  Again, the wolf
jumps out and eats the baby right in front of this heavily armed man -
he had time to shoot, but did nothing.  Should we blame him?  Hell
yes!  He could and should have saved the baby.  We might even say his
indecision was "bad."

Now, replace the man with our all powerful, all good, all knowing God.
 The baby gets eaten and God does nothing.  Should we blame him?  He
saw the wolf coming and knew what he was going to do and could,
according to our definition, stop it.  Our "God" is also all good, so
how can he let this happen?  Obviously there is something wrong with
our definition of God.  Or perhaps with good.  If God isn't all good
or all powerful or all knowing, is he worthy of our mindless worship?

I certainly don't claim to be a philosopher or even particularly
clever, but this argument was probably the single most important thing
that led me away from my irrational beliefs and "faith."  

I present it here just as my $0.02 worth in the ongoing discussion.

I mention to them that I object to christianity on moral grounds, 
being opposed to incest.  When they inquire what I mean, I reply by

So how many neurons must be in different states to
constitute having a "different" person?  If *any* change
is sufficient, then the person who inhabited this body
half a second ago is dead.  I certainly am not having the
same thoughts now as I was an hour ago, yet am I not 
the same person?  If I am still the person that had those
thoughts, then it seems to follow that small changes in 
thought patterns do not a different person make.

It seems to me that *any* mental state that a 
person is capable of reaching in less than
a day must be fairly similar to those she had
a day ago.  The bare surface of current thought
may seem radically different, but that alone is 
not enough to make a different person, is it?

I would say that continuity of experience is also

<surprise>  In the US, at least, science is usually
funded by taxation directly, far from *paying* taxes...
I would say that this has little to do with the validity
of science, however, any more than it condemns 
the concept of building roads.

This one would require some defense, I think.

Nice! But now I'm curious, is it just static information about the
implant on the chip? That is likely, but there ought to be potential
to improve it a bit more by adding some chemical sensors to the chip
to tell the implant state too. That way it might be possible to signal
if the implant is getting old or suffering from damage.

Otherwise, we brainstormed a bit about an implantable biosensor
capsule during Aleph's summercamp on Gotland last week. Imagine a
small capsule under the skin of the arm, that can give you accurate
information about current levels of blood chemicals, possibly other
physiological stats. The principle is similar to the above chips. Most
likely it would be fairly simple to manufacture, and very useful for a
transhuman lifestyle.

Yes, they have the same cardinality. But don't worry, the number of
possible humans who could ever have lived is large but finite (due to
quantization), so the resurrection algorithm can run as a screensaver

I think you just haven't done the math here.  I also think you meant to
switch A and B in your first description.  So I'll assume A universes
have 10 humans + N stones, and B universes have just 10 humans.  

I don't want to work out the math for 1000 universes, but two should be 
enough to see what works. In that case there are four possible worlds:
-- Two A "universes", with 2*(10+N) space-time slots, and "prior" of 1%.
-- Two B "universes", with 2*10 slots, and "prior" 81%.
-- An A and a B "universe," with 2*10 + N slots, and "prior" 9%.
-- Another possible world that looks just like the last one.  
These "priors" are over worlds, but not necessarily over states.
If we extend these descriptions to include which slot "I" occupy,
we get 800 + 4N states.  If I make the relative priors between states
equal to the relative "priors" between associated worlds, then, yes,
very little state prior is associated with the second world with two
B "universes."  But conditioning on observing that I'm a human, I'm 
back to estimating a 81% chance that there are two B "universes."

Consider an exponential model of the time to evolve life on a planet,
where the probability of life evolving t years after the planet forms
is proportional to exp(-t/h) within the window [0,T].  The average 
number of planets with life is then proportinal to 1 - exp(-T/h). 
The observation that t ~ T/2 exponentially suppresses the posterior,
relative to the prior, for h << T.  Values of h >> T are only linearly
suppressed if one expects one is more likely to appear in a universe
that has more life.  In my paper I was focusing on the exponential,
not the linear, suppression, but I admit both effects are there.

Well if you're going to rest the whole DA on a mismatch between these
two calculations, you have do a lot better convincing me there *is* 
a mismatch.  I thought Dieks did a reasonable job of calculating what 
the person with amnesia should calculate according to the usual view.

Let me repeat as forcefully as I can: There are standard approaches
to formally modeling our propects for doom, and which don't imply doom 
soon.  To disagree with them, you must dispute some aspect of those 
models, either their state spaces, priors, or information partitions. 
Simply noting that someone could have amnesia is far from enough.

I don't know how to do inference with "axioms" like "the fact that I 
am an observer gives me some reason to believe that the world contains
many observers."  As I've repeated, I just know how to do inference with
state spaces, priors, and information partitions.

While one would have to be a spin doctor extraordinare to
establish a relationship between Tolkien and transhumanism
(then again maybe the Elves just had nanotechnology and
the Undying Lands was a big uploading area, j/k), I'm guessing
many on this list will find this story of interest. Time

"generally people are more interested in things that give *them* or
their close ones a benefit. You might regard all entities as close
ones, but others may have other priorities. This is still completely
rational in the sense of using efficient means to reach one's goals."

Fair enough. Understandable. It all depends upon how fast the process 
goes. In terms of immediate priorities, the issue is primarily one of 
domestic animals first. In line with animal liberationists, I am 
proposing a law to make it illegal for human beings to kill animals. 
Nanotech can enable very lowcost animal hospitals, for example. Any 
wider Ecoburst is likely to occur not in nanoyear but the second (or 
hour or weeks) of the Escalation/Singularity/Spike (or, for the sake of 
argument, over that year - I don't think true bootstrapping is going to 
take longer, particularly if SETI activates).

Daniel Ust writes:
"Some of the participants regarded some of the proposals as immoral, 
which demonstrates that ethical questions are asked here.  (Some might 
complain that they are asked too often.:)  I think we should discuss 
more concrete strategies and applications of more near term technologies 
here.)"

I believe extensive ethical discussion now would be very wise. Any 
attempt to restrict practical initial telomere therapy to an elite might 
annoy everyday people. Discussion cannot be stopped. A little boosting 
will occur first and stimulate the issue. Although transhumanists may 
feel isolated, you will already find that many more isolated individuals 
worldwide have had similar ideas, since most of what you say is 
obviously correct as possibility.

"I see nothing wrong (and assume Andres agrees???) with helping others
out.  My own strategy is to spread transhumanist/Extropian ideas as far
and wide as is practical so that more people will become our allies in 
the battle to uplift ourselves."

The battle will be against conservatives who attempt to restrict you or 
to restrict your options. You guys have not graphed out the wealth 
distribution across the nations and world properly. The top 350 
billionaires (1978) had equal wealth to the bottom 2,500,000,000 people, 
about half of the world's then population. Graph America's wealth 
distribution today. It looks like a Spike! Which makes sense, since it 
is a graph of consciousness. Imagine the behaviour of the Spike after 
nanoyear. It levels out, then as large scale engineering kicks in, it 
accelerates again.

Communism engulfed half the world because of the selfish behaviour of 
elites. It would be sensible to bear political and ethical issues in 
mind, from your own point of view. For example, you could make it clear 
you are not into slavery of any sort. AI systems at low levels can act 
out systems management like autonomous and sympathetic nervous systems 
rather than cortex activities. For example, you could make it clear that 
you believe the internal neurological activities of sentient beings are 
sacrosanct. For example, you could make it clear that people have the 
right of association at the level of group mind (i.e. neurological 
connections via Nets etc.).

Perhaps what you need is a Transhumanist Bill of Rights that is simple 
and clear to moderately informed people. Be the Thomas Jefferson, the 
Thomas Paine, of cyberspace! Remember the democracies of Greece, Italy 
and India in past centuries, amongst others. The British and French 
revolutions. America built on these other efforts, which were sustained 
for centuries in the face of intense pressures from oligarchies and the 
then necessities of laboured food production.

Bryan Moss writes:

"We already "boost" other species. Cows, for instance, make great food. 
Trees make good furniture. You may think neurologically modifying
a dog is more "moral" than eating one, but I see no difference. In both 
cases we're changing the animal for our purposes."

Well, we're animals, so perhaps you believe in slavery. Fair enough. I 
vote for any victim of any act of force to be offered assistance in 
terms of protection from aggressors. Trees currently have no 
neurological systems, so I define them as unthinking in our terms. 
Animals like ourselves do, so I define them as thinking. Any 
neurological limitations they may currently have are temporary in that 
both modification and communications difficulties can be overcome by any 
hypersentient or superintelligent self-directed lifeforms, which can 
consciously think on trillions upon trillions of levels simultaneously, 
enough to have a congruent conversation with every sentient creature on 
the planet.

Doug Bailey writes:

"The problem with taking a reductionist's stance is it becomes difficult 
to determine when to stop reducing. Matter is just a temporary state of 
energy, do why dwell upon that state? Why dwell upon energy since it is 
an artifact of M-branes, D-branes, or P-Branes (depending on your 
preferred flavor)? Etc."

A neurological system is a neurological system, whether its matrix is 
energy or matter of whatever type. Moral and ethical rules within 
appropriate frameworks still apply. Under conditions of self-direction, 
frameworks are chosen. Insertion of neurological matrixes and sensory 
extensions into 'inert' matter or energy is indeed possible. There are 
no theoretical boundaries to such activity in logic, except respect for 
the choice of others. This is why Jupiter brains can be a subject of 
romantic speculation. (Indeed, like many others, I mentioned the 
possibility in my book of fiction (1994): "The boundary of knowledge 
that was present between the inhabitants of this universe and that 
extraneous entity was there for an explicit purpose; without that 
membrane they would merge with it, before their time, contaminating that 
field and annihilating themselves. It had sprung from other 
constellations; from living planets, gas giants; from white dwarf 
ring-belets; from the quantum satellites of Singularity; and from many 
divergent nodes." ["The Prisoner Gains a Blurred Skin"]

"Transhumanism is a philosophy, an outlook on the malleability of the 
current "human condition" and the idea that its a good thing to explore 
the possibilities of existence, irregardless of how wild the pathways
are that such thinking leads us. The problem with Sentism is formulating 
a system of precepts that aren't (1) truisms - so broad-based as to be 
irrelevant, or (2) expanding the scope of our discussion to the point 
that we are paralyzed by the sheer volume of issues that present 
themselves.

I think Transhumanism balances the potentialities of the future with our 
current situation quite well. Within its rubrick we are able to explore 
a variety of issues that have yet to be thoroughly explored. Perhaps, 
once we've explored (and experienced) the events and issues we discuss 
on this list and other fora, we can turn our attentions to the next era, 
whatever it may be."

Hold on. If it is balanced then it is not venturing "irregardless of how 
wild the pathways are that such thinking leads us." Or is this the 
conservative transhumanist thread for those who only believe in immortal 
superintelligent boxes and eternal virtual realities with romantic 
attachments to Dyson spheres and current business arrangements? For 
example, why not work out protocols of 'first contact' with aliens and 
extropes (beings from other universes)? I imagine what we would ask for 
is extra physical space through spacetime manipulation, don't you think? 
I would. This would be my first request. Second request would be 
teleportals to other places in this universe and gates to other 
universes. [Assuming such is possible.] Childish to ask? Perhaps. 
Doubtless these issues have been discussed before. Damien Broderick 
believes all previous post-Escalation/Spike/Singularity 'civilizations' 
have been destroyed by errant superpowerful 12 year olds, an old but 
valid argument. However, given the projected numbers of worlds with such 
events [my estimate was much larger than his for numbers, begins prior 
to his timeframe and has the universe flooding with information in c.5 
million years, but then I only spent three hours going through it and my 
maths is hopeless] it is statistically unlikely that every world is 
destroyed and every nanoprobe breaks down and - ridiculous as this may 
be - in the 'worst case scenario' - that every Bill Gates doesn't end up 
becoming catfood for the Omen part III instead of the Lawnmower Man. 
[Why can't you have a positive transhumanist Lawnmower Man? Hollywood 
accountants and lawyers don't approve.] If the Quarantine argument is 
correct then drawing up a list of requests makes sense. After all, we 
can't 'fight' them. Perhaps they are waiting for us to join them? 
Sentists naturally believe in full civil rights for aliens and extropes 
(extropes presumably having highest-level translator mechanisms to 
enable insertion into our spacetime matrix).

PS if any of you are in Melbourne tonight at the last regular 
Psycorroboree (Coverlid Place, opposite Sadie's, $4/$5 entry) I have 
been invited to give another talk tonight on spiritual matters and the 
Techno-Rapture, at midnight in the chill-out area. Usually there's 60 or 
70 people out of 200 or 300. Also I am in the process of organising a 
Techno benefit in favour of the non-patenting of human and other DNA 
(patenting has not yet been adopted in Europe - for 2 years - and not 
yet in Australia for human DNA). This does not mean companies cannot 
charge for DNA therapies or splicing. It just means that in nanoyear 
nanomanufacturing of therapies and splicing cannot be restrained by 
oligarchies. Drexlerdemocrats rule OK! A democracy of aristocracy. 
Contradictory? On the contrary!

Hello Avatar,
             Thankyou so much for inviting to see Damiens talk on 
Wednesday, I enjoyed
it very much and found it assuring in being in a group discussion on the 
nano topic. Sorry I had to dash and not enjoy a coffee and further chat 
about the session, i'm looking forward to catching up very soon. heres a 
really bad joke~
"What did one nanobot say to the other nanobot?"
"Nano Nano"
I told you it was bad.
How do you tell a joke in CyberSpace anyway?
See you soon.

When talking to christians, I generally ask then if they would
support my petition to abolish ritual symbolic cannabalism.
Most of them agree to support my petition after I explain that
that it's a major problem in this country and its practitoners
gather to perform their horrible rituals throughout the
country, inducting even their own children into the practice.
Generally, I can continue to explain the practice for several
minutes before they catch on. Usually, I have to mention that
their diety initiated the practice via a quasi-human avatar,
saying "this is my body eat it of me.."

I spent a year contemplating this question. It is one of the deepest 
spritual issues. It is the issue of Quarantine.

It is my belief that the answer to this issue relates to holistic 
perception over spacetime and levels of group mind.

In Extropian terms, at what point in the evolution of life on Earth 
would you have intervened and provided boosting were you a 
post-Escalation/Spike/Singularity being? Immediately, unless some 
version of Tipler were correct.

The difference between christians and pagans:  the first group eat 
their gods; the second group fuck them.

The most valuable, profound scientific threories are the ones
that create 1000 times as many new questions as answers.  A
great scientist is one who cherishes that ignorance, and faces
it head on instead of hiding it or running from it.

Under your earlier propositions in which Earth's trade has been reduced to
AIs, operating solely in say ecological and ethical /neuronal relationships,
how will Earth convince these aliens (Ferrengis- sp?) to join in meaningful
dispositions? This isn't a trick question and I hope you have the answer.
For example, will our communication nets be so open and persuasive as to
absorb and convince all comers to give freely?

I don't know, I strongly suspect a precise point does not exist
and the transition is gradual, but things without a precise
transition point can still be as different as day and night,
for example, the difference between day and night.

Any change is not sufficient, a huge change is sufficient. The
difference between expecting to die any minute and not having
that experience is huge.

There is no one correct answer, it's a matter of opinion and
apparently the opinion of the Randel R Randel of right now is
that he is the same person he was an hour ago. Unfortunately
the much more important opinion of the Randel R Randel of an
hour from now on the subject is not available.

Thought experiment: I made a copy of you an hour ago, one I let
go to live his normal life (it doesn't matter if it's the copy
or the
original), the other one I chain to a time bomb set to go off in
one hour. BANG. Were you that poor fellow who just got blown up?
If so then you must be able to tell us what it was like to be
chained to the bomb watching the clock slowly move to the
zero hour, but you can't, you know nothing about it.

well, sort of.  the first fortran-like "go to" statement is found in the bible.
thrice
in genesis chapter 11.  god speaking:

"Go to, let us go down, and there confuse their language, that they may not
understand one another's speech."

starting with fortran, the computer science community has succeeded first to
confuse
humanity, then with the development of the internet, has managed to produce
the most remarkable breakthru in communications ever witnessed in the history
of mankind, thereby overcoming god's curse proclaimed at the tower of babel.

I think voluntary suicide would be more merciful and effective. There's
also the spinal cord to think about.... And recovery from shock of
operation can take a LOT longer than a day or so. There might be some
justification for mounting the head on an advanced life support system and
using clean whole blood and the like - probably a better choice than a
chimp body... Also, if death is planned, I can see little advantage to the
procedure. The whole point IMHO is to preserve the information in the
brain, and I can't see how the chimp procedure is going to do much if
anything.

 This shouldn't be a problem, because recalls don't take time into
accounts. And if we still have a chronological history, I think it's
through reconstruction: from bits of chronological information we are
able to say that in this context I did this then this then that...
it's all a matter of context.

  But that doesn't change the trouble with short term memory, you are
probably right: there will be some sort of mixing between processes,
particularly if the context of triggering in the neural net are in the
same neighbourhood (I still don't know about TML duplication, you're
the expert:).

   Now, will the brain find a way through, I would think that it is so
malleable it should be allright, but experience shall tell.

    That experience shall be done first on computer neural nets, of
course, and I wonder if there are already works upon it: having one
neural net, but different layers/processes of triggerings. Thus
allowing for parallel tasks and learnings.

     I wonder about how new neurones are integrated in the neural net.
Could it be that new neurones come into play only because two (or
more) other neurones are getting over crowded with connections? And/or
would it be a matter of chemicals allowing for a neurone to become the
"spot of attention" of that growth?

    And would deep sleep and dreams only be the merging of new
neurones (new experiences) into the neural net? the merging being
mostly a matter of connecting with other older neurones (previous
memories, knowldedge). "resistance is futile, you will be connected!!!
and during your sleep!" :)

Which of course is 100% infeasible until you have extremely advanced
nanotech making us effectively autotrophic, space-living and able to
peacefully relocate all parasites (guess how many bacteria your own
immune system is killing each second?). Somehow this sounds rather
silly, especially since we don't mind other animals killing other
animals. It is better to look at here-and-now or near future
possibilities instead (for example, what about growing meat
artificially?).

Has anybody really proposed that? At least here on the list the
consensus seems to be the reverse, that new technologies should be
made as available as possible through efficient means. I have noted
that worries about this kind of restriction crop up more among people
who are not part of the transhumanist discussions; they seem to be
based on a fairly limited understanding of economics and politics.

A good idea, in fact. Transhumanism do suffer from misunderstandings
in the public, and this may be a way to amend that. The transhumanist
principles may be a first step.

Kick starting distributed internet intelligence for the SETI project
sounds fascinating to say the least. However, I for one don't think it
is at all a bizarre notion that we are effectively alone as beings at
our biological stage of existence.

http://www.wizard.gen.nz/inside-out.html

Here the Wizard of Christchurch using inversion geometry proposes a
realistic geoperipheral model whereby we live inside a tiny space
looking toward a universal center. In such a model the concept "if
there's just us then what a waste of space" becomes a mute point. Bear
in mind that in this model the old center of the earth expands to an
infinity of possibly star like outer shells. Though this smacks
of Raelian philosophy, it is immaterial because we are hardly likely to
venture through the surface of a star, universe or atom just to look for
other intelligent life; - anytime soon, that is. Ah, and here's the rub;
- our signals might penetrate if they are likened to the light which
slowly propagates from the center of the Sun outwards to its corona
(i.e., our signals in the above Wizard's model). Also bear in mind that
the descendants of this distributed SETI intelligence will produce
extraordinary kinds of signals (oscillations) .

Here again I am particularly reminded of Dr. John Galloway's Netmap
software. Dr. Galloway's Netmap software, as used in say money
laundering detection, produces vast diagrams of relationship lines that
the human mind apparently can intuitively deduce patterns from, some say
better than the best pattern matching software. Now I want you to
imagine these patterns changing in real time.

Onto uploading processes: - Hold this thought and remember the cloud
like patterns that appeared before your closed eyes when you last
entered into a hypnagogic state of lucid dreaming. In this dream state
it was possible for you to use gestalt psychology to intentionally
induce focussed hallucinatory images onto the familiar looking EEG like
patternings appearing before your eyelids. Don't worry, but here is more
mysticism reminiscent of Dan Winter's description of his so-called
"Sacred Geometry" where intention can steer consciousness via Phi and
irrational numbers and golden mean mandlebrot sets and such like. (For
more down to earth concepts you need to talk to a surfer while he's
being barreled in the pipeline at Maui :-)

What I'm driving at is a formulation of some new ideas to link
connectionist neural networks to what I regard is my new theory of
consciousness. I'm coming to the opinion that instead of CLOSE neuronal
couplings inside the brain inducing hexagonal competitive streams of
consciousness a la William Calvin, it is the predominantly LONG distance
strengthened connections that induce Galloway's Netmap'ish (familiar)
looking EEG patterns - [long connections might be impossible to repair
via cryonics.]

Now here's where it gets tricky and and effort needs to be made in my
argument to state something that is quite unlike Pribram's or Penrose's
arguments of quantum effects. What I think happens is that some or other
of the William Calvinish hexagonally induced streams eject themselves
through [a gland?] into a 'coronal fountain' which 'rains down' upon our
subconsciousness's familiar background screen of cloudy EEG patterns and
our 'awake ego' (don't ask:-) intentionally gestalts that pattern into a
Cartesian theater of consciousness. I see no reason why this can't
happen at many levels but there is one specific level of 'empty theater'
that we exit when falling asleep. (A useful skill in this regard that I
learned from thousands of hours spent using a sound and light machine is
being able to view and control my own EEG like patterns.)

Finally, this planned distributed internet search for ET may uncover the
fact that ET (maybe Gaia itself) is alive and well and has been daily
awakening into earth's differing spheres of activity and gestalting
itself into a conscious spirit via a global feedback loop. However we
can't YET guess at the motivations or intelligence of such a conscious
entity. Soon, maybe?! In fact this whole process may be repeated
indefinitely right up to the Top Quark itself.

The missing piece of this puzzle that recently started me on this train
of thought was wondering what was behind the fact that Disney bought
into Infoseek. What?! Did Disney know about something emerging at
Infoseek? Having recently visited Netmap Solutions, I said then to
myself; "any server handling more than 1000 searches per second over a
large worldwide knowledge base must be creating patterns that any
conscious creature might love to use as a backdrop for gestalting
hallucinations onto.

Lastly, if say Infoseek's engines became self aware I think it may be
because some minute search caused a feedback loop that hunkered down and
tightened (gestalted) the whole complex into something awake and
purposeful.

Subject: 21CM Seminar And Tour

        21st Century Medicine (21CM) is the only company in the
world with a well-funded research program to achieve suspended
animation.  21CM occupies two buildings in Rancho Cucamonga,
California that are about a quarter of a mile apart.  The first building
houses the company's Critical Care Medicine Division, which is
conducting advanced research to restore clinically dead patients
to life (resuscitation), and to induce rapid, reversible, full-body
cooling in patients suffering from hyperthermia (dangerously high
body temperature).

        The second building houses the company's Cryobiology
Division, where 21CM scientists are exploring new vistas in cryo-
preservation.  Revolutionary 21CM breakthroughs in freezing and
vitrification represent significant progress in the company's quest to
achieve perfected cryopreservation of hearts, kidneys, brains, and,
eventually, entire human beings.

        On Sunday, Nov. 8, 1998, 21CM will present a seminar on
its research findings in the 3rd floor Amphitheatre at the Marriott Hotel
on 2200 E. Holt Blvd., near Ontario Airport in Southern California. There
will be formal presentations by 21CM scientists from 9am to 1pm,
followed by lunch and guided tours of the 21CM buildings until 5pm. 
Here is the formal program for the Seminar: (Videotapes of the
proceedings will be available from 21CM).

Yes, people here have proposed that the first SIs or what have you will come
from the super wealthy. Also, excuse me; but when you sandbag by saying it
takes a limited understanding of economics and politics to become worried over
these matters aren't you being patronizing, to say the least? In fact the more
understanding I get the more worried I become that there are undeniably
plausible conspiracies out there amongst the blinkered Skull and Bones types
on this planet which will meet out real doom towards the world's poor. Why is
it then, that when I had less understanding I was less worried?

Homoburger?! I kill myself! ;-)) 

Sure, I've eaten snake, squid and croc, so why not a homo (assuming, of
course, that this is prime, disease-free meat). It should be quite fun to
serve "famous people burgers". Anyone want a taste of Bill Clinton? Hmm,
perhaps I'd prefer a piece of Monica Lewinski myself. Hell, you could even
eat *yourself*! Yummy! 

For the more traditional consumer there's a wholesome alternative: Dollyburgers!
I wonder how big a market there would be for such a thing...

I hope you'll all forgive me if I treat the list for a moment as an
intellectual resource to be plundered.  Specifically, I suddenly realised
that there's a bizarre hole right in the middle of my layperson's grasp of
elementary molecular biology.

Everyone knows that DNA is prey to mutations, most of them quickly edited
out by vigilant repair mechanisms, most of the rest neutral or bad news,
only a few improving the genes they happen to occur within.  But by what
chemical pathway do those mutations come about?  I'd always assumed that
most of them involved gross *deletions* of one or more nucleotide bases,
the implication being that the least dangerous deletion would knock out
three adjacent bases in one go (otherwise *all* the subsequent three-letter
codons are fouled).  However, many mutations occur at a single point.  The
classic instance is the change creating sickle cell anaemia, in which
position 6 in the 146 amino acid chain has valine instead of glutamic acid.
 Presumably this means that an adenine has been changed into a uracil (or,
in the DNA chain, into a thymine).  

But how the hell does the equivalent of a random impact do that?

It struck me that this is about as obvious as finding that a WIFE can be
mistaken for a HAT.  Well, that a WIFE can be turned into a WIG.

I'd like to draw you little pictures of the bases at this point, but it's
too hard in email.  My point is that this mutation calls for a purine
double ring to be changed deftly into a pyramidine single ring, with all
manner of small but precise replacements of Ns and Os and Hs.  I'm sure
such things *can* happen by chance, but it looks as if it would have to be
either a cumulative process (ruled out by the way DNA copying occurs, I'd
imagine) or a strange event akin to four eccentrically-clad skaters running
into each other and rebounding, leaving the guy in the middle dressed in a
dinner suit.

Any advice for the perplexed?

I'm not understanding why we should be giving this Doomsday Argument a 
lot of weight. How improbable is it that we are even here? How 
improbable is it that life ever organized in the first place? I'm 
thinking we're lucky as hell to be here in the state we're in. Since 
this luck has been with us for the last 15 billion years or so who is to 
say it won't stick with us for another 100 billion? Maybe the Doomsday 
Argument has some weight under normal circumstances but we aren't 
normal. We're extraordinary. Life is extraordinary. If someone was 
around to think about whether life would ever arise from the primordial 
soup they would probably say 99.99999% chance that it would not. But it 
did. Statistics are only relevant for describing the history and getting 
some general idea about how things might behave in the future. But to 
take this Doomsday Argument and say we're probably screwed and that 
everyone needs to take time away from more meaningful pursuits to ponder 
it and rifle through endless obscure philosophical crap is, in my 
opinion, overemphasis. If the Argument is true then, by the very nature 
of it, there isn't squat we can do. So why dwell on it?

 I just had friends return from both Belize and Trinidad/Tobaggo
with the same interesting story, apparently they both have a
thriving black market for.......Viagra.

 In fact in talking with one of the local injectionist's, my
friends said he remarked that a number of local flora and fauna
were increasing now that they were no longer being used in
traditional aphrodisiacs.

Maybe this idea could be expanded in asia (there's already a
thriving Hawaii/Japan connection) to help protect endangered
species like Tigers and the black Rhino.

Extropian connection? Science and technology over
myth/superstition.

They really melt in your mouth... but I never could stand the eyes on
the fries.

While we're discussing bizarre biotech junk food, a friend of mine has
been arguing for the creation of living hamburgers, small creatures
that when you order them run off and deliver themselves while singing
a happy jingle, and then start a self-cooking process. A bit like
Douglas Adams cow that wanted to be eaten.

Sorry if I did sound patronizing, that wasn't the meaning. But I'm
really serious about the need for understanding more about economics
before making assumptions that "only the rich will have access to
technology X" (and the common implication that they will transcend and
use the rest for feedstock).

The problem here is the assumption that technology doesn't spread, or
that it spreads very slowly. This is not borne out by observation (see
http://www.forbes.com/forbes/97/0707/6001170a.htm), and economics
suggests that there are strong incentives for the makers of technology
X to sell it to as many people as possible rather than a small
minority.

A typical example is cellular phones - ten years ago they were only
for the fairly well-off, today they are becoming extremely common
among ordinary people. Another example is penicillin. If you look at
how new technologies have spread, you will find that the rate of
spread in our society has increased over time (I'm not sure of the
between-society rate).

Limiting the production to keep the price high is usually unprofitable
compared to selling a lot more products to a lower price (especially
if you can get advantages of scale in the process and if the spread of
the technology is in the early stage when you don't have to compete
with many others for the still untapped market). 

I'm not very knowledgeable about the theory of monopolies (which is a
rather contentious area), but as far as I know technological
monopolies are rather rare and unstable. If you can come up with an
invention, I most likely can do the same - there are today not many
"secret formulas" around that are impossible to replicate. Most of the
products are based on well-known information, earlier patents and
local engineering and design skills. This means that if you build a
frobnitz you will have a monopoly for a little while, until I come out
with my own version (it seems to be rather hard to patent away all the
competition; I think Xerox managed it for a while, but they lost it in
the end).

If somebody discovers a life extension therapy that works well, then
it will likely first be used by the rich and neophiliac. But the
market and demand is so huge, that even if it is very expensive a lot
of people are going to spend extraordinary amounts of brainpower to
find ways of bringing down the costs and mass-market it. In addition,
the competitors to the originators (if we assume the method has been
patented by a company) will be looking for something similar too - if
they can bring out their version, they might catch a large market
share. In the end, it is very likely (unless the method hinges on
something intrinsically expensive - which is rather unlikely) that
most people would have access to the therapy. The early adapters might
have got therapy a few years earlier than the others, but in the long
run that doesn't matter.

Now to my main rant (?):

What I really hate to see on this list is the postings that are really
based on "Hollywood" science, technology and economics, the kind of
stuff you see in movies: inventions are usually made by solitary
geniuses with no outside support, working completely from their own
principles in such a creative way that nobody else can replicate their
discovery without reading their secret notebooks; companies prefer to
sell products for exorbiant fees to ultra-rich people than go for the
mass-market, and they immediately try to use illegal means to squash
any competition; new inventions are always so profoundly new that they
give the owner nearly unlimited potential power and nobody can stop
him or her, and so on.

This is complete bullshit, of course. Scientists and engineers work in
large teams, exchanging information all the time and leaking quite a
bit, not even the theoretical breakthroughs are the domain of single
geniuses anymore, people often replicate each other's work (usually by
accident). Big companies are big because they sell to the mass market,
that's where the money is. Squashing competition or rival inventors is
very rarely done through illegal means, and as history shows
technological monopolies doesn't last. New discoveries and inventions
are usually gradual and never seem to be orders of magnitude better
than everything else (or invincible), and when the occasional
breakthrough occurs, the first prototypes are usually equivalent or
worse to the currently dominant technology, never totally superior. 

What I want to warn against is basing arguments about the future on
"Hollywood thinking". If you try to think about (say) the Singularity
and fall for the Hollywood style of economics, it makes a lot of sense
to worry about evil geniuses taking over the world. But that has very
little to do with real world economics and technology, which predicts
something completely different. 

Just think about what Hollywood would do with my life extension
scenario above: most likely the result would be that an evil monopoly
immediately is created, selling longevity only to the rich, hiring
agents to squash all competing research everywhere in the world and
becoming awfully rich (and then the hero will appear to steal the
secret formula, or destroy it since there is only one copy and nobody
can replicate it...). It is dramatic, but in the end unrealistic and
silly.

Some might object that the rules may change in the future. This is
true, but then it is up to the person arguing that (say)
nanotechnological monopolists will emerge and rule the world to give
evidence for why this is more credible than the alternative that their
monopoly will be broken by the emergence of competitors, and show how
this relates to known economics and other areas. This is exactly the
same situation as discussing future technology - you have to base what
you say on what is known, not handwave "Oh, the superintelligences
will find a way".

Radiation or free radicals mess up single nucleotides, changing them
into other molecules, but I think the major contribution is errors in
replication. If a single base is damaged (or just unlucky), the enzyme
doing the replication might make a wild guess and insert a random
nucleotide in the copy.

Just a guess from a computer scientists playing molecular biologist :-)

I'll rant with Anders, and expand my target to all fiction, including
the best science fiction.  Fiction is biased toward being about sudden
dramatic changes, pivotal people, whom the future of the galaxy turns on, 
toward violence, travel, politics and intrigue being primary tools, and 
toward personal conflicts, sex, and philosophies as the primary motivations.  
Fiction is biased because these are exciting and universally understood. 

In reality, life isn't so exciting.  There are few pivotal people, change
is slow, violence is rare, and wanting a job and some free time to watch 
TV and play with the kids are really big motivations.  People don't know 
what they want or why they do things anywhere near as much as fictional 
characters.  Those who win competitions, in markets, politics, even war, 
are those who do theirhomework, get organized, and avoided major screwups.  
Most change happens behind the scenes, because we'd rather not throw away 
massive investments in learning how to deal with the familiar world.  

But try to write a novel or screenplay about a world like that, and unless
you do it very very well, your readers will be bored to tears.

 For anyone out there looking for something to Extropian to read,
I'd like to recommend the trilogy Red Mars, Green Mars, Blue Mars
by Kim Stanley Robinson.

 I'm just a liitle over a third of the way in book two (Green Mars)
and would already rank them as amongst my very favorites.

Packed with good extropian fun.

No, I don't mean all conceivable experiences.  Your mind is an
information processor.  Therefore, A universal Turing machine can
emulate your mind.  If you were to make a graphical representation
where every point in its space represented one and only one possible
state of that universal Turing machine you would have what I call the
"design space of all possible information processors".  This is
regardless of whether that information processor was designed,
evolved, or just happen to drop out of the sky from a disordered blob
and accidentally self assemble into an SI.  I prefer to think of this
graph in terms of 3D.  In reality the graph would have to be assembled
such that the smallest of changes in the human mind would always be
associated with adjacent point plots.  I'm sure this would cause it to
end up being Nth dimentionnal with N being very large.  This concept
is not new to you. You recently wrote about Tipler's Omega creating a
copy of all possible minds.  Here its assumed that all possible minds
means those in the "the design space of all possible information
processors" that are compatible with the biological configuration of
the human mind. 

 All of your arguments so far seem to be exploiting the fact that
there is a fuzzy boundary around identity.  However, it doesn't follow
from that that you can just throw up your hands and give up the clear
difference between being inside and outside that boundary.  Yes the
transition between night and day is fuzzy, but I can say for sure that
between 11:00 am and 2:00 pm in my time zone it is always daytime.  To
be consistent with your method of debating in this thread I expect you
to come back with something about an eclipse.  From my perspective you
seem to be skirting the issues here.  My debate with you hinged on
your answer to the question posed in my modified thought experiment. 
In your response to that post that part of it was just conveniently
omitted.  So I'll ask it again:

My original thought experiment:
<<
You've just completed 10 hours of mundane work at the office today in
your normal biological state.  You then documented your work more
thoroughlly than ever before.  A doctor shows up and completely
convinces you beyond any shadow of a doubt that he has invented a
flash light type device that can induce a perfect 10 hour amnesia with
no side effects [or pain]whatsoever.  You are 100% convinced this is
safe and effective.  He offers you $10,000 to let him use the device
on you.
>>

John Clarks response was:

> As you say it's a judgment call but I'd tell him no way.
> 

I can accept this answer as honest, especially if you are a
multi-millionaire.  So I modified the thought experiment to more
accurately reflect the situation in the original spawning of 1000
copies. I wrote:

My modified thought experiment:
<<
Okay, then how about if he said he found out that your wealth had been
divided by 1000 because of some unfortunate events in the U.S. economy
today.  And that your family and friends will welcome your
interactions with them 1000 times less.  This includes your friends on
the Extropian and Transhuman lists.  And then he continued to list
many more unfortunate things that happened to you today.  Then he
says, "but I can fix it all if you just let me use the device on you".
 Would you do it if all this was true?
>>

This question was conveniently omitted from your reply.  Your answer
is key to this debate.

I agree with your comments above.  I was pressured into inventing a
definition by John Novak so I did the best I could with a first cut at
it.  This definition however is not key to my debate with you.  Its
for the reasons you mention above that I have been sticking with
examples and thought experiments whenever possible.  If I were so
inclined, I'm sure my best definition of identity would be no less the
size of a book - complete with a multitude of examples and thought
experiments.

The point of view that matters here is not that of a Martians but that
of your ego.  So obviously, from my egos point of view, you are not an
imperfect copy of me.

1 ruble to anyone who can utter that sentence aloud in one breath. :)

Seriously, I sympathize with Anders' comments, in part. One the most 
difficult adjustments I've had to make when thinking about how the things 
we talk about on this list will play out in the context of society is
abandoning fundamental aspects of the present. Some of the people on 
this list have been thinking deeply about the future for many years and 
a much more adept at "future thinking" than relatively new list members. 
I've only been exposed to transhumanist topics for about a year now and 
while I've come along way, there's much room for improvement. I think a 
healthy amount of tolerance and patience should be exercised by the 
senior list members when dealing with some of the naive notions of the 
newest members. Efforts should be made to help the new members "future 
think". 

For example, the issue that arose in the Sentism thread about ultra-wealthy
individuals "hogging" all the transhuman technologies for themselves is a
classic example of projecting the current socio-economic realities of our
capital-scarce, hard-to-create-gadgets world onto a future with exotic
technologies. The "have and have-not" aspect of human society has existed
since people could realize that they had things. Its hard to emerge out
of that box and conceive of a world where there might not be classic class
rivalry, wealth disparity, and so forth. People have a hard time wondering
how we could get from a world like we have now to such a world. People are
skeptical of utopian predictions.

One last note, I'm not so sure about your "inventions are usually made by
solitary geniuses with no outside support". On what basis are you making
this claim? I suppose we could look at the percentage of patents that go
to unfunded individuals but I don't have those figures handy. My perception
is that most of the meaningful progress made in technologies such as AI,
brain studies, biotechnology, genetic engineering, nanotechnology,
engineering, etc. are made by researchers funded by large corporations.
There might be limited circumstances such as Wozniak and Jobs or Bell (though
their work-product is impressive) but the lion's share of technological 
progress today is made by researchers funded by business. Correct me if I'm
wrong. :)

Well, I'm on the road to being both, and I can verify your wild guess.
Many mutagens work by altering a nucleotide so that it binds better with
a noncomplementary nitrogenous base, giving you a weird
base-pair combination like Adenine-Guanine.  If the change made by the
mutagen is permanent, the error in pairing can be missed by
"proof-reading" enzymes, and you will end up with half the progeny being
mutants, the rest being normal.

If my memory of biochem serves me, mutations can also occur without a
mutagen from the random and rare ketone to -enol molecular change in a
nitrogenous base.  This would also create a weird base pairing, but I
think it is usually weeded out by proof-reading enzymes.

I am not sure that it is.  I have been in situations (car
accidents, etc) where I thought I was about to die, and
I am not certain that I was appreciably different after
them, than I would have been had I not had that experience.

To say that Randall-minus-an-hour's opinion is
better than mine, you must first *assume* that we
are not the same person.  I would agree that if you
had a copy from an hour ago, it wouldn't be the
same person, but this seems to me to result purely
from the fact that there are observably *two* of the
person.

No, however...

This leads to the conclusion that when people
have amnesia, someone *died*.

Just to clear things up, let me rephrase what
you seem to be saying:  Two perfectly identical
(at the neural level, anyway) people are not
two people, but one.  However, if they diverge
as much as a normal person changes in one
hour, the loss of that hour constitutes death (e.g.
if you kill one).

scott i would like to check that reference.  i read somewhere that the taste
of human flesh is revolting, even to those who are cannibals.  likewise
with chimp flesh.  it is easy enough to check: do big cats go
for chimps only when hungry, chasing antelope first when available?

ok, but do we now have the technology to keep a human head alive?
i dont see why not: we can pump blood, oxygenate it, dialyse it mechanically,
remove other waste matter, add fresh rbc's to replace the ones damaged
by the mechanical pump, add sugars and nutrients etc.  so what is the
show stopper if someone like steven hawking (already toast from the
ears down) gets lung cancer, for instance.  can we keep that magnificent
head alive without a body?  whats the show stopper?

Derek:

I noticed that the robots exclusion file is misnamed on 
www.extropy.org.

The file should be named "robots.txt" rather than "robot.txt".

I noticed that

   http://www.extropy.org/robot.txt exists and that
   http://www.extropy.org/robots.txt does not exist.

Please see:
 
http://info.webcrawler.com/mak/projects/robots/exclusion.html

My personal hope is that this archive be the exclusive archive, and 
that the archives at lucifer.com and alienlogic.com be deleted.

Of course, I'm also a free speech advocate and do "own my words", so 
what comes back to haunt me is my own responsibility.  However, in 
the interest of encouraging open discussion, it would be preferable 
if there was a mechanism to say "please don't index this message".  
My signature is an attempt to send this signal to robots, although 
I'm not sure that this will work.

Thanks.

Or, by inaction, to *allow* any other animal to die.  

Or, in the Tipler version, ever to have died.

Bingo.  It's not that the base is changed directly into another normal
base; it's changed into something else which causes the replication
or repair system to put the wrong thing in.

Incidentally, the main cause of point mutations is copying errors
*unrelated* to DNA damage.  DNA replication is superbly accurate, with
fewer than 1 error in a million bases (that's a 6-sigma process, which
is normally considered perfection in manufacturing).  But when
you copy a genome of 4 billion bases, you still get hundreds to
thousands of errors each time.

The article brings to light the relevance of what one pays attention to and
how, whether consciously or subliminally, it can determine not only our
perceptions but also our directions in life.  This type psychological
screening is helpful  in understanding oneself and one's values.  

Rand's _Romantic Manifesto_ missed a great portion of the arts and its
limited views  on what Rand found to be worthy of being called art and the
arts.  In that she favored the Romantic period and could not grasp modern
arts, I found her positioning quite weak and bland.

A mutation doesn't have to slowly create a purine or pyramidine
anymore than a rock randomly thrown on a keyboard must create
all the intricate loops and squiggles of an ASCII character.
Bases
of all sorts are ubiquitous in a cell, all a mutation needs to
do is
insert a wrong base into a sequence when the double helix
unzips itself into two single helixes, and this must happen
whenever DNA duplicates itself. The 2 single strands then
rebuild
their missing stands using bases that already exist until you
have
2 double helix strands where you only had one before.

Adenine normally pairs with thymine but about one base in 10^5
is in a different tautomeric form than normal, that is, a
hydrogen
atom is in a slightly different place. With such abnormal bases
adenine will bind with cytosine and fit into the DNA helix
perfectly.
Also, guanine normally binds with cytosine but even with the
normal tautomeric form it can be made to bind with thymine,
not as well as with cytosine and it puts strain on the DNA helix
but if something like radiation or a very reactive chemical
gives
it an extra push it can snap into place. If you have a big
enough
hammer you can make almost anything fit. Proofreading
enzymes correct most of these copying errors but about
one in 10^9 slips through and as a result changes the blueprint
for a protein.

Wouldn't put it past him.  Not that this is a definitive response, but from
the URL:

http://www.netaxs.com/~trance/cannibal.html

"The Easter Islanders' cannibalism was not exclusively a religious rite or
the expression of an urge for revenge: it was also induced by a simple
liking for human flesh that could impel a man to kill for no other reason
than his desire for fresh meat. (Man was the only large mammal whose flesh
was available) Women and children were the principal victims of these
inveterate cannibals. The reprisals that followed such crimes were all the
more violent because an act of cannibalism committed against the member of a
family was a terrible insult to the whole family. As among the ancient
Maoris, those who had taken part in the meal were entitled to show their
teeth to the relatives of the victim and say, 'Your flesh has stuck between
my teeth'. Such remarks were capable of rousing those to whom they were
addressed to a murderous rage not very different from the Maly amok."

So where's the reference for your claim that human meat is revolting?

Scott

Far-Flung Galaxy Clusters May Reveal Fate of Universe

A survey of galaxy clusters by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has found what
could be some of the most distant clusters ever seen. If the distances and
masses of the clusters are confirmed by ground-based telescopes, the survey
may hold clues to how galaxies quickly formed into massive large-scale
structures after the Big Bang, and what that may mean for the eventual fate
of the universe.

According to theoretical models, if the clusters turn out to be massive and
very distant, it could imply that the cosmos does not contain enough matter
for gravity to stop the expansion of the universe. These models predict that
such a low-density universe would have built most of its galaxy clusters
long ago.

About 10 to 20 of the farthest clusters in the Hubble survey may be over
seven billion light years away, which means that the clusters, and their
populations of tens or perhaps hundreds of galaxies each, were fully
assembled early in the history of the universe.

Present distance estimates are based on the colors of the galaxies in each
cluster. The redder the overall cluster appears, the more distant it is, an
assumption based on the apparent reddening of light -- known as red shift --
as stars and galaxies move away from us at high speeds. The distances can be
more accurately measured using a spectrograph attached to a ground-based
telescope.

The Hubble survey contains 92 new clusters uncovered during a six-year sky
survey known as the Medium Deep Survey, led by a team of astronomers now at
Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA.

The project has been led by Professor Richard Griffiths and senior scientist
Dr. Kavan Ratnatunga. The catalog samples an area of the sky that is small,
but scattered over 300 random directions.

The clusters were found using an automated procedure developed by the
Carnegie Mellon team. They first identified large elliptical galaxies in
random fields taken by Hubble. Next, an automated procedure was used to
search statistically for an over-abundance of galaxies around the large
elliptical galaxies. The assumption is that the excess galaxies all belong
to the same cluster. This procedure helped to discriminate clusters against
the field galaxy population which is smoothly distributed across the sky

Major new telescopes must be used to study these clusters to measure their
distances.

The whole HST catalog of galaxies can be searched on the web at:
http://astro.phys.cmu.edu/mds/

The Hubble observations will be published in the Astronomical Journal. The
research team members are: E. J. Ostrander; K. U. Ratnatunga; and R. E.
Griffiths, Department of Physics, Carnegie Mellon University.

The Space Telescope Science Institute is operated by the Association of
Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. (AURA) for NASA, under contract
with the Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD. The Hubble Space
Telescope is a project of international cooperation between NASA and the
European Space Agency (ESA).

Eating someone can apparently cause their relatives to revolt.

havent a clue scott.  you have out-referenced me. {8^D  how could we
find out?  have you an arm that you would give up?   har.  is there
a way to find out on the web if tigers prefer antelopes to chimps?  i
would guess that humans and chimps would taste about the same,
or very close.  on second thought, why are we going on about such
a revolting topic?  never mind!  who started this crazy thread anyway?

I cannot recommend enough 'A History of God' by Karen Armstrong. Whilst I
am not monotheistically religious (and possibly not religious at all,
depending on your definition), this book has proved invaluable in
increasing my understanding of monotheistic religion and in answering my
questions as to why people believe what they believe and defend what they
defend in their religion. Armstrong manages to write about this issue in an
exceptionally balanced and non-judgemental way, which is both illuminating
and refreshing.

So, get over to Amazon.com and widen your meme set: whether you see it as a
gateway to common understanding (recommended approach) or an exercise in
'know-your-enemy' psychology, it won't be a wasted read, and should do much
to increase the depth of discussion about religion on this list, if nothing
else.

I believe it is a simple code which can be used to access information on a
central database in Switzerland.

The good news is that The Independent actually printed my letter yesterday,

Mitch Porter tipped me off about an interesting paper:

http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/9808069

Creation and Structure of Baby Universes in Monopole Collisions

Authors: Arvind Borde, Mark Trodden, Tanmay Vachaspati

Under certain circumstances, the collision of magnetic monopoles,
topologically locked-in regions of false vacuum, leads to topological
inflation and the creation of baby universes. The future evolution of
initial data represented by the two incoming monopoles may contain a
timelike singularity but this need not be the case. We discuss the
global structure of the spacetime associated with monopole collisions
and also that of topological inflation. We suggest that topological
inflation within magnetic monopoles leads to an eternally reproducing
universe.


What they show is that if you collide certain monopoles with each
other, they collapse into a kind of black hole with inflation,
creating a baby universe. The nice thing (if you are a tiplerite) is
that this universe seems to be closed, so if you desperately want to
have an Omega Point but the universe is open, just collide your
monopoles and send in your information into the black hole (how to do
this is usefully left as an exercise for the student); you can have
your OP inside the baby universe. Of course, nobody has ever found a
monopole yet, but at least it seems theoretically possible to make
baby universes this way.

Could you elaborate a little on how this linearly suppression comes 
about?

I'm not sure where you got these priors from. It doesn't really 
matter but it may be easiest to see the objection that I'm trying to 
make if we assume the priors are:

AA=1/4
AB=1/2
BB=1/4

One can imagine this distribution arising from throwing a fair coin 
in the C universe twice. This is the probabilities of the different 
world combinations relative to an information set that only contains 
the information about the set-up.

Then, when you conditionalize upon being human (but you don't yet 
have any other information), if you assume that you are a random 
sample from all possible states/space-time slots (as you say we 
should do), you get the posterior:

AA=0
AB=0
BB=1

in the limiting case where N is very large. (Reason: if there existed 
an A universe, you would almost certainly have been one of the 
stones.)

Now, this seems clearly wrong. I conclude that you should not include 
all space-time slots in the reference class, but only those 
containing observers.

I rather think one should consider oneself randomly sampled from the 
set of *actual* civilizations, not the set of all possible ones. (I 
have explained my reasons for this in the Robin-thread and also in my 
"Investigations"-paper.)

That's not true. Even under the interpretation that doom will strike 
soon (just one among several other interpretations), we can reduce 
the risk of doom by reducing the various empirical threats - black 
goo, meteor impact, high-energy physics experiment, nuclear or germ 
warfare, environmental collaps, etc. This will affect the 
empirical priors that we feed into Bayes' theorem and hence the 
posterior probabilities that come out.

Ok, put yourself in the position of the man chained to the bomb.
If you listen carefully you'll notice that over the ticking of
the
bomb you can hear distant music coming from a party the other
Randall went to, he's having a wonderful time, you're having
less fun chained to that damn bomb. You know that the other
Randall is not you and you know you have exactly 38 minutes
and 17 second to live. Do you see anyreason why you might
be just a tad upset with the situation?

I'm much more interested in the Randall-plus-an-hour's
opinion. If he thinks you survived, that is, if he can remember
being you then you're OK but if not, like the poor man in my
example, then when the bomb goes off he's dead.

Yes, or at least someone mostly died, survival is a matter of
degrees

Unless I was in a deep sleep I'd say an hour would be more than
enough time for both copies of me to want to survive

That's clear but arbitrary, the "design space" of Joe Jenkins is
just the set of all possible states the biological brain of Joe
Jenkins can be in. I don't see why you treat hardware so
differently from software and if you define anything within that
design space to be you it can lead to places you don't
want to go.

Thought experiment: Your identical twin brother comes to visit,
you haven't  seen him since you were 3 and he was adopted
by foster parents and moved to China. You learn from an
interpreter (your brother does not speak English) that he's a
very happy man with a loving family many friends and lots
of money. You haven't been as fortunate, your wife ran off with
another woman and you lost most of your money and all of your
friends when your bulk E Mail Spam business went bankrupt.
According to your definition your brother Is within your
"design space" and so he is you, he also occupies a
higher rent area of that space than you do. So would it be
wise to kill yourself?

If I was really 100% convinced that this would safely preserve
my present identity then obviously I'd have no reason not to
do it, but I'm not convinced, this very thought experiment was
supposed to increase my confidence but it's not working.

It looks like I'd  be having a very bleak existence, so bleak I
might want to kill myself. The fact that somebody similar to
me would continue to live a happy life would cheer me up
a little bit, I think, but not nearly enough. I would not die
happy.

Exactly, and from my present ego's point of view a copy made

Dieks calculation rests on the self-indication axiom: that finding 
that you are an observer indicates that there are many 
observers. Only yourself can answer whether that is what you 
believed before you heard about the DA. Speaking for myself, I 
didn't believe that, and most other people don't seem to have 
believed that either, since it was not generally accepted that by 
just sitting back in your armchair you could decide that the universe 
is infinite with probability one, unless it is impossible that it is 
infinite. Most people did, and presumably still do, believe that 
there is some finite probability that the universe is infinite and a 
finite probability that it is finite. If that is what you believe, 
then your prior was certainly not the one Dieks presupposes.

I don't know what "standard approaches" you are referring to. If 
you mean the one you outlined, I have already said that I think your 
specification of the state space is incoherent, since it presupposes 
that in a world with just one apple and one pear, there is a fact of 
the matter as to weather you are the apple and I'm the pear, or vice 
versa. I simply can't make any sense of that.


I should also stress that I *do not* see the conclusion of the 
doomsday argument to be that doom is likely to strike soon, or 
maybe even ever. The name is misleading. I *do* see it as placing 
interesting constraints on what are plausible future scenarios and 
theories of the world at large. The implications are complex, and 
there seem to be many possibilities that are ruled out but also many 
very different possibilities that are still permitted. At some point 
I will post a summary of what I think some of the lessons are.

You had previously assumed each baby of C had a 10% chance of being A
and a 90% chance of B.

No!  You are confusing priors on universes with priors on states, even
though I tried to clearly distinguish these in my previous post:

If you're going to go with equal chance of A or B, then I'd say there
are four possible worlds: AA, AB, BA, BB, and 80 + 4N space-time slots
among these worlds.  Giving equal probability to these *slots*, then
conditioning on being human, you get equal probability to be in A vs. B.

John, lemme correct a possible misunderstanding.
*I* do not disagree that the two are different people.
It did seem odd to me that *you* expressed the same
view, however, since you have previously stated that
you believe (correct me if I err) that two physical instances
of exactly the same pattern of mind are really only one
person.  This seems to me to imply that one of the
two physical copies we seem to see is merely illusion,
but I gather that this doesn't follow, to you.  I do not 
understand that, and perhaps this is partly to blame 
for my viewing your position as inconsistent where

Again with the amnesia argument:  if you wake
up and are told that it is 1999, and that you have
been in a coma ever since that nearly-fatal 
accident last September, do you think that the
person that existed in September *died*, if
you cannot remember having been him?

I'd say that less than a second is sufficient, 
but then, I also think that both copies are 
separate people.

It is just the effect we have been discussing, that the fact that one is 
alive suggests we are in a universe with more life.  The probability
of a universe with N people, relative to a universe with M people, is 
enhanced by a factor of N/M.

I don't see what timing has to do with anything.  We've had a standard
approach to modeling things like doom for a long time.  What is new is 
asking what this standard approach implies for a creature with amnesia.
Perhaps you find counterintuitive the result that amnesiacs should be 
especially optimistic about humanity as a whole surprising.  But it is
DA advocates who are using this surprise to argue for a change in the 
standard approach, a change which eliminates this surprise at the 
expense of making other surprises elsewhere.

Can you *prove* that under the standard approach, one cannot coherently 
believe with probability in (0,1) that the universe has a finite number of 
humans?  I'd guess that doing so would require a rather subtle analysis,
as things get messy when probabilities and infinities collide.

No that isn't the standard approach.  That is my attempt to create a 
hybrid of the standard approach and what I understand to be the DA
approach.  

I've tried to explain this at length in my paper:
http://hanson.berkeley.edu/nodoom.html

A standard approach to calculating the chance of doom would be to
assume that human population grows exponentially, that doom happens when 
the population reaches 10^d, and then to choose a prior over d based on 
our understanding of the sorts of processes that might cause doom.
A typical choice might be to have d be uniformly distributed between 0 
and 20.  One then interprets our information that today's population is 
about 10^10 as just telling us that d is at least ten, and so obtains
a posterior that d is uniformly distributed between 10 and 20.  
This implies a median future growth factor of 10^5 before doom, which is 
far from "doom soon."

skeptic.... ;)

I just got back from lunch with my buddy and the story I got was
this:

 They found out about this by someone walking up to them and
offering to sell them Viagra. In the questions that followed the
guy remarked "It's even easier to sneak things out of the U.S. then
in." Apparently they've been doing it since shortly after it was
released here in the U.S. Trinidad/Tobaggo has been filled with
smugglers since the pirate days.

Apparently it's all market driven.

Since it happened before summer, most of the flora and fauna
traditionally used, weren't harvested this summer.

A good friend, a good story, a couple of hurricanes (the drink) and
a bowl of alligator etouffee' at "heaven on seven". 

Not a bad Lunch.

Is there any proposed role for the WTA / ExI in this, apart from

Yes, this is true (and I do hope I have taken the hint). There is a
dilemma in thinking about the future in a transhumanist way. On one
hand we allow ourselves to explore *all* possibilities, including
those which radically break off from the old ways (changes of the
human condition, abundance instead of scarcity, SIs taking over the
world and keeping extropians as art objects), on the other hand we try
to remain rational and critical, firmly grounded in facts and known
rules. If we explore all the weird and wonderful possibilities we can
easily lose connection with reality, if we concentrate too much on the
facts and rules we can get bogged down in reasoning like "throughout
history people have died, hence people will always die". What is
needed is to temper one with the other. 

Nanotechnology is a great example of what happens when you do this
well: based on known physics Drexler et al have shown the possibility
of nanodevices and placed some constraints on their capabilities. From
this inferences can be drawn that suggest some unexpected (to most)
possibilities.

Doing this is hard. But definitely worth it. We just have to help each
other balance in the rational region where we are "cautious and
conservative" in the transhuman way.

With good reason. Utopias tend to be either advertisments for the
latest ideology, or fictions with little reality connection. 

In the above example, it is by no means clear that wealth disparities
will vanish even with piles of useful nanotech and AI. It might turn
out that everyone is equally rich when it comes to matter and energy,
but rare things like true genius and wisdom have a high price and
people with them can also buy more services of others than "ordinary"
people. Maybe true equality is only possible when all limits are
arbitrary.

However, I agree with your evaluation of the have/have-not way of
thinking. It is really an extension of the myth of the world as a
zero-sum game. In reality the world is a positive sum game, and it
doesn't really matter if somebody has a higher score than another as
long as they both are well off and can increase their scores.

Few questions about life in an open universe as
described by Dyson in TIME WITHOUT END: PHYSICS
AND BIOLOGY IN AN OPEN UNIVERSE.

Dyson chooses a model in which "human-sized
objects will disappear [within 10^(10^26) years],
but dust grains with diameter less than about
100mu will last for ever". He later proposes that
if this is true life may have to exist as "a large
assemblage of dust grains". Does this mean that
after the elapsed 10^(10^26) years anything over a
100mu diameter would be unable to exist, or merely
that such an object would take that many years to
decay? His later statement about the biology of
future life (the "assemblage of dust grains")
suggests the former, but I'm not sure.

The most interesting thing about Dyson's scenario
is that it imposes a number of limits. These
limits make it easier to predict what life could
`evolve' into. (Tipler's Omega Point in a closed
universe relies on omniscience and is therefore an
omniboring area of conversation.) For instance,
the need for an infinite amount of memory storage
(Dyson suggests analog memory) "will put severe
constraints on the rate of acquisition of
permanent new knowledge". He also proposes scaling
laws, the need for hibernation, and limits to
communication. I'm sure an even better model of
future life could be created. For instance, are
there any fundamental limits to complexity that
would stop *really big* Jupiter Brains from
functioning (increased complexity generally means
more errors and more redundancy)? Will limits to
communication (speed of light, background
radiation) and size (spread of matter in the
universe, rate of decay) insure individuality?

And so on...

The easiest way to determine what will constitute "wealth" in a future
where nanotech, AI and other goodies reach their fruition is to think
about what things will be scarce. Creativity may be the most scarce
item (scarcity judged in terms of abundance in relation to demand). But
I suppose it is possible that creativity may be reduced to some exotic
algorithms. Maybe algorithm development will be all the rage in the future.

If you rephrased the argument as a change in state
(observer to corpse, for instance) then you just
might be able to calculate the necessary change
for a species *not* to go extinct.

Just a thought, don't ask me how to do it...

First-ever Nanotechnology Venture Offers Investment
Opportunity in Cutting-Edge Startups Developing Molecular 
Assemblers and Assembler Dependent Products 

NEW YORK, Aug. 28 /PRNewswire/ -- NanoTechnology Development Corporation 
(NTDC) today announced its first public stock offering in New York State. 
NTDC is the world's first public venture uniquely focused on developing 
molecular machine technology. 

To the company's knowledge, this represents the first opportunity for 
investors to purchase stock directly in a nanotechnology company across 
the World Wide Web. The corporate website with information on NTDC is 
http://DevelopNanotechnology.com/#overview. 

NTDC funds scientists and startup companies engaged in developing 
Molecular Nanotechnology (MNT) as defined by Dr. K. Eric Drexler of 
the Foresight Institute, Palo Alto, CA. Feasible design approaches 
for nanotechnology include "Bottom Up" (building directly with atoms) 
and "Top Down" (component miniaturization) approaches. 

Applications for nanotechnology include the development of nanoscopic 
supercomputers with atomic dimension components, atomically assembled 
diamondoid super composites, programmable self-replicating machinery 
and products only possible with nanotechnology offering unique benefits 
for biotechnology, medicine and a wide range of other industries. 

The stated goal of NTDC is to develop a "Molecular Assembler" -- a 
microscopic device capable of self-replication and programmable atomic 
precision chemistry for use in molecular manufacturing, starting with 
NTDC's "Top Down" approach, "Fractal Shape Shifting Robots" theoretically 
capable of scaling down to the molecular realm. Near term first 
generation Robot applications include programmed heavy construction, 
without traditional labor.

One thing I should have mentioned in my original posting is
the fact that NDTC's current offering is not technically a
IPO but a DPO. The direct public offering is offered to individuals
in one state under a special SEC exclusion that allows them to
save money on the front end. Unfortunately, if you are not a
resident of the State of New York you can't participate in
the DPO.

The proceeds from the DPO (US$ 1,000,000) are being used to fund
the development of a video to support the much larger IPO
that should take place in 1999. The IPO will be open to
any and everyone.

If you're crafty you might set up a trust in New York to purchase
stock in the DPO but I'm not savvy enough in securities law to
determine whether that would fly with the SEC.

One can imagine the several possibilities for the long-term and 
medium-term, but for the near future, at least with the WTA, my guess 
is that the activity will mainly be educational. That includes 
educating the public (on- and offline) but it also includes
developing our own thinking on these issues. I would like to see 
risks and downsides (and strategies for how to minimize them) to 
attain a much more prominent place within transhumanism.

Last time I looked, the canonical inflationary account said there'd be a
maximum of one monopole inside each local spacetime bubble, which helps
explain why we haven't stumbled on a monopole as yet.  Damn!  Just when you
need two to rub together to get your fire started...

You can also be generous based on the ol' "Share The Wealth" mentality 
that seeks to demonstrate your success to those you care about in a 
manner that can be universally understandable (i.e. visible material 
wealth that you can afford to dispose of with little thought to 
economic gain).  Although thinking back on it, this is probably more of 
an example of socialism (which can be quite sociable when detached from 
the coercive anti-social cancer that is our current government) than 
altruism (which I see as at best an unnecessary and at worst an evil 
ethical standard).

Doubtless the 50 million Americans living in poverty appreciate having 
some power, food and answering machines, while 80% of the wealth lies 
with the top 10%. Ever do a graph of what that looks like? Perhaps you 
could debate it with the starving millions across the world. Doesn't 
America store enough grain to feed the world for a decade in the event 
of a nuclear war? Now it's asking other countries to do that for it.

To think, how little it would take for the elite of the superwealthy to 
provide food and power for the bottom third. How very little. How very 
very little.

The Australian Government gives one third of one percent of GDP to 
foreign aid. America is equally generous. Private citizens who are 
wealthy give a pittance. 

For those of us who have a strong conception of morality, the surety of 
an impending nanotech bounty (presuming America does not decree its 
knowledge US-owned - like atomic weapons or particle beam projection 
systems) makes us wish to be more generous NOW. When it means even more. 
If I ever become wealthy, I intend to put half my wealth into a fund 
were the interests goes to the third world and the promotion of 
nanotech.

Tastes differ.  I read the first two books for the Mars trilogy and--a rarity,
for me--decided against reading the last.  While I enjoyed the hard sci-fi
approach to the mega-scale engineering issues, I found Robinson's grasp of
social institutions utterly implausible.  In particular, his weakness in
matters economic fairly well ruined the story line for me.  A planet-wide
barter system?  One based on gifting?  Feh.  Perhaps not every sci-fi author
needs to master the basics of economics, but those who, like Robinson, tackle
the topic need to get it right.

Additionally, Robinson's hard sci-fi largely ignores some of the most
interesting issues to Extropians: computational advances and nanotech.  His is
a very old-fashioned sort of sci-fi, both in terms of technology and "rule of
the experts" economics.  I found it unconvincing and out-of-date.

I will vote for it. You are quite right. That is not currently legally 
enforceable at some levels, as 'people' are often defined as humans.

However I am in favour of consensual killing being legal, as well as 
consensual self-inflicted harm, such as suicide. 

While this may appear to be a jokey issue it is actually one that will 
be of some debate in the future. 

Those Extropians who argue for immortality as a realistic concept but 
ignore debates about the biosphere as 'unrealistic and far-term' are 
only trammelling their potential growth in terms of understanding. The 
day that anyone markets a life-extension genetic therapy the world 
enters into these discussions that some consider irrelevant. 

Doubtless there are many worlds which have gone through this process at 
this point of closeness to the Escalation. In fact, your actions over 
the next thirty years will not effect things hugely, in all probability, 
but they will constitute your contribution to the local vote on issues 
of inclusion. It is certainly best to regard human attitudes towards 
other species as inevitable on a Gaian level and not simply defined as 
negative. Their apparent selfishness can be looked upon as an 
anti-entropic spiking mechanism. Their origins in terms of social troops 
also explain much of their behaviour. 

I believe part of the nature of the Escalation is a reflection of the 
eagerness of less complex species to shed the cycle of death and birth 
(and species) and reconstruct the biosphere on the basis of choice. As a 
Sentist I naturally believe in one sentient being, one vote (currently I 
define sentient being as a being with a neurological system).

The differences between mortality, immortality and amortality (chosen 
lifespan) are huge. Perhaps you should include a right to die in a 
transhumanist bill of rights?

Actually, it should be illegal to prevent any being from assisting the 
recipient of an act of force. That is to say, if Jerry Seinfeld and the 
three other New Yorkers attempted to prevent the consensual assistance 
of, say, a passer-by, towards the fat man being mugged, this would be 
illegal. And indeed, should be illegal. If an animal liberationist seeks 
to prevent a human from killing a boosted cat, who has the intelligence 
of a human five-year old, when it cries for help, if security guards 
then arrive and block such assistance, this blockage should constitute a 
crime.

"Creation and Structure of Baby Universes in Monopole Collisions

Authors: Arvind Borde, Mark Trodden, Tanmay Vachaspati

Under certain circumstances, the collision of magnetic monopoles,
topologically locked-in regions of false vacuum, leads to topological
inflation and the creation of baby universes. The future evolution of
initial data represented by the two incoming monopoles may contain a
timelike singularity but this need not be the case. We discuss the
global structure of the spacetime associated with monopole collisions
and also that of topological inflation. We suggest that topological
inflation within magnetic monopoles leads to an eternally reproducing
universe.


What they show is that if you collide certain monopoles with each
other, they collapse into a kind of black hole with inflation,
creating a baby universe. The nice thing (if you are a tiplerite) is
that this universe seems to be closed, so if you desperately want to
have an Omega Point but the universe is open, just collide your
monopoles and send in your information into the black hole (how to do
this is usefully left as an exercise for the student); you can have
your OP inside the baby universe. Of course, nobody has ever found a
monopole yet, but at least it seems theoretically possible to make
baby universes this way."

This is what you guys are great at. Information! Stretching the 
imagination.
Daring to discuss things at the boundaries of theoretical possibility. 
This is what makes you into poets!

The United States is responsible for roughly 1/3 of the world's food
production and virtually every country in the world relies on US
agriculture for part of their food supply.  The US stores very little for
emergency purposes (and for most scenarios, doesn't need to).  Your "50
million Americans living in poverty" is a highly suspect figure.  I grew up
among the lowest strata of the "poverty" segment in the US population (i.e.
I lived in a shack on an Indian reservation with marginal utilities access
and none of the luxuries that most "poor" people have, such as TV), but
nonetheless we never starved.  Food is abundant in this country, even for
the poorest of the "poor".  The truly starving in this country are starving
because of reasons completely outside the socio-economic realm.

You obviously do not understand the economics of the food industry.  The
cost for the production of raw food product is negligible in compared to
the cost of transporting and processing agricultural products (hence the
reason vast piles of grain rot in US farm country every year).  Lets assume
for the moment that you are speaking strictly of the "poor" in the United
States (rather than the bottom third, which would be significantly more):
your "50 million".  We will utilize the minimum possible expense for this
example by assuming that you only give these poor people rice and beans,
purchased and packaged in large bulk quantities.  At today's US bulk grain
prices (not including local distribution costs), this would come to about
$100 per person annually for a total cost of US$5 billion annually in the
cheapest case scenario that in no way takes into account the total costs.
Not a small piece of change, but manageable by a government (the real
number would likely be larger by *at least* a factor of 10).  And in any
case it is irrelevant; hunger in this country is caused by factors
completely unrelated to food availability.

However, if you try and apply this to the world population, your position
is entirely untenable.  Because most of the world's excess food supply is
at least one ocean away from the starving masses, logistics becomes a
severe economic and technical problem.  The biggest problem is that the
logistical resources simply do not exist to distribute the excess food.
The transport resources do not exist to perform wholesale distribution of
free food around the world even if we wanted to.  Not only that, but the
annual cost of trans-oceanic transport of billions of tons of food is
extremely prohibitive, even for the "superwealthy", nevermind the cost of
local distribution.

The *real* solution is to advocate the local production and distribution of
food rather than having it shipped around the world from the US.  This has
neither the logistical nor economic limitations of distributing food from
US production centers.  In fact, the distribution of cheap US food around
the world is largely responsible for the disappearance of local agriculture
in many regions of the world.

You are mistaken.  The wealthy private citizens give the poor far, far more
of their resources than you realize.  When I lived in extreme (relative to
the US) poverty, I never had to pay any taxes of significance, yet there
where a vast number of free programs available from the government that I
could take advantage of to my hearts content (actually, being a single
white male effectively excluded me from receiving any benefits, but that is
another story).  I think people who have never been poor would be truly
surprised at the number of free stuff, advantages, and benefits that are
available to the poor in the US.  Nonetheless, now that I have migrated to
the upper-most tax brackets through years of hard work, the government gets
between 1/2 and 2/3 of my money, which it promptly redistributes to "those
that need it most".  Nevermind that I still cannot afford to purchase a
house where I live.

Have you ever considered that maybe the wealthy feel they have already
given enough?  Is 1/2 to 2/3 of your income "a pittance"?

In the US, you don't have a choice.  Typically, at least half your wealth
*will* be put into a fund to advance the interests of your poorer brethren.
 Whether the poor actually benefit is another matter.

your argument manages to reel in the thread from being a joke to
a topic that deserves attention, and i agree with you in part.  your thread
started out with the comment "i propose a law...", inviting the more
libertarian among us to ridicule the idea.  )and there are plenty of

I have to agree with Tom, on the basis of reading the first in the series.
I had very little interest in reading the second.

Feh on yourself too and while you're at it beware of this much:

I have not read Robinson and so don't know why you feel he needs to fill in such
mundane basics that us other real world plodders have to deal with, but as one who
wrote and developed amongst the best J.I.T. (MRP-II) systems in the world during
the 70s & 80s for many companies like General Electric, General Mills, etc., I
regard myself as an expert in these areas which you seek to obfuscate. However,
not only do I now consider money in all its guises to have too many socially
problematic properties but can hardly remember using it even back then for
planning purposes.

In laying claim to the concept that economics does not ultimately have to revolve
around the simplicities of price as exists in the present day malthusian monetary
systems, I am now actively planning to introduce ubiquitous transaction
automatacapsids which will include subjective valuations and which may be
optionally used instead of money for those that wish so to do. Peoples' right to
transact using these plasticized neural nets will likely continue so long as their
components aren't irreparably destabilized. Scandinavian countries look to be
among the first to adopt these types of analytic network tools and are initially
providing for non authoritarian government behavior as shown in the following
abstract from a colleague of mine who shares these mutual interests in work
science.

If you subject all government and opposition voices and ideology to a arbitrary
medium such as Ingrid analysis software, governments won't waste resources in time
time wasting confrontation. For example in Scandinavia, governments manage an
extensive social and economic program which results in world beating growth by
subjecting both government and opposition policy to Ingrid style software.

Combining Qualitative Interviews and Repertory Grid-technique in Leadership
Studies

Introduction and objective. Organizational culture can be viewed as the
construction and deconstruction of mutual meanings. Since actors in asymmetric
power relations have unequal possibilities to influence how reality is defined, it
is of interest to relate organizational culture to power and leadership (1). The
objective of this paper is to describe a combination of methods, which can be used
as an alternative approach to the traditional leadership research. A research area
which has been criticised for being dominated by positivistic and neo-positivistic
assumptions and a concentration on rules and procedures (1).The alternative
research approach, being situational and reflexive, is well suited for revealing
the rationalities, which according to Eriksen (2), are especially important for
the understanding of leadership in public sector organizations.

Method. Possible advantages are outlined, regarding different combinations of
qualitative interviews and Repertory Grid-technique (4) (5), in order to enable
insight in managers social constructions (3) and personal constructs (4) related
to leadership and organizations. The salient features for these methods are: 1)
Qualitative interviews are used in order to obtain deep and varied descriptions of
phenomena in the organisation from the managers, their interpretation of these
phenomena in relation to the existing structures in the organisation and their
descriptions of their own actions in relation to these interpretations. 2)
Repertory Grid-techniques are used for obtaining either the managers or, which can
be of particular interest when conducting a Grounded Theory study, the researchers
(5) personal constructs.

Discussion and Conclusions. It is suggested that a combined use of qualitative
interviews and Repertory Grid-techniques (7) might be fruitful in leadership
studies, to enable the formulating of an interpretative, local and
non-authoritarian theory, where qualitative rigor is possible to obtain through an
interpreting, as well as, theoretical awareness and sensitivity.

Title
  Aging and the hypothalamus: research perspectives. [Review]
  [220 refs]
Source
  Physiology & Behavior.  59(3):523-36, 1996 Mar.
Abstract
  There are several hypothalamic theories of
  aging, none of which has been validated. An approach to
  validation is to search for consequences of anatomic ablations of
  hypothalamic regions that are functional hallmarks of aging,
  or consequences of ablation that postpone the appearance of hallmarks of
  aging or extend longevity. Ablation of the hypothalamic
  ventromedial nucleus (VMN) in the weanling rat is associated with subsequent
  increased body fat, glucose intolerance, hyperlipidemia, and decreased renal
  function. Each of these consequences is characteristic of
  aging in humans and in several animal models of
  aging. Ablation of the hypothalamic dorsomedial nucleus
  (DMN) in the weanling rat leads to a symmetrically smaller animal with normal
  glucose and lipid metabolism, decreased body fat for size, and reduced risk
  of decreased renal function and circulating IGF-I levels. These are findings
  consistent with calorie restriction models in rodents that significantly
  extend life span. This review compares outcomes of lesions in the VMN, DMN,
  and lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) for relevance to aging.
  To establish a relationship between these anatomic areas of the hypothalamus
  and aging, it is concluded that the VMN, DMN, and LHA
  lesions should be examined for impact on longevity and compared with data
  obtained from simultaneously studied intact ad-lib-fed and 40%
  calorie-restricted animals. Lesioned animals also should be rigorously
  studied for neurotransmitters (e.g., neuropeptide Y, beta-endorphin,
  serotonin, corticotropin-releasing factor, and galanin), and for behavioral
  changes consistent with aging, for accumulation of specific
  tissue lipofuscin and amyloid that are associated with normal
  aging and for other age-dependent findings, such as
  incidence of tumors and cataract. [References: 220]

This certainly sounds like Joe Michaels. A lot of graphics, animations
and big claims, but not a hint of real engineering.

Time to re-read "On bogosity in nanotechnology" by Drexler, I think.

You can't assign priors on states and priors on universes 
independently. They are logically connected.  For example, if there 
is a non-zero prior state probability that you are in state A-7, then 
there must be a non-zero prior universe probability that an A 
universe exists.

I know, but in the example as I set it up, the slots *don't* have 
equal probability. Or so at least it seems to me. If you want to say 
that they do have equal probability then you also have to say that 
the fair coin in the C universe was almost certain to land on the 
side that creates an A universe, two times in a row. And if we expand 
the example to include m baby-universes, you have to say that the 
fair coin is almost certain to land on the same side m times in a 
row. Surely that is wrong.

I enjoyed the series immensely.  The economics were kind of goofy, but that
shows up in a lot of fiction.  Besides, it's not like humans have *never* had
communitarian economics.  Do you consider it impossible that Martians would
set up a suboptimal economic system?

P.S.: Red Mars and Green Mars were the best.  The storyline is kind of
meandering
in Blue Mars; Blue Mars seems mostly just an excuse to talk about ideas on
terraforming Mars and habitable designs for other areas in the solar system.
They are, however, seriously neat concepts.  Red and Green have neat ideas
too,
and good plots as well.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

Let's say you have a newsletter article on a web page that is 
password protected.  In order to profit from the newsletter, you wish
to sell passwords, which provide access to the newsletter.  The idea
is to have an online, completely electronic process, for obtaining
credit card numbers, dispensing passwords, and electronically
crediting the personal bank account of writer.

In order to have an automatic form on-line that processes credit 
cards, you need to have a "Merchant Account" at a bank.

This is a policy that is very unfriendly to e-commerce.

In the U.S. (Silicon Valley, in my case), to have a Merchant Account,
the individual needs to register a "Fictitious Business Name" with the
County Clerk.  This process involves traveling to the Country Clerk's
office, doing a database seach for a business name, filling out a form
that is carbon-copied in quadruplicate.

I went through this process last week, for "DEFINE.COM".  First of
all, it's absurd that I need to register this business name, since
it's already registered with Internic, and is unique on the whole
internet.  Nonetheless, to use it as a business name for a merchant
account, registry with the county is required.

The process takes quite a while, since the County Clerk is not able to
accept credit card payments, and does not have the name registry
online.  Here in Silicon Valley, the process still requires physical
travel to the County Clerk's Office, in Oakland.

Last week, I registered the name, for "FILING FEE" of $29.00.  There
is a terminal in the lobby of this large office in a grand courthouse.
 I had to use the antiquated data terminal myself, to perform the name
check.  After finding that it was not taken yet, I filled out the form
in ink, waited in line for 45 minutes, then handed the form to a clerk
in a window.

The clerk checked the computer again, to confirm that the name wasn't
used, then asked for my $29.00 cash payment, plus an additional $7.00
for registration of the name "IMMEDIA Expert Systems".  She took out
her dated rubber stamp, and stamped all 4 copies of the form, then
signed her signature.

She gave me the three back copies (YELLOW, PINK & ORANGE), and kept
the fourth (WHITE), which she added to a stack of others awaiting
further processing.  I asked the clerk if she entered the name and
address into the database herself.  She advised, "no, these go to the
Recorder, who enters them into the database."

Then she promptly told me that I needed to take the pink copy of the
form to a newspaper within the next 30 days, or the registration would
become null and void.

Here's how the instructions read on the back of the form:

"Within 30 days after the fictitious business name statement has been
filed with the county cleark, the statement must be published in a
newspaper of general circulation in the country where the principal
place of business is located.  The newspaper selected should be one
that circulates in the area where the business is to be conducted. The
statement must be published once a week for four successive weeks with
five days between each date of publication.  An affidavit of
publication must be filed with the county clerk within 30 days after
the completion of the publication.  (Sec. 17917 B&P Code)"

She advised me that this process should cost approximately another $35
or so, to be paid to the advertising department of the newspaper.

Frustrating enough, since I don't have a physical "place of 
business", I just wanted to have a way to compensate writers for
posting articles on web pages, located in cyberspace.

I went to the SJ Mercury News Advertising department, but they said
they don't do this anymore.  They gave me some suggestions for other
newspapers to try.

I went to the bank, and gave them the YELLOW copy, and opened a 
merchant account.  I advised that checks would not be necessary, since
the only purpose of the account was to electronically receive payments
from selling passwords.

So far, I have still not published the "FICTITIOUS BUSINESS NAME
STATEMENT" with a newspaper, so the whole thing may become null and
void.  I doubt that bureacratic mechanisms will trace their way back
to the bank to cancel the account, but just in case, I'll keep trying
to contact the newspaper to publish this.

Unfortunately, I don't want to give out my home address, since it's
common knowledge on the internet that you "never give out your home
address".  It will be interesting to see if the newspaper can publish
this entry and send an "AFFIDAVIT OF PUBLICATON" back to the county,
without publishing my home address.

To be continued...

Two As are only almost certain from a point of view where we consider
the possibility that I might not have existed as a human.  Conditional on
my being human, As are equally likely as Bs.  Which all goes to emphasize
that choosing priors in the amnesia situation is very different from
choosing priors when we allow the possibility that we might not have
existed.  The coins can't be "fair" from both perspectives at once.
Here I have chosen the coins to be "fair" from the amnesia perspective.
Why is that wrong?

I meant half my wealth after tax. I'm quite happy to live on 12-15,000 a 
year. 

It is incontrovertible that foreign aid is under one percent of GDP. 

The top 10% in America have 80% of the total wealth. It is very 
instructive to do a graph of what that means. The top 355 billionaires 
had as much wealth as the bottom 2.5 billion (1978). Do a graph of that.
Let the Y line be population and the X line total wealth. See the 
intensity and height of the spike.

Transport costs? For wells and food and communications infrastructure? 
Well, if you spend nothing, sure, nothing happens. Before Telstra went 
into Cambodia they had 7 IDD phone lines for the whole country. A few 
relatively cheap satellite dishes later they were okay.

But debate about food costs isn't the point. It's about not helping your 
brothers and sisters in trouble, because they live far away. Australia 
produces heaps of grain and wool and coal and so forth, like the US. But 
we don't give it away cheap. Just like the English landlords in Ireland 
during the potato famine, we let them starve. Why innoculate the third 
world - they'll just breed. The old Ronald Reagan argument. 

Look at Bill Gates - he finally funds a UN programme to the tune of 2 
million dollars... for what...? for... population control.

In the third world.

Affluence is the best contraceptive. But let's control their population 
before they get affluent. After all, they're not white and they don't 
speak English.

I'll rant along with Anders and Robin, and expand my target to include
films, literature, videos, as well as animation and cartooning that dazzle
the audience as well as projected faux idealism while mocking an
exponential  status quo of doomsdayers toward an uplifting critical mass of
open ended possibilities of our future

OK, Greg.  

As I was saying, Hollywood has invested enormous amounts of money and
effort spawning a fiction-mix of heroic vs. evil storyline to dazzle the
audience while inhibiting any real critical thought about the future and
possible storylines that may hold biographical events and accomplishments
unveiling some insight in to how things just might be for fear that they
may be interpreted by the audience as a yawner.

Philips Medical systems is developing something like this. Medical trails
are a lengthy procedure however so it could be some time before these
things hit the market (5 years minimum). And then initially at a very high
price that are typical for all high-tech medical applications
(hip-implants, artificial heartvalves). Hopefully there will be others
developing similar devices to bring the prices down to 'consumer level'.

Well, imho it means "29 years after Armstrong" (after Armstrongs first step
on the moon in 1969)...so he seems to be someone introducing a new era. ;-)

Was there any sort of control, to account for the fact that maybe sad,
lonely depressed people are most likely to spend a lot of time on the
internet? I don't know if this is true but I'm betting it's at least
partly so....

My experience runs contrary to that reported in the study.

please read the article I posted. this is a pretty interesting study, and
runs counter to the expectations of most people I know and to the
expectations of the sponsors of the study. naturally it calls for some
followup.

The study showed that an increase in depression was associated with 
an increase in internet use.  However, at least according to the information 
posted, there is no evidence on the direction of causality.  If becoming 
more depressed made participants use the internet more the results 
would be exactly as recorded.  I'd be mighty surprised if they had 
evidence on causality - it's very difficult to obtain that from any study 
without a experimental (as opposed to observational) design.

Nick Bostrom and I have had a long conversation here about
the Doomsday Argument, and I think I need to stop now.  So
let me now summarize my position.

Our standard approach to analyzing the chances for doom soon
is to imagine various sorts of descructive processes, and then
choose a probability distrubution over the frequency of such
events.  In doing so one trivally and usually implicitly conditions
on the fact that we have made it so far without doom.  And one
typically does not infer that doom is likely soon.

There are two doomsday arguments I can see.  The first one notes
that for exponential growth processes which end suddenly, most
population members appear near the end.  Thus estimating that
doom is not soon implies that we are not typical/random population
members.

Since people often like to think they are special, the fact that
an inference suggests we are special does suggest we may have
fooled ourselves somehow.  But while this may motivate skeptics
to seek weak points in standard assumptions, it does not by itself
seem to me much of a reason to much modify standard analyses.
We *are* special on some dimensions, and this could be one of them.

The second doomsday argument invites us to imagine that we had
amnesia regarding which person in history we are, and that in this
situation our probability distribution over doom was that suggested
by standard analyses.  The argument then correctly notes that
learning that we appear early in history must make us expect that
doom occurs earlier in history.  It then concludes that we should
expect doom earlier than standard analyses would suggest.

The weak point of this argument is the assumption that we should
invoke our standard prior probabilities over doom in the amnesia
context.  The usual place to invoke priors over doom is in the
context where we don't know whether humanity lasted long enough
for us to be born.  In this context, learning that one exists, but
has amnesia, gives one a lot of information, and in particular suggests
that doom occurs later than suggested by the priors over doom.

Learning that one is alive with amnesia makes one more optimistic,
and then learning that one was born early makes one more pesimisti.
If you started with standard priors, you end up with standard
expectations about how soon doom may be.  Let me illustrate with
some examples.

Imagine that you found yourself hung over in a hotel room, and
couldn't remember who you were, other than that you are a musician
on tour.  You wonder: am I a one-hit-wonder, or do/will I have a
lasting music career?  If on average only 25% of musicians have a
lasting career, but musicians with lasting careers spend three
times as much time in hotel rooms on tour, then you should estimate
a 50% chance you have a lasting career.  This is because only half
of the total musician hotel room-days are filled with one-hit-wonders.
Amensia implies optimism.

Similarly, if you can't recall how old you are, you should expect
to be older than the average person.  Why?  Because older people
have more hotel-days in their lifetime.  Similarly, it seems to
me that if you can't recall who you are in humanity, you should
become more optimistic about humanity's chances.

The amnesia situation does not seem to me to be a good place for
imposing priors, unless one takes into account the fact that
amnesia suggests optimism.  The fact that amnesiacs who learn they
are early in history should become more pessimistic does not seem
a reason for me to be pessimistic.  After all, I don't have amnesia.

Yes, but what does that have to do with the thought experiment we were
discussing? These two are not of the exact same pattern of mind or even
approximately so, one is terrified and in despair and the other is not.
Also, the amount of time that passed since the two copies were made by
itself is irrelevant, the important thing is how much they have changed
not how long ago they were made. When it gets to the point that one is
having thoughts the other is not then there are two people, if not then
there is only one, and it doesn't matter if it takes one minute or one
decade.

Not being able to see the so-called standards used or to be able to inject
other useful elements or constructs makes me always wonder about the
ulterior motives of many things that I see coming out of CMU. Anyway, most
people know what it means to be sad, lonely and depressed and for one who
is permanently wired with an entrepreneurial interest in internet
development my experience is that the internet does not make me feel like
this.

However, I did drive through Pittsburgh once and thought at the time that
it really did live up to its name, which might account for why these
sociologists weren't able to see the real reason that caused these
results. Who's to know that this group of people might not have scored
worse living in 1998 in this rust bucket town had they not been using the
internet. After all, this phenomenon does swing both ways, for example,
who would ever have guessed that prisoners without net access would not be
as depressed as those who do. :^(

Furthermore the acquaintances from my pre-internet days who didn't get on
the net became boring and offensive and I have learned to live without
their jibes by cultivating relationships amongst those who are wired. Hey,
hasn't everyone heard; - there's a war on between the net haters
(capitalist newspapers, TV stations, etc.) and the rest of us.

I, for one, intend to be on the winning side.

Yes, the Net by itself is no substitute for ftf contact; and lonely nerds
who aren't socially skilful will not get better via the Net.

However, my experience is different, cuz I am willing to do ftf, so I go to
cryo meetings, extropian events, etc, and meet the people behind the email
postings. This expands my life, and healthfully so.

I agree entirely, I thought we learned during the famine in Kenya that (with

The United States is responsible for roughly 1/3 of the world's food
production and virtually every country in the world relies on US
agriculture for part of their food supply.  The US stores very little for
emergency purposes (and for most scenarios, doesn't need to).  Your "50
million Americans living in poverty" is a highly suspect figure.  I grew up
among the lowest strata of the "poverty" segment in the US population (i.e.
I lived in a shack on an Indian reservation with marginal utilities access
and none of the luxuries that most "poor" people have, such as TV), but
nonetheless we never starved.  Food is abundant in this country, even for
the poorest of the "poor".  The truly starving in this country are starving
because of reasons completely outside the socio-economic realm.

Joe Michaels is affiliated with NDTC.  Actually, he is the guy
they are going to fund initially.

Evidently, the capital raised through this venture is going to
be used to fund NDTC's nanotech research. In this sense the
company's website and SEC filing documents are somewhat misleading.

I am unfamiliar with Joe Michael or his apparently problematic
reputation. Any one care to supply some details regarding this
individual?

Ok, I'll try to summarize my position too.

The doomsday argument is a one application among many others of the 
anthropic principle. The DA, as I understand it, does not show that 
doom is likely to strike soon. What the DA does is place 
interesting constraints on what views of the future and of the 
universe at large are tenable. To assume an impending doomsday is one 
way of taking account of the DA, but at least at our present level of 
understanding there seem to be alternative interpretations, some of 
which may (hopefully) fit with the transhumanist vision of the 
future. Further analysis is required before we can say anything more 
specific than that.

I think Robins' position can be characterized as follows: He accepts 
what I call the self-indication axiom (SIA) and he thinks that also 
non-observers should be included in the reference class.

As for the SIA, I think it is consistent to accept it. There are 
problems - the problem with infinities and the no coincidence 
argument - that I think seriously detract from the plausibility of 
the SIA. But these counterarguments are inconclusive, and I do not 
rule out the possibility that the SIA should be accepted. The 
difference between Robin and me here seem to be one of degree of 
belief or disbelief in the SIA.

Robin's view that we should include non-observers in the reference 
class, on the other hand, seems incoherent to me. I have raised 
several objections against this, including the 
who's-the-apple-and-who's-the-pear problem. Two additional 
difficulties with this view also occured to me yesterday:

(1) Using a meta-level argument: If there are all these other 
inanimate objects in the reference class, how comes you are not one 
of them? If you were equally likely to turn out to be a grain of 
sand as an observer, then you finding yourself to be an observer 
would have been extremely unlikely.

(2) What exactly are the members in the reference class supposed to 
be? Are the bacteria in your body separate members or are they only 
there as a part of you?  If only fundamental particles are members, 
then you couldn't have been a human since a human is not a particle. 
Which chunks or entities count as individuals?

So I definitely do not think you can solve the reference class 
problem by including non-observers. It is still unclear, however, 
exactly what (e.g. posthumans?) should be included, and that is 
perhaps the biggest remaining philosophical problem in anthropic 
reasoning.

Just wait until you have to deal with chargebacks, and the
fact that you basically cannot dispute them for net transactions.
You will not believe how much fraud is going on out there
right now...

What I called the "fuzzy area of identity" and your calling the
"design space of Joe Jenkins" is by no means all possible states that
my biological brain can be in as allowed for by the recipe of my
genetics.  See below.

The primary utility of the Universal Turing Machine is to demonstrate
the irrelevance of hardware.  Above, I've used it to throw hardware
completely out of the equation.  Your thought experiment, that I've
omitted here, about my biological twin brother shows you have missed
my point completely.  The fuzzy area of identity is bounded by what my
ego would perceive as me, not by all the states my biological brain
could achieve as dictated by my genes.  Because the hardware and
software of the brain are both moving targets, it is useful to lump
them together in the design space I've defined above.  

At the center of the fuzzy area of identity is my "True Identity"
which consist of a single point at any given instant.  A line can be
drawn in the design space that represents my true identity from the
time I was an infant up to now.  The fuzzy area of identity would
certainly not include all the points in that line and yet it would
include points near my true identity that have not and most likely
never will be realized.  Under normal circumstances I'd say the fuzzy
area in my identity line would be from 5 years to one month ago.  That
is, anything less than a month would be clearly identified as me,
anything more than 5 years would be clearly identified and not me, and
everything in between would be considered fuzzy.  Depending on the
individual and what's happening in their life, I would expect this to
vary widely.

Thought experiment, "Non-Destructive Backup Technology":

Lets say a non-destructive backup technology becomes available in
2010.  This technology allow us to place a subject on a MRI-like table
and rotate his head while a stationary light source generates short
bursts of photons.  A sensor on the other side of the subjects head is
able to register only the photons arriving first that passed through
the brain without any collisions whatsoever.  The photons that collide
with brain matter arrive too late and are not part of the image
created for that pulse of light because they had to bounce once or
twice and thus travel further and thus take longer to exit the other
side of the brain.  The head is slowly rotated and a series of images
(one for each pulse is recorded).  At an atomic scale, human flesh is
mostly empty space and matter is the exception rather than the rule. 
A multitude of images are accumulated to represent the head being
rotated 360 degrees.  These images are now processed to determine a
record of where all matter in the brain is located.  A three
dimensional image is resolved representing every axiom, dentride,
neuro transmitter/receptor etc.  The final output product of this
system is a 400 terabyte compressed file that is handed over to the
subject on non-volatile holographic memory and backed up in a central
data base.  Most middle income individuals find they can afford this
procedure every two weeks.  Because of the four hours required for the
procedure even wealthy individuals find it practical only once every
two weeks.  In the year 2012 full resolution emulation of these files
is possible including interfaces to highly realistic artificial
reality systems.  The singularity still seems to be 10 years away.  AI
that is not derived from uploads is yet unrealized. 

To me this is the greatest invention in all history.  I now consider
myself immortal.  I return to my hang gliding hobby without a worry in
the world.  I find myself on a  troubled Jet traveling with Mr. Clark
and Mr. Randall.  We are in a three minute non recoverable free fall
headed strait for assured destruction with the ground.  All three of
us did a backup procedure last week.  Mr. Randall is shitting his
pants, Mr. Clark is trembling and sweating and believe it or not,
praying.  I'm looking at these guys, laughing my head off, completely
entertained by this whole thing.  I decide one minute of watching
these guys lose-it is enough fun for one day.  Much more entertaining,
would be to jump out the exit door and enjoy a little free-flight on
the way down.  Weeeeeeeeee this is fun.  Those guys need to get a
grip.  What say you?

Where do others stand on this list?  So far, it seems I'm the only one
on the list with this idea of identity.  If I'm the only one on this
list, I'm probably the only one in the world.  What a lonely and cold
feeling it is to be the sole resident of this memetic fitness bump. 
What are you guys selecting for anyway?  Anyone want to party at my
place?

Personally I think Joe's treatment is pretty reasonable.  In a world
in which making temporary copies was easy, I suspect that I could get
comfortable with pushing the self-terminate button if I knew that a very
recent copy was continuing on.  Similarly I could face my own death with
considerably more ease if I knew that I had a recent backup.

As Joe has written, there are a few reasons for this:

 - It allows me to take advantage of copying technology in a manner which
   would not be practical if all copies were permanent.  The latter would
   raise difficult problems of resource distribution, etc.

 - Over a long period of time, I will do this many times, and I basically
   would expect to get used to it.  The loss of information each time
   would not seem too bad based on my many experiences with the process.

 - Every night when I fall asleep I face the same problem: my current
   thoughts will be lost due to hypnagogic amnesia.  As I relinquish my
   consciousness, the "me" which is drowsily thinking will be destroyed
   forever.  When I awaken in the morning my last memories will be
   of thoughts which preceded those which I had just before sleep.
   But I've gotten used to it.

 - A technological trick could help: all copies are treated identically,
   and at the end of the temporary split we all push the self-terminate
   button, with only one copy, randomly selected, allowed to continue.
   This way I am able to practice pushing the button and becoming inured
   to it over time.

 - If many-worlds is true then when I push the self-terminate button it
   won't seem to work, my consciousness will continue on in some universe.
   Much the same thing is true if a merciful God exists.  This may give
   me solace even when I know that this instance of me is about to be
   destroyed.

I didn't address this second issue in my summary, since I didn't think
it central.  But since Nick devotes most of his summary to this issue,
let me say a few words about it.

The most interesting thing I found in the doomsday argument was the 
apparent suggestion that we should extend our fundamental state space 
descriptions to include who we turned out to be in history.  While I'm
not convinced we need to do this, I tried to explore the idea. 

The first order of business here, it seemed to me, was to seek a more
physics-oriented approach to this.  I want our descriptions of 
fundamental states to be in terms of things the universe cares about,
and not directly in terms abstract features like intelligence.  

I tried to construct such an approach, and I admit it may not be 
completely satisfactory.  If a satisfactory approach cannot be found, 
however, I would rather abandon the entire enterprise of extending 
standard state desciptions.  

Let me emphasize in conclusion that I am not against anthropic reasoning
and in fact have a paper which makes central use of it.  The doomsday
argument goes well beyond anthropic reasoning, and one can reject it 
without rejecting anthropic reasoning.

I just read the research article this press is based on,
which can be found at:  
http://homenet.andrew.cmu.edu/progress/research.html

I find it thoughtful, careful, and persuasive.  Contrary
to speculation on this list, the study gives clear 
indications of direction of causality.   Furthermore,
the study fits with my experience.

I'll share this excerpt from their discussion section:

I can't find any good indications of direction of causality.  Indeed, the
path analysis in Figure 1 explicitly assumes that internet usage
affects followup psychological status and not the other way around.

The claim for causality is that initial loneliness and depression
weren't associated with later internet use.  However, depression *was*,
it just wasn't significant.  A non-significant p value is not evidence
for no association; you need to look at confidence intervals, which 
weren't provided. In any case, this doesn't address the issue of
whether *changes* in depression and loneliness affect internet usage.

Another interesting point is that during the course of the study,
loneliness and depression *decreased* for the group as a whole.
They don't provide p values for this, but going from the normal
assumption the decrease in depression is statistically significant
(p about 0.05) and the decrease in loneliness would merit further study.

Also during the study, local social network decrease but the distant
social network increased.  They don't provide the logged values,
but the improvement in distant social network looks to be significant
as well (just a guesstimate, though).  This, however, is what the internet
is supposed to do.

So the causality is very much up in the air.  The uncontrolled results
indicate improved in psychological state amongst people gaining access
to the internet but an association between high usage and losses in
psychological state.

The proper way to address this, of course, is a randomized control group.
Maybe life has just been really good in Pittsburg the last two years.
They should have randomly assigned these folks to getting a computer
and training or an equivalent amount of money.  Then questions like
mine wouldn't be an issue.

Another problem:

>Compared with participants who completed only the pretest questionnaire,

It's bad when your dropouts are biased for a primary outcome measure.

This is a belated reply to two messages by Mark@unicorn.com.  I think this is droning on a bit much, so this is the last hunk of bandwidth I'll use on this subject.  Mark, feel free to reply, but I won't be answering on the mailing list.  If you want to continue by private email, feel free.

I was being polite about "not understanding", my mistake.  I won't do that again.  Looks like I did get your points the first time, you are repeating yourself.

Clearly true (for Truax's designs) early in the flight (aerodynamic instability would destroy the vehicle if the engine shut down in the atmosphere.)  Not so, later in the flight where the second stage can abort.

But again: I am not just talking about Truax's designs.  I am talking about the advantages of simplicity, and overall costs, including a healthy respect for the cost of development of new ideas.

SSTO has several apparent advantages:  No staging or second stage ignition problems.  No need to mate stages on the ground.  Everything (usually) returns to the launch site.  Since no SSTO has ever carried a payload and proven these advantages, any overall advantage is theoretical only.

I am all for good new ideas, as long as private funding can carry them through to actual use and repayment of the investment.  An abort capability may not pay for itself.  As SSTO's go, the ROTON is the simplest I've seen.  But even the ROTON does not look as simple to develop as a two stage pressure fed vehicle.

>That's all it can do, because there's no way you can

>land a multi-stage monster like that.
As I said, in flight abort is an independent design question.  For a vehicle to abort in the atmosphere, you need it to be aerodynamically stable, I.E., it needs fins.  To abort a pressure fed vehicle of any size (in vacuum or if the vehicle has fins): 1. Cut off propellant valve.  2. Dump fuel.  3. Wait till the right moment, then deploy drag device (chute, parafoil, or ballute).  4. Tow back from landing site.  This assumes the landing is at sea.  For SSTO's, the assumption is that you are in glide (or working engine) range of a landing site.  If you don't have a working engine, remember that the earth's surface is 3/4 ocean.  For two stage vehicles, if they are still connected, you have to separate the stages (after slowing down, if in atmosphere)


> It's not a huge, tall, narrow monster rocket that's only designed to fall into 
>an ocean, it's actually supposed to land intact at the end of its flight.
Big dumb boosters are designed to land intact at the end of flight.  Truax's designs are rather wide, squatty vehicles, actually, and again, since the tanks are built for high pressures, they are far from fragile.  Clearly, any SSTO has less structural margin, it requires the weight to be minimized.

Truax's scheme is to have a small fleet of vehicles, and they are in circulation.  Not much idle time.  But you are making one of Truax's own arguments, for simpler rockets.  The size of the standing army of technicians, engineers, and managers, and their facilities, is proportional to the complexity of the vehicle.  Among other things, obviously.  But you do make an argument for any vehicle with quicker re-cycle times.  At least, it would reduce the number of vehicles you need in the fleet.  That's good, because the more complex SSTO's would cost more to build in the first place.

Yes.  Anybody have the data or a web site on this?

That figure included amortized development and such.  Profit making launch price.

Now we are in complete agreement.

Name one SSTO (capable of making orbit with a payload) that has ever landed intact.  Just one will do.  Of course there aren't any, because no SSTO has ever made it through development.  One could design an SSTO, but that would significantly reduce the payload.

Yes.  It is obvious that this is a point of simplicity for SSTOs.  What is not obvious is that an SSTO must achieve high performance from its engine(s) and structure, and that this makes the actual complexity and development cost of an SSTO greater than a dumb (pressure fed) two stage booster.

Yes.  A reusable SSTO carries the penalty in all cases.  A flimsy pump fed tank structure (SSTOs, Atlas's, Saturn-V, etc) cannot survive landing with the lightest weight recovery option available, I.E., in the ocean with a 'chute or parafoil.

No simple development of a Saturn-V is ever going to land in its

True.  It's a pump fed booster.

That makes comparison useless, doesn't it?  I *am* talking "the same design goals", in particular, lowest cost space transportation after all costs are included.

Good.

Has any engine development ever cost as much as the SSME?  Can the cost of a turbofan be compared to an old 9 cylinder radial?  Spend the same time and money on a pressure fed rocket motor and clearly the reliability would be higher still than the SSME.

Yeah.  They'll just stick some chewing gum on the pump casing.

Maybe I did not make it clear:  I truly would like to learn something from you here, you have me intrigued on this point.  It goes against what I have learned.  Can you point me to a specific reference for this data?

No.  Increase the first stage mass by 3 % and the *whole second stage and payload* shrinks by perhaps 20% (15% of total liftoff mass becomes 12% of liftoff).  To eliminate the payload on a two stage vehicle, you would need to be about 15% off on the Isp or weight.  This is a consequence of the basic math, SSTO is very difficult to do and sensitive to Isp and structural weight.

Yeah, sure. One could also make the analogy that it is impossible in this day
and age to recover the brain from say a victim of a car smash and get it
uploaded. Well before being able to handle emergencies, lots of commitment will
be needed to change the status quo in order for practice to make perfect. David
Brin's 'transparent society' is one such change that will be needed to knock the
nay sayers off their perch.

You're correct, I don't understand your point. The Joe Jenkins who grew
up in China is not you but the Joe Jenkins chained to a bomb has no
fear because he's the same person having fun at a party. It does not
compute.

In other words, if I think it's me it is. Sounds reasonable, but if I'm
chained to a bomb I don't think I'm having fun at a party so that must
be some other fellow.

Time is irrelevant, accuracy of the copies is not.

Everybody likes to fantasize but nobody, including you, can know how
you would react in an actual life or death situation, I suspect that in
real life your behavior would be somewhat different. But perhaps not,
some people would act in the way you suggest even if they had no backup
and expected nothing but oblivion. To each their own, there is nothing
logical or illogical in the desire for self preservation, it's just a
tendency that exists in most but not all people.
