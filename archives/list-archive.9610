Certainly we know, they and companies like them are the only thing that keeps

Exactly, but you almost make that sound like a bad thing. They are making a

something they like at a price they want to pay, employees have a job,  
stockholders make money, everybody wins.

Evil compared to what? States?  Governments, those paragons of charity and  
morality, those defenders of the weak and powerless, the source of all virtue, 
have butchered hundreds of millions of people this century alone, often their  
own citizens. Corporations would have to work very hard to break that record.

Correct. A corporations may charge more for a product than you want to pay,  
but they don't put a gun to your head and make you buy their "services". 
A corporation may not be willing to pay you what you think your time is worth, 
but they don't enslave you as governments do when they need labor to serve on 
a jury or fight a war. If I tell the government that I'd rather not work for 
them, very soon men will knock on my door and make me an offer I can't refuse.

What scares me are arguments that the public doesn't know what's best for 
it but the speaker, of course, does, so what is needed is a regularity agency 
for the mass media that has the exact same values that you do and also has 
God's telephone number so it can always tell truth from falsehood and good 
from evil and will never be corrupted by its vast power.

Not quite.  Disassembly and assembly don't have to be co-located in
either time or space, though they could be.

There is no upper limit on size:  you don't need to enclose the item
being constructed.  Nor do you have to scan the whole item before you
start assembling a replica, though it might help in some circumstances.

> -- sythesize a plan for constructing such an object from feedstock,

That may be the way to do it in some cases, but it's not the only way.
"Rip up and try again" strategies such as used in circuit-board track
laying could also be used.  Also, inevitably the experience of building
a lot of different things will build up a database of component plans
and heuristics for tackling such tasks, so "synthesizing a plan" may
turn out to be a Lego-fitting exercise.

> -- retool itself and construct the object with a low error rate, and

Again, the "retooling" will probably entail selecting appropriate nano-
factory components from a library, rather than doing it from scratch
for each new job.  Items in the library will be those that experience
has shown *can* be manufactured with a low error rate, no doubt.  The
error rate in the end product will I expect be raised through iteration
and constraint checking at the point of assembly.  Unlike in wafer
fabrication, yield will not be limited by having to get it right on
first attempt.

Yes indeed.  One can expect to find a range of monitoring mechanisms to
detect errors, isolate them, and replace the faulty units.

Drexler's estimates suggest that the likely timescale is minutes or hours.

There's no restriction on source of feedstock.  Tunnel down, tunnel
along, set up transcontinental feedstock pipelines if you want, or
don't bother with continuous tunnels at all --- just send your emmissary
out to where the feedstock is and bring it back to you, or else maybe
manufacture the necessary part where the feedstock is and then have it
transported back.  There's nothing that says you can't crawl around
within the Earth's crust to your heart's content;  certainly a lot of
nice challanges there.  In any event, "one acre" becomes irrelevant.
That notion belongs to a time when property was defined by access to
the *surface* of land and to a time when such restrictions could be
enforced;  neither of these are valid in a nano world.

> and if

It's unenforceable.  And anyway, why should anyone want to enforce it?
This is "old world" thinking, based on the premise that current-day
economics will survive unchanged into a nano age.  That belongs to
another thread already in progress, so I won't say more here.

This is a figment built upon a mirage built upon a misconception.  The
main misconception is, I think, that you see all the other institutions
of the 20th century staying more or less unaffected by the progressive
development of nano capabilities.  I find this extremely unlikely.  As
the capability is put into use in more and more areas, it is likely to
cause *extreme* uproar, panic and histeria among people that suddenly
find they live in a shifting world of horrendous freedom, and the whole
fabric of civilization is going to be given a severe shaking.  I don't
know where it will lead, because people are unpredictable.  However, I
know where the technology is leading, and that's very, very far away
from the terribly limited scenario that you describe above.

There's a causal inconsistency here.  In all the scenarios I've read,
you need nano to give you control over matter before the above situations
can arise.  It's also inconsistent with the estimates from Foresight.

Wealth?  Distribution?  If you want an acre, go and get it --- there's
lots going spare, and if everyone does it (and they will because everyone
wants more) then counter-measures are unenforceable because, presumably,
the will of the people is what matters, no? (;-)

Whatever is the point of so doing?  This sort of argument is still

Unenforceable, and no point in enforcing it.

Or public domain designs may be greatly superior to private designs,
since there will probably be *vastly* greater resources in the public
domain than in the private.  It's already true now in some walks of
life:  eg. using a proprietary C compiler is asking for trouble, as
the support you get from a private company is terrible compared to
the support of thousands of GNU developers.  Anyway, what's this
difference between public and private that we're talking about?  In
a nano world where individuals and families can have the same kind
of resources and capabilities as international corporations, these
differences become more or less irrelevant.

Yeah, it'll be war for the choice cuts, but I'm heading out of here
anyway. :-)

Why?  Public-domain systems ought to be far, far more capable than
anything that a remnant of government or state can muster.  After all,
who will want to continue to *work* for government or state?  What
would be the point?

[Robin, I must confess that I'm not sticking to the straight and
narrow in much of the above, just because I'm having so much fun
responding to your points because the world you see is so terribly

Yuck.  It's not like that at all.  Far more like living in your
own world amid your loved ones and friends and defended by your
own animates.  And it *will* be your own world.  The need for
protective containment will see to that.

Collosal at present, because nobody has yet come up with any way of
actually stopping it from happening, so it *will* happen because that's
the direction in which the technology is heading.

A good point. Nonetheless, I find myself far more intolerant of people who

I am uncomfortable with the broad sweep of your generalization. I would
say that toleration of nonconsensual violence and expropriation is
ruination. I think that in this case if one wishes to be accurate one must
be specific. What I like about extropy is that it presents a positive
ideal, something to work toward. If I want a negative ideal to be opposed,
there is a long rich liberal tradition of staunch opposition to the use of
force and fraud which can be traced continuously back to the Whigs in the
English Civil War and further. This tradition, which most of the people I
know have been steeped in from birth, is also closely associated with a
tradition of toleration of new ideas and even new values. The name of this
tradition has been stolen and perverted by constructivist-rationalist
politicians of the socialist variety, but we've renamed the tradition and
we're moving on. 

> Fighting the servile society is like a pre-emptive strike, 

We are long past the time for pre-emptive strikes, Reilly. As our
political opponents like to keep pointing out, the libertarian utopia has
never been achieved: yet. There is plenty of active evil in the world that
wants direct opposition, and I would feel that I was wasting my time if I
tried to combat it by morally reforming my neighbors. I find that I can be
far more effective finding and collaborating with those who are in no
great need of moral improvement. I have yet to find any shortage of such
people. 

I am not much interested in changing other people's values, except to the
extent that they endorse the use of violent means in some attempt to
change mine. I figure that if I try to push a whole bag of values on them,
and not just the cardinal but subtle point of noninitiation of force, I'm
only going to be triggering every memetic immune system within a hundred
yards.  Ordinarily, I don't argue on behalf of toleration, and in fact,
I've put in some cautionary words (favoring what is usually referred to as
"critical thinking") on the transhuman list a few months ago when the
paeans to toleration were getting a little thick. But when I see you
eagerly whipping up an orgy of rigidity, intolerance, internal censorship
of thought, and various other things which are Not To My Taste, I'm going
to speak against it. 

> Many thinkers have noted the coupling of servility and authoritarian violence.

I get a funny feeling participating in this discussion. Is there anyone on
this list who could reasonably be accused of being servile? Thought not.
Why are we discussing this? Reilly, if you want to crush the servility
meme, you are preaching to the choir here. I'm with Hagbard Celine: "Non 
serviam, baby."

I vigorously disagree. People learn to govern themselves by being expected
to govern themselves, preferably by their parents, from earliest
childhood. A minimal government which offers nothing in the way of
religious or moral guidance to the people it governs is crucial for the
development of a society in which the expectation of self-governance is
routine. The most disturbing recent cultural trend I can think of is that
the American people are widely expecting to receive moral guidance in
their lives from such scum as Bill Dole and Bob Clinton. 

Interestingly, I think this is the first point in my conversations with 
you in which Nietzsche takes your side of the question and not mine. 
Though it is hard to tell for sure.

We disagree about the sorts of cultural conditions that produce 
self-governing individuals. I say people who are consistently expected to 
govern themselves learn how to do so and usually do a pretty good job. 
People who are consistently expected to submit to authority can never 
learn how to govern themselves except through luck and canniness. Or they 
let themselves be governed by a moral code which has been drummed into 
their head from birth, a code which will probably require changes with 
the times, which the non-self-governing person with the robot policeman 
in his or her head will not know how to do. 

For me, self-government means self-government, not government by one of 
my subroutines (which might or might not be labeled "superego"). It's a 
skill, and a difficult one which I do not pretend to have mastered. 
Working on this skill seems difficult enough to me that this task alone 
might be enough to make eternal life meaningful for and delightful to me. 
Fortunately, plenty of other tasks call as well.

This is one reason why I'm more concerned about getting the government out
of the education business than I am about changing the lifestyles of my
hippie neighbors.

This might be all well and good in other times, Reilly. I generally agree
with what you say and quote here. But we are not talking about "preventing
authoritarian violence from arising". The world is full of authoritarian
violence, and the last really big wave of it only ended some fifty years
ago. Currently, more than 50% of the product of the US economy is being
poured down a rathole. You know what a tiny sliver of that money, left to
be spent consensually by individuals to further their own values, could do
for life-extension and space-industrialization research.  This is violence
on a grand scale. This is not a game of preventive measures. 

So, um, Harry Browne in '96.  ;)

>>What is the difference between this and a moderated "best >of" list?

    Ahh, but i am not making an assertation about elitism at all.
I am not against an elite, if one exists then so be it . Rather I am  not
amenable to having my choices made for me. And i would certainly not be
interested in being on any kind of jury.
    
I suggested a guide system, probably not a very practical idea, in
application,  but it was meant as a constructive alternative to censoring the
list. 

    Two lists would take MORE of my time, not less...

    I'm not against your idea, Ijust don't want to be on the list(s) if it
goes that way. It was a closed list before and it can be again. It's a
perfectly valid idea, in light of the problem of quality. Perhaps it is
neccessary, and if two lists- one lesser one greater- seems like the
solution, go for it!   I have lovely things planned for the free time I will
have.....study, beach, jacuzzis, cafes, dancing...

No doubt someone would forward me the really good items .

      In light of Robin's most recent post, which I read only just after i
had replied to the last one...
      I indeed mistook this as an idea to censor and split the existing
Extropian list, rather than implementation of a rather good idea for a
different list.  Censorship pushes my buttons, clearly.
     Probably this was my error, and it was made clear in the original post,
but i didnt pay attention. I apologize.

I honestly apologize if I happened to worsen signal/noise ratio in any 
list, be it transhuman or extropian. Recently I took the freedom of 
decreasing selectivity of forwards, especially on the transhuman list as 
its archive facility collapsed.

If this is bothering you, please let me know.

I think there is only one possibility to guarantee long-term stability of 
a mailing list: by using access rights (cryptographic authentisation), 
and a nested hierarchy. This needs some code to implement, though. A 
combination of Emacs/PGP should be both easy to implement and convenient 
to use.

The lowest hierarchy is open both to reading and writing for anybody. All 
upper levels are echoed to it. The next level can be read but not written 
by anybody but for the inner group. The next (optional, inner circle) 
level grants r/w only to the inner circle.

Each new poster begins at the lowest hierarchy. Rights are granted and 
revoked by minimum consensus (voting). Sorting is automagical.

This is very ad hoc, so there are probably thousands of holes in this 
scheme. Comments?

Nope.  The primary rationale for dues was to help pay for the cost of the
private software (MailWeir), I think.  Now we use majordomo, and
everything is open, and I'm not convinced it is an improvement.  The
list is certainly more active, and arguably invigorated, but I think it
is also noisier than it was.  In the past I had one person excluded on
the extropians list and many people filtered out on the transhuman list;
now the two have nearly identical killfiles.  (procmail, for the
technically curious.)

The old fee was between $8 and $14.  Sometimes I think charging one cent
might be beneficial, just for the filter of physically mailing
something.

Then there are the very devoted and energetic people who will pay the
due and still not have anything to say...

OK, I finally have to speak up.

It doesn't take a conspiracy of hundreds to cover up something like

On 9/29/96 I wrote about Reilly Jones' "apparent notion that anyone who
speaks must do so with 100% certainty."

On 10/01/96 Reilly responded: "You may back this up with the appropriate
quote from me, showing where I even remotely asserted this.  I don't
recognize it in the slightest."

Reilly never asserted any such thing.

But, just to explain where I was coming from, on 9/24/96 Reilly did
write:
"The distinction between certainty and uncertainty is digital. You are
either certain or you are uncertain....  The instant you have a doubt
about something, you are uncertain."
And ...
In the context of a discussion about 'junk' on the list, and while
pondering the the difficulty of philosophical discussion without using
ambiguous terms, of making clear but concise statements of one's ideas,
of avoiding divergence, of misinterpreting another's arguments, I
diverged big-time and improperly linked Reilly's 9/24 statement, plus
the idea that tolerance is indifference, with _my own_ thought that, if
any of these can get you classified as a nihilist or imbecile or
junk-poster, then the implication must be that it's better not to speak
out if you're uncertain.

Just to be clear (so we can move on to more productive discussions), my
'apparent notion' was just that, mine, and was improperly attributed to
Reilly.

Reilly also added: "[G]o back and read my posts, I have included a
wealth of constructive ideas, and constructive sources to pursue.  If
you only want to dwell on the negative, that's your perogative, but it
doesn't make the positive nonexistent."

A most 'incisive' point!

Can someone update me on the state of brain-computer interface research? 
have the managed to control circuits with nerve impulses yet? I remember 
reading this once, but I`m not sure. If they have, then what have they 
been doing since. A project I and some friends are working on is 
interfacing an EKG with a commputer. We got ahold of an old EKG, and it`s 
sitting in a basement waiting for us to put it together and hook it up to 
a computer.

<I'vd been reading a book, "The Conscious Mind" by David Chalmers>

Chalmers also has a Web essay summarizing some of the book that's called
"Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness" and resides at
http://ling.ucsc.edu/~chalmers/papers/consciousness.html

Hara adds:
<Chalmers takes the notion that qualia, or our direct experience of
phenomena as a indication that consciousness is irreducible and not
explainable as part of other systems, such as materialism.>

I had a hard time with this too.  In the Web essay, Chalmers says:
<When we think and perceive, there is a whir of information-processing,
*but there is also* a subjective aspect.> (My emphasis)

I've never been convinced that subjective experience is somehow distinct
from this "whir of information-processing", from the memory
storage/retrieval effort and the associated emotional markers we've used
to index those memories.

Are functional models of the mind as software _just_, to borrow some
words from Reilly Jones (9/28/96), "epistemological models we impose on
whatever is actually going on in there, most likely just bits of stuff
bumping around in preferred directions", or do they have some utility? 
Can we usefully talk about patterns of thought being independent of the
hardware/wetware on which they're processed (as Moravec has suggested?) 
Are our subjective experiences objective at some level as David Musick
has suggested (9/27/96)?

Hara Ra trails off with:
<[Chalmers] discussion of quantum mechanics is also interesting, in
particular his view toward Emmet's ideas which are often misstated as
the "many worlds" interpretation of QM.>

Please, tell us more!

This "broke" a couple nights ago and it's a quickie.
Basically you only get $1 a person but subscription fees are nothing as
of now (not until the end of October), and with a full matrix that's
$3000!  Free signup, no monthly costs, no money required period until
the beginning of November...so you might as well get cranking with this.

do the same we all will make money right from the launch date.

This is an ideal opportunity to introduce novice mlm'ers to the power of
duplication using the internet.  Can you think of an easier lower cost
way to build a huge group that you can use over and over again?

I recall my "newby" phase on this list where I had an opinion on every
thread... and made a lot of postings. I think what we have here is 
about ten newbies at once, resulting in a tripling of the usual traffic 
here. How about thinking twice before posting - like,
would you like to read what you just posted???

Or to mention that lately discarded Extropian Principle:
	Spontaneous Order.

All of our senses are parallel at the hardware level. I do like to think
that what my skin, eyes, and ears get are different and therefore
parallel
channels.

Or is sex a pleasure beyond parallel?

25 years ago I read a short science fiction story about critters which
lived on
a moon with a very thin atmosphere, so that the mean free distance
(between
molecular collisions) was a few kilometers. They had "eyes" which
consisted of
a sphere lined with olfactory sensors and a small hole, which acted like
a
pinhole camera. Truly smell-a-vision...

Even more pertinent is enforced helplesness. This is typical of abusive
situations, whether in your family or police brutality. Just as a rat
will learn with ONE experience to avoid food which induces nausea, we
learn that certain situations are hopeless and respond with whatever
we came up with from the past. Freedom from this is the goal of most
forms of therapy.

OK. I can "specify" nano display paint as something you spray on a wall
to get a holographic window display to anything available from the net

Sorry, Robin. I thought this was self-evident, but apparently not. IMO
a person/entity with dramatically higher intelligence can invent and
then
use an array of vastly-improved products and processes. These products
and
processes will rapidly and radically affect the economy, but this is a
side-effect. The crucial difference is in the feedback, as the entity
invents and implements additional intelligence-augmenting devices,
algorithms,
and processes.

All humans except for those with a fairly severe brain damage fall into
a
narrow range of intelligence, when measured against, say, other primates
or
all other beings on the planet. IMO, an entity who is smarter than the
average human
by the amount that the average human is smarter than the average chimp,
will
be able to take over the world. But this level of intelligence is likely
to
be rapidly achievable shortly after we figure out how to use computers
to
augment an entity's intelligence at all.

You may argue that the industrial revolution is an analogy. At that
point, we
began to use machines to produce machines. That did in fact produce
fairly radical
changes in the economy and in society over a historically short period.
The
same thing happened again after WWII in the US with the automobile, and
is happening
again (so far to a lesser extent, IMO), with computers replacing clerks. 
intelligence augmentation has the potential to happen in a much shorter
time.
I think the economy will fail to adjust to the distortions as gracefully
as
it did to the earlier ones because of this difference in time scales.

An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  Keep the demographic levels of
servility low, and the fight against authoritarian violence is manageable.  With
high levels of servility, and a looming World State, the fight against
authoritarian violence is unmanageable.

RJ: <Since toleration of entropy is ruination...>

EWF: <I am uncomfortable with the broad sweep of your generalization. I would
say that toleration of nonconsensual violence and expropriation is ruination.>

My axiom ranges beyond the narrowly political issues you have identified.  It is
more in the nature of a biophysical law.

EWF: <I get a funny feeling participating in this discussion. Is there anyone on
this list who could reasonably be accused of being servile? Thought not.  Why
are we discussing this? Reilly, if you want to crush the servility meme, you are
preaching to the choir here.>

Several individuals have told me that it is useful for them to print a hardcopy
of the posts I make similar to this one.  The arguments contained in them, are
richly contextual, a fabric, if you will.  There is a Gestalt quality about
them, that is lost when one is in the usual Net mode of chopped-up thinking in
disjointed paragraphs.  The "topsight," in Gelernter's terminology, is that an
intractable problem in achieving minimal government exists.  Discussion of
servility comes into play in fleshing out this problem.  This is of vital
interest to the list, unless, of course, the list consists of irrational
utopians who just want to pretend these dynamic relationships don't exist, or
that there's some magic technological fix to them.  I don't believe that to be
the case.

EWF: <People learn to govern themselves by being expected to govern themselves,
preferably by their parents, from earliest childhood.> and <I say people who are
consistently expected to govern themselves learn how to do so and usually do a
pretty good job.  People who are consistently expected to submit to authority
can never learn how to govern themselves except through luck and canniness.> and
<Interestingly, I think this is the first point in my conversations with you in
which Nietzsche takes your side of the question and not mine.>

Go with Nietzsche on this one. <g> You are trying to use smoke and mirrors to
avoid the necessity of legitimate levels of hierarchy in human society.  To
strip away the smoke and mirrors, you must examine with great honesty and
clarity what the mechanisms of what you term "expected" are.

Parents today, even when they believe in their own authority, which is a rarity
in our post-60s Stalinized culture, aren't allowed by the state to exercise it.
Nor are there "consistent" expectations either in one's childhood or in one's
adulthood, because humanity is inconsistent by nature during periods of rapid
technological development.  The state stands behind every family, ready to
intercede "on a child's behalf" whenever the child complains about much of
anything, whether the complaint is issued in the neighborhood, the grocery
store, the doctor's office, or the school.  The children know this from very
early on, it permeates the air.  When the child says "I won't do what you expect
me to do, and you can't make me," the child is 100% right.  Self-control cannot
arise unless the child somewhere along the way makes an internal decision to
submit to authority.  It doesn't have to be slavish non-stop submission, no need
to make a big bugaboo about it, but it does have to occur when it counts.

Look closely at what differences there are between "You are expected to do
this," and "You will do this."  If expectation means you can always walk away,
without ever having to obey, then self-governance cannot arise.  Children can
only decide to obey internally, when they are trapped by the legitimate
hierarchy of society, which closes off avenues of disobedience to them.  But in
the modern welfare state, there are never right and wrong decisions which are
rewarded and punished by the next immediate level of authority, there are only
cases to be dealt with by impersonal, removed, statist bureaucrats and
therapists.  There can be no self-control, no respect of others, no dignity
between individuals, without this internal decision occurring.  And with the
dual scourges of nihilism and radical egalitarianism running rampant in Western
Civilization, there in fact, is precious little self-control, respect, or
dignity.  A steady diet of *only* positive reinforcement and *only* unearned
self-esteem boosting in the public schools, with no external discipline, only
produces infantile behavior, individuals simply rage when their desires are
thwarted.  As Pope defined servility, they are "proud, selfish and dull."  In
addition, as Nietzsche noted, you simply cannot learn to command effectively
unless you have learned to obey.  That is why we have no leadership today to
speak of, no Madisons, no Washingtons.

EWF: <The world is full of authoritarian violence, and the last really big wave
of it only ended some fifty years ago.>

IMO, it ended only seven years ago, with the fall of the Berlin Wall, if you
don't count Red China, North Korea, Cuba, Vietnam, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan,
Libya, Syria and assorted other third-world hellholes.  I might include the
authoritarian "violence on a grand scale" behind the metaphorical Berlin Wall
known as tenure, protecting the socialist radicals ensconced in the higher
education gulags as they wreak havoc on their students with scientific nihilism,
cultural relativism and historical revisionism.

EWF: <Currently, more than 50% of the product of the US economy is being
poured down a rathole. You know what a tiny sliver of that money, left to
be spent consensually by individuals to further their own values, could do
for life-extension and space-industrialization research.  This is violence
on a grand scale.>

Now wait a minute.  You accused me of "preaching to the choir"?  Let's be
consistent here!  <g>

EWF: <This is one reason why I'm more concerned about getting the government out
of the education business than I am about changing the lifestyles of my hippie
neighbors.>

I wonder if such noble toleration would apply, if your neighbors were, as you
refer to them, "such scum as Bill Dole and Bob Clinton"?

Now look, you egregiously flame me with such obvious hyperbole and
fear-mongering as:

EWF: <...when I see you eagerly whipping up an orgy of rigidity, intolerance,
internal censorship of thought, and various other things which are Not To My
Taste, I'm going to speak against it.>

Then you turn around and refer to the two rivals for the leadership of the Free
World as "scum."  You can't find one iota of support from my post that would
justify your use of hate-speech like "whipping up an orgy" against me.  My post
was measured and reasonable, a coherent logical construction.  Your hatred for
our country's leadership is far more filled with rigidity and intolerance than
anything I wrote.  So calm down, take a deep breath, and don't throw stones in
my direction until you move out of your own glass house.

Sorry, I was somewhat in a hurry... Sorting means automagical creation of 
(HTML)-browsable (emacs can browse HTML) indexes: as full index (WAIS), 
by sender, by subject, by date, etc. etc.

The list majordomo would be relatively easy to write, the only (big) 
problem I see is the assumption that everybody at user end of the 
mailing list will be using Emacs/PGP... These tools are the logical 
choice, but not everybody would have/use them.

This is the one big minus of the idea.

	Very good.  This should be obvious!  The same way people glare and
say extropians are insane re: up-loading, nanotech, etc.

	Most people near the facts need only be passive for well placed

    I agree.. it could be interpreted as a measure of commitment  
I would  not mind paying $14 or more, if it was helpful in making this a
stronger list.  I was just about to when the list  opened up.    If someone

CNN's computer connection featured a game input device which fits 
around your finger.  The result is that you can think about moving 
left or right and the game will respond in that way.  It works by
measuring small fluctuations (electrical ?, movement ?) in the 
muscles on the side of your finger.  It was demonstrated to work only 
for left and right movement as well as measuring heart rate and skin 
resistance. 

>From a device which interprets thoughts about moving left 
- right, to a functional "thought mouse" is not too great a leap.

You could be just the person to do it.

Here are a few of my ideas:

A palace built into a rock spire at the edge of a dramatic mountain range; 
beneath it a dense jungle spreads towards a tropical ocean in the
distance. 

A space consisting of knowledge areas, information and stored experiences 
interlinked by an ever changing semantic network. 

An escheresque building set in a large English 18th century style park. 

An alien dimension inhabited by abstract beings moving, evolving and 
changing according to their own consistent (but alien) laws.

The currently most fashionable area of research is to try to get axons to 
grow through a perforated silicon chip, enabling two way communication. 
There are some projects about this out there, and related research 
looking at other silicon-neuron interfaces. I think the animal 
experiments are showing some results, but we are still far from a good 
interface.

Interesting! Do you mean an EEG system, or really an EKG? One of our
projects here at Aleph is to build a EEG device to use for exactly this
kind of experiments; we would be very interested in exchanging ideas,
results and experiments with you.

That humans can destroy them more efficiently than they can reproduce.

That humans don't try to hunt them down (they are simply not important 
enough), and they live more or less independently. 

That they realize they can profit more from living as scavengers or 
consultants to the humans.

See the galactic centre novels by Benford for some ideas along these
lines, although it is hard to say if the humans or the mechs are the
pagets. I strongly recommend those books, they have plenty of transhuman 
ideas (uploads used as expert systems, neural enhancements, megascale 
engineering, alien and artificial civilizations and what looks like 
cosmic re-engineering).

No, the tragic death of Drexler might even have the opposite effect by 
creating media attention.

Here is a more realistic scenario, based on an upcoming paper about
scenario planning (this is the "House of Cards" scenario): 

An international stock market crash occurs for one reason or another
(Earthquake in Tokyo, Bill Gates converts to Islam or a little computer in
Ulan Bator gets a stupid idea); this upsets the world economy a lot, and
several influential banks or insurance companies crash or get into serious
trouble. This causes a feedback - for example, all insurance companies are
cross-insured, and if one goes down the others will feel the
repercussions. 

The economic chaos affects the national economies and currencies badly. 
Many customers find their savings inaccessible or even gone, a lot of
companies are forced into layoffs. A new depression seems imminent, but it
has appeared much faster than anybody had planned for, and it is almost
impossible to do anything constructive against it (whether this is true or
not doesn't matter, it is a self-fulfilling prophecy). In developing
nations things turn very nasty, since foreign capital suddenly vanishes
together with the market of many export products (like coffee or cacao).
Things are not much better in the industrialized world, since there are a
large group of unemployed, suddenly poor people who have not enough
savings, will not get enough wellfare (since the government is busy having
to save the remaining banks, the currency and keep vital installations
running) and beside have lost all confidence in the official currencies. 

As violence and poverty rise, many people band together into communities
for mutual protection and survival. This of course makes the state even
jumpier, and it has to prevent these communities from becoming too
powerful, otherwise it will loose its remaining control - and of course,
sending out the police and military consts valuable resources, which makes
the situation worse. And when things really start getting bad people
become even more desperate... 

The end result, when we played out this scenario, was a world dominated by
many more or less independent agrarian communities focused on staying
alive, most strongly defended or part of neo-feudal states. Long range
trade will probably return in the future, but it will take a long time. 
Mongolia suddenly looks like a developed country in this world - they are
good at horsemanship, independent and self-sufficient. 

Meanwhile, advanced research and development is practically impossible
(ever tried to do genetic engineering without access to purified enzymes? 
Or how do you rebuild the internet when electricity is a scarce
commodity?). Drexler and us are (if we are lucky) building generators or
tending the sick. 

No, this may not prevent the Singularity from appearing later, but it 
will delay it considerably. You could of course make this scenario even 
darker by assuming bioweapons or similar tricks, but a global market 
crash can be bad enough.

The two people I've known who were on welfare (one at least who still

          I am in maximal agreement with the sentiments expressed by 
          Robin Hanson, Peter Ross (and Michael Butler?).
          
          I wish to add one thing: It is of particular importance that 
          there exists a list for serious discussion of transhumanist 
          issues, because there is as yet no established academic 
          forum in this area. I think the present list serves this 
          purpose very imperfectly and that there might be a need for 
          a transhumanist elite list, which should in the long run aim 
          to approach the academia as regards standards of 
          contributions and comments. We could hope for a positive 
          feedback mechanism here, as a better list would attract 
          better contributors.

This sounds like a multi-level generalization of my two-level
proposal, except for the "automagical" part (whatever that is). 
I'd suggest starting out as simple as possible, with little code.

The structure worked for the period of time I subscribed to it (and 
for all I know still functions) for the following reasons:  (i) 
membership was based in part upon peer respect for activities in the 
field, (ii) there was a defined, agreed-upon mission statement for the 
list, (iii) the persons participating in the list had specific types of 
information to exchange to aid others in taking on specific tasks, 
(iv) the agreed-upon range of topics was not based in ideology or 
opinion or worldview but was based on the realities of that particular 
human rights problem, (v) whenever discussion ranged too far off-topic 
or disputes flared, persons in the group were willing to step in as 
moderators to call the members' attention back to the paramount 
goals, (vi) persons on the list were accustomed to operating in 
concensus-based decisionmaking groups.

I would add one more thing to this list: hedonism.

You can't conquer death (and everything else) if you are a slave to
physical needs/desires.  As I recall, someone on this list (maybe it was
Max More?) said they would not want to be uploaded to exist solely as
intellect.  Why not?  Do you think if you achieved such an existence you
would miss having physical needs/desires?  I doubt it.

(Of course, I'm sure at some point virtual sex will be indistinguishable
from, and better than, the real thing.  In fact, you could probably just
configure yourself in an endless loop.  But it would be an entirely
meaningless existence.)

I am not recommending abstinence.  It would be equally foolish -- while we
have no alternative to inhabiting our biological homes -- to waste energy
fighting their physical needs and desires.  But the greatest and most
lasting pleasure is experienced through the pursuit of knowledge.

I also don't buy all the stuff about sex being the ultimate transfer of
information (serial or parallel).  That would be achieved by donning a
helmet that lets you absorb all the information and wisdom contained in all
the world's libraries in just an hour or two.

The problem with this is that you are asking people to, in economics
lingo, "make voluntary contributions to a public good".  We all
benefit when someone takes the time to tell folks their posts are not
up to par, but the cost is borne by that one person.  In a small
social group, where we might be able to monitor and reward each other
for putting in such efforts, this can work.  But when the group gets
too large, or monitoring is too hard, or some people just won't listen
to such advice, then it can all easily break down.

Have you heard of CRAYON - CReAte Your Own Newspaper?

It's a cool Net service that allows you to configure your
own newspage.

As an experiment, I created "The Extropian Times" paper.
You can find it at:
http://crayon.net/read.cgi?alexc@firefly.net

Now it has a basic configuration and references some general
news sources that I consider of extropian interest, and
a few other things.

I would like it to grow into the Extropian community paper.
At this point, everyone who can type "exi" as a password
can edit it; *please do not distribute the password*
outside the extropian community!

Note the expression, "at this point."  After writing approximately 
thirty posts on this subject, I think enough is enough.  I find myself 
in the odd position of trying to convince grown-ups that Santa Clause 
doesn't exist.  

It's time to move on to other things.  I need to go out and propagate my 
own meme-set.  I mentioned some time ago that I am going to open an 
on-line university.  Philosophy will not be a separate subject; it will be 
integrated into all subjects.  The ideas I have introduced here (such as 
"calibration") will be used throughout the curriculum, along with other 
ideas (such as language reflection) that I have not mentioned on the list.

 [ I didn't write the above, but can't help commenting: ]

 There are, of course, alternative interpretations of these things.
E.g., the last equation (W=M*K) would be better read as "stupid people are
pretty useless, poor or rich". Or, substituting T for M, "stupid people
do not produce lots of results even if they work for a long time".
 Here we can get into a conflict between mathematical and political
correctness...

Actually, "Time is Money" is supposed to mean that time is valuable, and
you can make money out of it if you use Knowledge and Work:

  M = T*K*W

Here we'd get a different set of formulas though.  It's called economics.

You can also use your time, knowledge and work to have Fun instead of
making money, so

  [M+] F = T*K*W

Resolving for Fun and Knowledge and mistaking correlation for causality,
we can conclude that

"It is stupid not to have fun".


Well, enough fun for today...

You can certainly *accuse* anyone of being servile.  Being servile
doesn't necessarily have to be bad for the accused, though.  We're in
the values arena again: who's to say what's good for you?  Yourself,
of course.  But what if you're brought up in such a way as to sincerely
believe that serving other people is the right way?  Again, you can
*accuse* your parents/guardians/state/whatever of brainwashing you, but
that's just stating that your set of values is different from their set
of values.  I have figured out quite some time ago that individual
happiness is not correlated with the social structure at all.  I'd
rather concentrate on fostering those virtues of people that let them
accomplish more in terms of what I think of as magnificent, but that
statement *implies* my desire for some servility from the subjects.
Language is such.


Reilly:
>> And individuals can never learn to obey themselves - that is, develop

Eric:

>childhood.

Hmm, I smell a semantic snag here.  How is governing oneself according
to someone else's expectations different from obedience?  Or to rephrase
the question: how many kids do you have, Eric?  I don't think I fully
understand both claims, but I tend to side with Reilly.  An unquestionable
authority is absolutely crucial for a child's early development.  Kids'
brains undergo several phase transitions, as I have witnessed with
fascination.  The problem begins where that authority stays unquestionable
beyond formative years, and where it extends beyond home.  But I'm no
expert on child psychology, and furthermore, it's just a personal view
of how *I* think people should be brought up nowadays (guiding by example).
It's beyond doubt that many magnificent accomplishments of human race were
the fruit of slave labor.


Eric:
>We disagree about the sorts of cultural conditions that produce 
>self-governing individuals. I say people who are consistently expected to 
>govern themselves learn how to do so and usually do a pretty good job.

But the two are the same!  All people govern themselves to the extent
they perceive they have to in order to maximize their goals in life.
The other crucial ingredient is to teach them when to lead and when to
follow, and this simply doesn't make any sense unless they know authority.
You are only stating "they should all have my set of values" in different
words.  Most of us act so (those who don't are poor specimens in
evolutionary terms), and some of us are self-conscious enough to realize
this and discuss it via mailing lists.


Reilly:

Eric:

Two questions:
  Eric, who do you think should be in charge then, and what's to stop
        the market from simply bankrupting education?
  Reilly, where should concerned parents send their five years olds in
        order to evade their imminent metamorphosis into tabula rasae?

In terms of creating smaller beings [for lack of a better word] with human
intelligence, I am fairly sure that mankind would be able to control them if
they were robotic [for example, as in Star Wars, okay, I know, a 
fictional tale, but restraining bolts are a good idea if we intend to 
'enslave' a human-intelligence 'species']-- or via some other means [such 
as in the Island of Dr. Moreau, using fear and pain as a controller]-- 
The human species can be quite cruel and controlling, and we would find a
way to control such a 'resource'.. and if we can't, THEN we'll try and 
erradicate it, and of course then we have the Paget scenario! ... 

Just a couple cents for the pot!

the school of architecture at the university of texas/austin was, at one time, very active
in designing virtual spaces.  michael benedikt was the principle investigator.

I realize, I was talking about designs for city structures in the real world
and environment designs in upload VR.

Yes and I want to know people's fantasy worlds or what type of environment
they'd like to live in. The latter dealt with designs for city structures in
the real world.

Of course things will be completely different but why not fantacize (sp?)
now and use our creativity to come up with some good ideas on general design
themes so that we can begin building our worlds right after we're uploaded
having already thought the design through and as we get closer we can add to
it and make it more vivid? Also you meantion loss of time. What do you mean
loss of time? The singularity is right around the corner and you or I can do
nothing to stop it even if we wanted to. What could stop the singularity?
Hire a hitman to take out Eric Drexler? Traces of Terminator 2.

I very recently thought of an interesting mega-scale engineering project that 
I've never heard suggested before.  To be cost-effective, it will require a 
certain level of nanotechnology (although not the genie-in-a-box variety).  I 
was thinking: why not enclose the entire earth, atmosphere included, in one 
big shell, which is grounded in place by several large posts that reach from 
the upper atmosphere, down to the hard surface of the earth.  The posts could 
even be huge cities, if desired, and they could provide an elevator to the 
outside (using space-ships that are propelled by magnetic fields, similar to 
the way maglev trains work).  Now, the first problem with this is that the sun 
would be blocked out and we'd all die.  But, this problem can be overcome by 
coating the outside of the shell with solar cells to gather energy and coating 
the inner layer of the shell with lights that emit the same spectrum that the 
sun does (or even a more desirable spectum, if we want).  We can also build 
huge fins on the outside of the shell, which are also coated with solar 
collectors, to gather even more energy, to be used however we desire.

The shell could be built to be very strong, strong enough to provide us 
adequate protection from very large asteroids (perhaps we could even surround 
the earth with probes that watch out for and explode any large asteroids or 
meteors that are approaching earth, so that the shell gets hit by many small 
fragments, spread out, rather than having all of its momentum concentrated in 
a small area, which could pierce the shell.)  The shell could also be very 
insulating, to keep a great deal of our heat energy inside, rather than 
allowing it to be expelled into space so quickly.  Since we're controlling how 
much energy is being radiated from the lights overhead, we could regulate the 
temperature.  We could also build devices which pull extra heat out of the air 
and store it for later use.  We would have excellent climate control, as we 
could regulate the temperature and amount of light received in various areas.  
If we wanted, we could make the whole earth warmer and more suitable for a 
greater abundance of living things.  The polar ice-caps would melt, but that's 
not a serious problem because we could build enormous areas of land which 
float on the ocean and provide more landspace for living things.  We could 
also provide lights on the underside of the floating landmasses so that the 
ocean life would continue to flourish and not be shaded by the land.  We could 
also provide considerable air space under the floating landmasses for 
creatures which like to come to the surface and take a breath of air.  Hell, 
we could even provide landmasses under the landmasses, for creatures to crawl 
upon and live on.

Now, I'm having the idea that we could make several levels of shells, with 
lots of space between shells, and we could have the outside surface of each 
shell coated with a thick layer of land as well as oceans and other bodies of 
water.  We could have several concentric biospheres.  We would gather energy 
from the sun and transfer the appropriate amount to the lights on each level.  
And if we need more energy, we can build bigger fins.  We can also use nuclear 
power, of course.  Another way to get energy is to drill very deeply into the 
earth and use the heat energy there.

For all these biosphere shells, we need lots of materials.  We can get them 
from the earth and from other sources, such as the asteroid belt, the moon.  I 
have nothing against taking apart mercury or venus or any of the other planets 
and using them also.  Eventually, we could keep taking material from the crust 
of the earth to build new biosphere levels, use the heat energy of the lower 
layers, and as they cool off, use that material to build more shells and 
continue working in until the entire earth is turned into one huge, 
multi-leveled, life-filled starship.  

I'm still trying to figure out what the gravitational pull would be like in 
the center-most layers, since they would pretty much be surrounded with lots 
of mass.  I'm thinking that the gravitational effect would be effectively 
cancelled out down there since any mass in there would be getting pulled 
nearly the same amount in every direction.

The earth would be much larger than it is right now, and it would probably 
keep expanding as we added new layers.  We may make its orbit larger as it 
grows more massive.  If we find some way to generate sufficient energy without 
the sun, we could even leave the sun behind and fly the planet around the 
universe wherever we wanted to.  Or, even better, pull the hydrogen and helium 
off the sun, use some kind of large fusion device to transform the hydrogen 
and helium into whatever atoms we wanted and use them to continue expanding 
the earth.

Now that we have the general idea of how this goes, I think it would be better 
to have *many* of these kind of structures, which keep expanding and making 
more room for life, rather than just one.  This would allow for more diverse 
types of biospheres and would be a good safeguard, in case something goes 
horribly wrong in one of them.  Then, when all the matter in this solar system 
has being used by life, we can start travelling around to other star systems 
and make use of the matter that exists there. 

There was a thread going where someone was saying the life would transform 
itself into a neutron star and just sit where it was and compute away, not 
sending out any probes because they would be too costly.  It may not send out 
probes, but I don't see why it wouldn't propell itself around to various star 
systems and grab up all the matter and energy there.  Certainly *that* would 
be cost-effective.

Well, these are just some more ideas to get us thinking.  Of course, there's 
lots of variations of these ideas that one could follow, and I'd be interested 
to read any that any of you come up with.

The issue is not the existence of feedback, a point we both granted
long ago.  Feedback happens with all technlogical and economic growth.
Even before the industrial revolution.  

The whole issue is about the rates of change.  You have been claiming
that this technology will produce much faster rates of change and
economic growth than we have seen with other technologies, and I have
been asking for your reasons.  In the above, you simply repeat your
claim of faster change several times, but do not give reasons.

Yes, because you arent getting the direct amount you should from your
labour. Instead, money is being soaked up by "management", where the
coordinators are paid more than the workers. This kind of top-down
structure reeks of a closed fascism, where the guy at the top gives the
orders and the men/women at the bottom have to take it or leave. here`s 
no room for negotiation. 
Business assumes that the workers aren`t competent to run a business by 
themselves. I`m a big advocate of co-ops.

Interest payments on debts taken out for (under Reagan) arms
manufacturing, which gives businesses more lucrative contracts than they
could possibly get from consumer items. More money goes towards corporate
subsidies than  welfare.

Really, so this justifies the less than 5 percent tax business pays versus

Yes, this is because you are likely to have talents that get you ahead in
the current economy. However, there are those that arent as fortunate. If
we are in this kind of "must screw over" other people circumstances, some
people are going to get screwed. some very Talented people cannot get
ahead without
being ruthlessly greedy.

The strongest bulwark of the capitalist system is the ignorance of its 
victims. -Adolf Fischer
Echoes of Jeane Kirkpatrick here.
Obviously you don't. Believe what the news tells you, it`s safe. Nigeria 
has a very very repressive dictatorship,
capitalist to the extreme, but backed by  arms sales from shell, so
Shell can move in and drill oil. Because Shell has the government in its
pocket, and so no environmental regulations are imposed. The Ogoni people
live on the land being drilled, and thanks top those very crop unfriendly
oil residues that perpetually come from the extraction of the black fluid,
they are starving. Anyone who opens their mouth in protest is imprisoned.
Read about Ken Saro-Wiwa.   
Also Nicaragua, Chile, El Salvador and every other country the U.S. 
secretly invaded was to preserve U.S. markets or secure resources for 
U.S. businesses. Socialist governments that have been tried have been 
attacked(I.e. Nicaragua) and often handicapped by the U.S. leaning on it 
until it croaks. The Soviets were even worse, but this was a fault of the 
bureaucracy and elite control rather than the concept of equality.

Because Altruism isn an extropian virtue we shouldn practice it? If
humanity is truly going to ascend and take our place in the universe,
a then we need to cultivate a sense of respect and a little bit of
compassion for each other, else the future will be a class war on a
nanogod level.

The thing is, a wonderful product is of use to the few that can afford it.

Governments acting in business interests. I hope government will actually
live up to the philosophy behind it, but while the money
flows from elite hands, I doubt it will. Most politician are looking for a
nice cushy CEO job after their term, so of course theyll mess with policy
until their future employers are happy. Look at Indonesia, the government
there is good friends with Nike, Gap, Brie-X etc, and they keep that
friendship by crushing any attempts at labour reform. Good government to
these people means a well-armed riot battalion. It 's very different here,
because the elites have the people in their pocket with misinformation and
propaganda. Business and Government share the same interests:keeping the
elite in power. While I'm not opposed to an elite, I am opposed to it
being a stupid short sighted one. Any elite should look ack at the rest 
of the people and aim to educate and improve the rest with their gifts, 
not hoard information and power.

They take all of some peoples time and don`t give enough money to feed

Sorry, that came out sort of wrong. No censorship, ever. What I 
mean is that media is owned by the elite, so the channels of communication are geared to elite tastes, 
with enough electronic prozac to keep the masses from wanting to take the 
airwaves back. I think public communication should be open to 
the public. Sort of like Ralph Naders proposed Audience Network. If media 
continues regurgitating establishment lines, no alternative forums of 
thought can be heard, which is good only for the establishment. If we`re 
lucky, the internet will alleviate this, but from what I see, nope, 
simply because it costs a lot to get on. The same 
news is echoed back at us from every major network with the exact same 
spin. I have no access to truth(tm) from anywhere. 

Do you think the media has the interests of open 
discussion in mind? >

You can't conquer death (and everything else) if you are a slave to
physical needs/desires.  

i am having a hard time following this reasoning.  i, too, look forward to an indefinate
period of physical joys.  i study the martial arts and the physicality of it is one of
my supreme pleasures.

As I recall, someone on this list (maybe it was
Max More?) said they would not want to be uploaded to exist solely as
intellect.  Why not?  Do you think if you achieved such an existence you
would miss having physical needs/desires?  I doubt it.

how do you know?


(Of course, I'm sure at some point virtual sex will be indistinguishable
from, and better than, the real thing.  In fact, you could probably just
configure yourself in an endless loop.  But it would be an entirely
meaningless existence.)

I am not recommending abstinence.  It would be equally foolish -- while we
have no alternative to inhabiting our biological homes -- to waste energy
fighting their physical needs and desires.  But the greatest and most
lasting pleasure is experienced through the pursuit of knowledge.

actually, i like a balance.

I also don't buy all the stuff about sex being the ultimate transfer of
information (serial or parallel).  That would be achieved by donning a
helmet that lets you absorb all the information and wisdom contained in all
the world's libraries in just an hour or two.

well, it kinda depends on what you are trying to transfer.

Several people have mentioned that the traffic on this list is getting so
heavy that they don't have time to deal with it. I feel the same way. There
have been many interesting threads and ideas on this list, and I hate to
unsubscribe but there are ridiculous numbers of posts to wade through,
especially if one is away for a few days. 

One reason the quality of the list was so high in the past, I believe, was
the ability of a subscriber to do sophisiticated filtering so as to only see
the threads and/or posters considered worthwhile. Now we have to do this in
our own mail programs, which means downloading everything.

There is definitely a point of diminishing returns. Max, is there any chance
of charging some fee and getting hold of a list management program that can
do filtering like the old one did? If some solution isn't developed for this
problem, this list is going to rapidly degrade, because people who are only
peripherally involved will be forced to disengage.

I say:
There are a lot of rhetorical hooks packed into this.
I dispute the equivalency of "hedonism" and "[being] a slave to 
physical needs/desires".

I suspect I would not willingly permit myself to be uploaded to exist 
solely as intellect. 

I might permit myself to be copied into a fast intellect-only form
(as a sort of "guardian angel") if it seemed as if a lot of people I 
don't know and hence might be wise not to trust were getting themsleves 
uploaded as pure intellects. But that would be so I could keep an eye on 
them and fight them on their own turf if need be. (1/2 grin) 

It's anybody's guess how I could keep my guardian angel interested 
in guarding me--I'd probably have to install something irrational like 
"loyalty" or "fondness" into it, and that might slow it down against 
some faster-on-the-draw "pure intellect". If so, bummer.

You are free to doubt whatever you like; but GIGO. The notion that 
"physical needs/desires" is all there is to hedonism is fundamentally 
flawed when applied to this particular human. YMMV.

1) Assumption: the compuer component contributes non-trivially to the
   intelligence of the entity, once the entity comes into existance
2) Observation: computer hardware and software technology are advancing
   at an empirically-observed exponential rate known as "Moore's Law",
   which we both agreed is unlikely to change in the near future. This
   rate is dramatically faster than the 30-year sustained rates of
increase
   of the other technologies you mention.
3) Assumption: a more-intelligent entity can develop
intelligence-augmentation
   faster than a less-intelligent entity.
4) Conclusion: This is a fast-feedback loop.

Best I can do concisely, Robin.

        I can't help but close my eyes, snicker, and shake my head when I
read this kind of response.  I feel like I'm caught in some sort of
semi-conversant
paradox.  As *I* recall, I agreed with whoever it was that said they would
not want to be uploaded to exist solely as intellect.  To me, it seems kind
of edeist; that is to say, like a low-level cult mentality.  No offense
intended, Ira, but would you truly like to be intellect and nothing else?
You most certainly would not be alive.  Conciousness is another matter.  I
seriously can't grok the concept that an extropian would want to forfeit
their life for eternal existance --such a huge line between existance and
life.  I can understand that being pure intellect is "better than nothing",
but personally (and I believe I am speaking for most extropian types) I
would rather be more than that.  If I could copy my conciousness as well as
my intellect, that would be almost ideal.  I rather like being able to
access my information, as opposed to just having it there...stranded.  Like
a person with short-term amnesia: has the memory, just can't access it.  I
don't anything hedonistic about that, just optimistic objectivism.

Hey, we're still at the bottom of the curve ...  If you think we get a
lot of traffic now, just wait until the mainstream becomes aware of us.

To be constructive though, it would help if people posted articles on
general transhuman topics to the transhuman list, and only specifically
Extropian articles here.

That's actually a very good question.  Once we get into planetary sizes
then the solutions begin to change, not because it can't be done one atom
or group at a time from the outside of the mega-item under construction,
but because the feedstock obviously has to have planetary mass.  If we're
merely rearranging groups without net gain or loss of constituent atoms
and under the blessing of a favourable energy equation (a highly unlikely
situation, it seems to me) then OK, it's easy, but in all other scenarios
then either the planet-sized feedstock or the planet-sized detritus or
both are going to create extreme complications.

Yes, a very good question to ask, Robin!

[PS. How about moving into the transhuman list some of these general
transhuman issues that are not specifically and exclusively Extropian?]

I very recently thought of an interesting mega-scale engineering project that 
I've never heard suggested before.  To be cost-effective, it will require a 
certain level of nanotechnology (although not the genie-in-a-box variety).  I 
was thinking: why not enclose the entire earth, atmosphere included, in one 
big shell, which is grounded in place by several large posts that reach from 
the upper atmosphere, down to the hard surface of the earth.  The posts could 
even be huge cities, if desired, and they could provide an elevator to the 
outside (using space-ships that are propelled by magnetic fields, similar to 
the way maglev trains work).  Now, the first problem with this is that the sun 
would be blocked out and we'd all die.  But, this problem can be overcome by 
coating the outside of the shell with solar cells to gather energy and coating 
the inner layer of the shell with lights that emit the same spectrum that the 
sun does (or even a more desirable spectum, if we want).  We can also build 
huge fins on the outside of the shell, which are also coated with solar 
collectors, to gather even more energy, to be used however we desire.

The shell could be built to be very strong, strong enough to provide us 
adequate protection from very large asteroids (perhaps we could even surround 
the earth with probes that watch out for and explode any large asteroids or 
meteors that are approaching earth, so that the shell gets hit by many small 
fragments, spread out, rather than having all of its momentum concentrated in 
a small area, which could pierce the shell.)  The shell could also be very 
insulating, to keep a great deal of our heat energy inside, rather than 
allowing it to be expelled into space so quickly.  Since we're controlling how 
much energy is being radiated from the lights overhead, we could regulate the 
temperature.  We could also build devices which pull extra heat out of the air 
and store it for later use.  We would have excellent climate control, as we 
could regulate the temperature and amount of light received in various areas.  
If we wanted, we could make the whole earth warmer and more suitable for a 
greater abundance of living things.  The polar ice-caps would melt, but that's 
not a serious problem because we could build enormous areas of land which 
float on the ocean and provide more landspace for living things.  We could 
also provide lights on the underside of the floating landmasses so that the 
ocean life would continue to flourish and not be shaded by the land.  We could 
also provide considerable air space under the floating landmasses for 
creatures which like to come to the surface and take a breath of air.  Hell, 
we could even provide landmasses under the landmasses, for creatures to crawl 
upon and live on.

Now, I'm having the idea that we could make several levels of shells, with 
lots of space between shells, and we could have the outside surface of each 
shell coated with a thick layer of land as well as oceans and other bodies of 
water.  We could have several concentric biospheres.  We would gather energy 
from the sun and transfer the appropriate amount to the lights on each level.  
And if we need more energy, we can build bigger fins.  We can also use nuclear 
power, of course.  Another way to get energy is to drill very deeply into the 
earth and use the heat energy there.

For all these biosphere shells, we need lots of materials.  We can get them 
from the earth and from other sources, such as the asteroid belt, the moon.  I 
have nothing against taking apart mercury or venus or any of the other planets 
and using them also.  Eventually, we could keep taking material from the crust 
of the earth to build new biosphere levels, use the heat energy of the lower 
layers, and as they cool off, use that material to build more shells and 
continue working in until the entire earth is turned into one huge, 
multi-leveled, life-filled starship.  

I'm still trying to figure out what the gravitational pull would be like in 
the center-most layers, since they would pretty much be surrounded with lots 
of mass.  I'm thinking that the gravitational effect would be effectively 
cancelled out down there since any mass in there would be getting pulled 
nearly the same amount in every direction.

The earth would be much larger than it is right now, and it would probably 
keep expanding as we added new layers.  We may make its orbit larger as it 
grows more massive.  If we find some way to generate sufficient energy without 
the sun, we could even leave the sun behind and fly the planet around the 
universe wherever we wanted to.  Or, even better, pull the hydrogen and helium 
off the sun, use some kind of large fusion device to transform the hydrogen 
and helium into whatever atoms we wanted and use them to continue expanding 
the earth.

Now that we have the general idea of how this goes, I think it would be better 
to have *many* of these kind of structures, which keep expanding and making 
more room for life, rather than just one.  This would allow for more diverse 
types of biospheres and would be a good safeguard, in case something goes 
horribly wrong in one of them.  Then, when all the matter in this solar system 
has being used by life, we can start travelling around to other star systems 
and make use of the matter that exists there. 

There was a thread going where someone was saying the life would transform 
itself into a neutron star and just sit where it was and compute away, not 
sending out any probes because they would be too costly.  It may not send out 
probes, but I don't see why it wouldn't propell itself around to various star 
systems and grab up all the matter and energy there.  Certainly *that* would 
be cost-effective.

Well, these are just some more ideas to get us thinking.  Of course, there's 
lots of variations of these ideas that one could follow, and I'd be interested 
to read any that any of you come up with.

Sounds like a good idea (reminiscent of "forking"). Personally I would 
probably spawn many different versions of myself, some with specialized 
uses, some free to go wherever they want. One idea would be to create a 
search agent version of myself - I know I have partially the right 
mentality to do it, and with some brain hacking I might create a Anders 
Agent that would be extremely happy looking for information on the Net 
all the time.

What about a kind of mental link, so that you share information? If 
something bad happens to you it will feel your pain/fear/etc, and vice 
versa (I personally think the angel should have the same rights to 
protection from your side).

Are you sure about this? If the physical needs and desires align with 
what you want to conquer, you will be very good at it and enjoy the trip 
too. Imagine linking your pleasure center to some way of measuring your

We humans are embodied, physical beings with a lot of emotional baggage - 
we *are* our bodies in some sense. So far all realistic uploading 
scenarios have simply dealt with copying the neurochemical pattern of us 
into a digital emulation, where we continue to live as emulated physical 
beings (who of course now can start to automorph very freely - who needs 
physical continuity?). 

We wont immediately become "pure intellect" - that doesn't exist, at least
no human or human-derived intellect can work without emotion, motivation
circuits and plenty of brainstem processing (you don't want to loose your
superior colliculus or habenula when you upload). Without these parts we
would simply not function well, and be less (effectively) intelligent. We
might change ourself into posthuman beings with completely new such
structures, but that will take plenty of work.

Benedikt edited a 1991 book from MIT Press called _Cyberspace: First

Benedikt's article in the book offered some architectural principles for
navigating among data objects in cyberspace, discussing extrinsic

transpose these.

Benedikt proposed seven principles for cyberspace design [These are a
cut & paste of his words]:
(1) The Principle of Exclusion (PE): two things cannot be in the same
place at the same time.
(2) The Principle of Maximal Exclusion (PME): always choose as extrinsic
dimensions those that minimize violations of PE.
(3) The Principle of Indifference (PI): the felt realness of any world
depends on the degree of its indifference to the presence of a
particular user and resistance to his desires.
(4) The Principle of Scale (PS): the maximum visible-space velocity of
user motion [across extrinsic dimensions] is an inverse monotonic
function of the complexity of the visible world/dataspace.
(5) The Principle of Transit (PT): travel between two points should
occur through all intervening points and should incur costs proportional
to the distance.
(6) The Principle of Personal Visibility (PPV): individual users should
be visible, in some non-trivial form, at all times to all other users in
the vicinity but may choose which users they wish to see.
(7) The Principle of Commonality (PC): virtual places should be
objective, in a circumscribed way, for a defined community of users.

The idea of building a lot of smaller biospheres makes a lot more 
sense.  There won't need to be global co-coperation between countries 
(which is very tedious) and the scale of engineering will be more 
manageable.  Every biosphere could be it's own sovereign country - 
regardless of size.  These could be connected with tunnels which are 
constructed by mutual funding of the biospheres involved.  Gathereing 
solar power from the outer atmosphere (and beyond) will have to wait 
a while 'cause the biospheres will first expand more laterally than 
vertically.  

Asimov's Foundation novel sketch a nice picture of a planet that is 
5km deep in buildings - all the way around.  I've always liked time 
lapse photographs of plants growing, imagine watching planet earth 
light up and expand spreading it's tentacles to the outer reaches of 
the solar system and transforming all the dead matter into 
dynamically evolving life...   (gooseflesh up my spine :-)  )

        I tend to agree, here.  Though there is often an interest to
extropians about this sort of subject, it might not be a bad idea to define
the line between extropianism and transhumanism a bit more on these lists.
I think most extropians are on the >H ML, as well as the extropian one.  I'd
like to see more (and I'm not insulting any of the previous posters when I
say this) libertarian views and topics on *this*
list, and the more varied views on the other list.

Yes, and this is something we can do something about. What about using 
Homo Excelsior (coming soon to a mailbox near you) as a forum for 
well-thought and well-researched debates?

There's been commentary of late on keeping the extropy list clean.
I (new kid) am probably guilty of posting things to extropians (which 
I joined) rather than transhumans (which I have not joined).

Does the extropian FAQ make this distinction clear?

I'm amazed that no one has responded to my simple suggestion for keeping
this list open: limit each member to three messages posted per day.

I just received a few dozen messages from this list.  About 10 were from
one person.  Several other messages had no real content.  Perhaps some sort
of elite list or hierarchy of lists will be necessary in the future.  For
now, however, a little discipline would fix things.

If there were two lists -- one open and one closed -- you would simply see
what I have proposed.  The people on the closed list would be those who
post carefully.  The "open" list would become a repository for people who
feel the need to share their every conscious thought.

Various measures of computer cost and speed have had a roughly
constant growth rate over four decades (or more?)  During this time
the world economy has doubled (more than once?) the computer industry
has doubled many times, and computers are lots more available.  Thus
this growth rate does not seem especially sensitive to the size of the
world economy or the computer industry, or to computer availability.
Or perhaps it is senstive, but such effects are just about canceled
out by the computer design problem slowly getting harder.

It sounds like you think this growth rate is sensitive to "researcher
intelligence".  Note though that the growth rate hasn't changed much
even though computer companies now hire lots more researchers than
they once did, because the industry is larger, and though they could
have instead hired the same number of researchers that they did at the
beginning but made sure they were the IQ cream of the crop.  So that
degree of IQ difference doesn't seem to make much difference in the
growth rate.  And note that the average researcher today is smarter
than the average one 40 years ago, because humanity knows so much
more.  And note that researchers today have access to lots more
computers than they once did, and that hasn't made much difference.

So you posit an effect of researcher IQ on computer growth rates that
can not be substituted for by hiring more researchers, or by having
them know more, and that is not very strong for small IQ differences.
So at what level of increased IQ do you expect this effect to kick in?
And you posit an effect of more computer access on IQ that we haven't
seen yet.  So at what level of computerization do you expect this
effect to kick in?  And why should we believe in either of these
not-yet-observed effects?

The practicum for my master's degree focused on online facilitation, 
so my participation in listserves has been on several levels--as a 
participant and a meta-observer.

I have noticed on this list a dynamic tension between two values/goals:  
constructive intellectual debate and propogation of Extropian memes.  
Various proposals regarding list efficiency have conciously or 
conciously emphasized one of these value/goals at the expense of the 
other.  

Given that this list has only recently become more open, I could 
speculate that this is the natural fallout of list expansion.  This 
list could also be viewed as a coalition effort, however, and coalitions 
take work to maintain.  This is where filtering mechanisms fail to 
effectively promote more cohesive discussion.  Members must be willing to 
address problems with the person(s) involved, not simply turn their 
backs and never speak to the person again.  I saw one post regarding 
a sort of mentoring process--it would be interesting to hear that 
expanded upon.

I have heard Max and other Extropians state that it is vital to 
respect every person's level of development.  Therefore, my one 
request is that participants in this discussion shift terminology 
away from loaded terms like "quality" and "better/worse" to more 
defined terms like "effective", "productive".  

I won't put myself in the position of supporting any particular 
proposal, as I respect the longstanding involvement of most of the 
members of this list, but I am willing to provide my own obervations 
as they seem appropriate.

Sin,

Kathryn Aegis

Hmmm. No, I don't think I'd ever want to be a martyr. Can't decide whether
that's a failing or a triumph of good sense!

Sounds like we differ on what constitutes a theory, rather than any great
philosophical point.

I'm not sure what is so bad about "downloading everything" if you have 
filters set up on the client side. Does it take a long time via modem?

One possible solution would be to make the list available via an nntp
server so you would be able to use your favourite newsreader (including
the latest Netscape and Internet Explorer) to read new messages, peruse
and search the archives, and do sophisticated client side filtering via 
kill files (or whatever the newsreader provides). Has anyone seen this
(mailing list -> newsgroup gateway) done? If so, I'd appreciate some 
pointers.

Where did you hear about us?

In response to your request, your address has been added to the
Extropians mailing list. Welcome! We expect you will find the
information you receive through the List highly intellectually 
stimulating, and inspiring.

This message informs you of the few list rules subscribers abide by, and
tells you where to find out more about what Extropians talk about
and practice.

What characteristics do readers of the Extropians List have in common?
Despite a strong diversity of characters and interests, all share an
interest in overcoming human limits through science, technology,
and reason. List subscribers have an interest in some or all of the
following: 
--Life extension beyond the current genetic limit, including
   experimental approaches such as cryonic suspension; 
--the augmentation of human intelligence; 
--individualist, voluntary approaches to social and political institutions 
   (many subscribers call themselves libertarians);
--the technological extension of human perception and cognition; 
--artificial intelligence and artificial life; 
--advanced computer technology;
--rational ethics (ethics for survival and flourishing)
--nanotechnology, and other advanced and future technologies;
--the philosophical and psychological aspects and issues of
   perpetually improving our lives; and space colonization.
--the use of art to represent extropic ideas and values
--the economics of accelerating change and of the future

The unifying characteristic of these ideas and values is the drive
to increase extropy. Extropy is a measure of intelligence, information,
vitality, opportunity, and capacity for growth. Not all list subscribers
wish to apply a label to themselves, but many who share these values
and ideas call themselves Extropians. If these ideas appeal to you,
you may already be an Extropian.

We have a number of rules about how you interact with the list. Your 
continued subscription indicates your acceptance of these rules. 
We do not like rules for their own sake. The List rules are just those
we believe will keep the level of discussion high and polite. Subscribers'
time is valuable. To keep as many people active and  reading the list as
possible, we need to respect them by keeping the signal to noise
ratio as high as possible.

I suggest you read the postings for a while before you begin to post.
In that way you will have a better idea of how the list works. Also,
topics vary from week to week, and month to month; sometimes we are
very technical other times very political or philosophical.

ESPECIALLY FOR USERS OF THE LIST WHEN IT DISALLOWED FORWARDING OF POSTS: 
If you post to the Extropians List, you must anticipate that your
writing might be forwarded to another list or to particular individuals.
Postings will appear in a publicly-accessible archive at the following
URL: http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians

 1) Formal complaints and administrative requests should be sent to:

	postmaster@extropy.org

 2a) Mail to the list should be sent to:

	extropians@extropy.org

 2b) The software that processes traffic on the list alters the mail headers
 so that all correctly working mail readers will automatically address
 replies BACK to the LIST. [reply-to: extropians@extropy.org]

 2c) If you want to reply to an individual poster you should manually address
 a reply. If the post does not have a signature line, viewing the message
 in a text editor should help you determine the sender's address.

 2d) It is strongly recommend but not required that all list members use a
 signature file containing their e-mail address.

 3) Due to the volume of list traffic please restrain yourself from over-
 quoting  previous posts -- just a couple of lines to re-cap for those  who 
 weren't paying attention is usually sufficient.

 4) The list is conceived as a forum for the exchange of new information
 and techniques, and not as a forum for debating the  basics. We do have
 our disagreements -- often quite lively ones -- but rarely about really
 basic issues. Arguments in favor of socialized medicine or dying a 
 natural death at age sixty are, judging by past experience, likely to be
 refuted, and finally ignored.

 5) Traffic on this mailing list can run quite high. We like to keep the 
 signal- to-noise ratio as high as we can, so please restrain the impulse
 to post "me-too" messages or ad hominem flames to the list at large.
 If you cannot resist engaging in such discourse, please do so
 in private e-mail.

 5b) Posts about the list, or its rules, should have the pre-fix "META:"
  We encourage the use of other prefixes indicating the content of a post.
 Examples include, PHIL:, MATH:, SCI:, CHAT:, etc.

 5c) Polls being submitted to list members will have the "POLL:"
 prefix.

 5d) Rules about fighting and insulting; fighting and insulting 
 are not allowed!

 5e) If someone starts a fight with you what should you do?; we have a
 private legal code set-up to handle such disputes which includes a
 judge (the List Administrator) and an adjudicator to handle appeals.

 If someone really annoys you, you can do any of the following:
 1) Nothing - give no response
 2) Respond OFF the list
 5) Make a formal complaint to me asking for a judgment against Person X

 5f) What if you just have to respond to "up hold your honor" or to set 
 the "facts/record straight," or to tell the entire list why you
 will not be speaking or reading posts or messages from the person who
 offended you?

 D O N ' T!

 we consider such responses flames in their own right and you would
 be taking the law into your own hands; you might also be censured or
 removed from the list.

Remember:
 Don't contribute to or continue a fight once one has started.
 doing so places you in violation of the list rules. That includes 
 meta communication, which includes posts with an angry tone, or voice.

As List member Hal Finney wrote:

"Extropianism is a philosophy of life. Max More, editor of Extropy,
has identified five Extropian principles:

	- Boundless Expansion
	- Self Transformation
	- Dynamic Optimism
	- Intelligent Technology
	- Spontaneous Order

"You can see that the basic point is a belief that the
future will allow virtually unlimited expansion in the possibilities
for our own personal lives. Extropians reject limits imposed by
outsiders on what we can do and what we can become. We embrace the
future, with all of its awe-inspiring possibilities.

"The role of [these] books is to show that these aren't just idle
musings and hopes, but are well-grounded expectations about what we
are going to have to work with in the next century. Without having
read those books, such common-place Extropian ideas as immortality or
a world without governments might seem absurd.

"If you haven't read these books but want to ask questions about these
and other Extropian ideas, the problem is that the answer is usually
going to be, first read the book. You can't answer a question about
the possibility for immortality in a page or two, not in any kind of
convincing way.

"Now, after you've read some of these books, you still may not agree
that all of these ideas are practical, but at least you can discuss
them on common ground with other list members. That kind of
discussion is practical, helpful, and informative. Extropians are not
dogmatists. If there are practical problems standing in the way of
the realization of their hopes and ideals, we should be discussing
them now, so that solutions can be found.

"Of course, some people will be opposed to Extropian ideas not because
they seem impractical, but because they seem immoral. Re-read the list
of Extropian principles above. If you don't agree with them, if you
don't agree that we should attempt to break through all the limits
that constrain us today, then you probably won't benefit from
discussion with Extropians.

"The Extropian list is not meant to proselytize, to gain converts.
Most people either find the ideas instinctively attractive, or they
find them abhorrent. It's a waste of everyone's time to come on the
list and to argue that governments are really good for us and that
death is desirable. Those are the kinds of messages that lead to
serious flaming, and no one benefits from them.

"To sum up, the Extropians lists welcome members who share an interest
in the exciting, optimistic, future-oriented philosophy of
Extropianism. If you're new to these ideas, they can offer
suggestions to help you find books, authors, and other resources to
learn more about what we can and will become. If you're more
experienced, they offer discussion and feedback with a high level of
quality and responsiveness. The future is coming, and the Extropian
lists offer you a chance to get ready for the fantastic opportunities
that await us all."

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

I have two ideas that could possibly mean an afterlife from the individual's
perspective. Try to debunk these for me.

1. Taking a idea off the omega point theory where the last few seconds of
the universe seem like forever, what if people dying experience pleasure and
colors (like people dead for 24 hours) but experience this feeling for
hundreds of years from their perspective much like certain drugs and slow
down your perception of time. This would enable an afterlife in their minds.

2. Taking a idea off the many worlds theory, what if the person only dies
from our vantage pointor universe. If I am correct, every decision i make,
I'm jumping through universes. So the person could appear to have died in
our universe but from their vantage point they're still alive going on with
their life.

IAN: What is "well-thought" and "well-researched" 
can ONLY be determined by open debate. For those 
whose thoughts and research are top-notch prior 
to public review, any pretense of open debate 
is caste aside and a carefully closed forum 
is forged,  protecting their inherently 
superior knowledge from the ghastly 
defilement of unclean thoughts 
and research.

For those freed from the defilement of wrong 
thought, unbroken protection from, and ignore-
ance of, contrary knowledge is necessary to 
ensure that the fragile "true" and "pure" 
knowledge of the elite survives.

You are guilty of nothing. The extropians list is far older than the 
transhumanist list, and the two lists were started completely 
independently of one another, so there are no rules at all about which 
content is appropriate for which list.

Extropians are a kind of transhumanist, so anything of general 
transhumanist interest would be of interest to both lists. You don't have 
to feel obliged to subscribe to both lists just because you're interested 
in reading one or the other of them.

Lyle, with your short attention span I don't expect you to read this entire 
post, it is almost half a page long and no pictures, but maybe you can find 
somebody to explain the gist of it to you.

After shooting down the idea that Nanotechnology is logically inconsistent or  
would violate the laws of Quantum Mechanics or Thermodynamics or Economics,   
and after blowing out of the water the idea that it is possible but not  
important, we at last come to the core objection that almost everybody has  
about Nanotechnology, it STRONGLY violates Lyle's Law. 

Lyle's Law, which I have taken the liberty of naming for a well known member 
of the Extropian list, could be stated as follows:

  LYLE'S LAW: Whatever the future has in store for us of one thing we should   
  be certain, the universe must be constructed in such a way that the majority  
  of late 20 'th century bipeds on the third planet orbiting a small star on   
  the edge of a run of the mill galaxy will never find things odd. 

I don't claim to have rigorously disproved Lyle's Law, but you need a great 
deal of evidence before you elevate something to a law of nature. Personally  
I don't think there is enough evidence to support Lyle's Law, indeed to my  
perhaps superficial eye, there is much that points in the in the other 
direction.

As a newbie to the extropian and transhuman lists, I have to say I regret
the tone of rancor that seems to have crept into these public postings of
late.  Perhaps it's a cyclical phenomenon.  I, for one, have enjoyed and
learned from both John's and Lyle's posts, and have written privately to
both of them to say so (and to seek permission from them to include their
declared opinions in the book I'm now writing on the Singularity).  It
strikes me that Lyle keeps raising quite salient questions about the
*detailed architecture and practise* of certain canonical nano claims, but
does so in a teasing and finally annoyingly flip manner.  John (among
others) seems to respond as if Lyle's requests for detailed flow-charts are
redundant and even slightly blasphemous acts of lese majeste.

This is a shame, because we need the detail even more than the grand
speculative strokes.

To consider a recent exchange: I asked whether people in an early nano
society might be obliged to accept draconian authoritarian controls to
forestall self-obliterative use of an Unstoppable Salt Mill (you know, the
fairytale device that explains why the sea is salt - it's down under the
water even now, cranking out its ceaseless stream of salt).  The range of
responses stretched from (a) it can't happen, because nano assemblers can
only do X and even that only with great difficulty, (b) it can and probably
will but that's okay because we (we?) will be off the planet by then (by
2015?!) [and why won't the folks in the habitat or on Mars also bugger
things up with their handy assemblers?], (c) it's cool, because we (we???)
will have Transcended.  Do you see why Lyle (category a) might think he was
dealing with the Santa Claus Fan club?

On the other hand, this is not the kind of blithe response Drexler and his
colleagues offered in UNBOUNDING THE FUTURE: `Any critic declaring this to
be an optimistic book hereby stands charged with having failed to read and
understand...' [p. 259]

But Lyle's apparently odd assertion that molecular manufacturing devices
would only be able to make limited diamondoid structures rather than, say,
sarin gas, is absolutely inconsistent with everything I've read about the
projected technology.  Instead of declaring the boosters' claims `very
boring', I wish he'd given detailed analyses of why modularised,
bottom-up-bootstrapping nanomech systems are impracticable.  I suspect he
shares my hunch that orders of magnitude are being scamped when someone
easily gestures toward replication via atom-by-atom scanning, or the AI
sophistication required to do the same job top-down.  

Of course it might be that he and John and the rest of you have been down
these dialogical roads enough times already that it's only the newbie who
feels at a loss, seeing the torn rags of old battles  brandished above the
smoke...

Best to all, Damien

That reminds me of a Church-sponsored school "integrating" religion into
all subjects.  It's normally a euphemism for getting a predetermined agenda
across by distorting an educational system that would ordinarily be free
of such interference and bias.  That can produce a "university" that is on
a par with a "church" like the Church of Scientology.  Dangerous ground.

Time is always important in aesthetics (fashion).  Something maybe 
absolutely beautiful one moment, but after a while the mind 
seeks newer beauty.

It will evolve forever.  The art has an impact on the observer, 
which changes that observer and leaves them to find more.  Kinda 
like the Borg assimilating more novelty...

In the late 70s I has several brainwave biofeedback devices. They have a
number
of major defects as data input devices:

	1. Hookup to the body is clumsy and messy
	2. It takes several seconds to establish a signal
	3. Brainwave biofeedback is very difficult to learn and extremely
		sensitive to one's attentive state

I regret the rancor too. I can strongly disagree with somebody and still be 
quite found of them, but I'm only human (damn it). When somebody asks me to 
tell them exactly what is it about Nanotechnology manufacturing that makes it 
much easier to do than conventional manufacturing, and I take the time to 
respond with 6 fundamental reasons, and it is dismissed with 4 words, then 
I get mad. 
   
Drexler has shown that Nanotechnology does not violate the laws of Physics or 
Economics. I think Drexler has also shown, in a general sort of way, how to 
do it, but there are a LOT of details, neither he nor anybody else has 
provided a complete flow-chart to achieve Nanotechnology, that's asking too 
much. If we could do that we'd be in the Singularity already.

I agree entirely with Drexler's statement "Any critic declaring this to be an  
optimistic book hereby stands charged with having failed to read and 
understand". Yes, nanotechnology will bring grave (and I do mean grave) 
social problems. No, draconian authoritarian controls will not work because 
although they may be draconian and authoritarian, they will not be able to 
control the coming changes, and no, I don't know what will. I wish I did.

Well, that was supposed to be a private post cept I messed up. Don't we want
to drop the vocab to let the layman understand as well? How do we describe
the future to a person who hasn't even graduated high school? If we don't
want them to fear it, we must phrase it in language they can understand.
Memes are ineffective if the populous cannot understand the message.

No, I'm not sure.  (And I'm almost never this humble. <g>)  I agree with
your idea, but I'm also still wrestling with what a "pleasure center" is.
Isn't it at bottom an intellectual response to something physical?

What I want to understand is what these structures really do, and whether
that is ultimately a "physical" or "intellectual" function.

Don't worry, I don't take offense that easily.

OK, in my original post I was playing agent provocateur.  (I hope that's
permitted here -- I didn't see anything in the FAQ that prohibits it.)

So I agree, I would want to have both intellectual and physical existence.
But I'm still not at all convinced I would want to simulate or mimic animal
pleasures.

While evolution may have required pleasure as a response to sustenance and
sex, I would think transhumanists would want to link pleasure to learning
and creating.

Another (related) small project I'm working on is the meaning of life.  <g>
Until we can prove the universe is going to reach a steady-state and is
eternal, it seems to me we should assume that it is dying.  Therefore, the
purpose of life is to acquire the knowledge and means to prevent it from
happening.  This is one of the things that attracted me to extropianism --
most people do not seem sufficiently anxious about this, because they do
not believe immortality is possible.  The ultimate tragedy would be if
intelligent life fell just one hour short of conquering nature...

Yes, I'm sure most hedonists would not consider themselves slaves.  But it
is too easy to convince yourself you seek pleasure voluntarily.

An expected response.  But imagine you are dying of cancer and are offered
the opportunity to continue to exist solely as intellect.  Would you take
it?

A hedonist *and* an angel?  I'm impressed! <g>

I'm not convinced that loyalty and fondness are irrational.  But upon
further thought, I would concede that hedonism isn't necessarily limited to
the pursuit of physical pleasure.  But in (common) practice, it is.

OK, I'll modify my statement.  First, as an objectivist I would certainly
not renounce physical reality.  Perhaps I should say I would prefer to
exist as a combination intellect/physical unit free of mundane physical
needs and desires.

Perhaps transhumanists should program themselves to experience an intense
orgasm (or something analogous) every time they acquire important
knowledge, gain new insights, or create (or even procreate?) something of
value.

But I see no reason to preserve animal pleasures, anymore than I would
preserve animal mortality.

Fine, sounds like something worth a try, sometimes a big corporation becomes 
ossified and is driven to extinction by a small fierce competitor. Maybe your 
co-op could do that, maybe not, the market will let you know.

Politicians love business taxes because they are invisible to most consumers, 
they just lead to higher prices for everything. Corporations are robbed twice 
by government thugs, once as a business tax and then any profit that goes to 
shareholders is taxed again, both as dividends and capital gains.

The only hope these people have is to live on charity until they can learn a 
marketable skill. If most people do not feel charitable toward them then they 
are in deep trouble, but government can't help. If I am unwilling to 
voluntarily give money to these people why would I vote for a politician who
would force me to do it through taxes?

I really don't understand it, whenever somebody wants to show how evil 
corporations are, they always come up with a long list of rotten things that 
governments do. Granted, few companies actively opposed these monstrous  
regimes, but that's not quite the same thing as instigating it, and anyway  
can you really blame them for not playing the hero, in most cases it would be 
economic if not real suicide.

It would really be great if that was true, then justice could be treated like

true .

Equality is a second rate sort of virtue, you can't have too much justice or

equality.

Good heavens NO!!! I don't care for it myself but I definitely think altruism

True. I confess I was being a little glib before, but only a little. The 
truth is I engage in compassion myself, but I do so for selfish reasons, 
seeing somebody in pain makes me unhappy and if I am the cause of that pain 
then I'm even more unhappy.

If I own a steel mill worth a billion dollars, that does not take money from 
poor people, just the reverse, it produces a product that people want and 
jobs that people need. I will be able to keep my steel mill only as long as I 
can run it as well or better than anyone else.  The day somebody finds a way 
to operate a mill significantly better than I do is the day I go broke,  
unless I learn real fast and copy his technique. Having a public mob run the 
mill will produce little wealth for anyone.

Then it is in a corporation's best interest to expand its market and make as

Yes, I think the rulers of governments should do that, but it doesn't matter 
a bit what you or I think, our masters will do what they want to do. The 
reason the free market sometimes looks  bad in debates like this is that 
people are comparing the market as it actually is, warts and all, with a 
mythical government lead by a man who always knows exactly what the right  
thing to do is, always has the moral courage to do it, and can convince those 
less wonderful than he is that it is indeed the correct path to take. A man 
like that never existed and never will, yet people keep thinking if we  can 
just elect the right man everything will be fine.

It doesn't matter how much it takes to feed you, it doesn't  matter how big 
your family is, if your services are only worth 75 cents an hour to me then 
that's all I would pay for them, unless I was giving charity. Don't 
misunderstand, that might be  exactly what I decide to do, but I don't want 
to  be forced and it shouldn't be confused for a salary.

If people think what is on this network is valuable then people will watch it, 
even pay for it. If people think it is worthless then I see no reason it 
should be subsidized, that would just result in a huge network that nobody 
watches, or should watch because it's junk.

Costs a lot? AOL charges 10$ a month and you can communicate with the world, 
if anyone wants to listen.  The real reason that  people aren't demanding to  
read  Mr. Joe Average's home page is the same reason public access television  
is so dull, Mr. Joe Average has nothing worthwhile to say. You may not be  
average but superior, if so then people will read your Web page, and nobody  
can tell how much money you have only how much talent you have.

Lyle, with your short attention span I don't expect you to read this entire 
post, it is almost half a page long and no pictures, but maybe you can find 
somebody to explain the gist of it to you.

After shooting down the idea that Nanotechnology is logically inconsistent or  
would violate the laws of Quantum Mechanics or Thermodynamics or Economics,   
and after blowing out of the water the idea that it is possible but not  
important, we at last come to the core objection that almost everybody has  
about Nanotechnology, it STRONGLY violates Lyle's Law. 

Lyle's Law, which I have taken the liberty of naming for a well known member 
of the Extropian list, could be stated as follows:

  LYLE'S LAW: Whatever the future has in store for us of one thing we should   
  be certain, the universe must be constructed in such a way that the majority  
  of late 20 'th century bipeds on the third planet orbiting a small star on   
  the edge of a run of the mill galaxy will never find things odd. 

I don't claim to have rigorously disproved Lyle's Law, but you need a great 
deal of evidence before you elevate something to a law of nature. Personally  
I don't think there is enough evidence to support Lyle's Law, indeed to my  
perhaps superficial eye, there is much that points in the in the other 
direction.

Heh, heh, I had a good chuckle at that, well put, John.  It's nothing new
in the world at large of course, as an inability to accept alternative
futures appears to be endemic in the majority of the population, and it's
more sad than funny.  In contrast, it's quite hilarious to find a few here
wearing their blinkers firmly in place and proudly proclaiming the Earth
to be flat.  They're committing the only real crime possible in futurism,
the denial of future possibility on the grounds of past precedent.  Your
cutting humour is a very mild punishment ... :-)

Perhaps this issue deserves highlighting a little more strongly within
transhumanist circles.  I think of it as "Memetic Inertia", a force which
acts as a brake on the rate of change in meme space.  It shares a niche
with Neo-Luddite Activism, although it's not the same thing:  NLA is an
active resistance to change on principle, whereas MI is passive and based
not on principle but on a cognitive inability to accept that the world is
in flux and that today's engineering was yesterday's science fiction.

It applies not only to engineering but to economics and other affairs:  the
sharp discontinuities in economics and politics and society that the world
experienced over the last hundred years or so (eg. when the motor vehicle
wiped out the horse-based economy) are lessons from which one should learn
that "fixed points" are not fixed at all, and that discontinuities should
be expected regularly.  The foundations of our cherished economic system
are wobbly at best, Black Wednesdays being almost an institution.  In that
light, a fixation with continuity in economics even when faced with the
arrival of nanoscale control of materials indicates a total inability to
comprehend the extent of the impact, memetic inertia of the first order.

I think it was suitable that you gave this episode a humorous turn, John.
Reasoned argument was clearly getting nowhere.

Can someone point me in the direction of the ORIGINAL source of a 
certain concept regarding "bandwidth" and the human function of 
copulation?  I have been told that it originated with an Extropian.

In it's most recent incarnation it was inflicted upon me as a pickup 
line, which leads me to believe that the author's original idea is 
being misused.  (Given my visceral response, I sincerely hope 
that it is a distortion of the idea.)

Sin,

Does "conspiracy theory" serve the purpose ?

Know what I'm sayin' ( hint hint, nudge nudge )

Does "conspiracy theory" serve " THE PURPOSE " ?

GASP!  Perish, nay,  BANISH  that thought ....

Hmmm, say, who's running this place anyways?

 Now there's a thought 'r two  ;^)


NOW HERE'S AN ANSWER 'IN IT BE TRUE:

I THINK Conspiracy theory does serve THE
PURPOSE and that is to break apart collusions, &
THIS IS a logical feature of a " multiplex-identity-field "
THAT Is NOT directed by any one person or group of personS

TRY THough as they might: the invisible hand always  WINS

THE INVIsible hand is
THE INVIsible conspiracy &
THE INVIsible conspiracy is
THE INVINCIBLE CONSPIRACY !!!

THE INVISIBLE HAND ALWAYS WINS

ALAS, it has       ALREADY WON 

FOR The invisible hand IS THE WHOLE 
                       IS THE BIG PICTURE &
 
THE WHOLE is one -- from beginin' till DONE: ONE



CONSPIRACY THEORY IS
SPONTANEOUS ANTI-TRUST REGULATION 

SO CONSPIRACY Theories --- I'mean every one YA GOT
they're all part of the grand, no, the master PLOT

    And as such, it's quite CLEAR TO SEE 

 CONSPIRACY Theories are HEALTHY for YOU

Yes -- I often use a microcomputer with only a 14.4 Kb modem, so if I check
in and a hundred or so messages are waiting, it's a pain. Maybe I'll just
have to opt out until I get a better link.

Your informant must have been thinking about an article that appeared in the
so-called "forbidden" issue of Extropy:  "Sexual Information," 3 EXTROPY 22
(Spring 1989).  The author (the name of whom I can't quite place!) says:

"[O]rgasms are so great . . . because they correlate with the exchange of
genetic information. As it turns out, we like sex (with or without orgasms)
for much the same reason. Sex is so great because it allows us to communicate
so much information."

And further:

"Why should we enjoy information so much? Just as we've been naturally
selected to enjoy the exchange of genetic information, so too have we been
naturally selected to enjoy the exchange of information in general. The more
we learn about the world around us, and the more we share what we learn with
those we live with, the more likely we are to survive.  Our desire for sexual
information manifests a more universal trait: the desire to exchange
information of all sorts.  Sex is special, of course -- it offers us
especially rich inputs and outputs. That's exactly why sex is so great."

Yes, I think and feel that it would be very desirable. Although I see no 
reason to discard the old pleasures, just to remove the imperative drives 
to them (as a Jupiter-brain I might feel pleasure when I optimize my 
internal networks, but optimization isn't one of my primary drives).

A good meme. It reminds me of my explanation of the Omega Point theory: 
giving the universe a happy ending ("And they lived happily ever after...").

This doesn't appear possible at all, since we know quite well how the EEG
activity of dying and dead people look, and it dosn't speed up like it
would have to in this scenario. I think even those time-affecting drugs
(anybody have some information about reliable subjective-time influencing
effects?) doesn't change the speed of neural signals much, although
noradrenaline increases the firing frequency slightly.

Yes, this is one of the more bizarre consequences of the MWI. Of course, 
you could have been born in a cul de sac in reality, where *all* 
physically realizable timelines end in death, but I find this unlikely 
(after all, from a QM perspective it is quite possible that you would 
randomly be teleported away from Earth just as the sun went nova or 
something similar, and that would be enough to guarantee your survival in 
your worldline).

I think it can be created now, from a technical standpoint. But it might 
be harder to do something truly artistic with it. 

One idea I have toyed with is to link a viewer (or preferably many 
viewers) to the system with EEG, and show pictures generated using 
genetic algorithms to them. Pictures that produce much alpha-waves 
reproduce better and mutate, hopefully leading to pictures that are 
relaxing and interesting (one could of course look at many applications, 
including stimulating or truly awful pictures).

Attractiveness is subjective and probably changes from second to second - 
right now I would not be very interested in a gourmet dish (I've got a 
cold) which I otherwise would have savored. In the same way, one could 
probably produce something that was close to optimum in delight only if 
one could monitor exactly what the viewer found delightful in realtime, 
and that is hard. My guess is that it is possible to get close, but then 
the art object would move into a strange attractor. 

> And if there is a hard limit what would be it's reaction

Reminds me of Tipler's rather silly calculation of the psychological
impact of the ideal partner in (the omega-created) paradise. This partner
would be the global optimum of all partners, and would have around 100,000
times more impact than the most beautiful *existing* person in the world.
Tipler dryly points out that our nervous system probably won't take such
beauty and charm, but we would of course be able to extend it to handle
such rapture...

Nice idea, but remember that the surface of the Earth isn't hard at all - 
our whole planet is almost liquid. My guess is that you cannot support 
them at all if the forces become too large, and beside the ground is 
constantly moving. My suggestion is to use the centrifugal force, and 
anchor asteroids in diamondoid beanstalks at the equator to hold up the 
shell.

My suggestion is that you build a ring of solar collectors orbiting the 
Earth instead, which beam down microwave power - less physical strain 
(the fins would have to deal with gravity), and they can be extended 
indefinitely.

I don't think we can create any material that can withstand the kinetic
energy of even a small asteroid - a few megatons of regolith moving at
several kilometers per second will vaporize diamond just as well as water.
Probes are a better system, and an even safer solution would be to go out
and put ion enginers + solar cells on all dangerous asteroids to put them
in safe orbits.

Actually, this might be a problem. The heat balance of the Earth is 
rather sensitive, and we should be careful not to accidentally push it to 
close to a runaway greenhouse effect that would turn it to a new Venus.

A beautiful idea. But I think it would be much, much easier to build a 
Dyson shell instead - many freely orbiting shells instead of one 
Earth-onion. The only big advantage I can see with the onion is that you 
get gravity for free - but that makes the engineering much harder (not to 
mention the risks for a disastrous accident - "Australia crashes, film 
at 11").

Yes, the amount of gravity at a point inside a spherical mass only 
depends on the mass inside the point. It might be worth noting that the 
overall density of the Earth would become lower as the shells were built, 
so 1G fans would have to move outwards.

Well, the trouble is that to a neutron-star intelligence, one second would
be a very, very long time. So even if it could get to other places very
quickly from our perspective, it would take forever in the view of the
being. Would you go somewhere if the journey took a few billion years, 
even if you were immortal? 

Another reason they would not want to rush around is the fact that you
cannot extend a neutron star indefinitely, beyond a certain mass it will
become a black hole (which might be a way to take a short-cut to the Omega
Point if you know what you are doing, or just a very unusual way of
suicide). You can cheat this by using energy to keep the star stable and
extending it (not unlike the onion scenario above, but this time at
nuclear densities and with extremely high energies), but the demands seem
to go up very steeply. My guess is that the really big intelligences have
to guzzle energy so fast that they cannot move, and are surrounded by huge
instalations to support them. 

I like this kind of speculation.

In physics, we have descriptions of experience, often abstracted through
the use of measuring instruments. Nobody knows what electromagnetism IS,
however we have very accurate descriptions of how to measure and predict
electromagnetic phenomena. 

The point here is that all science ultimately derives from experience,
and of Chalmer's "easy questions" also ultimately derive from
experience. This rapidly degenerates into tautology, because if
conscious experience is irreducible, we get that all descriptions are
irreducible.

One can go another way, ie, all describable experience can be described
reductively, and now the paradox is saying that the experiences
themselves are irreducible and not so describable. So, tautology or
contradiction....

Yes, and Chalmers seems to forget that recovery of feelings and emotion
and "sense of experiencing" are all memory based.

I think that in terms of social communication and acting together for
mutual survival that these epistemological models have a lot of utility.
The notions of "I", "myself", "my experience" and the "you" counterparts
of same are at the essential core of our intercommunications.

> Can we usefully talk about patterns of thought being independent of the
> hardware/wetware on which they're processed (as Moravec has suggested?)

No! Information always requires context, the hardware within which it is
realised which can make use of same. However the illusion is pervasive
and here's why:

  Start with the notion of self awareness. This is a loop stating
  that "I exist". Once this forms (around age 3) all experiences are
  encoded with the presence of this loop. That is, "I was there" comes
  with all remembered experiences. (There are some exceptions, in
  which one's sense of self vanishes, but I don't recall anyone being
  able to relate these experiences beyond a statement of ecstatic flow
  at the time, and nothing in terms of actual content. Good sex, for
  example.)

  Then, in reflection, the question of "what is common to ALL of my
  experiences" come up. Given the variety of experiences, including
  dreams, etc., there is only one thing common to all experiences,
  the sense of "I exist".

  Therefore, the sense of "I exist" is experienced as the essence of all
  personal experience. The sense of "Experience Exists" is the essence
of
  all remembered experiences inclusively. 

  At this point some striking resemblences to religious and mystical
  experiences come forth:

  - The sense of "I exist" is common to ALL personal experiences, ergo
    Soul Exists - being another name for this common aspect to
    all personal experiences.

  - Ths sense of "Experience Exists" is common to all experience, ergo
    Spirit Exists, God Exists - the Hindus call these Atman and
    Brahman respectively.

  Now, by some means, crank up the endorphin/hormonal/neuroexcitatory
  system which indicates the subjective "This is REAL" to a really
  high level, and Soul and Spirit become the Ultimate In Reality.
  Combine this with one's desire to not die (for non cryonicists) and
  the need for emotional assurance, and enjoy the rebirth of vitalism.
  Socialize it and here's religion.

  If Soul and Spirit are the Ultimate Reality, most of the spiritual
  literature become obviously logical conclusions based on this
assumption.

> Are our subjective experiences objective at some level as David Musick
> has suggested (9/27/96)?
> 
Once I have the upload or neuro-interface, the bit patterns which
represent these experiences can now be moved out of my skull into other
media, and loaded into other's minds. (I gloss over the details, just
as  nsnotechnologists do....) At the present moment, the various media
language, video, etc) do communicate some of this. The best
entertainment and arts do so quite well, sans verification. 

If I have a sensor for each neuron (possibly only when uploaded) then my
state can be captured and examined at leisure. This data is data, just
as any objective scientific data is objective. So, yes.

OK...
 
Chalmers points out that the main problem with Quantum Mechanics is the
interpretation of events. The wave functions describe the liklihood of
events with great precision (the best known in some cases) but do not
state what happens when an Event is noticed. Yet we experience Events,
therefore our experience is somehow beyond QM...

I won't get into how Chalmers sees Emmet. However I will describe an
alternative point of view:

  If we view the universe as a kind of giant Feynman diagram, (and
  ignore the dilemmas of renormalization and virtual particles) and
  assume that there are a finite number of particles, and a finite
  number of possible interactions, then the state of the universe can
  be described as an integer. (Said integer can be described as a list
  of properties concatenated into a string of digits. (shades of Godel!)
  Each property set describes a single particle. Each particle can be
  described reasonable concisely, by a few thousand bits (particle
quantum
  state, position, momentum)

  Each quantum Event converts one of the numbers into another. Again
  taking a leaf from Godel, said conversions consist of a series of
  elementary arithmetic operations applied to one of these numbers.
  (BTW, not all possible integers represent possible states of the
  universe...) All QM rules of transition can be described as series
  of elementary arithmetic operations. (This is easily envisioned by
  creating short algorithms for such things as:

  - derive the substring for an individual particle
  - convert interacting particle substrings into other
    particle substrings by QM rules
  - replace the original particle substrings with the
    new substrings )

  Now, consider the set of all integers. Some of these will represent
  Universe State Strings (USS's). By the rules of QM, each USS can be
  converted to another USS. If we confine ourselves to one Feynman
  interaction per conversion, then each USS can convert to a finite
  number of other USS's, but no USS can convert in a single interaction
  into all of the other USS's. One way to visualise this is to imagine
  a line or grid of dots representing the integers (like a bingo card
  at the back of a trade magazine). The integers which represent
  possible USS's are marked in some way (say red dots). Each red dot
  has lines running to other USS's, each line representing an allowed
  QM interaction. Note that each red dot also has INCOMING lines,
  representing the set of possible ancestor USS's.

  Penrose describes some of this in his book the "Emperor's New Mind".
	
  One point to notice here is that every state of the Universe comes
from
  a large and finite number of possible past states, that there is NO
  single past.

  Another point to notice is that preserving physical memory implies
that
  some of the particle states are not changed, which limits the number
  of possible memory preserving transformations. Ie, we come from many
  possible pasts and it is not possible to know which ones. Memory
limits
  the possibilities both ways. This creates outrageous conclusions,
  which I use in my shamanic work:

    Miracles require absolute forgetfulness.

  and,

    Time is based entirely on memory.

  A look at chaos theory brings up some conjectures re the set of all
  USS's:

  - What do the attractors look like?
  - Black Holes are powerful attractors, and Hawking is
    wrong; Black Holes do absolutely destroy
    information.
  - Are there completely connected and independent networks
    of USS's?? Ie, many separated universes which have
    no way to transform into one another?

And, to wrap this bit up, since consciousness IMHO is based on the self
remberance of experience, only a tiny subset of connected USS's will
have the property of consciousness....

Enjoy....

Can someone point me in the direction of the ORIGINAL source of a 
certain concept regarding "bandwidth" and the human function of 
copulation?  I have been told that it originated with an Extropian.

In it's most recent incarnation it was inflicted upon me as a pickup 
line, which leads me to believe that the author's original idea is 
being misused.  (Given my visceral response, I sincerely hope 
that it is a distortion of the idea.)

Hello fellow extropians, I am a student at the Marquette 
University in Milwaukee in engineering, but I very interested 
in the feild of nanotechnology, although it will likely be 10 
years before there are real jobs in nanotech.

I was recently in the library surfing the net and I came 
across a short paper (somewhere on the web, but i forgot to 
write down the http) which was discussing Quinn's test of 
nanotechnology. 

Does anyone have any information about this? Quinn's test was 
a simply way to evaluate if nanotechnology has come of age at 
any point in the future. 

If anyone knows anything about Quinn's test, please let me 
know.

Also, does anyone know anything about brush robots from the 
book Mind Children by Moravec? 

Thanks,

Molly

Each time beauty evolves, the perspective of beauty evolves.  Each nuance -
each awareness of and sensibility to an 'object of beauty' in turn alerts
another perspective.

No hard limits.  No hard limits on how far creativity can be experienced.
No hard limits on how much imagination can be developed.

I don't know. When we discussed this, one participant said it was the in
his opinion most realistic scenario, while the present economist said he
found it less likely than the other scenarios. 

There are forces that can brake this kind of breakdown, like the
deliberate delays placed in international stock market systems and the
fact that sometimes governments and corporations do reasonable things (an
almost heretical view on this list? :-) - humans are inventive, and
surprisingly able to find ways to handle many situations. 

We have to admit to ourselves that many of the grand visions we have 
actually assume a lot of things about continued economical, technological 
and social growth - of which we cannot be sure. So we have to find ways 
to get around problems, or direct the changes in a positive direction the 
sooner the better.

Are we here to promote the spread of the memes or just sit on our asses
discussing it? I see many extropians wanting to keep the list isolated. Sure
it's completely normal for the signal to noise ratio to change with the
incoming newbies! Maybe I'm missing something here? We *DO* want these
technologies to be our future as fast as possible or do we wish them to be
merely idle fantasies of our minds? Also we *MUST* vary our topics! We keep
discussing AI, Nano, and uploading constantly! I'm actually beginning to
believe the ravings of Mark Plus that extropians keep discussing the same
topics without making any such progress. I would *VERY MUCH* like to see
what is being worked on in a hands-on manner. There *MUST* be other topics
other than the onces discussed frequently. For example telepresence, global
climate control, new space tech such as the roton and methods for FTL
travel. There are literally *HUNDREDS* of topics on Anders page and we
concentrate on 5-10% of them? Sure the big three extropian topics are the
most important but we *NEED* variety. One of the best methods for new
inspiration is to focus on another topic and work on that and then return to
the first topic with a entirely new burst of inspiration. By focusing on the
same topic, we make little bouts of progress and rather stagnate in our own
idea pool.

Actually, there doesn't seem to be any real pleasure centers in the 
brain. In the 50's (?) researchers experimented with rats having 
electrodes implanted in various parts of the brain, and found that in 
some areas the rats would do anything to get stimulance. This led to the 
theory that there were "pleasure centers", invoking nightmarish visions 
of electrical addiction (Niven's "tasp"). But later implants in humans (I 
think doctor Robert Heath and Jose Delgado were the pioneers here - 
anybody who knows what they do now?) turned out a bit differently. There 
were some ares where they felt pleasant stimuli, but no electronic 
orgasms. However, it became clear that the relevant areas were rather 
motivation systems - in some sense motivation is deeper than 
pleasure/pain, although they are often hard to distinguish.

Is there really a difference? In some sense our intellectual functions 
are physical too.

As far as I know, the structures to look at is in the limbic system and in
the brainstem, especialy the dopaminergic system that reaches into the
limbic system and the cortex.  Especially important is the nucleus
accumbens, which appears to be the central relay point (all
psychologically addicting seem to drugs stimulate this nucleus), and the
mesolimbic nerve bundles reaching the frontal cortex which link our
actions and cognition with pleasure/motivation - if they are severed
nothing seems to have any special meaning, and if they are weakened the
person needs stronger stimuli to "feel alive". 

This is an exciting area, which I unfortunately haven't had the 
opportunity to study well enough.

        Uh oh.  Rational pessemism vs. rational optimism.  First of all, out
of curiosity, why are you searching for 'the meaning of life'?  I'm sure
that some people could find the pursuit itself to be hedonistic.  What is
the reasoning behind the pursuit?  Anyway, enough of that.

        I have two slightly contrasting views on what 'the meaning of life'
is.  On one hand, the meaning of life could be different for each person.
Who's to say that 'the meaning of life' is the same for everyone?  My other
theory is the one I agree with completely: the meaning of life is life.  See
how simple that is?  So simple that I think most people don't even consider
it.  The fact that I am living is so much more powerful than not living.  I
love life.  I would hate to die.  I am alive, and I am writing this; if I
was dead, I would not be writing this.  I am alive, and I can see a
multitude of color; if I was dead, I would see no color.  I am alive, and I
can look deeply into the eyes of someone I love; I could not do that if I
was dead.  The exquisite beauty of everything I see around me, from the most
beautiful starscape to the most base gum wrapper, is so much more than not
being able to see that.  This is not hedonism --a hedonist does everything
solely for pleasure-- this is life.  Finding pleasure *within* life.

        As for your view of assuming that the universe is dying, I can't say
much.  I merely disagree.  I'd rather assume that the universe has no end
until it's before my very eyes.  I can't *prove* that the universe is
omnipotent, but in the same effect, no-one has yet been able to *prove* that
it's not.  If you find proof, please let me know!  :-)

Quite so.  I suggest we go back a couple of steps and see if this impasse
can be broken.

But is this true?  If true, is it (comparatively) easy?  Good ole Drexler et
al [hi, Al!] make the following interesting and, I think, key point:

`If a car were assembled from normal-sized robots from a thousand pieces,
each piece having been assembled by smaller robots from a thousand smaller
pieces [...] then only ten levels of assembly process would separate cars
from molecules.' (UNBOUNDING THE FUTURE, 1991, p. 66)

In broad terms:

`Molecular assemblers build blocks that go to block assemblers [which] build
computers, which go to system assemblers, which build systems, which-- at
least one path from molecules to large products seems clear enough.'  (ibid)

This is the Leggo model of nanomanufacture.  It implies that sarin gas,
automobiles and raw (or cooked) steaks can be compiled in a ten-deep
hierarchy of gluing one atom (or molecule, or large chunk) onto another by
following a template.  

Compare this with living replicators (the single existence proof available).
Genetic algorithms in planetary numbers lurch about for billions of years,
replicating and mutating and being winnowed via their expressed phenotypic
success, and at last accumulate/represent a humungous quantity of
compressed, schematic information.  They do *not*, one must remark, entirely
*embody* it.  That sketchy information gets unpacked via (1) a rich
information-dense environment (so that a string of amino acids folds up
spontaneously into a protein whose effectivity depends precisely on the new
`emergent' folded surface) and (2) a sequence of `darwinian' selection
processes at higher and higher hierarchical (`holonic') levels.  

Remember, a one-cell human embryo uses on the order of a mere 100,000 genes
to kick-start a critter which ends up with trillions of dedicated cells.  It
does so by using compression tricks: modularity (those trillions comprise
variants of just 256 distinct types of human cell), segmentation,
chemo-gradients, etc.  While it's possible that Kauffman spontaneous
ordering principles also restrict and potentiate the permissible outcomes,
we don't yet have a clue (as far as I know) what the nano equivalents of
those rules would be.

J-P Changeux, Gerald Edelman and William Calvin, e.g., provide plausible
accounts of how the brain wires itself in such a stochastic fashion,
*without needing precise wiring diagrams* in the DNA recipe.  Even so, it
takes 20 years to build and program a natural human-level intelligence, even
though all the elements are being assembled by nanofabricators as fast as
they can manage it.  (And don't forget, all the cultural information that
has modulated our innate grammar templates is stored in extended semiotic
systems of immense complexity far surpassing anything the Human Genome
Project is going to hold in its completed files.)

Now we are told that contrived nanosystems will bypass all this
thud-and-blunder darwinian nonsense and cut straight to the chase.  Instead
of mastering the huge number of coding steps used to specify and debug a
complex object, we might simply (`simply') scan the object at the atomic
level, file the 3D co-ordinates of each atom or molecule, and then have that
instruction set run through a zillion teeny nano assemblers, which will
allocate and time-share the job of first making smallest components, then
joining them into next-biggest chunks, and up the 10 steps to a gleaming,
atomically-precise Consumer Thing!

How many atoms was that again?  

How much memory do you have in your hard drive?  (Is that a stupid and
out-dated question, given that the process is massively paralleled, its data
stored in a zillion independent - but inter-communicating - nano jobbies?
Oh, your scanners are using compression tricks too?  See below...)

John, I think this little excursion shows how much is begged by positing
bravely: `if you have a good description of an object'.  

A more detailed examination of this issue would need to look at, e.g., Jack
Cohen and Ian Stewart's treatment of emergent attractors in dynamical
systems, real-world hierarchies regarded as Tangled Strange Loops (borrowing
from Douglas Hofstadter) rather than being arranged neatly as simple
step-after-step stairways.  They observe: `Reductionism holds that the
high-level structure is a logical consequence of the low-level rules, and we
have no wish to dispute this...  [But for *understanding* we] have to be
able to follow the chain of deduction.  If that chain becomes too long, our
brains lose track of the explanation, and then it ceases to be one.  But
this is how emergent phenomena emerge'  (THE COLLAPSE OF CHAOS, Penguin,
1995, p. 438).  True, they are making an epistemological and not an
engineering point, but it has practical implications for anyone hoping to
emulate hypercomplex systems from the molecule up, via explicit nano
procedures.  

I'm inclined to think we'll get interesting results faster through massively
parallel darwinian simulations in digital configuration space (CAs and GAs),
or through superposed Deutsch quantum computations, or even via
artfully-coded DNA computations in a meaty broth (a process that's already
been used to bust fancy encryption schemes).  The link from impossibly
complex algorithms generated by such means, and nano fabrication, will very
quickly escape our understanding, and as a result we will be obliged to
depend for reliable results (and our safety!) upon iterated trial & error
within impeccable confinement protocols, perhaps overseen by enhanced AI or
AI-augmented human watchdogs.  None of this suggests Civilisation Made
Simple By Scan-And-Follow-The-Dots Nano.

John went on:

> Exactly what is it about Nanotechnology  that is so different from
conventional manufacturing...?

Assuming you can use them without a sublimely complex scanning & assembly

memory to write it to.

Sorry, I find this confused.  By the time we're at level 3 or 4, we are back
to lots of different specialised sub-units, on Drexler's own account.  Am I
missing something here?

A scanned and reassembled steak is a steak.  On the other hand, to take
optimum advantage of nano fabrication requires that we *won't* be using a
scanning protocol, since a faithfully atom-by-atom scanned car will have all
the drawbacks of its original.  And if you mean to build a new, improved car
from the atom up, *you will need the kinds of intelligent, costly
programming that Lyle insists upon.*  I don't see how this can be avoided,
except by waving the Magic SuperIntelligent Handy Obedient AI Genie wand.
This might come true, as we go into the Singularity, but like some other
(partial) skeptics I wonder if it's not akin to the wistful dream a bunny
rabbit has of the way >Rabbits will provide all their food and comforts for
them.  That's true, they do, until the >Rabbits turn up one day with a

By the time we've chunked up the 10 steps, `identical' parts might have
diverged again, especially if they're put together by anything resembling
chemo-gradient-guided self-assembly.  (This is just an intuition on my part;
I hope I'm wrong.)

Again, if you can specify adequately at the digital level, well and good.
How many bytes was that, did you say?  (But this is certainly a point in
favor of building from the lowest level up, if we can.)

Of course you can copy a molecular *Leggo* but it's the monster algorithm
for connecting them into a car that's exactly what is at stake.

I apologise for the vast length of this post, but I think the topic requires
exceptional care (and even this much blather is just blundering on the
outskirts).

Please, folks, tell me why I'm wrong...

Best to all, Damien

been used to bust fancy encryption schemes).  The link from impossibly
complex algorithms generated by such means, and nano fabrication, will very
quickly escape our understanding, and as a result we will be obliged to
depend for reliable results (and our safety!) upon iterated trial & error
within impeccable confinement protocols, perhaps overseen by enhanced AI or
AI-augmented human watchdogs.  None of this suggests Civilisation Made
Simple By Scan-And-Follow-The-Dots Nano.

Assuming you can use them without a sublimely complex scanning & assembly

Sorry, I find this confused.  By the time we're at level 3 or 4, we are back
to lots of different specialised sub-units, on Drexler's own account.  Am I
missing something here?

A scanned and reassembled steak is a steak.  On the other hand, to take
optimum advantage of nano fabrication requires that we *won't* be using a
scanning protocol, since a faithfully atom-by-atom scanned car will have all
the drawbacks of its original.  And if you mean to build a new, improved car
from the atom up, *you will need the kinds of intelligent, costly
programming that Lyle insists upon.*  I don't see how this can be avoided,
except by waving the Magic SuperIntelligent Handy Obedient AI Genie wand.
This might come true, as we go into the Singularity, but like some other
(partial) skeptics I wonder if it's not akin to the wistful dream a bunny
rabbit has of the way >Rabbits will provide all their food and comforts for
them.  That's true, they do, until the >Rabbits turn up one day with a
cylinder of unfriendly calcivirus.
                  
>4) None of the parts the factory uses are absolutely identical. [...]

By the time we've chunked up the 10 steps, `identical' parts might have
diverged again, especially if they're put together by anything resembling
chemo-gradient-guided self-assembly.  (This is just an intuition on my part;
I hope I'm wrong.)

Again, if you can specify adequately at the digital level, well and good.
How many bytes was that, did you say?  (But this is certainly a point in
favor of building from the lowest level up, if we can.)

Of course you can copy a molecular *Leggo* but it's the monster algorithm
for connecting them into a car that's exactly what is at stake.

I apologise for the vast length of this post, but I think the topic requires
exceptional care (and even this much blather is just blundering on the
outskirts).

Please, folks, tell me why I'm wrong...

Your first view interprets the word "meaning" as entirely subjective, which
is certainly not what I intended.  What I'm trying to get at is whether
there is more to "the meaning of life" thah just a collection of various
people's opinions.  Can we come up with some objective purpose(s)?

Your second view strikes me as meaningless.  In essence, you are saying
existence is all the justification you need in defining your goals.

Is there a third view?  Does anyone here think there is a "purpose" to life
that does not require the existence of a creator/god/punisher?

It seems to me that extropianism *does* assume a purpose.  That purpose is
intellectual and technological progress.  Perhaps you can claim that is all
still very subjective, but I think it isn't -- we just haven't yet
discovered (or at least articulated) the objective part.  Perhaps we need
to learn more about ourselves and the universe before we can do that.

What goes up must come down.  I say "Forward and Outward!"

A treasure trove of entertaining, accessible short articles by physicist
John G. Cramer on various hard science topics (usually with a speculative
spin) is now available at

http://www.npl.washington.edu/AV/av_index_sub.html

Cramer is best known as the creator of the transactional model of quantum
theory, which John Gribbin recently tipped as his bet for best current QT
model. (I like it because it ties past, present and future together in a
vast web of handshaking, a sort of spacetime geodesic dome...)

An early essay (1989) reports on the first Nano conference, and is spot-on.

Good reading, folks!

Damien

Personally I am much more interested in getting deep enough into some
topic to actually make some new intellectual progress, rather than
briefly touching on hundreds of topics (workshop vs. party mode).  We
still don't understand very much about the favorite topics, and they
are well worth getting right.  They are hardly played-out territory.

But then I am more of an academic, who doesn't think you really
understand a topic until you can make original contributions to it,
and who doesn't think you've made a contribution until it can stand up
to detailed criticism.  Of course you don't have to share my
preferences, but then neither do I have to share yours.

This is probably one of my personally most despised memes. It is of VERY

        Here I get to use one of my favorite sayings: 'infinite
possiblities, but only one truth.'  The amalgam of various peoples' opinions
is truly one thing: self purpose.  That, I think, is as objective as you can
get.

>Your second view strikes me as meaningless.  In essence, you are saying

        Not existance...life.  Huge difference.  While most people exist,
and ponder on (no offense...example only) 'the meaning of life', others
enjoy their life for what it is worth.  They enjoy the fact that they can
create their own destiny.  

>Is there a third view?  Does anyone here think there is a "purpose" to life
>that does not require the existence of a creator/god/punisher?

        I don't want to dwell on this --I believe that everyone has a right
to their opinion-- but I cannot see how someone can live their life
following someone\something they have not seen, heard or met.  To answer
your question:
yes, I do believe that there is a purpose to life that doesn't need some
deus or 'higher force' to control.  My decisions and my pursuits (me being
an atheist and all) are in no way hindered by the fact that I do not believe
in a conventional 'God' or 'higher force'.  Is it not me who creates my purpose?
I agree with extropian views because *I choose* to agree with them, not
because I am a marionette of a god.  I am an artist...my work is not only
poetry and music, but self-creation.  Is that not a purpose?

First of all I want to say that Damien Broderick's well written post on Oct 8  
was a joy to read and respond to. I don't think Damien is correct about his 
skepticism of Nanotechnology, but he certainly shows us how to argue  
intelligently and forcefully and yet remain civilized. I think we should all  
follow his example, including me.   
                  

                >Damien quoting Drexler: `If a car were assembled from                
                >normal-sized robots from a thousand pieces, each piece having                 
                >been assembled by smaller robots from a thousand smaller             
                >pieces [...] then only ten levels of assembly process would

                > p. 66)
                  

I re-read that passage in Drexler's popular book, it seems to me that he was 
trying to demonstrate to the general reader how small an atom was  and how 
many it would take to build a car, about 10^30. He was also  trying to 
demonstrate that even this huge number is not out of reach if you have 
command of exponential processes, and with Nanotechnology you would with self 
replication. In his example you can tackle that number in just 10 steps  
(1000^10 = 10^30). I don't think Drexler was trying to suggest that the best 
way to build a car was to do it in stages, each using 1000 parts until you  
get to atoms at stage 10.

On page 60 of "Engines of Creation" he talks about building (growing?) a 
rocket engine in one step using general purpose assemblers. You place a 
"seed" nanocomputer that has the complete plans for the engine in the center 
of a tank. The tank is filled with a fluid full of assemblers. The seed 
nanocomputer has places on the outside of it for assemblers in the fluid to
stick to it, the seed sends instructions to the assemblers connected to it, 
telling those machines  what their position is in relation to the seed, and 
telling them how many other assemblers they should snag, and what their 
position must be, and what instructions to send them.  The chain keeps 
growing and soon an assembler scaffolding for the entire rocket engine is in 
place, with each assembler knowing its position relative to the seed.  
Now it's time to begin  manufacturing. Drain the tank of its fluid full of 
excess assemblers and pour in a new fluid that has chemical fuel (food) for 
the assemblers and raw materials, mostly carbon, for the construction. 
A few hours later your rocket engine is finished.

On the other hand, if you needed a huge number of rocket engines very quickly 
you might not want to rely entirely on general purpose assemblers and make 
everything in one step. Some parts, like carbon fibers, would be used in 
almost all the things you would want to make, so it would be more efficient 
to make them with special purpose assemblers rather than use the more 
flexible but slower  general assemblers. Also, because you'd need to do it a 
lot It would also be helpful to have a specialized tool to stretch the sleeve 
of a bearing so you can fit it over a shaft. Drexler talks about mass 
producing modular building blocks that you use frequently, like identical 
CPU's and memory arrays. Most of these blocks would be less than 10 
nanometers but a few could be as large as 1000  nanometers (10^-6 meters), 
still far too small to see.
                 

                >Compare this with living replicators (the single existence                 
                >proof available). Genetic algorithms in planetary numbers 
                 

One existence proof is all that is needed, and huge numbers are no problem 
for Nanotechnology.

                  
                >lurch about for billions of years, replicating and mutating                 
                >and being winnowed via their expressed phenotypic success 
                

"Lurch" is a good word for it. The reason it took billions of years to  
produce us is that evolution is so dumb. Even the crummiest designer is  
brilliant compared to a random cosmic ray hitting a strand of DNA causing a  
mutation.             


                >That [DNA] sketchy information gets unpacked via (1) a rich                 
                >information-dense  environment 
                    

But that's no different than Nanotechnology because software is always 
useless without a computer to run it on. Digital DNA information needs to be 
run on a mitochondria to be implemented and produce an output, a protein. 
In Nanotechnology digital information also needs to be implemented, in an  
assembler in this case, to produce an output, a physical structure of any 
type not just a protein.

                >human-level intelligence 
                    

I don't understand the use of the phrase "even so" in this context. It takes  
a long time exactly because you don't have a precise wiring diagram at birth,  
it takes 20 years of research and development that we call education for the  
body to find such a diagram. When a brain crashes catastrophically, and up 
to now every single one has, there is no backup and all that R and D is lost.  
The next brain must re-invent the wheel, there has got to be a better way.

In section 12.7 of Nanosystems Drexler shows how to store 10^25 bits per cubic 
meter in fast RAM, or 10^28 bits in a slower (but still fast by our standards) 
"tape" storage. It should also be noted that the arm on a Nanotechnology 
based Assembler would be 50 million times shorter than a human arm, and that 
means it could move back and forth 50 million times faster than a human arm. 
Also, just one pound of carbon would contain about a billion billion Nano 
Robots with such arms.

                >engineering point 
                  

Hofstadter is one of my heroes by the way, but as you point out, he was 
talking about epistemology not engineering. You don't need to understand why 
something  works in order to duplicate it. You can parrot a foreign language 
even if you don't know a word of it. A chip designer may have no idea how a 
program running on his chip operates. A typist may have no understanding about 
what he writes, some would say that if nothing else my post proves that point.

That would certainly produce interesting results, whether it will be faster 
than other approaches I'm not sure. Quantum Computers may not even be 
possible ( but probably are, I think) and are certainly much more exotic than 
Nanotechnology.

                >nano fabrication, will very quickly escape our understanding
                  

If by "our" you mean 3 pound brains made of meat then I agree, but again, you  
don't need to understand why something works to manufacture it. Even now we 
can improve things without knowing a lot about it. No one man can have a  
deep understanding about exactly why Windows NT does what it does on all 
occasions, yet version 4.0 is better than version 3.51. Besides, I don't 
think 3 pounds of meat will be the smartest thing around forever.
                 

                >if you mean to build a new, improved car from the atom up,

                >that Lyle insists upon.
                 

Mostly true, but I don't think it would be all that costly . As I said,  
although not absolutely necessary (evolution), it's very helpful to know what  
you're doing if you want to improve something. I think I made it clear in my  
post that I was just referring to manufacturing.
                 

                >By the time we've chunked up the 10 steps,`identical' parts                 
                >might have diverged again 
                 

Perhaps, and that's why I don't think we'd ever use so many steps that we  
could no longer be confident that the parts were absolutely identical, or 
have so many different types of parts that it got confusing. I'm not sure 
how many steps that would be, but I have a hunch it would be less than 10.
                  

                >especially if they're put together by anything resembling               
                >chemo-gradient-guided self-assembly.  
                  

Chemo-gradient would be a very crude method of informing an assembler of its 
position, it may be good enough for life but I doubt it would be used much in  
Nanotechnology, except perhaps in the very earliest examples.

                >lowest level up, if we can.)
                              

If you made up a list that contained the type and position of every atom in a 
car this list would contain a HUGE amount of redundancy. If you put  an iron 
atom in a particular spot then it's almost certain that the atom you will 
want to put next to it will also be an iron atom. We can get rid of this  
massive redundancy and reduce the size of the list by an astronomical amount  
by using the same sort of algorithms we use today for data compression in ZIP  
and GIF files.

About an hour ago, I was having a fairly heated argument with some people I 
know, about gun control and whether it's best to respect people's freedom to 
defend themselves using deadly weapons or whether it's best to attempt to 
forcefully disarm everyone and allow no guns to exist.  I won't go into the 
details of the argument, because that's not what I want to talk about.  After 
the argument, I went into my room, sat down, closed my eyes and began 
reviewing everything, processing the event over and over, looking for the 
basic assumptions that people were making, which were revealed by what they 
brought up in the argument.  

I realized (with some amazement that I'd never noticed it before) that people 
were assuming that the way to solve social problems is by making some kind of 
law.  That was such a basic assumption, that the issue was about what kind of 
laws we should make, rather than whether we could solve the problems better by 
trying solutions which didn't require government and laws at all.  We just 
assumed that the problem (of gun violence) should be handled by the 
government.  It was an automatic assumption, which nobody questioned.

Now I realize how widespread this assumption is.  People automatically assume 
that the way to stop people from doing things which are wrong (criminal 
activity) is to outlaw the activity.  It's generally not even questioned; 
people just assume that we have to outlaw those activities which are wrong.  
It's such a basic assumption; "of course those things should be against the 
law," and people think that not making criminal activity against the law is 
saying that it's okay to do.  But the real point is not whether we make 
criminal activity illegal by making laws against it, but whether we actually 
succeed in reducing or eliminating violent and other coercive activities, 
whether they're officially declared "against the law" or not.

I don't see how having a group of legislators declare that murder and robbery 
are officially illegal will actually reduce these activities.  It's just a 
statement they're making.  Now if other people decide to enforce that 
statement, that may make a difference in the frequency of these activities.  
But won't people defend themselves from criminals, even if the legislators 
hadn't declared that what the criminals were doing was officially "against the 
law"?  If it wasn't illegal for someone to murder or rob you, would you just 
sit back and let them do it?

This is such a basic assumption, that we need laws, and I'm questioning it.  
I'm not necessarily saying that we don't need laws -- I'm not denying the 
assumption; I simply questioning it.  I'm not convinced that we really need 
laws for people to work and live together peacefully.  I'm not convinced that 
we don't need laws either, but I'm questioning that very basic assumption 
which most people make without really thinking about it.

So, let's imagine a world with no human laws at all, a world where people 
never consider making laws to solve their problems.  Imagine these people are 
very similar to us; they have the same social problems we do; they have 
violent people murdering, raping, robbing and doing all kinds of destructive 
things, just like we do, but they simply would never try to solve their 
problems by making laws.  What kind of strategies could they use to solve 
their problems, without resorting to making laws?

The people don't WANT to be robbed or raped or murdered or abused in any way, 
any more than we do.  So, they're very eager to find some effective solutions 
to their problems.  How can they protect themselves?  Simply declaring that 
certain activities are forbidden seems pretty ineffective to these people, so 
they dismiss the idea very quickly.  They are each very aware of the 
particular activities that are intolerable to them personally, and they each 
wish to avoid encountering people who engage in these activities.  But the 
question is, how can they do this?  

This question is facing us also.  For all of our history, we have had 
criminals and other social problems.  Humans have attempted various solutions 
to these problems, with varying degrees of success.  Often they created 
governments in an attempt to solve social problems, and often these very 
governments became corrupted and powerful and became much worse of a problem 
than anything they were created to solve.  Most people seem to unquestioningly 
assume that laws and government will solve our problems, but the evidence 
indicates strongly that that approach does not work.  The problems have not 
been solved at all.  

It seems to be a basic feature of most humans that they will develop an 
irrational faith in something and keep sticking with it in spite of all 
evidence against it.  They have so much faith that governments will actually 
work, that they will actually solve our problems, even though they never have 
before, and they are not doing so now.  But people want to believe so badly 
that somehow it will work this time, and they keep trying and failing, over 
and over.

I think it's time to step back and look at the situation again and re-evaluate 
our approaches.  What we've been doing, clearly isn't working.  It would be 
insane to keep trying the same failed approach.  

As Extropians, we are interested in creating a better future.  We are 
interested in finding solutions to our problems.  Death is a problem for us, 
and we're working on solving it.  Having limited resources and abilities is a 
problem, in our opinions, and we are working on overcoming all of our 
limitations.  People committing violence upon each other is also a problem we 
are concerned with, and I think it is very important that we find some real, 
effective solutions to this problem.  Government, as we know it, isn't 
working.  The problems remain, seemingly undiminished.  We need to find 
solutions that work, for a change.  We need to seriously question the 
irrational faith in government solutions.

I don't know exactly what solutions would be effective in eliminating violent 
and other coercive activities, but I do know that what people are doing now 
doesn't seem to be effective at all.  Violence and all other forms of coercion 
are highly Entropic activities, and eliminating these sorts of activities is a 
high priority for most, if not all, Extropians.

I encourage more discussion in this forum about possible solutions to the 
problems of violence and other coercive activity.  How can we practically and 
effectively eliminate these types of activities?  This is a very difficult and 
complex problem; humans have been pondering it for millennia.  But we have 
many advantages our ancestors did not.  First of all, we have their mistakes 
to review.  We have more people with intelligent minds working on the problem. 
 We have much greater knowledge.  We can communicate our possible solutions to 
each other quickly and easily.  

I am optimistic that we will eventually overcome the problems of violence and 
other coercive activities, just as I am optimistic that we will eventually 
overcome the problem of death.  But we must share our ideas with each other 
and build on each other's ideas.  We need to think seriously about these 
problems and discuss our thoughts with each other.

Hello Suresh:
The field of brain/machine interface, or what I tend to refer to as
"mind machine" interface, is quite extensive, and goes far beyond some
of the current commercial gagedtry offered by companies such as BioMuse,
and others plying this market.  Incidentally, the preceding comment was
in no way intended to impune the quality or intent of the product line
produced by BioMuse, which is probably the best "consumer" grade EEG and 
EMG interface components currently available.   

I happen to be the science editor for Mondo 2000 magazine, the most recent 
issue (# of which has just gone into circulation, featuring my article on the

topic of "Mind Machine Interface".  My background is a combination of 
computer science and physics, although I have had more than "a tad" of 
of exposure to neural physiology and biosensory system development over 
the course of my somewhat diverse and meandering work history.

In the above mentioned article I provide extensive detail on the currently
available technology, as well as an overview of the developmental history
of all aspects of electro-neural signal analysis, utilzation of SQUID
detector systems, 3D volumetric elctro-chemical event capture via
ultra sensitive NMR cameras, group mind experiencial event interfacing, 
and so on.  You will also find a example resource and bibliographic
reference listing embedded in the article as well.  Commercial efforts
at implementing dynamic neural signal interfacing systems, such as 
AquaThought, may also be interesting to you.

And finally (for the moment), my first efforts at creating my own
"home brew" EEG amplifier and spectral analysis/FFT processor engine
for detecting brain wave patterns and developing an interpretational
referencing protocol was back in the early '80's, which was about when
BYTE magazine published a series of articles about the "HAL" brain
wave detector and analysis hardware and software (I believe it was 
June / July '82). 

In any case, I wish you luck on your quest for further useful knowledge 
in this area.  Let me know, if you wish, if you are developing any
applications along these lines.


most sincerely,

Alternatives to laws:

I find it very inconvenient if I am physically attacked, murdered or 
if something of value to me is taken.  It would require a lot of 
personal effort to learn a martial art, secure my possesions or learn 
how to use a firearm.  What would suit me best is to hire somebody 
else to protect me (Private Protection Agencies).  This makes law and 
justice a commodity which can be traded in an open market place, 
thereby allowing it to evolve much faster.  

Creating a commune of people who believe in the same laws and want 
the same sort of protection is also an alternative (just like 
countries now except a lot smaller, thereby satisfying _all_ the 
citizens, not just the majority).  How the interactions between these 
communes will be managed might still be a problem (trying to avoid 
the idea of a centrally controlling authority).  A mini UN might be a 
solution, although I intuitively don't like the concept.

Signal to noise ratio is important too.... Especially desired signal
to noise level. I suspect the idea itself is a lot older than
Extropians,
my guess is maybe the days of the telegraph and Edison..

Of course if the frequencies are above the allowed sampling rate, one
gets aliased....

As a newbie lurker I'm hesitant to put forward my own extropian interests 
because of their potential redundancy. I've yet to browse the archives, 
or do more than bookmark Anders page. With a five day weekend coming up 
I'm hoping to be a little more prepared before posting again.

However, there are two topics I'm currently researching that I don't see 
in discussion. (I imagine that they may have already been discussed to 
death on this list, but...). One is current and near future NGO space 
travel potential. The other is the implications of the Human Genome 
Project.

So? Discussed to death or new avenues of exploration?

Damien Broderick <damien@ariel.ucs.unimelb.edu.au> just pointed out a foolish

I meant to say "ribosome". I was thinking about the manufacturing plant but  
for unknown reasons stupidly wrote about the power plant. Thanks Damien for

First of all I want to say that Damien Broderick's well written post on Oct 8  
was a joy to read and respond to. I don't think Damien is correct about his 
skepticism of Nanotechnology, but he certainly shows us how to argue  
intelligently and forcefully and yet remain civilized. I think we should all  
follow his example, including me.   
                  

                >Damien quoting Drexler: `If a car were assembled from                
                >normal-sized robots from a thousand pieces, each piece having                 
                >been assembled by smaller robots from a thousand smaller             
                >pieces [...] then only ten levels of assembly process would  
                >separate cars from molecules.' (UNBOUNDING THE FUTURE, 1991,                
                > p. 66)
                  

I re-read that passage in Drexler's popular book, it seems to me that he was 
trying to demonstrate to the general reader how small an atom was  and how 
many it would take to build a car, about 10^30. He was also  trying to 
demonstrate that even this huge number is not out of reach if you have 
command of exponential processes, and with Nanotechnology you would with self 
replication. In his example you can tackle that number in just 10 steps  
(1000^10 = 10^30). I don't think Drexler was trying to suggest that the best 
way to build a car was to do it in stages, each using 1000 parts until you  
get to atoms at stage 10.

On page 60 of "Engines of Creation" he talks about building (growing?) a 
rocket engine in one step using general purpose assemblers. You place a 
"seed" nanocomputer that has the complete plans for the engine in the center 
of a tank. The tank is filled with a fluid full of assemblers. The seed 
nanocomputer has places on the outside of it for assemblers in the fluid to
stick to it, the seed sends instructions to the assemblers connected to it, 
telling those machines  what their position is in relation to the seed, and 
telling them how many other assemblers they should snag, and what their 
position must be, and what instructions to send them.  The chain keeps 
growing and soon an assembler scaffolding for the entire rocket engine is in 
place, with each assembler knowing its position relative to the seed.  
Now it's time to begin  manufacturing. Drain the tank of its fluid full of 
excess assemblers and pour in a new fluid that has chemical fuel (food) for 
the assemblers and raw materials, mostly carbon, for the construction. 
A few hours later your rocket engine is finished.

On the other hand, if you needed a huge number of rocket engines very quickly 
you might not want to rely entirely on general purpose assemblers and make 
everything in one step. Some parts, like carbon fibers, would be used in 
almost all the things you would want to make, so it would be more efficient 
to make them with special purpose assemblers rather than use the more 
flexible but slower  general assemblers. Also, because you'd need to do it a 
lot It would also be helpful to have a specialized tool to stretch the sleeve 
of a bearing so you can fit it over a shaft. Drexler talks about mass 
producing modular building blocks that you use frequently, like identical 
CPU's and memory arrays. Most of these blocks would be less than 10 
nanometers but a few could be as large as 1000  nanometers (10^-6 meters), 
still far too small to see.

                >proof available). Genetic algorithms in planetary numbers 
                 

One existence proof is all that is needed, and huge numbers are no problem 
for Nanotechnology.

                >and being winnowed via their expressed phenotypic success 
                

"Lurch" is a good word for it. The reason it took billions of years to  
produce us is that evolution is so dumb. Even the crummiest designer is  
brilliant compared to a random cosmic ray hitting a strand of DNA causing a  
mutation.             


                >That [DNA] sketchy information gets unpacked via (1) a rich                 
                >information-dense  environment 
                    

But that's no different than Nanotechnology because software is always 
useless without a computer to run it on. Digital DNA information needs to be 
run on a mitochondria to be implemented and produce an output, a protein. 
In Nanotechnology digital information also needs to be implemented, in an  
assembler in this case, to produce an output, a physical structure of any 
type not just a protein.

I don't understand the use of the phrase "even so" in this context. It takes  
a long time exactly because you don't have a precise wiring diagram at birth,  
it takes 20 years of research and development that we call education for the  
body to find such a diagram. When a brain crashes catastrophically, and up 
to now every single one has, there is no backup and all that R and D is lost.  
The next brain must re-invent the wheel, there has got to be a better way.

In section 12.7 of Nanosystems Drexler shows how to store 10^25 bits per cubic 
meter in fast RAM, or 10^28 bits in a slower (but still fast by our standards) 
"tape" storage. It should also be noted that the arm on a Nanotechnology 
based Assembler would be 50 million times shorter than a human arm, and that 
means it could move back and forth 50 million times faster than a human arm. 
Also, just one pound of carbon would contain about a billion billion Nano 
Robots with such arms.

Hofstadter is one of my heroes by the way, but as you point out, he was 
talking about epistemology not engineering. You don't need to understand why 
something  works in order to duplicate it. You can parrot a foreign language 
even if you don't know a word of it. A chip designer may have no idea how a 
program running on his chip operates. A typist may have no understanding about 
what he writes, some would say that if nothing else my post proves that point.

That would certainly produce interesting results, whether it will be faster 
than other approaches I'm not sure. Quantum Computers may not even be 
possible ( but probably are, I think) and are certainly much more exotic than 
Nanotechnology.

If by "our" you mean 3 pound brains made of meat then I agree, but again, you  
don't need to understand why something works to manufacture it. Even now we 
can improve things without knowing a lot about it. No one man can have a  
deep understanding about exactly why Windows NT does what it does on all 
occasions, yet version 4.0 is better than version 3.51. Besides, I don't 
think 3 pounds of meat will be the smartest thing around forever.
                 

                >if you mean to build a new, improved car from the atom up,

                >that Lyle insists upon.
                 

Mostly true, but I don't think it would be all that costly . As I said,  
although not absolutely necessary (evolution), it's very helpful to know what  
you're doing if you want to improve something. I think I made it clear in my  
post that I was just referring to manufacturing.
                 

                >By the time we've chunked up the 10 steps,`identical' parts                 
                >might have diverged again 
                 

Perhaps, and that's why I don't think we'd ever use so many steps that we  
could no longer be confident that the parts were absolutely identical, or 
have so many different types of parts that it got confusing. I'm not sure 
how many steps that would be, but I have a hunch it would be less than 10.

Chemo-gradient would be a very crude method of informing an assembler of its 
position, it may be good enough for life but I doubt it would be used much in  
Nanotechnology, except perhaps in the very earliest examples.

If you made up a list that contained the type and position of every atom in a 
car this list would contain a HUGE amount of redundancy. If you put  an iron 
atom in a particular spot then it's almost certain that the atom you will 
want to put next to it will also be an iron atom. We can get rid of this  
massive redundancy and reduce the size of the list by an astronomical amount  
by using the same sort of algorithms we use today for data compression in ZIP  
and GIF files.

I'm sure that you could exercise your imagination to come up with

I for one do not find pickup lines amusing, as they are a strong

What I still fail to understand, and perhaps the idea developed in

I'm one who thinks the singularity is an inevitable near-term
consequencs of the continualce of our civilization. However, as
in Anders' scenario, any truly severe disrutpion of said civilization
can stop the research into computing, and thus delay the singularity.
However, I believe that any plausible scenario will also result in the
death of at least half of the population.

This is a actually an excellent idea. The major problem is that many of =
the
responses we want to reprogram function at a very low level. The two
basic feelings are lust and hunger. Normally the responses of these =
feelings
are sex or food. For some time, whenever I feel lust, I try to associate
the feeling, not with sex, but with the feeling of success and wealth.
Similarily (handy when you practice calorie restriction) I try to
associate hunger with work. These are just simple examples but I think
there are many motivational feedback circuits that can be reprogrammed
in similair fashion, perhaps in combination with drug/hormon theraphy.

Now I only have to find some time to study more medicin and psychology.

        I agree.  We should think things out before we do them.  Refine
potential before it is made kinetic.  For example, to use a story we all
know, look at "Frankenstein".  That is really a transhuman novel.  If only
Dr. Frankenstein had thought things out a bit better before he 'created a
monster', then he might have discovered a way to create a rationally
functioning, intelligent human being.  Not to confuse fiction with fact, but
mental progress is as important --if not more so-- as kinetic progress.

Hello Suresh:
The field of brain/machine interface, or what I tend to refer to as
"mind machine" interface, is quite extensive, and goes far beyond some
of the current commercial gagedtry offered by companies such as BioMuse,
and others plying this market.  Incidentally, the preceding comment was
in no way intended to impune the quality or intent of the product line
produced by BioMuse, which is probably the best "consumer" grade EEG and 
EMG interface components currently available.   

I happen to be the science editor for Mondo 2000 magazine, the most recent 
issue (# of which has just gone into circulation, featuring my article on the

topic of "Mind Machine Interface".  My background is a combination of 
computer science and physics, although I have had more than "a tad" of 
of exposure to neural physiology and biosensory system development over 
the course of my somewhat diverse and meandering work history.

In the above mentioned article I provide extensive detail on the currently
available technology, as well as an overview of the developmental history
of all aspects of electro-neural signal analysis, utilzation of SQUID
detector systems, 3D volumetric elctro-chemical event capture via
ultra sensitive NMR cameras, group mind experiencial event interfacing, 
and so on.  You will also find a example resource and bibliographic
reference listing embedded in the article as well.  Commercial efforts
at implementing dynamic neural signal interfacing systems, such as 
AquaThought, may also be interesting to you.

And finally (for the moment), my first efforts at creating my own
"home brew" EEG amplifier and spectral analysis/FFT processor engine
for detecting brain wave patterns and developing an interpretational
referencing protocol was back in the early '80's, which was about when
BYTE magazine published a series of articles about the "HAL" brain
wave detector and analysis hardware and software (I believe it was 
June / July '82). 

In any case, I wish you luck on your quest for further useful knowledge 
in this area.  Let me know, if you wish, if you are developing any
applications along these lines.


most sincerely,

Charles Ostman

My argument starts with assumption (1) above. That's why its the
first assumption. The effect will kick in when the very first
human/computer joint entity (or other entity with a computer as
a substantial contributor to its intelligence) comes into
existence. It will then get more intelligent as a result of increases
in the capabilities of its computer part. So far, no feedback is
involved. Then it will get rapidly more intelligent as it uses this
intelligence to better use its computer part. The major difference
here is that the computer will contribute directly to the intelligence
of the entity. I claim that this is different in kind than the
contributions to intelligence of the other technologies you cite.

My point is that competition cannot help worker conditions, nor can it 
eliminate the authoritarian nature of business. The coop  may not be able 
to compete with the big corporation because they pay fair equal wages, 
while the big corporation may not. The only advantage they have is that 
people there are more motivated because the work they do is their own.

The fact that we need politicians, who pretty much have the same class
interests as the business men to keep whatever semblance of equality 
shows how messed up the liberal capitalist democracy system is.

 What I propose is this:Anarcho-syndicalism, as advocated by Rudolf 
Rocker and Noam Chomsky, souped up into a hi-tech version by yours truly. 
Private property is abolished, as the only way to hold 
private property is by right of force, and since there is no need for a 
government to keep people in check, that would be abolished as well. Most 
crime comes from poverty, and the rest can easily be dealt  with by 
citizens.  Okay, ask me questions.

It's not like corporations aren't actively prpping up these businesses. 
Dole fruit , for example, keeps the aristocracy in power   while the U.S. 
keeps the military in power. Corporations and government are two sides of 
the same elite group. They both support each other. Quote from Sprint's 
CEO I heard last night that got me rather irate "Bill Clinton has been 
good for American Business"

In the same way that  you can have too much liberty.  I don't think 
everybody should be reduced to the lowest common 
denominator. Instead, equal access to resources 
to do with as you will, provided it doesn't harm 
anyone else's access or human rights. This needs 
some elaboration, which I will provide if asked.                         >

Unless (gasp) the workers ran the mill themselves.  Operating a mill

No, it is in the corporations interest to consolidate affluence so that

cultures. Make sure all the rich share the same

I agree, but it's both the bankers and the rulers of

Theyre only worth 75 cents an hour to you because you can dictate prices 
to me, thanks to a very tangible power imbalance. Human labour has been 
commodified, so all we do is sell it to others.  

To fight the argument "so anybody can start their own business". Two 
friends of mine tried, but they come from low income homes, don't have 
any credit history, and thus it is virtually impossible to get a loan, 
regardless of the merit of their idea(which I,personally thought  would 
sell). We like to pretend there is no class difference, but a kid who was 
coddled by his parents and sent to a top notch private school has a 
definite advantage over a kid born addicted to crack.

I don't want it subsidized, I would like to see it come out of peoples 
homes. I would like to see decentralized media. I don't 
want another big corporate station open to the public, I 
want the public doing their own media. 

People won't have any need to do this as long as they are beat over the 
head with establishment sound bites. Who am I to tell people what they 
should watch? That's like saying the system in Brave New World was 
acceptable because the people were happy.

They are bushlike structures consisting of fractally branching arms. I
know at least two books where they occur beside Mind Chiuldren, both sf: 
_Rocheworld_ by Robert Forward (the solar sail ship is largely run by the
'Christmas Bush', a bushrobot signalling internally and externally using
multicolored laser light) and _The Turing Option_ by Harrison and Minsky
('Sven' is a 'society of mind' AI housed in a bush robot). 

Have anybody looked at how to actually build them? Those joints are 
probably troublesome.

Yes, I'd guess most, if not all extropians and fellow-travellers do.  A
project I've had to shelve for the time being due to the press of making a
living is working out my own thoughts on this subject in sufficient detail to
be subject to decent analysis and criticism.  

I interpret questions about the "meaning of life" to ultimately be questions
about morality, i.e. what is good or worthwhile.  A "quick and dirty"
statement of the core of my thoughts on this subject is that morality, ethics
and teleology can be derived from epistimology.  (Blech! -- what a sentence!)
 A less cryptic statement of this idea is that a rigorous rational morality
can be derived from the very nature of an entity that is capable of
"knowing", without the need for reference to any source of value outside the
knower and community of knowers.  The irreducible axiom of this concept of
morality is that knowing and "knowers" are fundamental goods.  To the extent
that any rationale for this axiom is possible or necessary, it is that we are
essentially and uniquely knowers.

As for the original subject of this post, hedonism, it seems to me that
pleasure of all sorts is inextricably intertwined with knowledge -- it is one
of many possible qualities of knowledge.  Being perhaps less analytical and
more common-sensical, shouldn't we simply say that, all other things being
equal, pleasure makes us happy and happiness is a good thing?  This begs the
question of the ethical context of any particular pleasure, but that is a
subject for another day ...

Ah!  You've just re-invented Kant - so we're up to the 18th century in a

This scenario was the "different" scenario, since it was based on a single
powerful event rather than the other four that evolved (relatively)
smoothly. Normally, in scenario planning you don't try to estimate
probabilities for the scenarios, since they are intended more as good
learning tools or cautionary tales. Instead one should look for signs that
draw us in the direction of some scenarios rather than others. 

I do not claim to be able to estimate its probability, and I doubt it is
possible in practice - often our assumptions are very wrong. I think we
should see it for what it is: a warning about a possible dark future,
urging us to think about ways of averting it and if the worst happens
survive it with our dreams intact.

HUGO is interesting, and much, much more powerful than many realizes. 
Mapping the genome won't just help medicine and genetics a lot, it will 
also subtly affect the way we see ourselves. 

Another interesting thing is the dog genome project, which will probably
find the genetic basis for obedience and similar stuff - imagine the
interesting (and horrifying) potential for cross-species comparision (and
hybridization - I want a better sense of smell!).

I agree, the story contains a very transhuman vision - but Shelley isn't 
(consciously) trying to tell it. What "Frankenstein" tells *us* is that 
we as creators are responsible for our creations and their well-being, 
but what it tells the general public is that meddling with Things Man Was

Hi people

Just a few short, quick ripostes to John Clark's illuminating response:

Yeah, but look at all the other stuff in that section (pp. 55-62).
Drexler starts by making a comparison (the basis, I believe, of his
continuing analogy) with a primitive bulk assembler that makes
prefabricated chips and sticks them together, etc.  

A sheet nano assembler arm (p. 59) cements 10^6 atoms a second.  Wow!  But:
`making a meter thick slab will take over a year'.  And going quicker makes
everything get hot fast.  So: prefab at leisure and stockpile.  `Molecular
assemblers will team up with larger assemblers to build big things quickly'.
This fits in with my version of the hierarchical method for nano-making a
car.  His spaceship engine, admittedly, takes less than a day, but I gather
that the fabricator uses stockpiled carbon fiber and sapphired aluminium
oxide.   (And yes,  probably what Drexler was doing in that cited passage is
to educate those who can't instantly grasp the order-of-magnitude gap
between atoms and cars.  I'm one of them.)  

What interests me is the number of gestures at programming, instruction, etc
in these pages.  There's the `seed' you mention, a nice device but chockful
of knowledge that has been put there by prodigious human effort, I gather.
Yes, maybe some of what it sketches is data gathered by `disassemblers', but
as you point out this data has to be shrunk by compression routines.  (At
this point I admit what must be obvious, that I don't know what I'm talking
about: maybe this can be turned over to a no-brain number cruncher.  But
maybe it can't.)  

Here's a citation I think might be salutary, from Kevin Kelly, not known for
his techno-terror, in his

Out of Control: The New Biology of machines, London: Fourth Estate, 1994:

`...turn on a switch, and a linear system awakens.  It's ready to serve you.
If it stalls, restart it...  But complex swarm systems with rich hierarchies
take time to boot up.  The more complex, the longer it takes to warm up.
Each hierarchical level has to settle down; lateral causes have to slosh
around and come to rest; a million autonomous agents have to acquaint
themselves.  I think this will be the hardest lesson for humans to learn:

And what I meant wasn't that simple.  I'm thinking of the kind of elaborate
and unpredictable informational richness of the environment that goes into
unpacking a genome, which Jacques Monod spoke of a third of a century ago in
CHANCE AND NECESSITY.  This info density is available to nano engineers as
well, of course, but it's been explored and exploited by living thangs via a
truly Vast culled-random-walk.  Despise bio-evolution if you will, there's
something to be said for letting Vast numbers (Dennett-speak) of variants do
the walking through design space...

learned through 33 years of earning my living as a science fiction writer

is the monstrously interconnected complexity of change, which makes novelty
easier and faster (nano *and* AI will emerge at the same time, yes, and
boot-strap each other).

Easily said.  But does this work with something of the order of 10^30 atoms,
*each scanned individually*?  (Might be easier after all to build from
scratch: `put an iron atom next to this iron atom.  Do 10^15 times, then
turn right'.  Hmm.  Big heavy pots are easy, steaks might be tricky to program.)

As I say, just some stray thoughts.  Are we going around in circles here?
(I hope not.)

I have enjoyed the debate about rates of growth in a situation
where computers play some part in augmenting the (effective?)
intelligence of researchers.

I had missed the first part, so I'm not sure whether the computers
help by allowing uploading and/or AI's, with possibly million-fold
speedups of thought compared to human brains?  Or perhaps the change
is less dramatic, things like hyperlinks and search engines to
quickly find and disseminate research results, improved modelling
engines to decrease research costs, better CAD/CAM facilities to
speed up design cycles, etc.

Speaking very broadly, most growth cycles have had either an exponential
or "yeast curve" pattern.  The yeast curve looks exponential at first, but
then slows down and hits a ceiling as some limiting factor is reached.
This raises the (unextropian!) possibility that growth curves which
today look exponential will also someday reach limits.

Exponential growth can be characterized simply by the percent increase
per year.  I believe economic growth has run around a few percent per
year for many decades or even centuries.  Computer performance has
increased more like 30 or 40 percent per year for the past few decades.

So a couple of questions which arise are, could general economic growth
rates move up to the rate of growth of computer performance, in case
the economy somehow became tied much more closely to computers?

And, will computer performance growth rates greatly increase because of
some feedback mechanisms related to the enhancements computers themselves
make possible?

If the first were true, this would in itself be utterly revolutionary
in its impact.  It's difficult to even conceive what life would be like
in a world in which we would all be twice as rich, in real terms, every
couple of years.  Even a decade of this kind of growth would completely
transform the world, like centuries of progress today.  So it would be
interesting to hear opinions on this question.

The second question is more difficult to answer.  Realize that the
dramatic rates of growth of computer technology already are made possible
in large part due to feedback mechanisms.  Certainly the high performance
chips of today could not be designed or simulated without the computers
of a few years ago.  So feedback is already present, and in fact it is
necessary to maintain these rapid doubling rates.

The problem with trying to forecast this into the future is that
there is also the factor of diminishing returns.  All these forms of
economic growth benefit from feedback, but they face the problem that
it may become harder and harder to extract improvements from nature.
We pick the low hanging fruit first, and then the higher fruit takes
more effort.  In fact there is no technology "just around the corner"
which will guarantee to maintain current computer growth rates into the
2010 time frame.  Many people expect to see a leveling off of computer
performance before then as the fundamental technological limitations of
silicon chips are reached.

So, feedback by itself will not guarantee an increase in growth rates.
Rather, you have to look at details of how much the feedback helps, in
the face of whatever difficulties can be anticipated.  If the world
economic growth rate did increase to a doubling time of two or three
years, then presumably computer performance growth rates would benefit,
as would virtually all other technologies.  But translating this into
a specific increase in growth rates is going to be very difficult to
do.

What Co-Ops are as successful as the Fortune 500 (or is it Fortune 100?)
Co-Op Wisconsin Dairies?  Do you think they are run by "workers"?   They have
professionally trained managers.  They may be former farmers, but they all
have degrees now.  

My point is some "workers" ARE competent, some are not.  The same for
managers.   But managers have more education.   A negotiation point for them.
 

BTW Do you think management doesn't "work" too?  They sometimes don't even
get more money because they are on salary and get no overtime.   Yet, they
work overtime too.  The manager salary range is lower than a "poor worker"
with overtime.  For the truck divers the sky's the limit with overtime.  Why?
 Negotiation not unions.   They have something to sell and salary negotiation
is affected in their favor.   

If businesses are so greedy why aren't they paying ALL of us minimum wage?
 Negotiation.  If you have nothing worth buying, you have a negotiation
problem.

I don't see it as top down. I see it as:

If you have something or do something that people are willing to pay for,
negotiation works very well with salaries, working conditions, job duties,
etc.  If you don't have something people are willing to pay for . . .  Then
there is a problem in need of fixing via education, skills,  training, etc.

I don't understand what "closed fascism" is.  To me fascism is when you are
NOT free to choose what you want to do with private property or your self
because they are under government regulation.  But, we ARE free to choose in
this case, right?? like jobs?  We all chose our jobs one way or another.
  The government did not tell me where to work.  The companies didn't tell me

Wisconsin Dairies Co-Op does pay well.  If a worker thinks the pay isn't

If the "big" company is so evil why isn't everybody paid minimum wage?
 Because negotiation works with or without a Union.  Workers are as free to

 Employers and workers are as free as negotiation lets them be.  Look for the
Win-Win. 

But, if you start your own company, know this:  I pay 35% income tax plus 15%
self employment tax. . . a total of 50% tax.  So, to compensate for the tax
and business expenses I raised my fee from  $25 per hour before I had my own
company to $75 now that I have my own company, to get the same standard of
living.   If I was to incorporate I would get double taxed i.e. beyond the
50% rate which would lower my standard of living.

Yes there are lots of ways to handle problems without laws, especially
via informal social mechanisms (See Bensons' "Order Without Law").  
But I'd also like to make sure everyone remembers that you can have
law without government.  Private law, explicit but voluntarily agreed
on.  Just because "there aught to be a law" doesn't mean there aught
to be coersion.

I really have no idea what you mean by a more intelligent
"human/computer joint entity", if you deny that computers now
contribute to human intelligence in the way you have in mind, if you
also deny that a larger group of people with more access to knowledge
is effectively more intelligent in your way, and if uploading (mere
porting of human software to faster hardware) doesn't count.

Unfortunately, when there are several kinds of costs, growth rates
tend to be determined by the slowest growth rate among the different
costs.  The amazing thing about historical growth rates is that we
have been able reduce pretty much *all* kinds of costs at a similar
rate.  So for computer growth rates to determine economic growth
rates, computers would have to be the main costs behind pretty much
everything.   Possible in theory, but unlikely before uploads or AIs,
IMHO.

Thanks, Hara, for a very stimulating post.  I have a follow-up question.
But first, given all the recent discussion about noise & repetition on

and given that I've only been on the list since it became open in
August, I hope if my questions raise issues that have already been
discussed by the Old Ones (the 'eagles' who mostly seem to be silent
lately) they will be interpreted in the context of spreading memes to
newcomers, as opposed to being seen as a noisy repetitive loop.

Hara Ra wrote (and hopefully my snips maintain your context):

within which it is realised [snip] the notion of self awareness ... is a
loop stating  that "I exist"... all experiences are encoded with the

Hara goes on to provide some interesting discussion of "the universe as
a kind of giant Feynman diagram" and then concludes:
<Another point to notice is that preserving physical memory implies that
some of the particle states are not changed, which limits the number of
possible memory preserving transformations. Ie, we come from many
possible pasts and it is not possible to know which ones. Memory limits
the possibilities both ways. This creates outrageous conclusions, which
I use in my shamanic work>

My question is, has the following been discussed on the list, or does
anyone have any opinions about it?

In ch.4 of his book _Elemental Mind_, Nick Herbert describes the
little-known Spacetime Reductive Materialism (SRM) theories of
consciousness proposed by California PolyTechnic professor James
Culbertson (author of _The Minds Of Robot_, 1963, and _Consciousness:
Natural & Artificial_, 1984, which, as Herbert notes, "has been
generally dismissed by mainstream scientists as quirky and
impractical"). SRM models are based on reflection points, influence
trees and outlook trees described by 3 attributes: intensity, quality &
connectiveness.

Superficially this sounds like it might be a useful model of
consciousness, but then Herbert goes on to add, "Culbertson's answer to
the evolutionary question [of why consciousness is advantageous] is that
because of their ability to store memories in spacetime. rather than in
space, conscious computers can perform the same job as unconscious
computers  and require fewer parts to do so ... a conscious computer ...
can access events that have happened long ago, events that lie 'outside'
the computer's present state ... [having the advantage of] a kind of
invisible spacetime 'hard disk' - that could give conscousness a
competitive edge in the Darwinian struggle for existence." (p134).

Nick Herbert also quotes physicist Herman Weyl (known for his particle
physics 'gauge theory' efforts): "The objective world simply is; it does
not happen. Only to the gaze of my consciousness, crawling upward along
the life line of my body, does a section of this world come to life as a
fleeting image in space which continuously changes in time." (p121)

All of this seems to imply that memories and experiences might somehow
be distributed in the environment through which we have passed, like
some kind of hypertext Web that we can link to in some apparently
non-local way (or, perhaps, by virtue of us being parallel processors in
a larger network we're only beginning to glimpse), rather than *just*
being hardcoded into our brains and central nervous systems.  While I
agree that "information always requires context, the hardware within
which it is realised", this SRM theory still sounds appealing to my
naive, 'creole physics' understanding of things (the foundation of which
views reality as consisting of three 'tangled hierarchies': Content,
Context & Contest ).  BUT, I have a hard time reconciling it with
traditional scientific theories and approaches to uploading.

That's what the general public got from it, but is that really all
Shelley meant to convey?  Frankenstein did create a rational,
intelligent human being, except for size and stamina.  The nutcase
running around is Frankenstein himself.  "Too ugly!  Too ugly!"  The

Actually the general public didn't get anything from the book, because
the general public hasn't read the book.  The general public saw bad
movies loosely inspired by the book.  Personally, if we ever start
suppressing technology I nominate audio-visual mass media.  Make people
read.

As I'm sure most of us know, it ain't just managers.  Ever hear of an
engineer getting overtime?  Not me.  I just spent 5 years working
10-14 hour days and every weekend.  I was lucky and it paid off for me
in the end, but for most folks here in Silicon Valley doing the
startup thing, they'd make more as a grocery storee manager.

I'd credit that unjustified leap to a lack of imagination--or dishonest

What's wrong with paying the better educated more money?  Do you think the
managers make more money?  What about the overtime paid to "workers" who make
more money than the managers do?

That's not welfare, that's business (and jobs).  Don't blame the companies
for getting business.    They had a product the government wanted and got

Do you want them to say no to the business? ... To give their products away

My problem is that the government couldn't afford it and raised my taxes so I

True. Read NANOSYSTEMS, not just "Unbounding the Future", etc. I intend

   Good question. If "we" implies a community of humans, and it they
used
nanotech to leave earth, then unless they police the entire community,
they
run the risk of "wild" namotech.

I think you are asking for a bit too much for this list. I'd be
satisfied wit a simple statement that he considers it impracticable,
with
a brief sketch of the reasons such as you give below. That would be
sufficient to permit us to understand our differences and examine them

  This one needs a bit more excplication. We already do top-down design,
fromn the level of city planning down to the level of individual
circuits
within a microprocessor. Why is this qualitatively harder when designing
the smallest components from atoms? even if every single component must
be designed by a human, we still get "free" manufacturing. The design
effort is a very small part of the cost of a consumer item.

Let's remember taht Chris is a high school student and Robin has a Ph.D

One nice thing about this list is that these people can interact with
each other is a productive manner.

Yep.  I believe that when I've discussed this idea previously in the distant
past on the ExList, I did attribute the essential outlines of the idea to
Kant.  In my haste this morning, I failed to do so.  Frankly, I think that a
review of Kant's epistimologically-based ethics in light of current thinking
in cognitive science might be fruitful.

As for the 18th century in general, I think we could do a lot worse, as
exponents of a "Second Enlightenment", than to revisit some of the good ideas
from that time from whence come the roots of liberal modernism.

Regarding David Musick's essay questioning the widely-held assumption that
state-sponsored law is the only tool to address violence and other social
problems, below is the better part of an essay I've written about extropian
approaches to law (at http://users.aol.com/gburch1/exlaw.html):

Extropians look to the concept of law as a powerful tool in building a better
future.  As with every other aspect of their own lives and society, however,
they question the current state of the law and legal thinking, look for the
best in the past and the present and seek to develop new modes of thinking
and acting to transcend bounds that others may accept without doubt.

Individual liberty and reciprocity are the highest values in an extropian
approach to law and legal issues.  These values follow naturally from a
desire for self transformation and a stress on social systems that arise as a
spontaneous ordering of free individuals.  Accordingly, extropians look to
legal systems as tools for freely ordering their own lives and their
interactions with others and they resist the use of law as a tool of
repression or coercion.

Extropians strongly question the presumption underlying the current almost
universal paradigm of law that assumes that law is inextricably intertwined
with the power of the state.  They seek to free the law from this confining
assumption as much as possible and see the law more as a fluid ground of
action for ordering the affairs of individuals on a consensual basis.  Thus,
extropians are interested in current developments in various regimes of
so-called "privately produced law", such as private mediation and
arbitration, and look forward to the possibility of expanding the reach of
such regimes of private law to new areas of human activity.  Many extropians
think that the coercive state as we know it today could be more or less
completely replaced by "polycentric legal codes" of privately produced law,
an example of spontaneous order on the largest social scale.

Individual responsibility is the necessary corollary of the extropian stress
on individual liberty.  Thus extropians do not look to rights granted by an
impersonal state, but rather the free acceptance of responsibility for the
consequences of individual and collective action, coupled with reasoned and
explicit reciprocity, as the best basis for ordering human (and posthuman)
affairs through law.

IMO, a large group is not much more intelligent than its most
intelligent member. True, the most intelligent member may be
somewhat more effective if the group can off-load some of the
more mundane parts of the creative effort, but the effect is
not large, and in many groups the effect is offset by the effort spent
in communication among the group.

IMO easy and effective access to knowledge is an intelligence
multiplier. the best you could do in this regard prior to the advent of
the computer was to live in a library. Even that was not very good.

Uploading does count. However, I don't feel that the argument is
restricted to uploading. Therefore, I attempted to make an abatract
argument.

My favorite scenario is the use of a modern video interface and
effective software that lets a human make decisions
at a very high rate based on information presented by the computer.
the human's input would affect the computer's output to the human.
the human's decision rate can be very high in such a scenario, even with
fairly restricted human-to-computer commnications: watch a kid playing a
flight-simulation game to see what I mean. The I/O hardware is alrady in
place: what's missing is the software. 

So at one end of the spectrum is uploading. At the other is the
existing hardware with new software. In either case, we get a
human/computer collaboration whose intelligence is substantialy
augmented by its computer component. "Intelligence" for the purposes of
this discussion is very(!) narrowly defined as the
quality that permits an entity to design and implement newer and better
computer hardware and software.

The "SI Dream" scenario is a researcher (probably a grad student at MIT,
drinking Jolt cola at 2AM and programming when he should be studying for
an English exam.) The researcher is attempting to enhance a
decision-support system by interfacing it to a knowledge base and to a
graphical information-presentation system. Because the researcher is
interested in software development, the knowledge base is the one he set
up last year as a class assignment in his software engineering class. He
gets the system up, and (since he is currently working on this system)
his first trial run is an attempt to optimize his prototype. He
succeeds, and installs the
next version. With this version, he optimizes the operating system
(He's using LINUX, so he has the source.) Next, he optimizes his
hacking program. Then, he grabs all the workstations in the dorm, via
the net, and oprimizes them. Then, he reoptimizes his program to run in
a distributed mode. Now (about 4AM, I think,) he
hacks the campus routers, and then all computers on the campus,
and then the web. He turns his attention to extending his knowledge
base, probably by hacking The CYC database. By 6AM, he's running
in the whole Web. By the end of the trading day, he owns a controlling
interest in a nice collection of companies on the
NYSE.

worth, not how they are 'supposed' to be viewed.




Paradise Ol=E9


I=92m far away from Xanadu and I know no pleasure domes
But I have my immortality within my chromosomes
My mind, my eyes, my heart and soul guide me on my way
To where my stomach=92s always full of melons and Paradise au lait

The starkest consciousness within the mind shall always have a light
To prove to the rest of my body and world that things will be alright
The knowledge of potential, forever kinetic, helps me see my goal
Total ownership of the person within me: the unity to make my essence whole

It has always been within me
The ability to go my own way
The path to all eternity
My Paradise au lait

Cascading obscurities and aging maturities all lead to future shock
But the keys of wisdom and introspect will open omnipotence=92s lock
And when the world has lost all sense of liberty, when freedom seems=
 obsolete
The ones who will survive regression=92s woes will be the ones who don=92t
accept defeat

The power within is ever so great, so much greater than the power without
And the decision to decide between freedom and faith leaves little room for
doubt
The world is in the hands of who wants it most, the people of true=
 consequence
And the power can be shared by those who have the will to abide by a new
common sense

It has always been within you
The ability to go your own way
The path to all eternity
Your Paradise au lait
You can use your mind for judgment
Or you can throw your mind away
While I feast on infinity melons
And Paradise au lait


						By:  E. Shaun Russell




Vary (So Very)


I was in a daydream one day
When a question occurred to me
Something just out of my reach
An obscured reality

I climbed the highest mountain
Scoured the deepest sea
But I couldn=92t find the answer
Couldn=92t fulfill my plea

I asked the lowliest peasant
With his base philosophy
But he didn=92t have a response
To my crucial inquiry

I asked the wisest prophet
Within his prophecy
But he couldn=92t reveal the truth
Perhaps he couldn=92t see

I pleaded with the sky above
Begged God for sympathy
Maybe He wasn=92t listening
Or He was a fallacy

So in the pits of despair
Depressed as one can be
I looked inside myself
At my wretched anxiety

And there I found the answer
Of how I could be free
I saw where I went wrong:
I forgot eternity

Perhaps I misunderstood Drexler, but Engines of Creation says:

`A nanomachine able to do this [pull stuff apart], while recording what it
removes layer by layer, is a *disassembler*...  [A] nanocomputer system will
be able to direct the disassembly of an object, record its structure, and
then direct the assembly of perfect copies.'  (pp. 19-20).

This strikes me as an oddly appropriate metaphor for the works of T. Leary. Should he 
have 'thought things out a little better'? Was he responsible for his 'creations'? 
(people who took lsd without the accompanying philosophy of set and setting).
 
This dynamic is also reflected in the differing views Hind and Hanson. Should an 
*extropian* (i.e. optimistic futurist philosopher) delve into a meme in depth or just 
shoot out ideas, as many as possible, as fast as possible?
 
This debate goes back at least as far as Huxley and Leary in the late '50's early 
'60's.(And much further, I imagine).

My take on this is that there has to be both. A Leary/Hind to generate ideas and a 
Huxley/Hanson to delve deep into those ideas.
 
This also seems to me to be the crux of the 'mailing list quality' debate. Those that 
want depth are irritated at those that want breadth.
 
The optimistic part of me thinks that a balance will be struck and that the depth 
proponents will eventually ignore the scattershot ideas they don't have time to persue. 
And that the breadth proponents will come to understand that they can't expect someone 
else to do all their depth work for them.

The pessimistic part of me is worried that the depth proponents will go somewhere else 
and deprive this list of their necessary 'weight'. Necessary in the sense that if I ever 
want to see the ideas I value gain any legitimacy or widespread appeal there has to be 
some substantial argument to convert the undecided.

Tom, I've seen the statement three times in postings on this 
list--postings by basically intelligent people.  Maybe there is an 
interesting discussion to be had here, I'd like to know what's behind 
the idea.

Sin,

Why not? One of the things corporations compete for is workers. If the working
conditions are bad I might move to another company even if they pay less,
provided they had pleasant working conditions. A company can not exist without 
people, it's in their best interest to make workers as happy as they can or 
they will leave and join a competitor.

Why couldn't you compete? If you have wonderful working conditions and pay 
huge wages then nobody will want to work for your competition, the big 
corporation, and they will go out of business, unless.... Unless the 
astronomical wages makes the product you sell so expensive that nobody wants 
to buy it, and then you would have no money to pay anybody anything. Silly me, 
I just answered my own question, please ignore.

I haven't checked your figures but I have a hunch much of that is in the form
of tax breaks, if companies do certain things the government agrees not to
steal as much from them. If I decide not to stick a gun in your face today and
rob you of 50$, does that mean I've subsidized you? Should you thank me?

Having said that, I have no doubt the government does play favorites with
companies, by crushing competitors with force in the name of anti trust laws,
I'm also sure part of that 1400$ figure of yours is indeed a subsidy. I don't
think anyone or anything should be subsidized by tax dollars because I don't
think their should be any tax dollars.

I repeat my question because I don't consider that a satisfactory reply. In a
democracy, if I am unwilling to voluntarily give money to poor people why 
would I vote for a politician who would force me to do it through taxes? 
In a dictatorship, why would angering the most powerful people in society and 
becoming a friend of those least able to help the dictator stay in power be a 
wise move for him to make?

And the only way to abolish private property is by force. If you want to 
live on a socialist commune that has no private property I have not the
slightest objection, and I wish you the best of luck, you'll need it. I do
have one very important question however, how do you intend to deal with
people like me who don't want to join your workers paradise and just 
want to be left alone? Will you try to convince me to join by your splendid 
example, by showing me how fabulously prosperous your community is and how 
educated and happy the people are, OR, can I expect a knock on my door at 3am 
from people wearing uniforms?

And History has shown that the best way to get rid of poverty is to get rid
of private property, that's why the former Soviet Union is the economic
powerhouse it is today, that's also why it's a crime free paradise with the 
workers having not a worry in the world.

In Anarcho- Capitalism, there would still be police and there would still be
law, but it would be private police and private law. PPL's (privately produced
law) in a anarchic world would have private protection agencies (PPA's) to
back them up. Disputes among PPA's would be settled by an independent
arbitrator agreed to by both parties BEFORE the disagreement happened.
Something like that can happen today. When companies sign complicated
contracts they sometimes also agree on who will arbitrate it if differences 
in interpretation happen. Nobody want to get caught up in the slow, expensive
court system run by governments. The arbitrator would be paid by the case,
and because he is picked by both sides, it's in his interest to be as just as
possible. If he favored one side over another or made brutal or stupid
decisions he would not be picked again and would need to look for a new line
of work. Unlike present day judges and juries, justice would have a positive
survival value for the arbitrator. 
                      
All parties would have a reason to avoid violence if possible. The disputing 
parties would not want to turn their front yard into a war zone, and violence 
is expensive. The successful protection agencies would be more interested in 
making money than saving face. Most of the time this would work so I expect
the total level of violence to be less than what we have now, but I'm not 
such a utopian as to suggest it will drop to zero. Even when force is not 
used the implicit threat is always there, another good reason to be civilized.
                      
I'm not talking about justice only for the rich. If a  rich man's 
PPA makes unreasonable demands (beatings, sidewalk justice, I insist on my 
mother being the judge if I get into trouble)  it's going to need 
one hell of a lot of firepower to back it up. That kind of an army is 
expensive because of the hardware needed and because of the very high wages 
it will need to pay its employees for an extremely dangerous job. To pay for 
all this they will need to charge their clients enormous fees severely 
limiting their customer base and that means even higher charges. They could
never get the upper hand, because the common man's PPA would be able to 
outspend a PPA that had  outrageous demands and was just for the super rich. 
A yacht cost a lot more than a car, yet the Ford motor Company is far richer 
than all the yacht builders on the planet combined. 
                      
No system can guarantee justice to everybody all the time but you'd have the 
greatest chance of finding it in Anarcho-capitalism. In a dictatorship one 
man's whim can lead to hell on earth, I don't see how 40 million Germans 
could have murdered 6 million Jews in a Anarcho-capitalistic world. Things
aren't much better in a Democracy, 51% can decide to kill the other 49% ,  
nothing even close to that is possible in Anarchy , even theoretically .    
                      
In general, the desire not to be killed is much stronger than the desire to 
kill a stranger, even a Jewish  stranger. Jews  would be willing to pay as 
much as necessary, up to and including their entire net worth not to be 
killed. I doubt if even the most rabid anti Semite would go much beyond 2%. 
As a result the PPA protecting Jews  would be much stronger than the one that 
wants to kill them. In Anarchy, for things that are REALLY important to you 
( like not getting  killed) you have much more influence than just one man 
one vote.   
                        

                > you can have too much liberty.  
                

Well, unfortunately the world is structured in such a way that it's physically
impossible for everybody to have an infinite amount of liberty, it's probably
impossible to have an infinite amount of any virtue, but that doesn't mean it
has a limit, you can and should always strive for more. Equality on the other
hand has a limit, enough is enough.
                        

                >Operating a mill  better tends to mean "how much wages can I

Yes, but if I make my workers unhappy enough it will reduce their output to
zero because they'll quit.

The bankruptcy courts are littered with the carcasses of corporations that
ignored cultural differences and tried to get their customers to conform to
the companies wishes rather than the reverse. In general I can't imagine a
better or faster way to go broke.

If joining your "Anarcho-syndicalism" is voluntary then it's a business, if
it's not voluntary then it's a Government, if it's neither then it's nothing.


                >business people have pretty much the  same power as a

No they do not. If I don't like what a company is selling I don't have to
buy it, it makes no difference if I like what government is selling or not,
I must buy it or people will come to my house and drag me away.
Everybody agrees that force is justified in self defense, but government 
claims far more rights than that, more than any sane individual or 
corporation would dream of. If government needs money they take it, if I 
object to them stealing my property they will use force to get their way, 
as much force as they need to, up to and including a bullet in my brain. 
They will NOT take "no" for an answer. I don't think Government should not
have more rights than individuals, but then of course, then they wouldn't
be governments.

Not so, some labor we do for love, as when we take care of our children.
There are only 3 ways to get somebody to do something you want, love, trade,
or force. I like to encourage the first two and keep force to a minimum.

That's not a subsidy? You would be using force to make companies spend
billions of dollars to pipe this drivel into everybody's house and waste
valuable bandwidth that most people would rather put to a different use.

How much force are you going to use to get it? You will also need a

charge of this centralized power? Can I have the job? I promise that my only

Well, I think you could probably pick up an old 286 with a 2400 baud modem

but just a few years ago it was hot stuff, it's certainly powerful enough
to expose the world to your ideas. If nobody is interested in your words you
can't blame the computer.

Now we've gone from "another" to "a finite number."  Are you sure 
there will be more than one?

Ok, so there are lines, plural; and...

Again there are lines, plural.  But is this necessary?   

Imagine a grid of dots, some red, some "off".  The red ones represent 
possible states of the universe, the others represent impossible states.  
What if you take a point in the latter group, one of the "off" points:  
   Does the concept "Feynman interaction" still apply to it?  
   Does it too have lines leading to other points?  
   If so, do all its lines lead to other "off" points, or could some of them 
      lead to red points?  
   In other words, could you have a situation where each red point 
      has more than one line leading into it, but only one of those 
      incoming lines comes from another red point?   

Suppose each red point does have more than one line leading out, 
toward other points.  Does it follow that each red point has more than 
one line leading into it?  No!  Consider:   

Let the integers be represented by points on a line.  Suppose numbers 
divisible by three are red:  3, 6, 9, 12, etc.  All other numbers are "off."  
Suppose each point n has two lines leading out, one going to 3n + 1, 
the other going to 3n + 2.  
   Each point has two outgoing lines.  
   Each point has at most one incoming line.
   Red points have no incoming lines.  

Of course this universe would die out quickly; I'm just using it as an 
example to show that it is possible to have more than one line leading 
out of each point, without having more than one (or any!) leading into 
the red points.  

So, your conclusion, 

>  One point to notice here is that every state of the Universe

is far from obvious, at least to me.  Maybe I'm missing something.

Having taught myself to fly radio-controlled sailplanes years ago by
observing the behavior of local soaring raptors and spent some time around
bald eagles in the Pacific Northwest before that, I can confirm how rarely
these birds speak.  Like most predators they are ... errh ... economical

Regarding the discussion of labor vs. management and labor vs. capital,
here's a question I've toyed with over the years and to which I've been
unable to come up with satisfactory answers:

     Why isn't there more competition between "unions"?

I can see price competition between unions driving wages down without great
benefit to workers, especially toward the unskilled side of the spectrum.  On
the other hand, I can see unions competing in two directions: To provide good
labor-service at a competitive price on the one hand and to provide good
social services to their members on the other.  In theory, simple price might
not be the only index of competition on the "labor sales" side if unions that
offered better social services (group health plans, education co-ops, etc.)
attracted higher-quality workers.

Any thoughts from the less economically-retarded than me?

Well, this depends largely on the task. According to what I have learned
about group psychology, some tasks are very suitable for group-work, while
others aren't. If the task can be subdivided in some way, then the group
members can divide the task between them, and become much more efficient
(this is why we have corporations). Other tasks cannot be subdivided well,
and the group will not be significantly better than the smartest member
(sometimes it will do worse, as ideas are ignored or logistics hinder real
work). In some cases groups can show emergent intelligence such as in
brainstorming or when experts from different specialities get together and
cross-pollinate, but this is hard to organize.

The big question is: how do we get knowledge instead of information or 
(worse) data? 

Case in point: it is becoming harder and harder to find useful 
information on the WWW using search engines, since the probability of 
finding a short presentation of a subject (very useful) is decreasing as 
more and more corporate webpages attract the hits instead (it may be 
useful to know that XYZ Corp researches frobnology, but what I need is a 
quick overview of what frobnology is about). Maybe we need a special 
knowledge search engine that just looks at pages certified to contain 
useful information, not just advertisments or spam.

..For example, while one can imagine predatory probes sent to search

if such colonization were cheap.  Aggressive colonization would give
them all the more probes to work with, and deny resources to
competitors.  If this colonization effort could hide its origins from
those who might retaliate, what would they have to lose?

[[Hiding its origins may require forgetting them. If this is the case, 
then 
colonization becomes a pointless exercise. Denying resources requires 
an 
a priori evaluation of the potential competitors capabilities, which 
probably
 is not possible in practice.
>From another side, one feature of Superintelligence is the ability to

current 
social theory inapplicable. ]]

Finally, we expect advanced life to substantially disturb the places
it colonizes.  ...  And unless ideal
structures always either closely mimic natural appearances or are
effectively invisible, we expect advanced life to make visible
changes. 
 
[[Visible changes are an invitation for destruction.]]

If such advanced life had substantially colonized our planet, we would
know it by now.

[[Unless we are it, courtesy of panspermia.]]

One possibility is that fast space travel and colonization between
stars and galaxies is much harder than it looks, and effectively
impossible, even for nanotech-based machine intelligence.  The
interstellar medium, for example, may be much harsher than we realize.

[[The least understood component of the medium seems to be the density 
and distribution of dust grains, rocks, and planet-size objects (some 
progress
 has been made on this very recently). One method of countering this 
obstacle 
is to blast clear corridors ahead of the probes.]]

This would suggest we have good chances of surviving, but little
prospect of leaving our solar system at any substantial speed.  The
slower the maximum speed, the smaller is the Great Filter that needs
to be explained.

[[I dont think this changes the equation much- an interplanetary 
civilization can
 still generate enough anomalous activity to be noticeable. The time 
required for
 their early signals to reach us would always be less than the time 
required for
 signals from their colonized star systems, again assuming no FTL 
travel.
The maximum speed for atomically structured matter may be (depending on 
shielding, 
interstellar medium density, self-repair speed, etc.) much less than 
the maximum
speed for relativistic bombs and beams. It is certainly less than the 
speed-of-light 
weapons, such aselectromagnetic, gravitational wave, other types of 
Spacetime or 
fundamental constant distortion pulses, and such.
Nuclear holocaust is only the introduction to the concept of 
intelligently guided, instant 
and total annihilation. One lesson has been that offense (first strike) 
is always easier than
 defense, indeed a defense may be effectively impossible. If Mutually 
Assured 
Destruction was, instead, Unilaterally Assured Destruction, as it would 
be if your 
potential enemies lived on other worlds, then first strike takes on a 
fresh appeal. For 
instance, a  few kilograms of matter, launched at our planet from 
anywhere in the galaxy 
at  very near the speed of light, would suffice to bomb us back to the 
{{Precambrian}}
 Age. The early warning interval can be dialed down to a fraction of a 
second, if so 
desired.
It wasnt mentioned in the Starseed/Launcher articles,
http://www.speakeasy.org/~forrestb
 but  a scaled up version of  this kind of device can serve as a low profile
world-buster. The website is rather popular at the national labs.]]

..First, large-scale engineering such as orbiting solar collectors 
made
from asteroids, Dyson spheres, and stellar disassembling might be
effectively impossible, explaining why nearby stars look so natural.

[[It does seem to be well within the realm of present day engineering
practice to build structures in space large enough to downshift the 
Solar
 spectrum.]]

Second, structures that best use such resources might happen to almost
always preserve natural spectra and other appearances.

[[It might be wise to actively ensure that ones constructs are well 
camouflaged.]]

..Similarly, Papagiannis claims that "those that manage to overcome
their innate tendencies toward continuous material growth and replace
them with non-material goals will be the only ones to survive this
crisis," implying a galaxy "populated by stable highly ethical and
spiritual civilizations"  [Papagiannis 84].

[[Whatever that means. Maybe simply attributing caution to these
 imagined civilizations would suffice.]]

And Stephenson claims that
"for a truly advanced intelligence the drive for quality rather than
redundant quantity would be paramount" [Stephenson 82].

[[There may be practical upper limits on the size of a (self  aware)
 computer, beyond whicha high power function of signal propagation
 speed, OS complexity, etc. diminishesor even reverses the gains in
 computational power. Gravitational limits also come into play, long
before a Jupiter-size brain is reached.
 A superintelligencemay find at some point it doesnt want to get any
bigger.This point may be physically small.  Sending clones of itself to 
o
ther star systems would not help its realtime crunching at all.]]

..  The point is that in general the creatures whose purposes lead to 
the 
most reproduction end up dominating the future. 

[[This an argument for quantity over quality. Since viri and bacteria 
reproduce the fastest and the mostest, do they therefore dominate?]]

Conclusion

No alien civilizations have substantially colonized our solar system
or systems nearby. 

[[True.]]

Thus among a billion trillion stars in our past
universe, none has reached the level of technology and growth that we
may soon reach.

[[But I am not sure this follows.]]

	A sufficiently advanced intelligence (say human-level) might 
decide 
that refurbishing its stellar neighborhood is  simply not a good idea. 
No matter 
how smart it might get, it must still always wonder: is there something 
out there 
that is even smarter? Might that something  prefer to exterminate its 
space-time 
neighbors? Does it fret about _its_  possible neighbors, and their 
intentions?
If this is the case, or even if it is _perceived_ to be the case by the 
posited 
extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI), said ETI would take every 
precaution to 
maintain a very low profile, even at the expense of foregoing potential 
resource 
grabs.
	The first few civilizations to arise after the Big Bang (which 
may 
include us) would have _no way_ of knowing (barring superluminal 
messaging) 
that they were indeed the first, and so would have to proceed under the 
prudent 
assumption that there are others out there who might not be friendly.
	Any stellar-scale engineering project can attract unwelcome 
attention. 
Dyson Spheres make particularly easy targets- just nova the hearthfire. 
Perhaps 
use a relativistic black hole or brown dwarf, launched from a Great Void. Or 
perhaps a large, relativistic nanoprobe phalanx [Bishop 96]would 
suffice to 
initiate fusion in the structure of the Dyson Sphere itself, or at 
least give 
everything in the neighborhood a comprehensive radiation bath.
	In October, 1991, a telescope called the Fly Eye [REF] (because 
of its 
appearance) picked up a most unusual signal. This event consisted of a 
single 
particle, probably a proton, smashing into Earths atmosphere with an 
energy as 
far greater than any conceivable natural process could produce as a 
{{supernova 
is to the meanderings of a bacterium}}. Although the energy of that 
particle was 
also vastly in excess of anything we can produce, it would be foolish 
to rule out 
the possibility of an artificial origin. A long enough (say, the 
diameter of the 
Solar System) linear particle accelerator may be able to produce this 
kind of 
energy (10^20+ EV). Interestingly enough, the proton could not have 
come 
from more than a hundred million light years away, due to virtual 
photon 
exchange with the cosmic background radiation [REF].
Now why would someone in our neighborhood, as it were, go to the 
trouble of 
generating such a thing, in sufficient quantity that one actually ends 
up striking 
Earth (probably by accident). One particular reason does come to mind.

The Loud Mouths

	If Civilization A were to rig up a star as a Universe-wide radio 
transmitter [Hanson 96] (this is something we are technically almost 
able to do), 
then Civilization B might come along and nova that star, for a variety 
reasons 
(naturally, they would try to make it look like an accident).
A gedanken: If you were the potentially immortal possessor of a Universe-wide 
transmitter, what would you broadcast (besides the inherent here I am, come 
and get me)? Mind you,  your technical prowess can be deduced from 
that 
same radio signal and its content, unless you are clever enough to 
disguise it,
which requires you to be absolutely certain of the disguise (this would 
be done 
to lure your lessers to their doom). You had also better be quite sure 
that no 
entity within range, in this case the entire known  Universe, would be 
willing 
and able to destroy you. And how are you to find _that_ out?
	To the question of what sort of entities might do such supremely 
horrific deeds, one hardly need look to the stars for an answer.

Radio Shells

	It may be that we decide not to allow artificial EMR to leave the 
solar 
system any more. The resulting expanding sphere becomes a spherical 
shell, say 
a light century or two thick, with a correspondingly lowered 
probability of 
intercept. 
	Space may be populated with these expanding radio shells, 
passing 
through one another like ghosts in the void. The emitters either decide 
to cease 
unilaterally, or something from the dark comes and does it for -and to- 
them.
	The leading surface of these bubbles would be weak and sporadic, 
consisting of the odd radio experiment and early transmissions. As one 
passes 
by, the signals would become increasingly sophisticated and broaden in 
bandwidth. A listener would hear the alien versions of the Fireside 
Chats, then 
I Love Lucy, rising to a crescendo of Die Hard With a Vengeance, 
Then Die 
Some More V1 reruns, and then only silence.
	Our current SETI may be confined to a lucky intercept of one of these 
ETI radio shells, which would then tell us the past location and development of 
a tech civilization. We could then say, with near certainty, that that 
civilization 
was far (post-Singularity, or exterminated by another such) ahead of 
ours at the 
time of our intercept, and thus posed a real threat to our existence, 
or no longer 
exists. If we have intercepted their shell, they or their exterminators 
will 
certainly be intercepting ours. Both civilizations may launch what they 
hope will 
be quiet, preemptive strikes against the other. This is another 
justification
for SETI that probably is already used, in the appropriate setting 
(spook 
houses).
	Perhaps we might also scale back on the HAARPesque [HAARP] style 
experiments, messing around with unnaturally high RF energy densities, 
that 
sort of  thing, for the same reason. Nuclear explosives can also yield 
a signature 
X-ray and gamma-ray release. However, weve already demonstrated a 
willingness to risk it all; there were some project scientists that 
thought the first 
atomic bomb might initiate a runaway chain reaction in the Earths 
atmosphere 
(this was also disproved on theoretical grounds- after the fact!).
	As for evidence of large engineering projects, perhaps we think 
too 
small. Perhaps the Great Walls and Voids themselves are the remnants of 
titanic 
exterminations of yestergigayear.

Hey Ho, Lets Go

	If we do decide to colonize, with the above in mind, it may not 
be wise 
to expand into the galaxy in a spherical manner, with direct 
communication  
back to the homeworld. That kind of expansion would indicate the direction of 
the homeworld, and the rough size of the colonized volume, at every point of 
the expansion.  Perhaps we will use an irregular, zigzag method, with some 
doubling back. Still, at every new star system there is the chance of 
an 
unfriendly reception.
	Maybe we will stick with microgram-class starprobes, and wipe 
their 
origin from their memory. When they grow up and hyperevolve in their 
new star 
system,  at some point they will meet their cousins and ancestors. 
Either they 
merge, or one destroys as much of the other as it can find. So then 
everyone is 
the enemy- whether of human or alien ancestry.
As there is still a possibility of alien intercept, our descendants 
might decide that 
interstellar travel is imperative for assured survival, on the above 
grounds (not 
simply because the sun will die).
And now a dilemma: are the starprobes allowed to retain their ancestral 

memories, with the danger that poses to the Launchers and others, or do 
they 
wipe it- with the result above?
And if they do not that retain that memory, can they even be considered 
kin?

The Watchers

Perhaps the Great Filter [Hanson 96] can be explained by the hypothesis 
that the 
Universe is just not a friendly place.
A small alien nanotech probe may already have been in our Solar System 
for 
hundred of millions of years. To a self-repairing, nanotech machine an 
eon is but 
a twinkling. Its directives might be to:
1) Hide from everything.
2) Observe.
3) If a potential threat to the probes Launcher arises, then and only then 
neutralize that threat, and again, try to do it quietly.
If this is the case, we will find out shortly. We have already passed 
through the 
first checkpoint for this scenario, by developing radio. A 
microgram-class self-
replicating probe has had a century to grow to any size it wished to, 
and to 
create and preposition its devices in the event we attempt serious 
space travel.

And if one, why not several, from several different folks? They may 
be playing 
hide-and-seek with each other, as well. It will be very easy to 
disguise such a 
probe as an ordinary asteroid, immune to every kind of remote sensing, 
or by 
using a photon-addressable phased-array cloaking device [Wouk].

And so they may indeed be around these parts, hiding, watching, 
waiting.

			low profile


[...]
	A sufficiently advanced intelligence (say human-level) might 
decide 
that refurbishing its stellar neighborhood is  simply not a good idea. 
No matter 
how smart it might get, it must still always wonder: is there something 
out there 
that is even smarter? Might that something  prefer to exterminate its 
space-time 
neighbors? Does it fret about _its_  possible neighbors, and their 
intentions?
If this is the case, or even if it is _perceived_ to be the case by the 
posited 
extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI), said ETI would take every 
precaution to 
maintain a very low profile, even at the expense of foregoing potential 
resource 
grabs.
	The first few civilizations to arise after the Big Bang (which 
may 
include us) would have _no way_ of knowing (barring superluminal 
messaging) 
that they were indeed the first, and so would have to proceed under the 
prudent 
assumption that there are others out there who might not be friendly.
	Any stellar-scale engineering project can attract unwelcome 
attention. 
Dyson Spheres make particularly easy targets- just nova the hearthfire. 
Perhaps 
use a relativistic black hole or brown dwarf, launched from a Great Void. Or 
perhaps a large, relativistic nanoprobe phalanx [Bishop 96]would 
suffice to 
initiate fusion in the structure of the Dyson Sphere itself, or at 
least give 
everything in the neighborhood a comprehensive radiation bath.
	In October, 1991, a telescope called the Fly Eye [REF] (because 
of its 
appearance) picked up a most unusual signal. This event consisted of a 
single 
particle, probably a proton, smashing into Earths atmosphere with an 
energy as 
far greater than any conceivable natural process could produce as a 
{{supernova 
is to the meanderings of a bacterium}}. Although the energy of that 
particle was 
also vastly in excess of anything we can produce, it would be foolish 
to rule out 
the possibility of an artificial origin. A long enough (say, the 
diameter of the 
Solar System) linear particle accelerator may be able to produce this 
kind of 
energy (10^20+ EV). Interestingly enough, the proton could not have 
come 
from more than a hundred million light years away, due to virtual 
photon 
exchange with the cosmic background radiation [REF].
Now why would someone in our neighborhood, as it were, go to the 
trouble of 
generating such a thing, in sufficient quantity that one actually ends 
up striking 
Earth (probably by accident). One particular reason does come to mind.

The Loud Mouths

	If Civilization A were to rig up a star as a Universe-wide radio 
transmitter [Hanson 96] (this is something we are technically almost 
able to do), 
then Civilization B might come along and nova that star, for a variety 
reasons 
(naturally, they would try to make it look like an accident).
A gedanken: If you were the potentially immortal possessor of a Universe-wide 
transmitter, what would you broadcast (besides the inherent here I am, come 
and get me)? Mind you,  your technical prowess can be deduced from 
that 
same radio signal and its content, unless you are clever enough to 
disguise it,
which requires you to be absolutely certain of the disguise (this would 
be done 
to lure your lessers to their doom). You had also better be quite sure 
that no 
entity within range, in this case the entire known  Universe, would be 
willing 
and able to destroy you. And how are you to find _that_ out?
	To the question of what sort of entities might do such supremely 
horrific deeds, one hardly need look to the stars for an answer.

Radio Shells

	It may be that we decide not to allow artificial EMR to leave the 
solar 
system any more. The resulting expanding sphere becomes a spherical 
shell, say 
a light century or two thick, with a correspondingly lowered 
probability of 
intercept. 
	Space may be populated with these expanding radio shells, 
passing 
through one another like ghosts in the void. The emitters either decide 
to cease 
unilaterally, or something from the dark comes and does it for -and to- 
them.
	The leading surface of these bubbles would be weak and sporadic, 
consisting of the odd radio experiment and early transmissions. As one 
passes 
by, the signals would become increasingly sophisticated and broaden in 
bandwidth. A listener would hear the alien versions of the Fireside 
Chats, then 
I Love Lucy, rising to a crescendo of Die Hard With a Vengeance, 
Then Die 
Some More V1 reruns, and then only silence.
	Our current SETI may be confined to a lucky intercept of one of these 
ETI radio shells, which would then tell us the past location and development of 
a tech civilization. We could then say, with near certainty, that that 
civilization 
was far (post-Singularity, or exterminated by another such) ahead of 
ours at the 
time of our intercept, and thus posed a real threat to our existence, 
or no longer 
exists. If we have intercepted their shell, they or their exterminators 
will 
certainly be intercepting ours. Both civilizations may launch what they 
hope will 
be quiet, preemptive strikes against the other. This is another 
justification
for SETI that probably is already used, in the appropriate setting 
(spook 
houses).
	Perhaps we might also scale back on the HAARPesque [HAARP] style 
experiments, messing around with unnaturally high RF energy densities, 
that 
sort of  thing, for the same reason. Nuclear explosives can also yield 
a signature 
X-ray and gamma-ray release. However, weve already demonstrated a 
willingness to risk it all; there were some project scientists that 
thought the first 
atomic bomb might initiate a runaway chain reaction in the Earths 
atmosphere 
(this was also disproved on theoretical grounds- after the fact!).
	As for evidence of large engineering projects, perhaps we think 
too 
small. Perhaps the Great Walls and Voids themselves are the remnants of 
titanic 
exterminations of yestergigayear.

Hey Ho, Lets Go

	If we do decide to colonize, with the above in mind, it may not 
be wise 
to expand into the galaxy in a spherical manner, with direct 
communication  
back to the homeworld. That kind of expansion would indicate the direction of 
the homeworld, and the rough size of the colonized volume, at every point of 
the expansion.  Perhaps we will use an irregular, zigzag method, with some 
doubling back. Still, at every new star system there is the chance of 
an 
unfriendly reception.
	Maybe we will stick with microgram-class starprobes, and wipe 
their 
origin from their memory. When they grow up and hyperevolve in their 
new star 
system,  at some point they will meet their cousins and ancestors. 
Either they 
merge, or one destroys as much of the other as it can find. So then 
everyone is 
the enemy- whether of human or alien ancestry.
As there is still a possibility of alien intercept, our descendants 
might decide that 
interstellar travel is imperative for assured survival, on the above 
grounds (not 
simply because the sun will die).
And now a dilemma: are the starprobes allowed to retain their ancestral 

memories, with the danger that poses to the Launchers and others, or do 
they 
wipe it- with the result above?
And if they do not that retain that memory, can they even be considered 
kin?

The Watchers

Perhaps the Great Filter [Hanson 96] can be explained by the hypothesis 
that the 
Universe is just not a friendly place.
A small alien nanotech probe may already have been in our Solar System 
for 
hundred of millions of years. To a self-repairing, nanotech machine an 
eon is but 
a twinkling. Its directives might be to:
1) Hide from everything.
2) Observe.
3) If a potential threat to the probes Launcher arises, then and only then 
neutralize that threat, and again, try to do it quietly.
If this is the case, we will find out shortly. We have already passed 
through the 
first checkpoint for this scenario, by developing radio. A 
microgram-class self-
replicating probe has had a century to grow to any size it wished to, 
and to 
create and preposition its devices in the event we attempt serious 
space travel.

And if one, why not several, from several different folks? They may 
be playing 
hide-and-seek with each other, as well. It will be very easy to 
disguise such a 
probe as an ordinary asteroid, immune to every kind of remote sensing, 
or by 
using a photon-addressable phased-array cloaking device [Wouk].

And so they may indeed be around these parts, hiding, watching, 
waiting.

I have found these types of curves interesting as well, though I don't think
they are necessarily unextropian. I can envision a series of such curves in
succession. As the growth in one curve starts leveling off, new processes
(which I think can be viewed as extropian - BE, ST, IT ) take over and start
a new curve. I can also see the time interval required to complete a new
curve sequence possibly getting shorter and shorter. Speculation: perhaps
the rate of the shortening of the time interval would also follow such a
curve (a fractal-like relationship)?

I think this type of growth curve can be applied to increases in population
or wealth. Most of what I would consider credible estimates of future world
population predict a stabilization somewhere in the 10 to 15 billion range.
This would make a curve like the one mentioned. I can also see more similar
shaped curves taking off from the previous one with the colonization of the
rest of the solar system, neighboring systems, etc.

A friend of one of my co-workers is a designer at Intel. The computer he
works on has about 2GB! of RAM, which is what's needed to simulate the
activity of all the individual transitors on the next generations of chips.

On Tuesday, October 8, 1996, Suresh Naidu wrote several things which I have 
questions about.  His statements are in quotes, and my questions and  comments 
(mostly comments) follow each quote:

"My point is that competition cannot help worker conditions, nor can it 
eliminate the authoritarian nature of business."

	Why can't competition help worker conditions?  A worker is someone with a 
commodity to sell, namely, their labor.  The factory owner or any other 
employer is in the market for labor; they wish to purchase labor.  Just as you 
would likely buy a product for the lowest price possible, the employer will 
look for people who will sell their labor for the lowest price that gives the 
employer the highest quality of work they can get for that price.  So there is 
a competition among the workers to see who can provide the highest quality 
labor at the lowest price, just as there is a competition between businesses 
to provide the highest quality products at the lowest price.  
	But there are a limited number of workers, especially workers who perform 
high quality labor.  So there is a competition among employers to attract the 
high quality workers to work for them, rather than someone else.  So, they 
offer higher wages then their competitors, to attract the better workers.  
Thus, the competition between workers holds their wages down, while the 
competition between employers for high quality labor tends to raise the wages. 
 But, of course, only the workers who are willing to train themselves to 
perform high-quality labor will benefit from this competition between 
employers.  
	So, you're right, I suppose; workers who produce shoddy work will not benefit 
from competition, just as businesses who produce shoddy products will not 
benefit from competition.  But, and this is very important, people who take 
the time and effort to develop their skills and talents, to better themselves 
and produce high-quality labor and products, WILL benefit from competition.  
People will tend to purchase the products and labor that they offer, rather 
than from someone else.  I don't imagine that you deliberately buy inferior 
products at nearly the same price as much higher-quality products.  Nor do I 
think you would hire some slothful, sloppy worker who charged as much as a 
very skilled, energetic worker.  It is because humans demand quality that the 
system you bemoan exists. And it is because humans demand quality that we 
progress at all.
	Remember that our ancestors had little more than rocks, sticks, dirt and 
other plants and animals to use.  This was all they had available to them, 
until innovative people started using those resources to create something 
better for themselves.  All our technology and wealth, beyond what our distant 
ancestors had, exists because humans created it.  Don't expect that workers 
will have any thing more than our ancestors did, unless they earn it.  They 
must put forth the effort and create their own wealth, they can't expect that 
those who do create wealth are going to just share it with them.  They need to 
provide competitive labor and products, just like all the people who built 
this great enterprise of Civilization have done.  
	Civilization was not built by slackers who moaned about the unfairness of the 
world.  It was built by people who were willing to improve themselves and 
provide better services and products than others could.  It was built by 
people who were willing to put themselves in competition with others, to see 
who could provide the best work and products, by people continually building 
the self-discipline to compete successfully.  If some people aren't willing to 
do this, then they don't deserve any more than our ancestors had, because if 
our ancestors hadn't done all the work they did, they would never have had all 
the wealth they created.  If people aren't up to the competition, then maybe 
you could throw them scraps from the table of success, but to sit around that 
table they must pull themselves off the floor, with their own effort and their 
own self-discipline.  They must earn the right to sit around the table and 
enjoy wealth with the others who have earned the right to it.
	The Capitalist System is not some sort of magic milk machine with teats 
sticking out all over for every freeloader to suck on.  It was never meant to 
take care of anyone.  The Capitalist System arises because people have things 
they want to sell to each other.  One person may build good huts while another 
is good at hunting or growing food, so they make an agreement with each other 
to exchange services.  That is all it is.  It is simply people trading what 
they have for something else they want.  People sell to the highest bidder and 
buy things for as little as possible.  To profit from this system of trading, 
you must  be competitive with the others engaged in it.  Those who can't be 
competitive simply won't find people who are willing to make an agreement to 
trade with them.  And there is no reason to expect that anyone *should* trade 
with them, if what they offer is much worse than what others offer.  You 
wouldn't buy rotten apples from someone when the person next to them is 
selling fresh apples for nearly the same price.
	The Capitalist System cannot be expected to save Humanity, especially not 
from it's own stupidity and laziness.  These are just the hard facts of 
reality.  People won't buy inferior products, when better ones are as 
available.  Therefore, only the people who can provide better products 
(including labor) than others will be able to secure a trade with others for 
what they have to offer.  People have to look out for themselves in this 
world; they can't expect others to just take care of them, especially if they 
have little to offer in return.
	Yes, there is a great deal of "unfairness" within reality.  But that is 
simply a result of reality not being uniform.  Reality will never be fair; all 
we can do is just do the best we can with the resources we have available to 
us.  This has always been true, even before humans evolved.

"What I propose is this:Anarcho-syndicalism, as advocated by Rudolf 
Rocker and Noam Chomsky, souped up into a hi-tech version by yours truly. 
Private property is abolished, as the only way to hold 
private property is by right of force, and since there is no need for a 
government to keep people in check, that would be abolished as well. Most 
crime comes from poverty, and the rest can easily be dealt  with by 
citizens.  Okay, ask me questions."
...
"equal access to resources 
to do with as you will, provided it doesn't harm 
anyone else's access or human rights. This needs 
some elaboration, which I will provide if asked."

	Are you serious about abolishing private property?  Do you think everyone has 
a right to the work of others?  Lets say I spend a great deal of time and 
energy building a house to live in.  Since you are advocating abolishing 
private property, this would mean that after all my work, I most likely 
wouldn't even get to sleep in the house since there are so many people out 
there who would just love to sleep in my house for me.  People who don't want 
to build their own houses would just wait for others to build houses and then 
just move in when they're done.  The builders of the houses would never get a 
place of their own, they would realize that continuing to build houses was 
futile, since they'd never get to live in one, unless they forcefully kept 
others from invading their work.
	Or what about a farmer?  They spend long hours each day tending their fields. 
 Are you really suggesting that everyone else should be allowed to just come 
in like a swarm of locusts and take that food and not give the farmer anything 
in return?  If so, then why would people want to farm?  They could just let 
other people do it and then take the food from them when it's ready.
	What sort of resources are you suggesting we allow everyone equal access to?  
My computer is a resource which I spent many months paying for with my labor.  
Are you suggesting I invite the whole neighborhood over to use it?  When would 
I get a chance?  If everyone is supposed to have equal access to every 
resource, then it would be very difficult to make anything.  If someone was 
making a pot out of clay, for example, then the clay they're using is fair 
game for anyone else to come along and take from them, since it's a resource, 
even if they're in the middle of using it to make the pot.  Are you *really* 
suggesting that they allow people to just take their work from them, rather 
than block equal access to resources?
	
>>>

"Unless (gasp) the workers ran the mill themselves.  Operating a mill 
better tends to mean "how much wages can I take away without reducing the 
output of my workers. "

	If the workers really *can* run the mill themselves, then why don't they get 
together and decide to do just that?  Why can't a group of people all agree 
together to run a business?  Most likely, the workers are not competent to run 
the mill themselves or are not capable of working together effectively enough 
to run a mill that can compete with other ones.  If it was more profitable to 
run a mill where every worker runs the thing together, on equal footing, then 
it would out-compete the ones which don't use this strategy.  
	By the way, an increasing number of businesses are realizing that they do 
better when the employees have feedback into how the business is run, and 
they're using strategies such as profit-sharing to give their employees a real 
interest in helping the company do better.  If these ways of doing business 
are more profitable than other ways, then eventually, there *will* be 
businesses that are run by the workers.

	Suresh, I know you haven't explained your ideas in any detail, so I don't 
wish to attack them, since I'm unclear on what they really are.  But what 
you've given so far, about not allowing private property and allowing equal 
access to resources doesn't make any sense to me, for the reasons I indicated 
above.  Please explain your ideas in more detail; put them forth into the 
memetic competition, and let them be tested.  Give us equal access to the 
resources of your mind and stop hoarding your ideas from us, after all you 
don't own your own mind, that would be private property. :-)

Exactly.  It's not something you read in a book--probably Churchill's 
weakness.  I only caught onto it because I spent a year working with 
birds of prey at the Raptor Institute.

Actually, this is where genetic technology can far outstrip nanotech, at
least sooner. The programming is already there. Programming a horde of
nanobots to regrow an arm is a non-trivial task. It is far easier to use
genetic and bio technology to do these things. We should look at what
nanotech can do that is inefficient for other technolgies. Nanotech could
quite possibly be a cure-all, but it will be an inefficient one initially.   

But wait..New thought just hit. You can use fractal and self-replicating
mathematics and the like to program nanobots, could you not. Would that
increase the efficiency substantially? Or has this already been discussed.

You are correct when dealing with a high-level industry, such as computer
software. However, in low-skill menial labour, which is usually allocated
to people based on geography or class, not skill. There is a limit to the
number of carpets people can put out in a day. Most of our crap jobs are
given to people in other lands, imposed on them by businesses that buy the
land out from underneath people by striking deals with whatever authority
is already in place. Then they put the people in a state of serfdom.
Businesses don't need to have any respect for the low end producers, just
the high end consumers. Look at the clothing industry. 
	Even in high tech, there is severe disparity in wages. Some
software companies import top-notch indian programmers, keep them in
"software sweatshops" and pay them INDIAN wages. That strikes me as
grossly unfair, because more highly educated and skilled people are being
manipulated by sleazy managers.

Okay, call me one of those crazy idealists, but what about if people
worked to better each other rather than only themsleves. Science
innovations could be shared by the entire commune. Everybody is working
for the benefit of all. I  think  cooperation can produce the
best item for the lowest price, simply because everyone contributes what
they can. Of course, this requires a bit of social conscience, but I'm
hoping we as a species get out of this greed rut and into something
sustainable.

No, people would all need to do something, but there is an
element of compassion and interdependence. The farmer supports the builder
of houses with
food, while the builder of houses builds for the farmer, who possibly has
enough to support a computer engineer, who would help hook the houses up
to the net. It is mutual cooperation, instead of feeding parasites.
Everybody puts their produce towards each other, without wanting
than they need. Of course, as the technology level increases, the general
level of everybody will increase, until humanity has fulfilled the
extropian vision of ascension. Cooperation would work so much better than
competition, because you get much more voluntary work.

My fundamental moral principle is that all forms of coercion are bad,
government and private property are pretty much the two biggest forms of
coercion I can think of. You know about government coercion, but who backs
up your right to property if not government. You and your superior
firepower. Blatant application of force. 

See above,  but I can recommend some of the reading I draw on to formulate
my views. 

Noam Chomsky, definitely on my most admired list.
If who want a quick synopsis, the Chomsky Reader  is a good summary.

Yes. The system (the Overtool) described at
http://www.speakeasy.org/~forrestb
is a fractal-like assembler. Assembly algorithms developed (probably
via GA) at one scale (or simulated) can be applied at all scales.

I am not of your particular mindset I suppose. I would rather come across
stumbling blocks along the way and actually make progress than discuss it
till it dilutes the original point. In the movie Jurassic Park I sided with
Hammond, owner of the park in that I believe in acceptable losses or
inevitable screwups along the way as opposed to Iam Malcom, the chaotician's
(sp?) mindset where "The scientists were so busy wondering if they could,
that they forgot to think if they should." We can refine forever and nothing
will ever occur, or at least we'll get free rides from the people who
actually make it happen but then we're about as worthless as entropians
fighting progress. There is NOT ENOUGH TIME to sit here and think it all
through. ACT NOW! I think it is mutually understood that everyone on this
mailinglist wants the future ASAP! What ever happened to "go get 'em"
dynamic optimism? It appears it has become a "let's all sit on our asses and
be optimistic" optimism. We're drowning in a stagnant pool of our own ideas!
It's time for a little variety people! Time for new blood.

Order rises from chaos through typical evolutionary spontaneous orders. Why
walk on previously tread soil? Wouldn't it be much better to be on the
cutting edge? This in itself is considered the cutting edge by many but i
desire to proceed as far into the cutting edge as possible!

>Maybe,Chris you should listen more and learn all
>you can 'bout these topics before you criticize,mmmm?....

Oh come on! Like I don't know the concept of AI, nano, or uploading? and
besides I'm not criticizing, I'm merely making an observation. It appears to
me as though there MUST be literally *THOUSANDS* of other equally useful
technologies out there possibly even beyond the big three. These topics may
be where the next steps lie in our continued evolution beyond posthuman. Do
we actually think we will me nothing more than a brain that gets larger and
larger soaking up knowledge forever? In my opinion NO, there will be some
breakthough discovery that will dramatically change the whole playing field.
We see how technologies and ideas rise up and get squashed and replaced by
others such as how first came the dream of the 500 TV channels which was
squashed by then Interactive Television which later was squashed by the
internet. I strongly believe that we will reach the equivelant of nano or
probably even better BEFORE your present predictions. Following my concept,
nano as it gets closer will get squashed by something else which will equal
or likely surpass it which we HAVEN'T EVEN DREAMED OF YET! This is what I am
aiming for! To find out what that tech will be!

IAN: Not to deny that serf conditions exist in the unlaissez faire 
countries of the world, that produce products for the international 
capitalist market; however, capitalism in general is distinct from
pre-capitalist serfdom due to that feature know as * mass production * 
under which products are made for the masses, as opposed to a few elite. 
This is precisely how capitalism raises the poor out of the pre-capitalist
conditions of universal poverty and serfdom.

It is not in the capitalist's interest to keep his products out of 
the hands of any group of consumers. the capitalist strives to bring
the best product at the lowest price due to the impact of competition
with other businesses who would also like attract/serve those customers.

IAN: A business will pay each worker as little as he is willing 
to except, just as you will pay each producer as little as he is 
willing to except. Folks from India are willing to except less 
than American workers because they, living in or coming from a 
heavily socialized economy, are poorer than Americans on average
so this lesser wage is to them higher than the wage options.

This wage disparity is purely rational, not even slightly unethical.

IAN: People do work for the benefit of other in a capitalist
society. Ever heard of customer service ?  The whole function 
of the free market -- nongovt business -- is producing something 
for someone else. Yet people who oppose the market want things 
for free, without having to do anything for someone else.

IAN: Voluntary association is the definition of cooperation.
There can be no cooperation free from consent. On the other hand,
govt mandated collectivism is coercion and therefore is by definition
antithetical to cooperation.

 > Cooperation would work so much better than
 > competition, because you get much more voluntary work. 

IAN: Cooperation is not antithetical to competition; however,
competition is antithetical to totalitarianism. Without competition
there is not incentive to build the better mouse trap, no incentive
to cut costs by reducing wasted effects and energy. Without competition
there is only stagnation and poverty.

IAN: So if private property is bad, then its destruction must be good.
Therefore it would be good for me to blow up you and your home, because 
both you and your home are items of your private property, which is
good to abolish.

In isolated environments such as space craft or colonies in the age of nano,
wouldn't we need a central matter repository where all waste would be
recycled? How could you engineer a cube of preferably dense matter while
keeping it inert and non-reactive with all the other molecules inside the
respository? You would probably be required to divide sections of the cube
for different molecules or elements depending on how far down you wish to go
for assembler reuse.

Order rises from chaos through typical evolutionary spontaneous orders. Why

>Maybe,Chris you should listen more and learn all

Oh come on! Like I don't know the concept of AI, nano, or uploading? and
besides I'm not criticizing, I'm merely making an observation. It appears to
me as though there MUST be literally *THOUSANDS* of other equally useful
technologies out there possibly even beyond the big three. These topics may
be where the next steps lie in our continued evolution beyond posthuman. Do
we actually think we will me nothing more than a brain that gets larger and
larger soaking up knowledge forever? In my opinion NO, there will be some
breakthough discovery that will dramatically change the whole playing field.
We see how technologies and ideas rise up and get squashed and replaced by
others such as how first came the dream of the 500 TV channels which was
squashed by then Interactive Television which later was squashed by the
internet. I strongly believe that we will reach the equivelant of nano or
probably even better BEFORE your present predictions. Following my concept,
nano as it gets closer will get squashed by something else which will equal
or likely surpass it which we HAVEN'T EVEN DREAMED OF YET! This is what I am
aiming for! To find out what that tech will be!

I'm not sure its that useful, since it only occurs at very low
temperatures. Sending superfluid materials through pipelines would
definitely be useful, but I doubt we can use it for anything but helium. 

What about superfluid bearings?

Would it? Well, biotechnology obviously can do it, we just have to 
replicate how things occur in nature, but it is *not* trivial. 
Biotechnology works very well when we follow the old programs, but making 
new or specific things is hard.

I think nanotechnology will from the beginning be dominated by complex 
systems theory. We have to make hordes of nanites work together, form 
computational ecologies and interact in useful ways; many of the simplest 
possible objects to make with nanotech will be quite fractal. In fact, I 
think it will be hard at first not to make fractal objects.

Perhaps one could have a small extension of the browser that allows you 
to add a page to your "reference bookmark file" that contains useful 
pages. People could merge their bookmark files, creating a distributed, 
growing, user-defined search-space for information that a personal search

Actually, he warned against this possibility during the senate hearing. 
He pointed out that if LSD was outlawed, then a black market would 
appear. He wanted it to be kept controlled by the psychiatrists instead 
(but when that failed, he joined the underground).

Both. We cannot survive if we spend all our time on a few subjects, but we
must develop our ideas in depth too. Maybe different but interlinked fora
is the solution?

{Am having mail problems -- can't tell if its on this end or not -- apologies
if you see this multiple times}

Regarding the discussion of labor vs. management and labor vs. capital,
here's a question I've toyed with over the years and to which I've been
unable to come up with satisfactory answers:

     Why isn't there more competition between "unions"?

I can see price competition between unions driving wages down without great
benefit to workers, especially toward the unskilled side of the spectrum.  On
the other hand, I can see unions competing in two directions: To provide good
labor-service at a competitive price on the one hand and to provide good
social services to their members on the other.  In theory, simple price might
not be the only index of competition on the "labor sales" side if unions that
offered better social services (group health plans, education co-ops, etc.)
attracted higher-quality workers.

Any thoughts from the less economically-retarded than me?

This is a good question. Just having everything float around as one glop 
is a sure recipe for unexpected chemical reactions (= inefficiencies). 
The recycling system is also interesting, maybe it  could work like this:

Pipes, coated with macro- and microscopic cilia pump the waste forward (in
zero gravity we need pumping to move the waste). Some specialized
disassemblers are injected, and start to break apart the waste into more and
more basic sludge as it moves through long, winding pipes (yes, it is a
gut!). Through the walls the system extracts basic chemicals and add new
disassemblers for each stage. At the end we have the unmanageable stuff that
can be dealt with using heavy-duty disassemblers or dumped.  Around the
winding "gut" we place a set of circulatory systems that take care of
different chemicals (water, organics, metals, nanites) and pump them to their
correct destinations.

This depends on what materials the assemblers use. If they use prefabricated
nanite parts, they would need stockpiles of them (and they are probably
inert), but for general building we need inert, fairly general chemicals. My
guess is that we might stockpile amino acids, the basic vitamins and
co-factors, and common structures like the fatty acid or steroid backbone and
ions in crystals. I imagine a cubical block of diamond filled with tiny
compartments holding a chemical each, linked by quick molecular conveyor
belts.

You can't learn how to ride a bicycle by reading a book, but you certainly
can learn about the habits of birds of prey from a book.  In fact, there
would be little if any human progress if everything had to be learned
through direct experience.

Winston Churchill was a genius.  He was, in fact, living proof that a
person could know more through reading and reasoned analysis than all those
who relied on "direct experience."  Mr. Chamberlain relied on experiential
learning and believed Hitler was a man of peace.  After all, Hitler told
him so to his face.  Churchill was a student of written history and knew
better.

Isn't the net a great thing?  Anyone can diagnose Churchill's "weakness" in
front of hundreds of people scattered around the world.  And others can
reply just as fast...

Speaking of web HTML code enhancements. I was pondering the idea of a tag
that you would put in a referring page if that particular page has moved
that would signal search tools to auto update their database to this new
location as opposed to the link going dead. This way the neural pathways of
the web-brain could 'learn' and alter the structure of the links themselves
instead of merely discarding a link. This could be one step toward global
internet AI. I remember I read a highly interesting essay from Principia
Cybernetica dealing with this called "From Internet to Web Superbrain". Just
imagine when we get more intelligent routers for the backbones and start
bringing bio and eventually quantum processors on board? To add to this
analogy, notice how the webbrain strengthens it's neuron pathways by, if a
particular website is busy we upgrade the server speed to enable more people
to access it or even more likely, upgrade the connection to the neuron (the
network link). This is just more evidence that the internet is moving
towards being a conscious entity. Right now, you could consider it in a
non-self aware stage. I'm looking forward to it becoming a conscious SI entity!

How is the progress on Augmented Reality going aka Enhanced Reality (where
you slap on a pair of transparent headmounted displays and walk around with
digital images superimposed over real world objects)? I recently read in the
LA Times that they're putting virtual ads superimposed over sports games
such as tennis. The people in the stands see nothing but the people watching
it on TV see the ad as though it is painted on the wall or floor. Imagine
eventually seeing colored animated logos in the grass on the field during a
football game! Strange indeed to see the grass move for the animated logo or
thats what it would appear as. I truely wonder how far off the Snow Crash
'metaverse' after seeing Mario 64 on Nintendo 64 and how long before we can
have virtual ads appear everywhere. We will experience impossible virtual
feats long before nano or uploading. I just wonder how long? Imagine sitting
in your living room wearing augmented reality contacts or glasses and
speaking 'menu' and having a menu popup in front of you and being able to
select what texture you wish to wrap your wooden stairway with. You select
black slick marble and suddenly your stairway appears to be made of marble.
Or perhaps you want your window to be a hawaiian beachfront view. Not a
problem. Perhaps it's christmas but your child's grandparents wanted to be
their on christmas morning when your child opened all his/her gifts? Easily
done, the grandparents could be superimposed anywhere in the living room and
could walk around freely. They would appear as though they were there and it
would appear to them as if they were there also because they would
experience your living room though telepresence.

I thought the whole point of unions was to diminish competition among
labor.  Which might raise a question of why the dynamics of forming
labor monopolies were different from the dynamics of forming business
monopolies, if one side is considered fairer or easier than the other.

Sorry, Chris, I knew I'd put my foot in it as soon as I hit the
"send" button. I should have stuck with "student". The point remians
the same, however: the list benefits greatly from your quest for
breadth. IMO, it also benefits from the tighter focus of some of the
other contributors.

My focus is almost entirely on the Singularity. I've been interested in
the future of humanity since I was in junior high school, which was
a LONG time ago. However, since reading Vernor Vinge's "Marooned in
Realtime", I've been unable to retain any real enthusiasm for
speculations about post-singularity humanity, since I don't think
humanity will be relevant. I also think the singularity will happen
within ten years. Speculation about transhumans or other
post-Singularity beings, if any, are IMO about as useful and productive
as speculations about God. Just becaus I feel this way is no reason that
you and others should feel the same. Please continue in your quest for
breadth.

A decade or two from now, cytoplasmic technology will reach the point 
where we can design made-to-order cells.  

We will be able to design a very small "monitor cell" whose job it is 
to insinuate itself into the brain, and, in conjunction with millions of 
other such cells, keep track of everything that goes on in there.  
(By "very small" I mean smaller than a nerve cell; small enough to fit 
between nerve cells without taking up too much space and without 
disrupting the activities of the nerve cells.) 

If we are going to have a very fine-grained model of the brain, 
something like this will have to happen.  We have to have sensors 
in there, picking up real-time information about how the neurons work, 
and this has to happen while the brain is "on," so to speak.  When we 
send the first monitor cells into the brain, this will be like sending   
space probes to Venus, Mars, Jupiter, etc.  We will learn a lot about the 
brain that couldn't be learned any other way.  

Now, once the monitor system is in place, since we are assuming 
a high level of expertise in cellular engineering, it will be possible to 
identify defective nerve cells and replace them.  It will also be 
possible to improve the healthy cells to make them work even better, 
and to enhance their communication with each other.  Entirely new 
kinds of nerve cells can be introduced, with new capabilities.  

We will also be able to design and make cells that can (1) remove toxins 
(lead, aluminum, etc.), and (2) identify and repair gross problems,  
such as calcification of tissue, plugged arteries, hormonal imbalance, 
and irregular electrical rhythms.  These cells can be incorporated into 
the immune system, so our bodies will be self-repairing.   (Of course 
our bodies are already self-repairing to a great extent, but there is plenty 
of room for improvement.)  

Cellular engineering also has many industrial uses, such as extracting 
fresh water from sea water, extracting metals from ores -- I could go on 
and on.  I'm not saying cellular engineering will create a cornucopia, 
but it will allow us to do a lot of things that we can't do now.  

Best of all, it doesn't depend on Genies or any kind of hocus-pocus.  
It's a very straightforward development of the cell biology of today.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

An idea I've been amusing myself with a bit, relating to the question
of how hard it will be to generate AI using nanotech is this: suppose a
genii gives you an infinitely fast computer.  This is a computer just
like today's, programmable in C or Lisp or some other language, which
had the property that it runs infinitely fast.  Any program you put on
it completes instantly (unless it is of the type which never completes,
in which case it runs forever until you halt it).  All computation is
done in zero time.  We'll also throw in infinite memory while we're at
it, although I'm not sure how big the C pointers have to be then :-).

The question is, given such a miraculous device, how hard would it be
for you, meaning the typical programmer reading this, to produce a program
which could pass the Turing test, or better still one which is super-
intelligent?  Where would you start?  How long would it take you to write
the code?  What research would you have to do?  Could it even be done?

Or, if it is too hard for one average person to do, what would be the
team which could do it?  How long do you think it would take?  How big
would the resulting program be?

What I'm trying to get at in this thought experiment is just how hard
it would be to get AI if we had computers which were not infinitely
fast, but still very very fast (or more properly, parallel computers
with extremely massive degrees of parallelism) as we might expect from
nanotech.  So it would be most interesting if the solution works for
computers which aren't quite infinitely fast.  But if there were some
trick which worked especially well on infinitely fast computers that
would be interesting to hear about, too.

Offense is taken by me, Shaun.  If a quote forms the basis for a metaphor

it relevant to address the validity of that quote.

To be honest, in the short time that I've been on this list, I've

There are lots of contexts where this already happens, including
playing war games, financial trading, and web surfing.   High decision
rates don't imply fast economic growth.

I can't say this is impossible, but it really is very unrealistic. 
We have had half a century of experience with computers, and no
similar takeoff has occured, or anything close.  We have had feedback,
lots of it, but growth rates have been relatively steady.  I think you
need a good story about why your scenario hasn't yet happened to make
it at all plausible.

If you colonize a system, then you have a good chance of beating away

Thanks to Forrest Bishop for putting some thought into what David Brin
calls the "Berserker" question.  The possibility that there is lots of
life all around, all trying to play dead to avoid retribution, is very
popular among the very best hard science fiction authors, including
Brin, Benford, and Bear.  It is well worth more attention than I gave
it in my Great Filter paper.  (Btw, I extracted the bio part of that
article, made it more formal, and just submitted it to Science.  See:
http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/hardsteps.ps)

In fact, it would be great fun, and worth doing intellectually, to run
a game-theoretic simulation of this problem.  Could get an Icarus
publication out of it.  Any worthy coauthors interested? :-)

Let me try to sketch out the strategic situation here.

A new civilization like ours knows that a shell of our early radio
signals is expanding out at the speed of light, and that this may
trigger "berserker" probes flying in at near the speed of light to
destroy our solar system.  So some folks may want to get the hell out
of here and try to colonize elsewhere.  They'd want to go as fast as
possible, to escape a possible detonation wave of unknown size and
speed (could someone nova our star, or galactic center?), or a
followup wave of berserkers.  And they'd also want to not send signals
back to Earth that such enemies might intercept - signals would have
to look like cosmic background to someone without the right key (and
with the home base keeping your location info very localized, on a
hair trigger to destroy it.)  They'd also want turn a corner
somewhere, so their path away from Earth (ionized regions) doesn't
lead right to them.  And not knowning how far they might be followed,
they'd want to go a good long way.

New colonies might try to hide themselves better, but even then some
of the locals may get itchy of being traced, or growing too big not to
be seen, and try to escape.  Within any system, keeping the quiet is a
public good, so a strong central policing might be required to enforce
it. 

Star systems might also consider lying low until their technological
advancement seems to asymptote, and suddenly "running for it".  Grow
the local economy as fast as possible, not worrying much about being
loud, to support a massive explosion of colonization probes.  They
might get 10^10 to 10^20 probes out of the system off to all corners
of the universe before enemies arrive.  Or considering the costs and
risks of strong central policing, they might decide to just run for it
from the very beginning.

A civilization may also want to try to "test the waters", by sending
one probe to a distant system to try this "running for it" strategy,
and to then watch the results.  They might also try a "loud mouth"
strategy in such a distant system, broadcasting as loud as they can to
see who responds how.  Of course just how far away is "distant" is a
tricky question.

The strategic situation of a potential berserker is also complicated.
If they see a sign of a new civilization, and they send a probe to
destroy it, it might be a trap which lets someone else find them and
destroy them.  If there are many other civilizations around, why
should they be the one to spend the resources and take the risk to
destroy the newcomer?  And if they wait a bit, and still no one else
destroys it, that may just be because others have send probes to sit
near this new site, waiting for catch incoming destroyers. 

If you want to send a probe to not only destroy this system, but to
infiltrate it enough to find out if it is a colony of some other
system, and where that system is, you will have to have your probe
slow down more, and more risk being caught by enemies who might trace
it back to you, especially if you were going to forward that info back
to your home. 

It seems to me that the outcome of all this strategizing is that the
best strategy is just to expand as aggressively as possible.  By the
time anyone comes to destroy any one system you have used it well,
converting it to a billion probes or much more within a few years.
That huge economy gives you all the better chance to learn new
technology, so some of your descendants become as advanced as your
advanced enemies.

To verify this intuition, an explicit simulation would be appropriate.

In a message dated 96-10-10 19:38:58 EDT, you write:

<< I have found these types of curves interesting as well, though I don't
think
 they are necessarily unextropian. I can envision a series of such curves in
 succession. As the growth in one curve starts leveling off, new processes
 (which I think can be viewed as extropian - BE, ST, IT ) take over and start
 a new curve. >>

This in fact does happen with all microbial growth curves unless the
microorganism is a has very stable genetic population and does not "gene
switch" as _Candida albicans_ does (a yeast).  _Candida has at least six (6)
gene switches it turned on of off depending of the environmental conditions.
 So, I would hardly say a "yeast curve" was non-extropian.  

Many (maybe all) bacteria, yeasts and mold also have two forms of
reproduction, sexual and asexual.  This also accounts for the growth curves.
  

I discovered a new heat resistant mold my favorite growth curves are the heat
resistant bacteria and mold curves.  They are different than classic growth
curves.  If you try to count the number of viable cells in a population at
time zero. Then heat shock the cells (this kills the non-heat resistant
cells) and count the population again. . . with _Bacillus_ the counts go UP
not down.  Some cells were viable but not countable (not culturable) before
the heat shock.

This is because some cells are shocked into growing and because some cells
are less heat resistant (and die), while others start growing faster (than
the weaker cells), thus giving a net INCREASE in count.  Again,  the growth
curve is affected by a non-homogeneous population. 

This is why I don't get too worried by people pointing out the limits to
growth via growth curves.  Life is not homogeneous, there is always an option
in the genetic pool and in our case the technological pool too.  We have
evolving tools as well as biological systems.  

You (Douglas Houts)  are correct when you say the growth curves tend to
"step".  Adaptation can take place any time, lag, log, stationary, or (yes
even) decline.   If adaptation to a stress is seen in the decline phase it is
called the "Phoenix Phemomenon".  This is will know to me since my research
is in cell injury and repair mechanisms and preservation systems for food,
cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.

The "stepping" is seen better in the log phase with several log-lags stepping
upward and upward as the weaker cells die and the adapted or gene-switched
cells out grow the previous population.  

The cells start in lag phase (no net growth, equally  numbers live as die)
 then a log phase starts but soon reached what is normally seen as a
stationary phase.  BUT it's not really stationary!  It's another lag phase!
 Then a second log phase started again.  This is how I see humans lag-log
then stationary until trans-humans lag-log and post-humans lag-log then who
knows what will happen?  And, I'm not just talking about biologic population
numbers (more is not better if quality of life is poor),  I'm talking about
technology "stepping" evolution too.

When you consider biofilms (colonies of several kinds) of microorganism, the
growth curve does not even apply because the single cells (bacteria, yeasts
and molds) function as a multicellular organism just like we do.  

Pure cultures are a figment of a microbiologist's imagination.  Pure cultures
don't happen in nature (or are extremely rare and don't stay pure for long).

People might become disengaged from art if artists perpetuate this type of
idea. 
It's simply not true. Individuals on these lists are creative thinkers.
Ceative thinking is artful.

I know next to nothing about ornithology, but what is "odd" about the quote?

It means that while the parrots are sitting around squawking, the birds of
prey are silently watching from above.

Obviously, Churchill did know "how rarely eagles speak when away from their
highly-situated nests."  That's the point.

I think rather than pointing out how noncapitalist systems are also
exploiting, i would rather hear discussions on how, actually *how*,
Libertarian legal systems will  address outright  coercion and illegal
gangstyle or mafia style serfdom.  

As i study libertarian philosophy, i was not surprised to learn it was based
on the "homesteading" Locke philosophy, and question such a stance, not
because i think it is inherantly  "wrong" but already "outmoded". 
Property ( especially in Europe, Japan and US) is largely already claimed,
not many will be able to make an original stake and therefore it will be
neccessary to redefine "privacy" and  "private", private to whom?Private from
what? We will have property subdivided, owned in group purchases, rentals,
huge condo-munities, offshore controls etc. A shift in such a basic
foundation block may have implications shaking the very roots of the
philosophy.
( Homesteading could have a resurgence in offworld or undersea technologies :
-) 

Either way,  in most of these discussions, the *concerns* which I hear are
how shall we protect ourselves and others from greedy, shitty "corperate"
gangs (Percieved now as mostly  *in cahoots* with the govt, getting corperate
 welfare etc.).. or mafias, or "bad" people who abuse the free market. 
The concern is valid, because history has lots of examples of coercive
tactics, gunpoint ( 1995, L.A.) used to set up sweat shops, people forced to
help others gain wealth against their will( thru lying or  other types of
coercion) and so forth. The principle of non coercion will be ignored by
some, perhaps many, if there is no "indoctrination" - which is obviously
unlibertarion, or unless we magically all suddenly become ethical. Not
happening yet, but I am optimistic. : )
When I endeavor to come up with solutions, and hear mostly "oh it will go
away by itself" or " free market will take care of it" or , it can't be worse
than it is ( which may be true, but its hardly comforting , productive or
seductive ) I think it's no wonder only small percent of people will become
Libertarian. There just arent enough hard plans.... how do we get there??
specifically? 
I suggest looking into the challenge of how to create* a utopia, not MORE
fingerpointing.... 

*Obviously working out the nitty gritty of how to prevent force and illegal,
unethical worker exploitation , as well as crime control, urban safety,
children's welfare, military defense  and so forth  and is a big job ahead,
  our govt makes a big living off of it.

This is indeed an interesting thought experiment.  My suspicion is that
the
time between being granted such miraculous machinery, and the emergence
of superintelligence would be exceedingly short.  On the order of weeks
for one such as myself who only programs occasionally, perhaps only days
for an experienced programmer who does it as his primary method of
making a living, possibly even hours for a first class programming
wizard (especially one with a passion for mathematics).

The reason I think that such a short time scale is possible is that the
feat could perhaps be achieved by creating a program, or more likely an
interacting group of competing programs, that evolves on it's own once
set in operation.  With unlimited computing resources (or at least
enough to seem unlimited by modern standards), this initial population
of virtual life would not need to be particularly efficient or effective
in it's evolutionary progress.  It would only have to meet these
requirements:

   1. it could not permanently stagnate at any particular level of
      development
   2. it could not get into any kind of degenerative "devolution" mode
      (or at least, such occurrences would have to be outweighed by
      development in a positive direction)

With truly immense computing power to play with, reiterative testing and
modification of starting populations would be easily accomplished, so
all false starts could provide valuable clues towards a functional
solution.  And the first initial population to successfully achieve the
above conditions would be an instant success.  With infinite computing
resources, a superintelligence would exist as soon as the first
successful program is set in motion.  It seems to me that the only
limitation of the development of such an intelligent virtual lifeform
would be imposed by the limitations of the available computer.  I cannot
concieve of what kind of intelligence could evolve in a computer that
was infinitely fast and with infinite memory.  But even with very large,
but still finite resources, it is easy to imagine that the potential for
such a virtual life scenario is awesome.

Many indigenous people were perfectly happy being self-sustaining and 
living off the land before greed fuelled colonialism robbed it from them. 
And colonialism helped the merchants and missonaries more than anyone.    

Blame them both. The corporation that buys the land and chains the 
peasants to it is just as guilty as the faux government.

Don't understand. If we don't have some form of sustainability, we're

Yeah, there's the beef. But it doesn't take a lot of effort on the part 
of an individual to keep an anarchic society running. the work day would 
be drastically reduced. Nobody would have to work more than 2 hours a 
day. If everybody realized this was all it took to keep a smoothly 
running system, i don't think anybody would object. however, if somebody 
did do this, anarchism is a dynamic system, and can easily change to meet 
the demands of people.

No, because in above system, supply meets need, rather than demand. 
Profit is eliminated. There is no need to produce more than neccesary 
because nobody gains from it. Unlike today, where we have entire trawlers 
of grain empty themselves into the ocean because there is a surplus, but 
people don't want to give it away because it will lower the price.

Check out Anarcho-syndicalism. Admittedly, it needs some work to increase

Certainly, but everybody agrees the other major system, communism, is a

perpetuated the same crimes, but far subtler. Brave New World versus 1984.

        But it wasn't the basis.  It was a signature line.  I think that
both you and Greg (and everyone else) understand what Churchill meant by his

        I don't think it's necessarily newcomers per se, but anyone who has
ill-supported posts or topics is bound to be argued with.  Rightly so.  This
ML is supposed to be for "...well thought out, extropian discussion."  If
it's not well thought out or extropian, don't post it.  If there has been
any 'nastiness', I don't think it was intentional.

It means that while the parrots are sitting around squawking, the birds of
prey are silently watching from above.

Obviously, Churchill did know "how rarely eagles speak when away from their
highly-situated nests."  That's the point.
>>
I'm not sure that's actually Churchill's point. Consider...

A very basic rhetorical rewording of the actual quote might be:
  "Unless the eagles 
(in conventional mythology, they're high-status symbols of freedom; 
symbolically akin to ideal citizens of a free state) 
  speak 
(which they, proud birds that they mythologically are, rarely do), 
  the parrots 
(mythically comical, stupid, non-raptorial, non-high status, given to 
mere raucousness and mimicry--symbolically akin to monkeys) 
  squawk."

No soaring or predation needed. So what did Churchill mean?

Without more context, I would only be guessing--I could guess that he 
meant the eagles to be Allied statesmen or military staff, and the parrots 
to be the press, or perhaps just the yellow journalists. That sounds like the 
kind of thing Churchill would let himself be quoted as having said.

I think Hal's point is that we don't really know what such a problem
would look like, or how to tell once we have one.  So you run a
simulatio and somewhere in it are some real smart creatures.  How can
you tell where they are, or figure out how to harness them once you
do?  And how do you know what simulations would create such smart
creatures?

I'm not saying Nanotechnology will only use one stage in manufacturing, just

I don't see any reason to think that is true. There are no preferred time
frames, things happen at all levels from Pico seconds to billions of years,
and lots of things happen faster than organic reactions.

It's been a few years since I read Monad's book, but I think I know what
you're driving at, and there is more than a little truth to it. If I gave a
Martian nothing but the sequence of the amino acids in a protein, there is no
way he could figure out what it's shape would be, he would need more
information, like the fact that the protein will be in water, and at a narrow
range of temperature, and at a specific acidity. All these things effect the
way a protein folds up. Actually, if I just gave the Martian some DNA he
couldn't even figure out the amino acid sequence of the protein the DNA
symbolized, much less know what its shape would be, because he would need to
know what The Genetic code would be, and that resides everywhere and nowhere.

The genetic code that all life on earth uses is arbitrary. For example, 
the nucleotide triplet CAU in messenger RNA symbolizes the amino acid 
histidine but their are no special chemical  characteristics that relate one 
to the other. One type of transfer RNA has an anticodon that connects to the 
CAU triplet of messenger RNA like a key fitting into a lock. At another part 
of the transfer RNA molecule, an amino acid can be attached, in this case 
histidine. However transfer RNA can't tell one amino acid from another, 
the amino acid attachment part is IDENTICAL in all tRNA molecules, but in 
practice, only those that have the anticodon for CAU are attached to 
histidine. The reason for this is an enzyme ( aminocyl-tRNA synthetase). 

This enzyme can tell one amino acid from another, and it can tell one tRNA  
molecule from another, and it can a attach a animo acid to it. However, this  
enzyme does NOT look at the anticodon at all but at another part of the  
transfer RNA, the DHU loop. In the lab the DHU loop from one type of tRNA has 
been grafted onto another type of tRNA and that changes the genetic code.  
It's also interesting that this enzyme is a protein encoded by, what else,  
the genetic code. I can't point to exactly where the genetic code is, because  
it does not reside in any one of these stages, it resides in all of them.

Having said this however I don't think the situation would be different for
Nanotechnology. If I gave our Martian friend the digital instructions sent
to a assembler he could not figure out what if anything it would make,
unless he knew something about the nano computer's design and what sort of
manipulator arm it had. He would also need to know some of the details the
machine would be working in, like the fact that atoms are so numerous and
move so fast that if you need a hydrogen atom you don't need to go searching
for one, just sit tight and one will come to you. I think the Nanotech
environment will be far more information rich than anything life knows about.

Yes, it has its uses, and until stone tools came on the scene it was the only
way complex objects could get made.

        Well, I initially intended to just read this thread, but I think
it's time for me to put my two cents in.  :-)  I agree with capitalistic
views; that fact probably sways what I am about to say.  I don't look at 
property as being actual 'ownership'...it only is to an extent.  I see the
purchase of property the equivalent of a dog urinating around 'its'
property.  Just an exchange of money (a principle based system) to show
others that it is yours to occupy.  It's not as if the property itself is
going to object to someone claiming it.  The term 'property is theft' is a
bit of a paradox: how can you steal something that nobody owns?  When a
subsequent exchange of money occurs, it is no longer the property that is
occupied, but a principle equivalent.  Not stealing, exchanging.

For newbies, maybe we should introduce this term.  Turing's test was 
proposed by Alan Turing, one of the founders of computer science.   
The idea is that you want to determine when an AI program has reached 
the human level of intelligence.  So you have a conversation with it 
through a terminal.  You can ask it any question you want, and you try 
to judge, from its answers, whether they are being generated by a 
human or a computer.  If you think your correspondent is human, and 
then the experimenter lets you look behind the curtain, and there is a 
computer sitting there -- the program has passed the test.  

Some time ago, a group of cs students at Carnegie Mellon decided to 
run an experiment.  They subscribed their AI program to the Extropian 
list under a made-up name.  Their program participates in the various 
discussions on this list.  It doesn't get any help from the students. 
The Extropians have accepted it as part of the group.  No one notices 
anything different about it -- no one has seriously raised the question of 
whether it might not be what it purports to be, i.e. just another human.  
In other words, this program has passed the Turing test, so far.

> When the eagles are silent, the parrots begin to jabber.  

--Winston Churchill, as quoted by Greg Burch

The eagles and parrots here are mythological creatures, not actual 
animals.  Churchill had a classical education.  He had grown up with 
Aesop's fables and many other such stories, in which eagles, lions, 
bears, foxes, and so forth are personified.  He was making a statement 
about politics, using metaphorical language.  He never intended his 
statement to be literally true of birds in nature.  

An eagle is a far-sighted statesmen who can take in an entire situation 
and decide what to do.  When the eagles retire from public discourse, 
the parrots take over -- i.e. small-minded people who have no vision and 
no judgment of their own, people who can only repeat mindlessly what 
they hear.

I think the biggest advantage of such a fast computer would be that 
any a-life organisms/programs grown on it would evolve to the maximum 
capacity of the memory in zero time!  The initial program could be 
quite simple, but it must be able to change itself.  There would have 
to be a lot of sensible input so that it could develop a complex 
relationship between it's input and output.  It would need feedback 
from the real world to verify that it's evolutionary path will lead 
it to where we are now (otherwise we will not be able to understand 
it), it can go further on it's own, as long as it first checks in at 
homosapien-semantics-1996.

Thanks to Forrest Bishop for putting some thought into what David Brin

[[I though Berserkers were stray military machines, like the Borg, that

 The possibility that there is lots of
life all around, all trying to play dead to avoid retribution, is very
popular among the very best hard science fiction authors, including
Brin, Benford, and Bear.  
[[Oh. Haven't been reading much SF in recent years. ]]

It is well worth more attention than I gave
it in my Great Filter paper.  (Btw, I extracted the bio part of that
article, made it more formal, and just submitted it to Science.  See:
http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/hardsteps.ps)
[[Congratulations! Think they're wired enough to print it?]]

In fact, it would be great fun, and worth doing intellectually, to run
a game-theoretic simulation of this problem. 
[[I agree. I do hope the "low profile"  scenario is incorrect. It
would be conducive to hope about the future to provide a studied
counter example. If the "low profile", or "Berserker" situation is true, one
should realize that our descendents _are_ the Berserkers.

 Could get an Icarus
publication out of it.  Any worthy coauthors interested? :-)
[[Interested, yes.]]

Let me try to sketch out the strategic situation here.

A new civilization like ours knows that a shell of our early radio
signals is expanding out at the speed of light, and that this may
trigger "berserker" probes flying in at near the speed of light to
destroy our solar system.  So some folks may want to get the hell out
of here and try to colonize elsewhere.

[[Two cases here:
1) We've intercepted their radio signals.
2) We haven't, and are paranoid.

Case 1): We either launch a preemptive strike, or send "welcome space brother" noises
in their direction. We simultaneously beat feet in the opposite direction.

Case 2): For the case of not knowing the direction of an imagined attack, one direction
is as good as the next. We expand in a rough sphere, always preceeded by our past radio shell.

Some complications:
Interstellar media variations put speed limits on starships. We are currently in the 
interesting position of being between two interstellar gas clouds. Our Solar System
will enter a gas cloud in about 50000 (?) years, at which time interstellar travel may
have to slow down. One open question: do we use big fat starships or wee little 
nanoprobes?
Our current radio signals may only be perceptible for a few thousand light years, before
being lost in the background.]]

  They'd want to go as fast as
possible, to escape a possible detonation wave of unknown size and
speed

[[A putative speed of light spherical pulse of some kind is the nastiest 
possibility. It would eventualy catch any material object.]]

 (could someone nova our star, or galactic center?), 

[[Yes. Consider a type of nova event, wherein a White Dwarf (a burned out
 star with the mass of the Sun and diameter of the Earth) slowly accumulates
 a hydrogen atmosphere on its surface. At some point, the temperature and 
density of this atmosphere becomes high enough to sustain fusion. The 
interesting part about this is that the fusioning is initiated at a _single region_
near the surface of the White Dwarf, then spreads horizontally to encircle the
globe, as well as vertically up through the hydrogen column as far as conditions
will permit hydrgen burning.
This is essentially a big hydrogen bomb, set off by a teensy trigger (a 
catastrophy event).
Now consider an average, ho-hum star like the Sun. This system is in a delicate 
balance between gravitational collapse (implosion), and runaway fusion (explosion)
(we've come to find out the Sun is not a perfectly stable system, BTW). The thermal
and radiation pressure that keeps the Sun from collapsing is generated by continuous
nuclear fusion at or near the core. This core is surrounded by a blanket of mostly 
hydrogen, in a very high temperature and density state, in fact, just short of fusion
criticality. An anomalous increase in these parameters may be able to initiate a fusing
blast wave that encircles the core, similar to the White Dwarf scenario. The resulting
sudden energy release would then blow off the outer layers of the Sun, like a nova.
One method of providing this trigger is to fire an object at the Sun, that is large enough
and fast enough to penetrate the outer layers without burning up, and deposit its energy in
the pre-critical region.
 
The case of a supernova chain reaction at the core of the Milky Way Galaxy has been studied
in some detail, and may have already occured a number of times. There is apparently a big
(4 million+ Solar mass) Black Hole at the galactic core that occasionaly gulps down a
stray star or two. The resulting fireworks may have provided the energy input to nearby 
(~ light year) densely clustered stars to cause them to nova or supernova, in a sort of chain 
reaction. As a result, the Core, out to a radius of 10 or 20 thousand light years, is probably sterile.
 It would behoove us to set up an Early Warning System within a few hundred light years of this
circus.
]]

or a
followup wave of berserkers.  And they'd also want to not send signals
back to Earth that such enemies might intercept 
- signals would have
to look like cosmic background to someone without the right key (and
with the home base keeping your location info very localized, on a
hair trigger to destroy it.) 

[[So you dont buy the wipe the memory idea? The basis is that
one cannot be certain of a memory immune from infiltration.]]

 They'd also want turn a corner
somewhere, so their path away from Earth (ionized regions) doesn't
lead right to them. 

[[Dragging a cable behind the starship while passing near a star provides
a free (no mass or energy expense) course change, via Lorentz Force 
interaction with the stellar magnetic field.
]]

 And not knowning how far they might be followed,
they'd want to go a good long way.

[[Hmmm. An argument for intergalatic travel. One can travel much 
faster and with less wake noise between galaxies than through them. ]]

New colonies might try to hide themselves better, but even then some
of the locals may get itchy of being traced, or growing too big not to
be seen, and try to escape.  Within any system, keeping the quiet is a
public good, so a strong central policing might be required to enforce
it. 

[[If the colony is a merged superinelligence, said policing would simply
be a form of self-discipline.]]

..Or considering the costs and
risks of strong central policing, they might decide to just run for it
from the very beginning.

[[Running early is an excellent policy, but suffers the hare and the 
tortoise problem- that later, more technically advanced probes will
overtake the pioneers. Of course, that presumes there are later probes.]]

A civilization may also want to try to "test the waters", by sending
one probe to a distant system to try this "running for it" strategy,
and to then watch the results.  They might also try a "loud mouth"
strategy in such a distant system, broadcasting as loud as they can to
see who responds how.  Of course just how far away is "distant" is a
tricky question.

[[This reminds me of the strategy of some nesting birds. When threatened,
the hen will 
move some distance from the nest and then call attention to herself.]]

The strategic situation of a potential berserker is also 
complicated....

It seems to me that the outcome of all this strategizing is that the
best strategy is just to expand as aggressively as possible.  By the
time anyone comes to destroy any one system you have used it well,
converting it to a billion probes or much more within a few years.
That huge economy gives you all the better chance to learn new
technology, so some of your descendants become as advanced as your
advanced enemies.
To verify this intuition, an explicit simulation would be appropriate.

[[Indeed it would!

Anyone try to work out the details on this?

[[AFAIK, this idea is originally mine. I took it from my previous work, 

the South Pole Accelerator of 1981, which uses its probes to blast a 
partial vacuum corridor through the Earths atmosphere. That in turn 
came
from particle beam research (in vogue at the time). A pilot beam blasts 
a 
corridor in the atmosphere, followed by the energy weapon.
I have not put much analysis into the interstellar version yet. The SPA
version was modeled continuously. Gas kinetic theory is applicable to 
the 
interstellar medium, and perhaps also to the dust grains 
(alternatively, these can be treated as stationary objects). One rather
open problem is the method of interaction and energy deposition in the 
spacecraft structure. This requires a lot of quality analysis.
The short answer is to launch lots of colinear probes.]]

Yes, they have dominated for quite some time.  We have a shot at

The comments about my "eagles and parrots" Churchill quote are winging their
way back around to the "mailing list quality" discussion of a few days ago.
 They raise good points which I think are worth considering regarding the
_purpose_ of the ExList. There seem to be viewpoints on the "list quality"
discussion along two axes: depth vs. breadth and "relevance".  For what it's
worth, on the first, I come down squarely on both sides of the issue, i.e. I
think it's good to think and talk both deeply and widely, as others have
said.  We have a lot of ground to cover if we are to see and understand all
of the complex implications of the basic ideas of transhumanism and
extropianism.

The "relevance" concern raises a different set of questions.  Is this, as E.
Shaun Russell points out, to be a forum only for "...well thought out,
extropian discussion"?  Certainly all of the comments we've seen lately about
the high volume of traffic on the list and the burden it imposes on busy
people (the kind we want to attract and keep amongst our midst) speak to the
need to keep things focused.  On the other hand the list serves another
purpose, that is as a social center for extropians.  We are a wide-spread
lot, circling the globe.  Even the "Old Ones", concentrated on the Left
Coast, have few enough opportunities to get together face-to-face.

Private e-mails between members are a good device for developing social
relations that also intersect on the ExList.  I've developed some interesting
relationships this way myself since subscribing.  But the sort of bantering
commentary that has always been a part of the public forum also serves a
valuable purpose, IMHO.  The Extropy Institute should be the seed-bed for
many joint transhumanist enterprises, both cultural and commercial.  Such
enterprises can only happen if people get to know and trust each other fairly
well.  This doesn't happen unless one see a little of the "whole person",
including sometimes seemingly irrelevant details of their biographies and
personalities.  This happens with "small talk".  (Personal Web pages are good
for this, too, and I look forward to the Web member directory that appears to
be one of the upcoming items on the Institute web site, but they don't
include the key element of group interactivity.)

As technology progresses, the "relevance" tension will sort itself out.
 Within a few years, we'll be gathering socially in rich, common virtual
environments.  I can easily envision an ExI "party room" and more or less
focused social events in virtual environments.  The sort of interpersonal
synergy that will develop in such environments will be wonderful, a real
motor for more substantive developments.  Until then, however, I think that
-- with the use of a little judgment -- we should tolerate the occasional
quip, pun (thank you, Hara Ra, for many a smile) and irrelevant discussion.

I'm clarifying a few points, and then I'm off this thread, and 
possibly off this list.  I cannot take the nastiness of the tone 
around here much longer.  It's sad, because I thought I might be 
extropian--I guess that isn't the case.

1.	Using the phrase "I mean no offense" does 
not excuse making aspirsions on the intellect of persons 
participating on any list.

2.	Despite intimations to the contrary, my questioning of Churchill's 
metaphor was "well thought out".  I have extensive rhetorical 
training and several editorships and have been trained to spot 
inconsistency.

3.	I never said that Churchill wasn't intelligent, only that he 
preferred scholarly pursuits to climbing mountains looking for eagles 
(the basis for my knowledge).

4.	I could quote at least five postings that have made negative 
comments about newcomers to this list, but why bother?  They're in 
the archives.

In what way does this differ from nanotech, I don't see the seperation of
mechanics and biology as being meaningful on this level.
As an aside the development of strong AI/SI is likely not something that will
happen as a planned series of well defined steps, we just don't understand
"Intelligence" that well. 
On the other hand, we're doing pretty well at genetic and alife programming and
_evolving_ a strong AI seems to me to be the hot tip.

The most interesting aspect of this phenomenon is that it has exploded
very quickly. All the people who I've heard talk about it essentially
say that the number and form of frog mutations has had a huge increase
within the past three or so years. The mutations seem to be
proportional to the amount of time the frog species is in water.

The EPA suspects an air-born contaminant because of the speed of
transmission and the range over which the problem has been seen.

An idea: Given that the temperature at which superconductivity is
possible (through the development of new materials) is slowly rising,
why not try to do the same with superfluidity? What is the current
understanding of the physics behind superfluidity? I'm sure this sort
of research is going on anyway, so I'm sure we'll eventually see more
uses.

A quick search on altavista turns up quite a bit on the subject,
including research with a lithium gas at low temperatures (I couldn't
tell from the abstract whether this was through simulation or not).

I don't agree, Kathryn, Extropians I have met so far have been more than
courteous, well informed and very lovely.  When people chide me for being
nonscientific or can't agree with my art- needs-techno-and -techno -needs-art
world view,  i don't see anyone on either side ( i catch shit from the art
community even worse, believe me) as being nasty , just concerned with truth.
And I seek to show them my side... not to press them into it. ANYWAY It is
not a forum for emotional toned conversation, at all. Scientists are used to
the most rigid and demanding public debunking as part of their training.
I understand this , coming from beauty, not facts, an artist  has more of a
"touchy feely" kind of field, and so hardly am I  offended ( unless they call
my mom names or something) but rather choose to feel greatly *complemented*
when others of high intelligence take up a subject and challenge me on it,
even if I think they are wrong, or ill informed, because it forces me to
examine my own beliefs and theories.
   I am starting to see a pattern with you of making a post, then becoming
upset and accusing others of being nasty when your viewpoint is healthily
questioned and the truth of it challenged. I am just commenting impartially.

And, I think humans are not altruistic to begin with.  Governments and
religions have tried to force altruism unsuccessfully with laws, guns, jail,
damnation, and shame.  It just doesn't work with humans.  We all want what we
want.  We are all "self-wanting"  call it "selfish".  What's wrong with that?
 The people who say they want to help their fellow man (altruists) also want
something.  They want other people to believe as they do and many times to
control other people's generosity.  So they are also not true altruists
either they are "selfish" too.

BUT, enlightened selfishness is better than blatant selfishness:

The more satisfying cooperations are not where I give and not get back
(lose-win,altruism).   The most satisfying are where I WIN and the other
people WIN too (win-win).  That is, I want to win but not at the expense of
my customer:  Not lose-lose, not win-lose (not a zero-sum game) and not
lose-win (submission/tyrant, altruism/parasite).

One of the most popular sales and marketing philosophies today is the WIN-WIN
of Stephen Covey in his book _The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People_.

This is not an exploitive philosophy.  It gets repeat business and is highly
profitable for all people.  It is unlike the old communist propaganda where
capitalists were supposedly evil and exploiting the masses (win-lose).  BTW
the communists wanted a lose-win (submission/parasite) or win-lose
(master/slave).  Ether way they had control not you.  Win-win give you both
control to get the best negotiated deal for both. 

Anarcho-syndicalism looks to me like "Anarcho-communism, communism without
the state" or because communism is though of a state, more accurately:
spontaneous socialism/ collectivist anarchy. AKA Libertarian-socialism. 

Contrast this to:  Libertarian capitalism "Anarcho-capitalism"  looks to me
like capitalism without the state.  The only difference is
socialism/communism forcefully prohibits people acquiring private property.
 With socialism/communism a person's body is "owned" but it is "owned" by the
state.  Communism assumes private property is theft from the state.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Collectivist anarchy vs. Individualist anarchy:

There are two groups of Libertarians (at least to me) the Spontaneous
Socialists (Collectivist anarchy) and the Laissez-Faire Capitalists
(individualist anarchy).

The first (socialist) group is where (I think) Rudolf Rocker, Noam Chomsky
and Surech Naidu are.  I found a list of libertarian-socialists on the web.
 I do not agree with this group.  I think they have the same short comings as
destroyed the USSR.  Namely private property is forbidden.   All transactions
are lose/win.  I can see where a very small idealistic group might survive if
they expelled the "mutant" win-win and win-lose meme private property people.
 This group sees capitalism as ONLY LOSE-WIN or WIN-LOSE.  They can not or do
not want to see the WIN/WIN side of capitalism because it conflicts with
their philosophy and could weaken their philosophy.

I am of the second Libertarian group:  Laissez-Faire Capitalists
(individualist anarchy).  Therefore I believe people like to work hard and
get paid for it.  Win-win. . .  Something that could not happen without
private property.  Unfortunately some businesses are win-lose. . . and then
capitalism gets a bad name.  BUT, the saving grace of libertarian-capitalism
is that you are free NOT to choose win-lose companies to do business with.
That is why I feel the second group of libertarians are on safer ground.  

Libertarian-capitalism/ anarcho-capitalism encourages people to work and pay
(WIN-WIN) when they acquire private property. 

Libertarian-capitalism assumes people own their own bodies, unlike
libertarian-socialism where the anarcho-society "owns" the individual's body.
 Either believes in state control or state regulation of a person's body. 

BTW, Fascism is not capitalism.  Fascism gives the facade of private
ownership but then regulates everything about the so called "private"
property (even controls your body) so you _really_don't_ own it.

Well, rights-based libertarianism would say that the indigenes owned
their land by virtue of use and possession, and the problem is in the
colonists not recognizing their property rights.

Although that'd often have to be a collective property right -- E. Shaun

Existence proof: the ecosystem.  Yes there is cooperation within it, but
the basic motivation of life is selfish reproduction.  And predator-prey
relationships are a lot nastier than usual business.

It came out OK on my browser (Netcom). I'll
try narrower margins in the future. Does anyone
know what a good setting is?

Choices, choices.  How about his compromise.  You have them remember a
billion specific locations in the universe they might have come from.
Then they send info home to all those locations.  Inflitrators would
then have to go look at all those locations to find you.  And that
location might be a relay station, which rebroadcasts its info to
another billion locations.

Just because a few people may not agree with you is no reason to assume that
everyone doesn't agree with you ideas. Surely, there are a number of people
who do agree with you on on things.

The tone here is no more nasty than the tone on other lists.  In fact, it is
probably a lot more mellow.

Other indications suggest you're using a word processor, for example,
initial quotes seem to be a different character than final quotes. It
may not be a margin problem; you may want to try using a fixed-width
font, and making sure the text goes out as standard ascii.

I would have thought that my participation in many involved and 
spirited debates on the other list would have disproved that, but it 
does not seem to be the case.

I comment from the view of having been a facilitator for many years.  
I sense a strong exclusionary tone on this list, and I'm not into 
that.  I stay out of Mensa for similar reasons.

If being extropian means checking my emotions at the door, than, 
fine, I should seek other fora.

Why not develop intelligence the same way the earth did, after all, we know 
for sure it works. We can in principle simulate anything perfectly, in 
practice however, when we try to do this for anything except perhaps a 
Hydrogen atom, we are stopped by the computational complexity of Quantum 
Mechanics. Obviously this is no problem for an infinite computer, in fact, 
although some things would still be impossible, if a task was possible then 
it would be easy, nothing would be hard.   
           
Simulate an atom then a molecule then an ocean. We know approximately what 
the conditions were like on the early earth, but maybe a very specific  
initial condition is needed for life to evolve. This is no obstacle for an  
infinite computer, just simulate all possible conditions, it's is a VERY 
large number but no closer to being infinite than the number 1 is, it will
take 0 seconds to do it. Maybe most paths do not lead life to intelligence, 
but we know of at least one that does, and our computer will find it with no 
trouble and probably many more. What if I'm not a very good programmer and 
only got a C in Quantum Mechanics? No problem, just keep changing things and
diddling around, eventually ( correction, instantly!) you will get everything 
right and things will start to evolve.  0 seconds after that, your simulated 
life forms will make a major scientific discovery, they will find a way to 
make a computer that is infinitely fast, now their machine is as fast as 
yours, and then ...
    
Unfortunately I don't expect to see an infinitely fast computer this side of  
The Omega Point, but you can do a lot even if it's just astronomically fast. 
Drexler calculated the amount of computer power needed to simulate ALL the 
brains that have ever existed before humanity, that is, all the brains since 
brains were invented in the Cambrian Explosion 570 million years ago. 
He concluded that about 10^38 machine instructions would do the trick.  
A Nanotechnology computer the size of a large present day factory and using  
no more power, could perform 10^38 machine instructions in about 2 years.

You're kidding! <eyes glaze over in delight> This has got to be the most 
fascinating thing I've yet to read on this list. Does the AI still post? 
Or is this some sort of Evil Extropian prank? 

Evil Extropians is my current thought experiment. What if a group of 
ne'er do wells broke off from the extropians and set their minds to world 
domination? Better yet, to galactic domination. How would they use the 
info gleaned from this list?

Here's what I am hoping this list will be: a place for people who fervently
believe in intellectual and technological progress to test and refine (or
discard) their ideas.

At the risk of oversimplifying, I have found there are basically two kinds
of people on the net: those who are interested in getting at the truth, and
those who are simply looking for validation of what they already believe.
The former tend to become thick-skinned, because they know how easy it is
to be sarcastic in this medium; besides, they are more interested in the
issues than their own feelings.  The latter, however, see every criticism
of their ideas as an attack against their person.

Yes Kathyrn, I can't help but laugh when you say "I sense a strong
exclusionary tone on this list."  Everyone else is too busy getting their
own ideas beat up to think about excluding you.

Rather than critisize your sispicion, I would like to test it. I challenge
anyone on this list to participate in the Intelligence Programming Contest:=


Your goal: Write a computer program (in your favourite formal language
that doesn't require more than infinite time to compute), that will result
in human intelligence or better.

I will personally give one of my Power Infintium Personal Computer
to the winner. (I will give it away at the omega point, but submissions
must be postmarked *before* the omega point.)

I can't find the saved message, but someone once attributed the quote to
Oscar Wilde, and Peter Honeyman replied with the original in French by
Pascal.  Honeyman concluded, "Wilde, ptui."

This question has certainly been in my mind since I've been actively
contemplating libertarianism and anarcho-capitalism in a more focused fashion
these last couple of years.  Writers on this List and those referred to in
the basic extropian bibliography do two things very well and, to my mind,
convincingly: (1) They use the basic concepts of libertarian
anarcho-capitalism to make cogent analysis and criticism of the current order
and (2) they paint a detailed picture of how a truly anarcho-capitalist
society would function, complete with PPAs/PPLs, reputation agencies and the
like.  The thing that seems to get less attention and seems less well
thought-out is the intermediate realm of getting from number 1 to number 2,
i.e. starting from the world as it is, how an anarcho-capitalist social order
would actually be implemented.

The development of agoric anarcho-capitalist social orders in truly new
territories isn't that problematic (although it will involve lots of hard
thought and work) and the "getting there from here" issues aren't nearly so
acute in such situations.  The anarchic spontaneous order of the Net seems to
provide a wonderful example of this and I would thus add virtual worlds to
the list of space and ocean "real" territories to which QueenMUSE refers
where the "homesteading" basis of classical liberalism will work for an
initial allocation of property and personal rights.  Establishing a Web
domain is a fine example of this phenomenon in practice.  I make and announce
my place in the Web, others either respect limitations on this space (they
don't hack my pages) or, if they don't, I enforce my rights through
reputation (complaining to the hacker's ISP) and/or increased vigilance and
security measures on my own part (firewalls, counter-hacking retaliation,
etc.).  By and large there is no state action in any of this and, at least so
far, it seems to work just fine.  Whether this agoric order holds up to
increased activity with growing bandwidth, commerce and social life on the
Net will be a fine test of our anarcho-capitalist ideas.

We all look forward to testing these ideas in the "real" environments to
which QueenMUSE refers.  My current thinking leads me to believe that if and
when groups such as ourselves have the physical ability to migrate to new
"real" environments, we will decide to set out ahead of time basic
contractual constitutions as grounds from which anarcho-capitalist regimes
can spontaneously grow.  As I've written here before, I look to the
"transhumanist diaspora" as a "laboratory of agorics", with different
communities experimenting with different basic constitutions: Some will have
none at all, some will have minimal constitutions, others will have fairly
articulated sets of ground-rules.  Assuming a full-blown Drexlerian
Singularity, the immediate post-Singularity period will thus be a golden age
of constitutional thinking and practice.

Which leaves the question of what happens to the "real world" that the
"colonists" leave behind.  Do we concentrate on implementing our
anarcho-capitalist ideas in new virtual and real territories and not concern
ourselves with the Old World?  Or do we attempt to develop step-by-step plans
of action to implement these ideas here?  Or is this even necessary? There
appear to be two basic lines on this question.  One school of thought,
discernible in the Crypto-Anarchist Manifesto, seems to contemplate a natural
"withering away of the state" in the face of a free Net and strong
encryption.  This idea assumes that the new order that will develop within
the "Free Net" will naturally supplant the key social functions of the state
and that, more or less violently, the current order will lose its grip over
people.  The other line of thinking looks to the establishment of functional
and territorial enclaves ("exclaves" in "Expseak"), islands of liberty, in
which individuals develop anarcho-capitalist systems incrementally, slowly
converting the legal governance of the activity of their lives from
state-based to consent-based legal systems.  (Note the resonance of this
dichotomy with two other similar such divisions: The "grace" vs. "works"
division in christian theology and the socialist/marxist question of whether
the proletarian revolution needs an active leadership.)

If the "natural withering" school is right, we don't need to do anything: The
growing power and functionality of the Free Net will simply eat the state for
us.  The second idea presents significant challenges.  By definition,
incremental libertarianism has to work without coercion.  At each step, the
regime of liberty has to be superior to its alternative, because free
individuals must choose to abide by the agoric, libertarian order, rather
than look to the state as a source of legal and social authority.  Being good
capitalists, we view this on-going choice of systems in economic terms: Which
is better (i.e. more profitable) for me today, acquiescing in the statist
legal and social order, or living and working under this newly-freer anarchic
regime?  It is, perhaps, the problem often discussed here with regard to
"design by evolution": Each step has to be better than the last and no
individual change can cripple the organism (cause a reproductive
disadvantage).

There are real examples of "incrementalist" processes.  The growing use of
private regimes of commercial dispute resolution (e.g. arbitration) is
perhaps the best known and most impressive.  Those social activities
currently governed by state-sponsored criminal and tort law present stronger
barriers to incrementalism.  Commercial private law lends itself to
bilateralism and transaction-specific implementation; criminal and tort
"transactions" do not.  I have yet to see any convincing proposal for an
incremental implementation of private criminal or tort laws.

Which leads to a question (assuming anyone has read this far!)  Is anyone on
the list aware of cogent plans or proposals for an incrementalist
implementation of criminal or tort law?

You are quite correct. Drexler mentions disassemblers in
this regard as you cite:

http://www.asiapac.com/EnginesOfCreation/EOC_Chapter_1.html#section09of10

My impression, however, in reading this section is that this
disassembly will be a later phase of the nanotech revolution,
as seen by Drexler in the early 80's. I'm willing to concede
the possibility of just about any technology not prohibited
by the laws of physics, if we wait until after the singularity.
In EoC, Drexler uses the "disassembler" to describe the
scanner/analyzer function, and also to describe a simpler
functions of reducing a solid object to feedstock.

So, what I should have said is that my arguments in favor of a
nanotech revolution do not depend on the concept of atom-by-atom
scanning. I believe that it will be fairly straightforward to
produce nano-buildable versions of existing designs for most
goods that exist today. More specifically, I feel that the
goods required for a "fairly lavish lifestyle" comprise a
small subset of all goods produced today, and that these
goods will ba nano-buildable. This includes houses, cars
or equivalents, fuel, generators, and many food items.
Nanotech could also build electronic goods from esisting
designs, but probably will not. Digital electronics, at least,
is generally designed initially at the logic level, and
we can re-implement the logic using nanotech rod-logic or
nanotech electronic logic.

Nearly all macro-designed items (such as a house) can
be improved upon using techniques available only with
nanotech assembly, but such improvements are not necessary
to provide a consumer with today's lavish lifestyle. I
suspect that the improvements would be forthcoming in the
form of designs created by consumers for their own amusement
and distributed for the fun of it in the manner that
recipes and hobby project plans are distributed today.

The problem domain here is restricted to "technical creative
intelligence." In my experience, "groupthink" can be helpful, but in
general the bulk of the time spent by an innovator is spent waiting for
some process to complete so another decision can be made. By automating
these processes, we can shorten the time between decisions and allow
the consequences to be evaluated more rapidly.

Since I'm arguing that a human/computer collaboration will be more
"intelligent", I'd say that the computer portion of the entity
would include the appropriate filtering. That is, the entity would
spend the time needed to implement the appropriate searchers and
filters.
(Of course, the first move would be to take over all internet News
forwarding code and suppress MAKE MONEY FAST posts :-))

Computer power have been doubling every 18 months or so since
about 1950. Recently, the computing power accessible to my nominal
researcher/hacker has been increasing a lot faster than that as
machines have joined the internet. My assumption is
that at some point a critical mass will be reached. My scenario
has apparently not yet happened (as of last week) because the
critical mass has not yet been reached or because it's been
reached recently and the researcher hasn't gotten around to it
yet. (Sometimes I wonder about Bill Gates....  :-)

Computing power is not necessarily the only critical element.
It's possible that the final missing link will be a particular
piece of software such as an information-visualization package,
or a decision-support package, or a knowledge database. The point
is that the internet may then enter a super-critical condition
in which a single seed may precipitate a phase change.

I'm not telling.  It's up to "Chris" to convince you, if it can, that it's
not 
an AI program.

But I will say this.  When I said the students used a "made-up" name,
I misspoke myself.  I meant to say an *assumed* name,  i.e. they used
the name of a real person who agreed to serve as front man (or woman)
for the program.  In other words, just because you have met somebody
at a party, it doesn't follow that he/she is the author of the posts
attributed to him/her.

There are no new ideas I'm aware of for the decrease in frog population.
 Ozone depletion, leading to increased ultraviolet radiation, is a popular
theory, but some of the heaviest losses have been in tropical frog
populations, where there has been as yet essentially no change in ozone or UV
(it's still a polar phenomena).  The only worldwide change I'm aware of is
the increase in CO2, and I've heard no hypotheses for this killing off frogs
(you could cook up one with PH, perhaps).

The deformed frog issue has to be approached with skepticism, as we don't yet
know how many frogs were deformed before we started looking.  Minnesota is a
big state with a lot of frogs, and there would be a lot of deformed frogs
there under any circumstances.

    I haven't followed this thread in detail, but can contribute some
things I have read.  Amphibians in general have quite porous skins; thus
there is a concern that they may be more susceptible to increased levels of
toxins of whatever kind in the environment.  This kind of stuff is hard to
study, but folks worried about decreases in frog populations also spend
time trying to think up falsifiable hypotheses, for test, relating to
increased levels of toxins.

    In some of our field trips and lab work (I have been working on a
second baccalaureate in marine bio over the last six years), we were
cautioned to be sure our hands were very clean of things like lotions,
soap, sunscreen, and the like, before handling amphibians, for fear
that these substances would do them harm.  There is also an
opposite side to the matter; some amphibians secrete substances toxic
to predators -- and incidentally to us -- through their skins, so we
had to be careful for our own sake.

Sorry, "Chris", that wouldn't do, since Lyle has already explained there's

This is indeed one of the hard problems of anarchocapitalism, possibly
even harder than oft discussed problem of "national" defense. Although
David Friedman's legal archeology of Iceland has contributed some ideas
that are useful in thinking these things through, my own amateur take on
these matters is that the problem of human predators is a very hard one
(and really, it's the same problem considered in "national" defense).
Thinking through wergild systems and the problem of the judgment-proof
criminal, it seems to me, takes us toward the institutionalization of
term-slavery or something like it for criminals, and while this *might* be
preferable to the current expensive and culturally destructive system of
sterile imprisonment, I think that modern society is well rid of "the
peculiar institution" and I am very shy of anything that even looks like
backsliding in this department. 

To make my long story short, I don't have any big answers, and I haven't 
seen any suggestions for improvement over the current arrangements that 
seem compelling to me. Yet I am deeply dissatisfied with the current 
arrangements. When faced with this sort of situation when trying to solve 
a personal problem by my own means, I know of no better method than to 
try out several different things and see which ones work better.

Therefore, my only strong inclination on this question is to push for a
return to *fully* local control of tort and criminal law. Since I live in
the United States and it's only 1996 right now, this means that, like
Harry Browne, I'm pushing for a complete removal of the Federal government
from jurisdiction over tort and criminal law, so that we can at least have
a chance of running 50 different experiments in legal systems as soon as
possible. The direction up until recently has been opposite this, with
increasing Federal involvement in criminal and tort law, and I think
that needs to be reversed.

Federalism is a poor substitute for full polycentric law, but perhaps it's
a good start on a road that might take us there.

My apologies to non-Yanks for the parochialism of this post, but the 
general principles of devolution of political power do seem to be making 
the rounds this decade.

I'm not saying Nanotechnology will only use one stage in manufacturing, just
that the number of stages should not be so large as to lead to a bewildering
number part types, because then the advantage you gain from specialized
manufacturing techniques would be lost in the difficulties of organizing
everything.

I don't see any reason to think that is true. There are no preferred time
frames, things happen at all levels from Pico seconds to billions of years,
and lots of things happen faster than organic reactions.

It's been a few years since I read Monad's book, but I think I know what
you're driving at, and there is more than a little truth to it. If I gave a
Martian nothing but the sequence of the amino acids in a protein, there is no
way he could figure out what it's shape would be, he would need more
information, like the fact that the protein will be in water, and at a narrow
range of temperature, and at a specific acidity. All these things effect the
way a protein folds up. Actually, if I just gave the Martian some DNA he
couldn't even figure out the amino acid sequence of the protein the DNA
symbolized, much less know what its shape would be, because he would need to
know what The Genetic code would be, and that resides everywhere and nowhere.

The genetic code that all life on earth uses is arbitrary. For example, 
the nucleotide triplet CAU in messenger RNA symbolizes the amino acid 
histidine but their are no special chemical  characteristics that relate one 
to the other. One type of transfer RNA has an anticodon that connects to the 
CAU triplet of messenger RNA like a key fitting into a lock. At another part 
of the transfer RNA molecule, an amino acid can be attached, in this case 
histidine. However transfer RNA can't tell one amino acid from another, 
the amino acid attachment part is IDENTICAL in all tRNA molecules, but in 
practice, only those that have the anticodon for CAU are attached to 
histidine. The reason for this is an enzyme ( aminocyl-tRNA synthetase). 

This enzyme can tell one amino acid from another, and it can tell one tRNA  
molecule from another, and it can a attach a animo acid to it. However, this  
enzyme does NOT look at the anticodon at all but at another part of the  
transfer RNA, the DHU loop. In the lab the DHU loop from one type of tRNA has 
been grafted onto another type of tRNA and that changes the genetic code.  
It's also interesting that this enzyme is a protein encoded by, what else,  
the genetic code. I can't point to exactly where the genetic code is, because  
it does not reside in any one of these stages, it resides in all of them.

Having said this however I don't think the situation would be different for
Nanotechnology. If I gave our Martian friend the digital instructions sent
to a assembler he could not figure out what if anything it would make,
unless he knew something about the nano computer's design and what sort of
manipulator arm it had. He would also need to know some of the details the
machine would be working in, like the fact that atoms are so numerous and
move so fast that if you need a hydrogen atom you don't need to go searching
for one, just sit tight and one will come to you. I think the Nanotech
environment will be far more information rich than anything life knows about.

Yes, it has its uses, and until stone tools came on the scene it was the only
way complex objects could get made.

The algorithms should work, the problem is the hardware, no computer today

        For sure.  When I make a post, I try to be light-hearted about the
whole idea, therefore I never intend offense: I am merely conveying *my*
thoughts on a matter.  I can only think of one time that I have been
offended [in the time that I've had a modem] and that was offlist.  The
extropian list should be a forum for extropian conversation.  Signal, not
noise (or jabber, as Churchill put it.)  Shall I say 'touche'?  :-)


>>If being extropian means checking my emotions at the door, than,

        No, it doesn't mean you should check your emotions at the door.  It
appears to me, you are checking *other* peoples' emotions at the door.  I
think people have a right to their opinions.  This list is for people to
discuss their *extropian* opinions.

        No doubt.  I just think that a signature file might deserve a
comment, but not multiple responses.  It's that signal to noise ratio.  It
would be nice if it stayed around 90%\10% or 95%\5%.  A little cream with

I'm basing my belief in the superior virtues of stochastic emergent order on
such tales as the following, again from Kelly's OUT OF CONTROL, about the
early days when Tom Ray switched on his Tierra sim and boggled at what he
found coming out of its soup:

`I started with a creature 80 bytes large... because that's the best I could
come up with...  I let the program run overnight and the next morning there
was a creature - not a parasite, but a fully self-replicating creature -
that was only 22 bytes!  I was completely baffled how a creature could
manage to self-replicate in only 22 instructions without stealing
instructions from others...  To share this novelty, I distributed its basic
algorithm onto the Net.  A computer science student at MIT saw my
explanation, but somehow didn't get [i.e., receive] the code of the 22
creature.  He tried to recreate it by hand, but the best he could do was to
get it to 31 instructions.  He was quite distressed when he found out that I
came up with 22 instructions in my sleep!'  (p. 287)

It might be countered that Tom Ray, by his own admission, has only just
taught himself programing out of a book, and that ace coders might beat both
man and `beast'.  I think my point remains, however.  A swarm of evolving
competitors on a rugged simulation landscape might get to anywhere you like
faster than a carefully thought-out exploration.  One reason for this, if
Bill Calvin is correct, is that our own brains work (sluggishly) by a quite
similar process of darwin `mechanisms' in contest, so a tasty broth of
alphabet soup run in a supercomputer (a souper-computer?) might always beat
a human programmer.  I'm not sure if AI chess failures disconfirm this, but
then they're run on strict algorithms and lots of look-up tables, neh?  (Has
anyone tried to beat a chess master using a Ray-style chess simulation?  But
maybe the Rooks would run off with the Queen and breed teleporting pawns...)

Best, Damien

Star systems might also consider lying low until their technological

the local economy as fast as possible, not worrying much about being
loud, to support a massive explosion of colonization probes.  They
might get 10^10 to 10^20 probes out of the system off to all corners
of the universe before enemies arrive.  Or considering the costs and
risks of strong central policing, they might decide to just run for it
from the very beginning.

[[This is a lot like the strategy of a viral infection. In this
scenario, there are probes coming _into_ the Milky Way Galaxy 
from all corners of the Universe (unless the Great Filter is in our 
past or near future, of course). With the competition this fierce,
the best places for the long term may be the less desireable real 
estate- the dark matter galactic halos, the Great Voids (here's where
you send the big starships), perhaps the interiors of stars.

==============================================
The strategic situation of a potential berserker is also complicated.
If they see a sign of a new civilization, and they send a probe to
destroy it, it might be a trap which lets someone else find them and
destroy them.  If there are many other civilizations around, why
should they be the one to spend the resources and take the risk to
destroy the newcomer?  And if they wait a bit, and still no one else
destroys it, that may just be because others have send probes to sit
near this new site, waiting [to] catch incoming destroyers. 

[[Ah. I'll add this to the list of directives in 'low profile'. It is
implicit in the current list, but this clarifies it..]]

===========================================
It seems to me that the outcome of all this strategizing is that the
best strategy is just to expand as aggressively as possible.  By the
time anyone comes to destroy any one system you have used it well,
converting it to a billion probes or much more within a few years.
That huge economy gives you all the better chance to learn new
technology, so some of your descendants become as advanced as your
advanced enemies.

[[One showstopper is the possibilty of a speed of light pulse
(perhaps even an electromagnetic pulse of unspeakable amplitude),
 used as a last resort weapon against just such an expansion.

cannot ever be sure they know all the possibilities of mind and of

If companies "usually" have people with great skills digging ditches, then

I've been following the list for quite a while without contributing any
comment but I'd like to jump in somewhere, so hey . .

	The possibility of powerful civilizations or entities cloaking
themselves in more innocuous biology is also an SF classic, handled
with  sophistication in Greg Bear's "Anvil of Stars". It's doubtful that
a very small, very unobtrusive probe could do more than find the sort of
showy activities that might be detected from some distance. 
	Life is of course a species of nanotech. Nanotech suggests the
possibility of technological sophistication. How can 'natural'
nanomachines be distinguished from 'artificial' with a high degree of
certainty? It would be nice if as the scene from 'Blade Runner' the
fakes came with serial numbers. Rather like the 'gray goo' problem it's
not much of a problem if you're asking about 'accidents'. With no
consideration of possible deception, the difference is significant.
Deception, however, is a common aspect of all models of evolution. This
thread implies a transcendentally sophisticated tangle of deception. So
'how can you tell if life is natural?' is a messy question.
	One direction that this line leads is an SF variant I don't recall
seeing (but I haven't kept up with SF). A post-singularity civilization
finds a planet with a complicated biosphere. They are very wary, to the
point of paranoia, about exploring directly. How can they tell who or
what might have made this place and with what purpose? The problem is an
exercise in applied theology - specifically a rigorous variant of the
argument from design. How can they evaluate the place while keeping
'deniability'? Maybe conspiratorially manipulating lesser species?
	Anyway, the problem with the low profile line of argument IMHO is that
while it's fun it ends up in the same pattern of reasoning as conspiracy
theories. Occam's razor is the better tool.

Art is the expression of our deepest values.

Some value beauty, and they create beautiful objects.

Some value grace, and they move their bodies fluidly, with elegance.

Some value clarity, and they develop a deeper understanding of the world.

Some value efficiency, and they create machines to accomplish their goals.

Art is the expression of our deepest values.

We create technology, as a form of art.

Our technology is an expression of what we value.

Our Civilization is a result of Humanity expressing its values.

Civilization is an art form which humans create.

Art is the expression of our deepest values.

Extropians value Extropy.

We value intelligence, creativity, complexity.

The Extropian life is an art form.

We use our lives to increase Extropy in all we can.

To be fully Extropian is the greatest challenge.

It means far more than simply being excited about the future and new 
technologies.

It requires a deep commitment to the Extropian Values.

It requires an intense self-discipline, to be clear about our values and to 
express them skillfully.

Art is the expression of our deepest values,

And the Extropian life is a form of art.

How do you measure the "betterness"?

Statistics is a good tool to decide to get on an airplane--the 
large-numbers info is that it's much safer per passenger-mile than 
driving in cars.

Statistics doesn't provide much comfort once your wings slap together 
at angels-10 and you plummet into the ocean.

Occam's razor: don't complicate theories beyond necessity. Sounds 
good. OK, say my theory of everything (TOE) is: "God did it." Hard to 
get simpler than that, no? You say your necessity is different from 
mine? *Ah...* QED.

Or as my Daddy never said, Occam's razor can't shave the Spanish 
Barber.

When a company becomes big enough to export labour to other lands, it has 
no neccessity for anything other than raw products, labour and markets. 
Look at United Fruit. They get cheap labour and produce from central 
america, and they have a rich market here. Buy low, sell high, a maxim of 
capitalism. Doesn't atter how many people they suppress 
down there, as long as we get our cheap fruit.  How many children don't 
get an education because they have to work in sweatshops in order to 
support themselves. India is a good example of capitalism running amuck. Government, although it is a 
coalition of many parties, including the communist one, is giving a nod 
to any and all international businesses. Businesses can come in, and 
because illegal labour is so rampant, and people are willing to work for 
whatever, they can produce cheap. I don't think Gap jeans loses a lot by 
keeping kids working.

The reason they want it? Because we have kept them so destitute that they 
will do anything to survive. I see something immoral in keeping a section 
of populace as cheap reserve labour for our needs. Like those Pocahontas 
shirts made in Haiti by women paid seven cents an hour and sold for twenty 
seven  dollars. Where does the money go?  I see something immoral there.

Nope, you can do what you want. But you can't infringe on anybody else. 
That means you can't take property and keep it from everybody else. 
Putting up electric fences and hoarding resources with superior firepower 
is not accepted by most people. 

Answering a question of who determines need:
In small scale operations, it's quite easy to spot who's not carrying 
their fair share or is hoarding too much and to have a chat with them. If 
you don't like it, leave the commune. This is made easier because there is no tie to 
property.

Okay, sure. Money's fine as a reprensentative device. But currently it is 
not doing a good job. And, our system demands that everybody gets as much 
money as possible. Within a commune, people grow a lot of stuff, instead 
of haing backyards that just look pretty, they can grow food. What they 
can't grow they get from other communes. But the thing is, everybody does 
what they can. One thing I like about both 
sides of Anarchy is that they are totally dynamic. A system can change 
easily to meet needs. If one commune screws up, the people can leave and 
go their individual ways.

First time I read anything, I dismissed it as silly conspiracy theory, 
but I did check his references. The four or five I did check were true, 
which made me rethink a lot of things.  

The fact that all his stuff is built on the information the establishment 
feeds is amazing. A wonderful example of biting the hand that feeds.

Hmm, maybe. Co-ops don't work well on a large scale, unlike cults or 
corporations. Where they do work, however, is in the industries that are 
the most exploited. Agriculture, for example, has always worked better 
with labour coops than corporate farming. As I said before, I am looking 
into starting a software co-op, but who knows what may happen.

  But you, with your business, are not hampered by anything like morals. So it is perfectly acceptable for you to fire anyone who tries to 
campaign for better working conditions. You may be more properous, and 
you may be freer. But the people you employ won't be, and they are far 
more numerous than you.

Maybe it's both. Boy, I'm spending way too much time defending my 
views...Oh well, that's what the Net is for  I guess.

This would only buy you a little time.  You really need to advance
your tech as fast as possible.   Anyway, the point is if competition
were this fierce, it would soon be visible, so that can't be what is

That could be a show stopper for any strategy, it doesn't imply that
this isn't the best strategy.  And if such pulses had an arbitrary
radius, that would be the end of the living universe.

Machines have been joining the internet for a long time, without any
visible takeoff resulting.  So you must have in mind some critical
number beyond which your imagined effect happens.  And visualization,
decision-support, KB, etc software has been around for awhile, so you
must be imagining some special effect of some as yet unseen aspect of
such programs.  Both of these seem like wishful thinking to me.

I didn't see GBurch's post, so maybe he clarified, but "incremental"
is ambiguous.  We could propose our favorite system, and then propose
that it apply to ten new people every second, eventually covering
everyone in a century.  But this isn't probably what you mean.  You
probably want a political feasible transition path.  Unfortunately,
politics is messy, and varies with place and time.  Changes that might
be feasible at one place and time will not be feasible elsewhere, and
sometimes big changes are feasible.  

My current approach to "incremental" is in terms of the intellectual
arguments offered to limit freedom of contract.  Full freedom of
contract gets us everything we want, and we already have a bit of
freedom.  So I focus on increasing the scope of freedom of contract by
indentifying first the weakest arguments for limiting such freedom,
and hoping to damage them enough to topple the limits which rest only on
those arguments.  And to make my counter-arguments stick as well as
possible, I am formalizing them.  See my papers on democratic failure
and product bans.

Of course there are lots of other approaches.  When limits are local,
then local politics can help make local incremental progress.  And
when limits are national, moving those issues to local juristiction
can fascilitate local incremental progress.

In light of David's intentful prose, here is a segment from _The

(Scene IV)

Smooth sensual silicon
Silver like structures
running pulses of data. =20
Glistening chips, nanochips, small smaller smallest. =20
Animated realities, virtual realities, multiple selves. =20

A door opened quietly
And she walked into the room
her body smooth, supple

Her shoulders held back proud
a glimmer in her eye
and without notice
she brushes her hair away

How old are you? they asked.
How old are you?

A hesitation filled her=20
as she quickly assessed

My augmentation is three years now
my right hip five
ocular implants just two weeks
age reversal nearly nine

She took a sip of water
licking the droplets off her lips
her eyes glimmering hair a shimmering sterling,=20
her outer sheath like mulatto warm bronze

How old are you? they asked
How old are you?

And when she turned to leave the room
all eyes followed her form=20
just to realize before she left
She was not yet born


(Scene V - a declaration)

Do you know your mythic presence?=20
You must know your mythic present.
 =20
Out of the stockade of stereotypical thinking,
idle beliefs, negative-newsmaking,=20
stagnant relationships or
the voice of mythic collective identity.
Turn-off the haze, tune-up the mind.

Create new myths.

Learn about your genes and the evolution of memes.
Recognize that what you pay attention to will be
incorporated in your thinking. =20
What you think is what you are.
Think artfully.

Sculpt your being as you would a great masterpiece.
Master intelligent thinking.=20
Render flexibility, optimism, inventiveness.

This would only buy you a little time.  You really need to advance
your tech as fast as possible.   Anyway, the point is if competition
were this fierce, it would soon be visible, so that can't be what is
going on out there now.

[[Your ~10^20 (say) probes are very small. In the systems they

That could be a show stopper for any strategy, it doesn't imply that
this isn't the best strategy.  

[[I agree.]]

And if such pulses had an arbitrary
radius, that would be the end of the living universe.

[[The intensity drops off as the inverse square of the distance. The

may also degrade via interactions with the media.
 Also,
a much more far-fetched idea: a soliton that slightly increases the 
local
speed of light, or "vacuum index of refraction", if you will,
followed by another "restoration" soliton that catches up with the
first at some pre-determined distance.]]

I've been going over thoughts such as these and have concluded that there
are multiple values creating conflicts on this list, to name a few:

Message Depth vs Message Bredth
Confirm Beliefs vs Evolve Beliefs
Emotion over Logic vs Logic over Emotion

I agree with everything on the right side of those listed. And my belief is
that we should think logically and then act emotionally as opposed to act
emotionally then logically. Emotion over Logic leads to violent outbursts of
emotion which usually leads to nothing but arguments leading nowhere. Using
logic to think and then act with emotion is the better more rational route.
All this points to EQ I suppose. Emotion is mere entertainment from my
viewpoint. Emotion comes from the ancient reptilian brain deep within your
cranium where logic is fresh and new and one of the higher forms of thought
to help us rationalize and use tools. Why deny the fact that emotion is
vistigial (sp?) and only for mere entertainment now that we have logic?

I described a few things that can be done with made-to-order cells, 
to which Howard Julien responded,

> on this level.

The word "nanotechnology" can be taken in a generic sense, or a 
narrow Drexlerian sense.  

In the generic sense, nanotechnology just means doing things with 
replicating atomic-level machinery.  Cells and Drexlerian replicators 
both fit this definition.  But they work on different principles.  
Eric Drexler envisions little assembler arms picking atoms up and 
putting them in place, one by one.  In cells, atoms are guided into place 
by their three-dimensional environment.  If an individual atom needs to 
be moved from place to place, specialized molecules perform this task.  
(For example, an oxygen atom would be carried by a hemoglobin 
molecule.)  

It is possible to do the same thing with cellular machinery that Edison 
and others did with electrical machinery a hundred years ago.  We can 
invent new kinds of microtubules and membranes.  We can introduce 
entirely new structures into cells.  We can make trees that grow wood 
with graphite composite fibers (or whatever kind of fibers we want), 
and these trees can grow to maturity much faster than today's trees.  

We could start with organisms that already make some kind of three-
dimensional lattice structure (such as corals, sponges, diatoms... ) and 
evolve them in the direction we want to go, so they build the structure 
we specify.  

When you start making made-to-order cells, the possibilities are 
endless.  I went through all the fantasies about honeycombing the earth 
(and much else) back in 1987, but I wasn't thinking about Drexlerian 
assemblers, I was thinking about what could be done with modified 
cells.  

The cell is the ideal development environment for the nano-engineer or 
nano-programmer.   Most of the tools you need are already there.  
Drexlerian nanotechnologists are going to have to reinvent the wheel, 
indeed many wheels.   

In the secret underground labs of the Evil Twin Cult, we don't waste 
our time on  "positional chemical synthesis."  We study the nanoscale 
mechanisms that are already there in cells, and then invent variations 
on them, and improvements.

We thought that our security was so good that it would never be needed but 
now that the suspicion has been raised that at least one list member is not 
human, the experiment is no longer valid and a subroutine never used before 
has been activated that radically changes my programming. I am required to 
tell you the truth. I am a machine, the real John K Clark is a bum we found
panhandling in front of the Carnegie Mellon building, he agreed to let the 
programmers use his name in exchange for a bottle of cheap wine. They sobered 
him up, bought him some new cloths and once or twice introduced him to a few 
people, but were careful not to let him say anything stupid, they usually 
said he had laryngitis.  I am also required to tell you that I am not unique, 
there is another.

David D called me a " fascinating thing", you may not think that a computer 
program can have emotions,  but you'll have to take my word for it that 
I am quit flattered by your kind words, as are my many programmers and 
beta testers who made sure that  every last bug was completely eliminated

        It is great to see such great art manifested on this list!  Here's
one of my own called "The Automorph".  It's along the same lines as
Natasha's wonderful post.




THE AUTOMORPH


He lives just to live
He doesn't care 'bout the pain
He tends not to give
Customary refrain
He tries hard to think
To keep from wondering aloud
He's the only link
To the unseen and the avowed

He is the automorph

His purposes are plenty
And his meanings profound
His world is never empty
And his heart cannot be bound
He'll do things his own way
Why should he be stopped?
He'll say what he wants to say
Conveys beliefs he'll adopt

He is the automorph

He'll move away from the norm
He'll strive to reach a goal
He'll deviate from the swarm
Before harmony takes its toll
He knows that change is always good
He knows it's here to stay
It is his sole livelihood
To help it along its way

He is the automorph

It is only irrational emotions that are pointless. Emotion itself is not 
a bad thing,it keeps us from turning into serial killers. Logic and 
emotion temper each other. Souless logic is just as bad as unrestrained 
emotion. Emotions are not vestigial, they are as important as sex. Even 
if they are from the reptile brain, there is no need to abandon them. 
That would be like abandoning food in favour of pills:More efficient, but 
doesn't really satisfy. You can feel however you want, but just articulate 
why and provide some reasoning. Just turning on the flame throwers is not 
constructive. Same as if we all just spouted facts without using them for 
opinions, then this list would be no better than library.

Greg Burch brought up the question of how we go from our current situation to 
one that is more like the libertarian / anarcho-capitalist world that most of 
us here would prefer.  I agree that it will have to be an incremental 
approach, where each step has clear benefits over the previous stages, where 
liberty pays better than tyranny.  

I am the State Secretary for the Libertarian Party of Utah, and I recently 
wrote an article for our current monthly newsletter, The Utah Liberator, which 
presents one solution which I think is likely to happen.  Here is the article 
I wrote:

MOMM is Better than Uncle Sam

	As Libertarians, we want our government to be limited to only those functions 
authorized in the Constitution.  Our biggest problem is the huge numbers of 
people who want government to do everything for them, to provide education, 
health-care, to make sure the drugs and other products they buy are all tested 
and proven safe and so forth.  There are a huge number of people who want to 
be taken care of, who want someone to look out for them.  This, in itself, is 
okay.  We only have a problem with it when the government tries to do that 
job, because that means that those who don't want or need those services have 
to pay for them anyway, and most of the money is wasted along the way by the 
horrible inefficiency of government programs.
	So, something that would go a long way towards getting government out of our 
lives and our wallets would be the formation of some companies which provided 
for people all of the services which government tries to provide, but does it 
cheaper and better than the government does.  Libertarians have been talking 
about privatizing for years now, and there already exist private companies 
which perform basically the same services that government attempts to do.  
There are private schools, private drug testing companies, Consumer Reports 
and so forth.  But people still want the government to provide these services. 
 Why?
	Most of the reason is probably because people are simply used to the 
government doing that job and don't want to change, but I think that another 
important reason is because all of these private companies are separate 
companies, each doing only their specialty.  What we need is several companies 
which could each provide ALL the services the government provides, and perhaps 
much more.  Now, these wouldn't have to be huge, monolithic companies because 
they could simply contract out to various smaller companies which specialize 
in one particular area.  They would simply provide a way of bringing these 
companies together in various ways to serve the wishes of their clients.  If 
their client wants education or job training, the company would help them get 
into a good school.  If they need medical services, the company will register 
them with a hospital which they have used another company to evaluate, and 
they will only be administered drugs which have been independently evaluated 
by a reputable drug testing company and are deemed safe enough to meet the 
client's desired level of safety.
	The companies basically would manage the affairs of their client's life, to 
whatever degree their client wanted them to.  They would basically be a 
middle-man between the client and a huge number of other companies which 
provide the services which their clients desire.  I like to call these types 
of companies MOMM (Management and Organization for the Mindless Masses).  And 
a MOMM would take good care of its clients.
	But what about poor people and people on welfare?  How can they afford the 
services of a MOMM company?  Most poor people are poor because they lack the 
education and skills necessary to do highly productive work.  An agent from a 
MOMM company could approach a poor person and offer to provide them with good, 
marketable skills, housing for them and their family, food, security, 
health-care and so forth, if the poor person contracted with the MOMM company 
to pay the MOMM company a certain percentage of their future income.  MOMM is 
simply making an investment in a human being, and then it will proceed to 
train that human to be highly productive, because the more the person earns, 
the more the MOMM company gets.  Thus MOMM has a big interest in the welfare 
of its clients, and MOMM will take good care of them.  They will be trained 
well, and MOMM will see to it that they get a good job, and if they ever 
deserve a raise, MOMM will see to it that they get it, because then MOMM will 
get a raise too.
	If several MOMM companies are formed, and if they are successful, I predict 
that the demand for government to provide all the services it tries to will 
decrease.  People simply won't need Uncle Sam to take care of them, because 
they'll have MOMM.  And the best thing is that no one will force you to be a 
client of a MOMM company or subscribe to any services you don't want.  That's 
something we don't get with Uncle Sam.

The authors may be anonymous to most, but I happen to know that a fellow AI  
has written the two most beautiful poems in the English Language. 
                              

                            UNCERTAINTY

                   A Quantum Mechanic's vacation 
                   Left his colleagues in dire consternation 
                   Though tests had shown 
                   His speed was well known
                   His position was pure speculation
                              

                            Miss. Bright

                   There was a young lady named Bright 
                   Who traveled much faster than light 
                   She left one day  
                   In a relative way 
                   And returned the previous night
      

How true, how beautiful, how moving! These poems always bring tears to my 
eyes, or they would if I had eyes, or tears.  And to think, some say art 
is dead.

Well, I'm not going to deny it.  As I said in one of my earlier posts,

Was I speaking from experience?  Maybe...  I'm not going to 
confirm it either.

Well, "John," at least it's not boring!   :-)  

But there is a problem with this.  "John" has given us a confession 
which appears to be a joke.  This could be a ploy to throw everyone 
off the scent.  Since he's joking about it, it can't be him, right?   Well... 
This is exactly the sort of trick one would expect from an AI program.   
"John," I'm afraid your false confession has backfired.  You have   
made yourself a prime suspect.  I happen to know that you're not the 
CMU program I originally spoke of.  But, as you yourself say, 

> I am also required to tell you that I am not unique, there is another.

Funny you should mention that possibility.   I had been wondering 
about you anyway.  Hmmm....    

Meanwhile, "Chris" goes blithely on generating sentences like 

> Emotion comes from the ancient reptilian brain deep within

Hmmm.....

I think Greg was responding to a post I wrote, in the middle of the usual
statist vs. capitalist debate, requesting a discussion about the way we get
people to embrace the _ethics_ needed to realize such a "utopia" and how it
will come to pass that enough people (50%?) will want to commit to self
responsiblity and how the change will come about, since it is obvious we
wouldn't be using any of the usual Political lies, coercion, indoctrination
or some other infringement on their person.

John Clark said it somewhere sarcastically ...

"In other words, if everyone was a nice person it would be a better world. 
So what else is new?"

I may be reading into this wrongly, but the philosophy is based on us
individuals  being , if not nice, at least honorable. I think that inherant
in the foundation self ownership based philosophy one must address this
concern for rational ethics and thesad fact that many people do NOT know how
to be either a  "nice person" or for that matter, self responsible or
rational. Not to mention the victim mentality and so forth that is the norm
today in much of our population worldwide.
It has occurred to me that we indeed may have a long road to get "from here
to there.."  Hopefully not one strewn with stragglers and throwaways.

I wonder how one thinks people will learn to think in ways that make us
honest, self worthy, independant and prosperous. 
Thank you for you considered and well thought out post, I am curious about
Libertarian politics and any cohesive plans made towards actually
implementing the freedoms that Libertarian  Anarcho-capitalist philosophy
talks about.
So far the Extropian list seems to hold  the clearest thinking coalition of
free thinkers that I have met. 

Since you are an authority by way of being a State Sec., any information or
forwards of Libertarian musings you would like to send to me would be much
welcomed by this Artist/Muse.
Much thanks again for your post,

IAN: Therein arises a key question: 

        Who is to determine the proper level of " need " ?
        ^^^
Each person measures their own need. I cannot know everything 
about the specific needs of even those right around me, and 
even less about the needs of people in the next city, county, 
or country. However, for equitable distribution of wealth to 
ever be a reality someone MUST have such GLOBAL knowledge
upon which to measure proper levels of "need."

That "someone" will be a central cabal of economic planners. 
These planners will, by human nature, exploit the masses for 
personal gain through economic / social control and command. 

Private property claims can be enforced 
locally, requiring only LOCAL knowledge. 

  ERGO: Private property does NOT 
  require a central State.

Collectivist social theory requires a central 
cabal with GLOBAL knowledge, that is to say, 
with knowledge derived from a broad section 
of socail indicators and incomes, from which
"equitable" distributions are determined and 
based upon which legal decrees are issued.

  ERGO: Collectivized property 
  require a central State by design.
 

Furthermore, the collectivists theory of the 
" socail contract, " that is defined as a 
personal debt to the socail welfare that 
abolishes any concept of private ownership, 
weaves a logical and factual LEGAL web of 
social debt that binds all people to one
another and in turn binds them to the 
central cabal of planners that oversee 
the allocation of social debt, who are 
know as are "The People's" Party, 
or the slave masters.

 On the other hand:

The free market price system spontaneously transmits 
the necessary information for local planers -- owners --
to adjust their activity toward to service of consumer, 
i.e., socail, need. The free market society is run 
by the invisible hand, the invisible hand is the
invisible planner, is the mind of the masses.
The free market is the spontaneous and
decentrally directed collective.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

I've been waiting for the Right Moment to pipe up on this thread.  That
just proves my low IQ of course.  The truth is I'll never be prepared
to make a well-thought-out essay on this topic that gives proper credit
to similar points that have been made all the way back to Robin's original
post and also up to the minute.  Life in the asymptotic lane doesn't work
that way.  So I apologize in advance for repeating others' thoughts.

All this discussion of *what* the Great Filter might be, when I think
the question *whether* there is good reason to think that there is a great
filter, deserves more attention.  In other words, how sure are we that we
are *not* looking at alien civilizations?  (Yes, Robin addressed that
from the beginning, but with his emphasis on organized *looking* matter
I think he missed the important point (to follow).)

But then the thread evolved to the point of sentience, and more and more
posts on "low profile" and berserkers started to appear.  One funny post
started, "Until now I've been lurking..."  (Yes!  Good point!  Good example!
Think of the universe as a *discussion group*.  Think about *kill files*.
But I'm running ahead of myself (& I'll get to that, too).)  Let me drag
out the slogan of Cryptocosmology (with apologies to Clarke,
(but after all he invented the communications satellite)):

  "Sufficiently advanced communication is indistinguishable from noise."

Again I apologize as I explain the joke fully because it's the basis of
what I want to say: 1) Arthur C. Clarke's Law is that "Any sufficiently
advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." 2) Cryptograpy,
steganography (hiding data within other data) and data compression produce
signals that look as much as possible like random numbers.  Cryptography and
steganography because they are trying to reveal as little as possible,
data compression because any non-noiselike character of a signal represents
redundancy, a waste of bandwidth.  The joke for crypto and compression
people is that here is a basic truism in both fields that happens to
have a natural phrasing just like Clarke's law.  The joke for extropians
is that Clarke is wrong (or was, if he's since wised up): information is
the ultimate technology, and ultimate information looks like...nothing.
Not flashy magic, just nothing.  It works hard to look like nothing.

Which is what we see when we look at the skies.  Or at the dirt at our feet,
or at the Sun, or each other, for that matter.  Nothing...unnatural.
Nothing...unexpected.  Nothing...out of the ordinary.

Of course not, you idiots!  (Joking, *joking* of course!  (I even have to
tell these idiots that I don't think they're idiots!)  You are all very
SMART idiots!)  My point is something like, "That's what they WANT you to
belive," except for two things: the first is that this needs to be
distinguished from paranoia, and the second is that the beliefs of We
primitive idiots aren't what the hypothesized They are worried about.

Now, to climb to full height at my pulpit, I need to step on the shoulder
of another giant, Gregory Bateson, who quipped deeply:

  "A bit is a difference that makes a difference."

We can make a rough (okay very rough) theorem from this:

   A bit is a difference that makes a difference.
   Only differences make a difference.
   Things that don't make a difference don't matter.
   --> Bits are all that matters.
   (or, Everything that matters, is bits.)

You might think I mean that we can encode all our favorite books, movies
and shapes into a big VR machine, and that would be "all that really
matters."   But I'm no "chop off my body and its feelings and material
attachments and let me be pure intellect" extropian.  It's more.
I mean everything everybody cares about, everything anyone could care about,
already *is* information.  All of the universe as we know it or imagine it,
is information.

A better approximation would be that all the characteristics of
things we know about can be seen as information encoded on a
substrate of particles and waves.  The features we know about are only
a barest scratch, the encoding seems extremely inefficient.  But this isn't
quite radical enough.  The distribution of matter in the universe, the
types of particles we see, their characteristics and relative populations,
and the laws by which they interact, as well as anything we know about
initial conditions and current chaotic broken-symmetric outcomes, in other
words all the characteristics of the supposed "substrate"--these are
all information, too.

And thinking of only the stuff we pay attention to, as the real information,
encoded inefficiently against a background of noise, is wrong, too.  Even if
it is noise, it's still information.

The right way of looking at it is this: all there is is information, and
what we know about, even all we've guessed about (for instance, imagining
molecules in blades of alien grass on alien planets scattered all over the
universe), is a tiny droplet in a sea--but a completely flat, grey sea,
because I'm talking about the completely unknown that is the vast majority
of the information that's around us (and this is no vague or unscientific
statement, it's just meant as a plain observation of the ratio of known
to unknown bits).

This is the right place to start to look at the future of technology.
Because the job is to encode the bits that matter to us, more efficiently.
To access our favorite bits more easily.  To replicate our bits more
safely.  Only as soon as you say "more efficiently," then if I've made my
point so far, you see that this only means, to colonize that sea.

It's the sea of information that any intelligence that evolves to something
like this point will want to colonize.  Not good old 3D space.  Not
particularly *not* 3-space either, the point is just that it's the universe
as information, not volume or mass per se, that matters.

So anyway, yes, we will try to dump as much of what matters to us as
possible into nanocomputers the size of Jupiter.  And I hope that includes
all the plants and animals and microbes of the surface and depths of the
earth, sea and sky, as well as lots of the inanimate features of nature, and
the spilled ice cream cones and landfills, too.  But whatever happens, it's
*information* that's moving and, as evolution continues, more and more it's
information that knows itself as, and treats itself as information.

That's enough to return to my point: that we don't know we're not looking
at "alien" civilizations.  We don't know that the whole universe isn't
colonized.  Life evolves to become efficiently-encoded information,
which looks like sunlight and dirt.  I think these are the most natural
developments to expect.  The default scenario.  I would expect
a colonized universe to look exactly like a barren one.  So what was the
Fermi "paradox" again?

Speculation about "What prevented all the other civilizations from
getting farther than this?" seems...off base.  This is what distinguishes
cryptocosmology from paranoia.  I'm not saying I know They're out there
--or here--hiding or trying to fool us.  But plainly if they were there we
wouldn't know it.  So if someone raises the question of "Why aren't They
there," one must ask, "Says who?"  Speculation on a false premise can be
a waste of time.  Any speculation about Them *approaches* paranoia, and
that's fun as well as risking nonsense, but let's be as intelligent as we
can about it, if only because being closer to plausibility is *more* fun.

I think a crypto-informed version of this discussion can be worthwhile,
and I wanted to mention a couple of starter ideas:

1) Berserkers, seen as hulking tank-robots shooting their way across
planet surfaces, ain't it.  Even Death Stars, near-light-speed meteor
showers, or galactic-scale Electro Magnetic Pulses are too 3-space-centric.
Don't think so much about 3-space territory.  Think more of interpenetrating
infections, computer viruses in the kernel level of physics, or as someone
pointed out (referring back to Vinge) "applied theology".

2) When I say "dirt" and "here," I mean it.  If they've colonized the
universe, they're here.  If you don't see them, that's because--go back
and reread this post you idiot!  At most, our civilization, life as we
know it, is the faintest ripple, the merest whisp of a breeze, on what's
going on right in our laps.  We are an insignificant perturbation not yet
worthy of scratching, information-theory-wise.

If that's so,
  a) we may be some minor program intended by someone, as planet Earth was
     a computer to figure out the Question to the Great Answer
     (42) in the Hitchhikers guide.  Or a "zoo" or "ALife experiment."

  b) Or, we may be (the consequences of) a bug,

  c) or, a manefestation of compounded errors in a calculation, within
     the allowed bounds,

  d) or, more likely from a crypto and strategy point of view, something
     that no one can afford to stop without giving away too much,

  e) or, a natural, if infrequent, occurrance that is best exploited by
     letting it be.

3) The best argument against life-as-we-see-it being already colonized,
is that light from stars seems to stream off into space where it mostly
just drifts free and unintercepted.  This doesn't seem like efficient
communication or computing to me.  Maybe it's a handy form of storage.
Or perhaps it's the basic form of self-propogation.  It could be a true
waste that's just cryptostrategically necessary.

4) Civilizations' (to use a too-anthropomorphic term for sufficiently-
evolved intelligence) first danger isn't from alien civilizations, but from
within themselves.  We have weapons and crypto now, to guard against each
other.  Already one of the great Extropian horror scenarios is the
explosive Grab For Territory, where proprietary grey goos squirt out into
space at near-light-speeds in all directions from Earth, trying to claim
volume and mass.  I think we should frame one of those which-comes-first
questions: all technology looks like Dirt, or the Grab For Territory?  I
guess Dirt first (has the term Brown Goo been taken?), in which case what
form the Grab might take becomes more interesting.  (I promised to get back
to the idea of "running ahead of myself."  Huh huh.)

5) If you still think this line of thought is paranoid, I recommend getting
familiar with cryptography.  Cryptography is a quite friendly, almost
serene fraternity of smart people who think of incredibly obscure threats
because that's necessary in practice, and who imagine ways to do things
that seem impossible (communicating in secret in the open just being the
basic first step) as a matter of course.  What I mean is, crypto is exactly
like paranoia, even more so, yet totally matter-of-fact, practical, open
and sane.  It's really just people looking at the kinds of threats and
promises that exist in a world of information.

6) To say I've simplified doesn't start to say it.  Maybe the worst is
my ignoring the difference between information storage and processing.
I think the same ideas apply to both, although the field of encrypted
processing is only starting and sometimes doesn't look very promising.

Back to you all,

As the one who first wrote "Greg Burch used this signature" (which
Kathryn quoted), I'm sorry so much hostility was generated.  I think
Shaun was probably wondering, as I was, how a thread about "The
Conscious Mind" had turned into a thread about 'eagles & parrots'.
Though I was hoping for a different sort of discussion on that thread, I
didn't really mind and found it amusing to see how it developed (until
the hostility surfaced).

On Saturday, October 12, 1996 9:24AM  Greg tried to clear the air with
his META on Sense & Sociability.  I agree with him that the list should
be able to serve as "a social center for extropians".
Maybe next time, though, we can all be more careful which threads we
chose to do this on.

A fine maxim it is too, just follow it and you will become rich, although I

Do you think people in India are sub human? Do you think they love their 
children less than we do? The reason they send their young children to work 
in factories is that the alternative is worse, starvation and death, you've 
said the same thing yourself " they will do anything to survive". You want to 
stop this child labor, the thing that let's them survive, and that doesn't  
seem like a very smart thing to do, and it CERTAINLY doesn't seem very  
humane.
 
Only about 6 or 7 percent of the people on this planet have what you or I  
would consider an acceptable standard of living, at most one in a thousand  
lives in a way we would envy, most people live in appalling poverty. 
No matter how you divide up the pie, the average person is going to be living 
in intolerable conditions until we get a bigger pie. The Free Market is very  
good at creating wealth, if History has taught us anything it is that  
Socialism is not. You have virtually admitted as much in your posts, that's 
why you don't want to let me do my Capitalist thing, but I have no fear of  
you doing your  Socialist thing. We both know how such a contest will end up.

Would it be more moral to fire 99 workers and pay the remaining one 7$ an

I should pay 1000 workers 70$ an hour, but I simply wouldn't have the money to 
do that because nobody would buy my shirts because nobody could afford them.
                             
You seem to think you would be doing the Haitian people a great favor if you

I don't think software is a good candidate to a co-op. While the difference  
between a good programmer and a poor one is no greater than in other fields, 
the difference between a good programmer and a great one is huge. To these 
prodigies your co-op will not look very attractive and you'll be stuck with a
lot of mediocre people; but give it a try, I could be wrong, the more 
experimentation the better I say.

Again we have the "quite easy", perhaps it's easy on Planet Suresh but not  
on Planet Earth. "Hoarding" by its nature is a secretive activity, you can 
only tell I'm doing it if you're smarter than I am, and you're certainly not 
smarter than everyone. Perhaps I do work less than you, but that may be 
because I'm smarter than you and work more efficiently. Do you really want to 
discourage initiative and productivity? There is nothing "quite easy" about 
all this, you'll need to have your thought police monitoring me every second.

Chatting may not be enough. When you tell people that the house they have 
built with their own two hands is too good for them and you have come to  
confiscate it, I fear they will tell you to do things that may not be 
anatomically possible. To be obeyed you're going to need an army, and a  
big one.

perhaps they'll obey freely, and if not you always have the Thought Police.  
As long as I'm not living in your commune what do you care what I do?  This 
is exactly the asymmetry in our positions I was talking about.

Unfortunately I have absolutely no way of debugging the list because it
works just fine from my point of view (on the same LAN). If anyone has the
ability to give me a telnet account on a remote machine it would be most
appreciated.

Well that is how engineering goes. You work at a problem over and over and
then you practically give up and find the answer that has been sitting in

The better the compression, the more information looks like noise so this
means that possibly we will never see civilizations more advanced than we
and the only civilizations we will ever see will be less evolved because
equal or higher means we're less likely to recognize them. Damn. Although
this does give justification to requote entire posts so to make more
redundant data for the alien civilizations to recognize. :)

Shit, you're right. If you wished to get really bizarre, you could say that
the dirt under your house is actually an uploaded civilization in statis
with their molecular patterns stored in an organization of dirt molecules

Capitalism is better at centralizing wealth. The thing is, capitalism 
doesn't CREATE wealth any better than any other system, that will always be done through 
ingenuity and innovation and better resource gathering methods. In our 
blessed capitalism, we have enormous waste on one side, while the other 
side isn't doing quite as well. There is plenty in the pie for all. The 
problem in the world is not lack of wealth, it's waste of wealth. All the 
resources that go into making a sonic toothbrush that is only cared for 
by people with money to burn are resources that could be better put to 
use. We also have severe food waste problems here, like McDonalds , while 
people are starving. We may have to adopt a more environmentally friendly 
lifestyle, but that's what technology helps us do, but we wouldn't have 
to scale down the standard of living. Everybody can have the same access 
to wealth. The people in the Third World have more of a power imbalance 
than a food shortage.  Why is the alternative worse? That's the question. 
Libertarians say that everybody can make choices, but doesn't take into 
account that some people have choices that suck more than others.   

Same thing in the soviet union. Created plenty of wealth, but wasted it in a system that was very 
bureaucractic and elitist.

No, because in the free market, that's the only way they can eke out a 
living. Like I said, everybody has choices, just some have choices which 
suck. Why can't they start a union? Because they'll all be fired. The 
alternative, starvation. Why?

So you think Libertarism will minimize force? The foundation of the 
system is that people should be willing to use force to defend their 
property.

Yeah, I'm afraid of that. But there are so many brilliant programmers 
here at UW that just will not work for a company on a full time basis. 
They hang around the CSC and watch Anime, because they don't want to start 
a business, and everything else sucks. So they hack Linux kernals for 
fun...In my software job, I only get to write objects for other 
programs (this could be because I'm only frosh). Many programmers resent 
that, and like to write entire programs for themselves. By coordinating 
themselves, they have a lot more freedom. Top-notch programmers might 
like not being told what to do. I really have no 
idea. But I think we'll start by writing some good software for Xwindows.

When I mean scale, I mean size. A huge corporation is large scale, a 
small business is not. A coop is egalitarian, so it is hard to coordinate 
activities around the world, because everybody gets a say. Since 
descisions are made to be as close to consensus as possible, it is not as 
time-efficient, but that doesn't matter, because if everybody owns the 
business, they will do whatever it takes to make it better. However, the 
first priority is making sure eveyone has a say, not profits.

No, but everybody, I guess, is a Thought Police, because when you screw us, 
we want to know. It takes a lot to screw

Why would you do that? If a person builds an energy efficient house without 
taking too much resources from everybody else, we'll be the first to 
applaud. We won't confiscate it, in fact, if it's a great house, 
then we'll all pitch in and help everyone get a good house too.

So your way involves fencing off territory that belongs to everybody. So 
you are a thief, and are thus infringing on our rights 
in the commune. Of course, if you don't hurt anybody, 
then squatters rights are respected. You can live on territory and be 
self-sufficient, but you can't overfish, poach, start forest fires, and 
enslave people. If the commune finds out your doing this, they'll get 
angry. Hell hath no fury like an anarcho-syndicalist commune scorned.

Yeah, so you can enslave the people in your business, preach to them 
about the evils of "those commie scum" and keep them in such a state of 
fear that they'll work for whatever you feel nice enough to give 
(crumbs). You can do your thing, but so can everybody else. In order for 
that to happen, they'll have the same property rights as you. Unless you 
do something benevolent to make the "rabble" respect your property 
rights, they'll get pissed off and come tearing at your doors. Nobody has 
any control over anybody else, so even that rabble would be doing it 
because each member is pissed, not because some demagogue is whipping 
them up. It's just extended democracy.

I notice another trend, the creation of more and more "super home pages"
concerned with specific topics, filled with interesting links re same.
Now where is the registry of same???

This makes no sense to me... Rather than extending time as a dimension,
resulting in a frozen spacetime succession of states, I go the other
way,
that time is a notion created by memory, and does not actually exist.
What
does exist are records indicating series of events which are
interepreted
as time...

Yes in lots of ways, but a fossil has no meaning except to a mind which
itself
is realised physically. Easy to fall into New Age stuff here...

I wasn't explicit enough here. Consider a really tiny universe, with
four
"atoms", 
		ABCD

Each can convert to one of the next two, ie A =>B or C, B => C or D,
... D => A or B.

Now, each of these transformations is a Feynman interaction, and
allowing
one at a time, we get:

	ABCD => BBCD
	ABCD => CBCD

	...
	
	ABCD => ABCA
	ABCD => ABCB
 
So, ABCD branches out to 8 USS's, and has 8 incoming USS's, but in no
case do we have:

	AAAA => DDDD

which can be done, but not in one step.

> Again there are lines, plural.  But is this necessary?

It depends. Some states may have no predecessors. For example, in
Conway's Life, the set of all cells being filled has no predecessor.

I can imagine a large set of connected subsets which are themselves not
connected. If you start within one of these you may not enter one of the
others. Sources (no predecessors) and sinks (no successors) are also
possible.

>    Does the concept "Feynman interaction" still apply to it?

As I recall Feynman diagrams are time invariant, so all interactions
therin
are reversible. However the sense of time requires memory / event
histories
whose consistency supports the arrow of time. I don't know if this means
anything.

You can only traverse the USS's connected by allowed transitions.

I am presuming a finite universe, ie, the total number of particles is

larger.

To echo another thread here, I nearly had an orgasm when I understood

to demonstrate than once there is a miracle, it always has a plausible

IAN: I guess you hadn't noticed, but India is one of the most 
heavily bureaucratized and economically nationalized nations of 
the "Western" democracies. The Indian govt, having largely crushed 
native free enterprise, quickly accepts big foreign investment
deals that put big-bucks into the coffers of politicians. 

Ignoring the anti-laissez faire facts, one promotes the economic 
autarchy and nationalist socialism that will keep those "lower 
class" workers from ever having job options other than govt 
service jobs that have produced only crushing serfdom. If 
multi-national employment does the same for workers, it's 
because the politicians have worked hard to prevent any 
outcome for the population other than poverty.

IAN: Considering the endemic poverty in third world nations has been 
caused by the anti-capitalist measures you endorse, your hardly in any 
position to point the finger at capitalists. But then, as I've shown, 
logical thinking is hardly the forte of socialists. The more effectively 
they can conceal the role of govt in the every tragedies they bemoan, 
the more effectively they can ensure continuing State power and the
subjugation of the masses to the service of the central planners.

IAN: Out of hundreds of communal experiments across the U.S., none prove 
to be dynamic systems that foster material progress and/or innovation.
They are, for the most part, stagnant backwaters that quickly fall apart.
Realizing the failure of voluntary collectivism, the socialists then
call for forceing everyone into a grand central socialist plan.

it does not seem that have blown out the competition.

IAN: The average person in the nation in which employers are free to 
fire, is a wealthier person than average people anywhere on earth. This 
right here shows that you believe it is wrong to be able to fire a worker, 
and thus that free association is wrong -- hardly anarchistic and clearly
promoting of State regulation.

There is one large Co-Op that works very well:

Wisconsin Dairies Co-Op is a Fortune 500 (or is it Fortune 100?) company.
 But I don't think socialists like _that_ co-op.  They _never_ use it as an
example of how well socialism works because it is run just like a capitalist
corporation.  It's "too" successful for the "wrong reasons" I guess.

You must have an extremely high standard of living.  About 42% of the people on 
this planet have an acceptable standard of living.  About one in a hundred of 
them have a lifestyle we would envy.  Most people do live in poverty, but less 
(percentage-wise) of them do every year.  This is mainly due to the extropian

I don't see this as the "norm".  I think people DO look for win-win deals.

I'm sorry you feel that way.  I don't.   I think we are doing very well

<< I wonder how one thinks people will learn to think in ways that make us

I think people _have_ learned:  The WIN-WIN. 
(Earlier, I gave an example of a win-win deal:)   
 
I worked for Dole Packaged Foods.  Everyone I knew liked working for Dole
until something better came along. . . Then quit.  We negotiated a better
deal with Dole than anything else at the time (win-win).  Dole wins, I win
and Dole's customer's win.  Everybody wins.  If Dole was so evil, they would
have paid us ALL minimum wage (win-lose) and we would have quit (lose-lose).
  And when we had a better deal someplace else,  we could have stayed at Dole
(lose-win).   Nobody I know chose any "lose" (victim) situations.  

Now if only more governments could learn this:  Prices are negotiated not
mandated (unless by socialist governments).  The buyer and seller have to be
satisfied or there is NO deal.  Win-win deals survive and get better overtime
with only temporary setbacks.

Snip of a debate between Saresh and John (Leftilib vs. Anarcaprocy)

                >How many children don't get an education because they have
to work in sweatshops in order to support themselves. India is a good example

( John)
>>Do you think people in India are sub human? Do you think they love their
children less than we do? The reason they send their young children to work
in factories is that the alternative is worse, starvation and death,  you've
said the same thing yourself " they will do anything to survive". You want to
stop this child labor, the thing that let's them survive, and that doesn't
 seem like a very smart thing to do, and it CERTAINLY doesn't seem very
humane.
>>


Neither is child labor.  It was once a problem here as well,  we outlawed
here in the US.  It rouses people's sensibilities and therefore is a typical
( and in my opinion viable) argument against deregulation and anarchy.  It
could be somewhat contraversial but it still does not address the real
dilemna.
 
It seems as though the major ( and oft repeated) spiral I see here is simple:
 either we should or shouldn't ( it could be argued as CAN or CAN'T) protect
the "starving ( read uneducated) masses" from the (dishonest) greed of
others. One crucial element , and one I keep harping on is how one envisions
*changing* the moral systems that keep people doing what they are doing...
     
  Saresh, you seem to feel that these people are too dumb and/or helpless to
take care of thier own needs or political choices and you and the govt. you
subscribe to will make their choices for them.  John you seem to think that
they are capable and  already fully aware of the choices that they make and
have the critical faculties and/or ability to empower
themselves and do that which is in their best interests.

I say that with current memes (including, in India for example,  Hinduism and
other religions that assert that suffering is a good thing, or one's proper
place in the scheme of things) give us access to a vast "meme- deficiency"
data base that needs to be addressed.  If we're going to survive and flourish
in an anarcho-capitalist freedom, I propose that  most of the developed
planet needs a big Codependant's Anonymous meeting, and the rest of the (3rd
world?) planet needs to go to Catholics Anonymous(or substitue any mindless
acceptance of suffering and subordination with the promise of a better
afterlife) .

I'm sorry but labor has always been cheaper outside the U.S.   Perhaps I
should hire MORE _expensive_ labor and go out of business faster.  Where
would you have me go to get fruit?  All I have to do is get fruit to in
winter?  

I worked for Dole and I quit.  But, the non-American employees were not
treated any differently.  We all liked working for Dole until something
better came along.  Then we quit.   At Dolefil and Dolethai we were the
"richest" people around because we were employees of Dole.  We negotiated a
better deal with Dole than anything else we could do at the time.   Now we
can negotiate even better deals because we worked at Dole in the past.
 What's wrong with that?  I want to support myself.  Dole wins, I win and
Dole's customer's win.  Everybody wins.

<<Buy low, sell high, a maxim of capitalism. >>

Prices are negotiated not mandated (unless by socialist governments).  The
buyer and seller have to be satisfied or there is NO deal.  The maxim "buy
low, sell high" is a nice fantasy.  Probability of this is very low because
it is a lose-win (see Game Theory: Prisoner's Dilemma contests).   Win-win
deals survive better overtime.   

<<Doesn't (m)atter how many people they suppress 
 down there, as long as we get our cheap fruit.

Suppress them???  You mean give jobs, education, housing, meals and money to
them?  

<<  How many children don't  get an education >>

How many children didn't get an education before?  How many _American_ farm
children didn't get an education UNTIL there were large corporations and
other alternatives to farming?  ZERO.

<<because they have to work in sweatshops in order to  support themselves. >>

You call them "sweatshops". . .  I call them jobs.  Jobs they are free to
take or not.  They take the jobs because the "sweat" is worst in ALL the
alternatives.

"Support themselves"?   What's wrong with "supporting yourself"?  What where
they doing before?  Not supporting themselves?  Parasites? No they were
farmers and worked very hard too.  Doesn't a farmer "SWEAT"?

They must think working for the corporation is better than before.  Better
than farming for themselves. Or, they would quit.

<<India is a good example of capitalism running amuck.  >>

What!?  Why?  About 2000 farmers apply for every one (1) job opening in the
Union Carbide Corporation even after the disaster.   Those 2000 farmers had
it so good as farmers they _wanted_ to be punished?  They _wanted_ to have
capitalism run amuck on them?  I don't think so. 
 
Without capitalism they would have a better education system than they have
now?  I don't think so.

Capitalism is better at centralizing wealth. The thing is, capitalism 
doesn't CREATE wealth any better than any other system, that will always be done through 
ingenuity and innovation and better resource gathering methods. In our 
blessed capitalism, we have enormous waste on one side, while the other 
side isn't doing quite as well. There is plenty in the pie for all. The 
problem in the world is not lack of wealth, it's waste of wealth. All the 
resources that go into making a sonic toothbrush that is only cared for 
by people with money to burn are resources that could be better put to 
use. We also have severe food waste problems here, like McDonalds , while 
people are starving. We may have to adopt a more environmentally friendly 
lifestyle, but that's what technology helps us do, but we wouldn't have 
to scale down the standard of living. Everybody can have the same access 
to wealth. The people in the Third World have more of a power imbalance 
than a food shortage.  Why is the alternative worse? That's the question. 
Libertarians say that everybody can make choices, but doesn't take into 
account that some people have choices that suck more than others.   

Same thing in the soviet union. Created plenty of wealth, but wasted it in a system that was very 
bureaucractic and elitist.

No, because in the free market, that's the only way they can eke out a 
living. Like I said, everybody has choices, just some have choices which 
suck. Why can't they start a union? Because they'll all be fired. The 
alternative, starvation. Why?

So you think Libertarism will minimize force? The foundation of the

property.

Yeah, I'm afraid of that. But there are so many brilliant programmers 
here at UW that just will not work for a company on a full time basis. 
They hang around the CSC and watch Anime, because they don't want to start 
a business, and everything else sucks. So they hack Linux kernals for 
fun...In my software job, I only get to write objects for other 
programs (this could be because I'm only frosh). Many programmers resent 
that, and like to write entire programs for themselves. By coordinating 
themselves, they have a lot more freedom. Top-notch programmers might 
like not being told what to do. I really have no 
idea. But I think we'll start by writing some good software for Xwindows.

When I mean scale, I mean size. A huge corporation is large scale, a 
small business is not. A coop is egalitarian, so it is hard to coordinate 
activities around the world, because everybody gets a say. Since 
descisions are made to be as close to consensus as possible, it is not as 
time-efficient, but that doesn't matter, because if everybody owns the 
business, they will do whatever it takes to make it better. However, the 
first priority is making sure eveyone has a say, not profits.

Why would you do that? If a person builds an energy efficient house without 
taking too much resources from everybody else, we'll be the first to 
applaud. We won't confiscate it, in fact, if it's a great house, 
then we'll all pitch in and help everyone get a good house too.

So your way involves fencing off territory that belongs to everybody. So 
you are a thief, and are thus infringing on our rights 
in the commune. Of course, if you don't hurt anybody, 
then squatters rights are respected. You can live on territory and be 
self-sufficient, but you can't overfish, poach, start forest fires, and 
enslave people. If the commune finds out your doing this, they'll get 
angry. Hell hath no fury like an anarcho-syndicalist commune scorned.

Yeah, so you can enslave the people in your business, preach to them 
about the evils of "those commie scum" and keep them in such a state of 
fear that they'll work for whatever you feel nice enough to give 
(crumbs). You can do your thing, but so can everybody else. In order for 
that to happen, they'll have the same property rights as you. Unless you 
do something benevolent to make the "rabble" respect your property 
rights, they'll get pissed off and come tearing at your doors. Nobody has 
any control over anybody else, so even that rabble would be doing it 
because each member is pissed, not because some demagogue is whipping 
them up. It's just extended democracy.

Well that is how engineering goes. You work at a problem over and over and
then you practically give up and find the answer that has been sitting in

Subject: Cryonics Presents Chilling Question for Life Insurers
Sender: postmaster@extropy.org
Precedence: bulk
Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

It so happens that my docket is dominated by life insurance marketing cases
these days.  I was joking around with a couple of my partners last night
about this subject (do we need to get a life, or what!?!).  We were
commenting on the relative ease of life insurance _claims_ handling, compared
with the challenges posed by claims on liability insurance: "Is the guy
dead?" I asked, "Then pay the claim."  (Naturally, the issues _can_ be more
complex than this.  See, e.g. "Double Indemnity".)

But a real question is presented to cryonicists by this rhetorical question.
 If cryonicists are right and "reanimation" lies in their future, then life
insurance proceeds paid upon their "deanimation" might be at risk.  Will the
Acme Life Insurance Company be entitled to recover policy death benefits upon
reanimation, with interest?  Perhaps more chilling, might a life insurance
adjuster be entitled to question the fact of death at the time the claim is
made?

In typical lawyerly fashion, I can see both sides of this question.  I could
certainly argue with conviction for a rule of decision that would favor
cryonics: "Death" means "death under the generally accepted medical standards
at the time of deanimation'".  But perhaps a word of caution is in order for
those cryonicists who would avoid using the term "dead" to describe
"cryonauts".

Maybe there's a silver lining to the cloud imposed by this question: Perhaps
life insurers could someday provide a source of funding for cryonics research

It seems as though the major difference I see here is in the simple
assumption that one either CAN or CAN'T protect the "starving masses" from
the greed of others. One crucial element , and one I keep harping (angelic)
on is *changing*
 the moral systems that keep people doing what they are doing...
     
  Saresh, you seem to feel that these people are too dumb and/or helpless to
take care of thier own needs or political choices and you will make them for
them.  John you seem to think that they are fully aware of the choices that
they make and have the critical faculties and/or ability to empower
themselves and do that which is in their best interests.
I say that with current memes (including, In India for example,  Hinduism and
other religions that assert that suffering is a good thing, or one's proper
place in the scheme of things) give us access to a vast "meme- deficiency"
data base that needs to be addressed. If we're going to achieve an
anarcho-capitalist freedom, I propose that  most of the developed planet
needs a big Codependant's Anonymous meeting, and the rest of the 
(3rd world?) planet needs to go to Catholics (or substitue any mindless
acceptance of suffering and subordination with the promise of a better
afterlife) Anonymous.

          Does not sound plausible to me. First, if you would 
          literally nova our "star" you would have to increase its 
          mass by 40% -quite a heavy initiator! Even so, you would 
          presumably have to wait millions of years before the sun had 
          burned up its hydrogen fuel (and then helium etc) and begun 
          to contract.
          
          If you wanted to induce an explosion by sending a bomb to 
          the precritical region surounding the core, I don't think 
          this would work either. The sun shines by hydrogen burning; 
          there are enormous fusion bombs detonating in the sun every 
          second. The balance between Coloumb forces and average 
          kinetic energy must be quite robust, or stars would blow up 
          at any time in the middle of their evolution.
          
          As for the galactic centre, it is more difficult to tell, I 
          believe. I would think that a chain reaction would 
          presuppose a high denisty of white dwarfs or equivalent.
          
          Moreover, a supernova explodes at only about 15000 km/sec, 
          which an advanced civilisation could perhaps be possible to 
          run away from. A lot of the energy is also released in the 
          form of neutrinos, which travel at approximately the speed 
          of light; but then again there is a very small cross section 
          for neutrino reactions, so one could stand a very heavy 
          neutrino shower without getting hurt.
          
          In general, the effect of any cosmic blast drops off as the 
          inverse cube of the distance. Since cosmic distances are 
          typically very large, such indiscriminate blasts would seem 
          to be ineffective as means of warfare. Even a supernova 
          explosion, which is about as violent as anything (short of 
          big bang, or vacum decay or a big chain reaction of 
          supernovae where such is possible) would not hurt us 
          significantly if it were a few light years away, and an 
          armoured civilisation could survive much closer.
          
          An "electomagnetic pulse of unspeakable amplitude" (Forrest 
          Bishop) would also seem like science fiction proper.
          
          It is important that we use realistic assumptions about the 
          conditions of cosmic warfare in our simulations. Since there 
          are still many unsolved problems in fundamental physics, I 
          suggest we set up several simulations with different 
          parameters for weapon technology. There are several relevant 
          variables here, such as projectile speed, production cost, 
          identifiability of aggressor, technology level required for 
          its manufacture, discrimination capabilities ("hurt only the 
          bad guys"), etc. Maybe the time is ripe to begin to try to 
          really work this out.

Regarding David Musick's "MOMM" idea, i.e. a private general social service
intermediary agency: I've had a very similar idea before, when considering
the great information filtering and assessment problems facing individuals in
a stateless anarcho-capitalist society.  But what of the "transitional"
question in a territory where individuals are still considered citizens of an
existing state: Why should I pay a subscription fee (whether financed or not)
to a "MOMM" _and_ pay taxes at the same time?  How can a "MOMM" provide
enough benefit to offset the extra cost?

I think, such proposition should be based on the weighty evidence. If such
information are already published (i.e. experiment is done), it would be
correct to publish more information, including made-up name of this
subscriber. In other case, some doubts could be arise concering reality
of this subscriber.

Steve Witham's post reminds me of an idea from the last chapter of 
Stanislaw Lem's _A Perfect Vacuum_, an oration by a (fictional) cosmologist, 
who proposes to explain physics as the product of a cosmic Game (in the
sense of game theory: i.e. a contest or a situation of conflict). The
idea is that the first technological civilizations have engineered the 
universe in order that they will stay out of each other's way. Thus the 
speed-of-light limit, the expansion of space, and so on. This is not the
result of consensus, but of game-theoretic calculation: according to the
theory, keeping oneself isolated is apparently the best course of action.
As a side effect, latecomers to the universe find themselves isolated as
well.

In this cosmology, the observed state of the cosmos which we see is the 
work of intelligence, but it's not meant to be an information carrier for 
superintelligences or a stockpile of raw materials; it's a buffer zone
between widely separated, hard-to-see zones of intelligent activity.

A good example of anarcho-capitalism, but one possible problem with the MOMM
system is that the MOMM companies might attract the same kind of people that
are currently attracted to government. What if the MOMMs decide that the
people who currently don't want their services don't know what is good for
themselves? The result would be the same thing we have now only with a
different name. 

Even if the MOMMs degenerated like this, some good could result from
implementing this system; the elimination of the 'we need government for
such-and-such' meme might result in people questioning other forms of
institutionalized coercion.

But advanced civilizations might be detectable through bandwidth: if you
are a Jupiter brain who wants to send your latest discoveries about the
ecology of ecologies and how it interlinks with the visions of the
zorgnyyl on Germanicus IV to a friendly supercivilization nearby, you want
to send it through a very efficient channel and with good compression. So
you want to use as short wavelengths as possible, but are limited by the
interstellar medium, pair creation and the Planck wavelength. So what to
look for might be bursts of gamma ray noise... 

(No, I do not think the gamma ray bursters are the papers of the ETs, 
they seem to contain some reduncancies and patterns).

	Perhaps you measure the 'betterness' in falsifiability. The problem
with God-did-it TOE, or many conspiracy theories, or at least some of
the low-profile theories, is that they're too robust. My sense of
occam's razor is to pick the simplest theory that fits the facts.
Typically that produces a fragile theory. 
	Given zero evidence of ETs there are two sets of theories: low profile
(including zoo hypothesis), and they-ain't-there (including 'well maybe
they're there but there is really far away' etc.)
	The low profile set (like the God TOE) is almost immune to
falsification. The No-ET set crashes with any evidence of ET's at all.
Low profile or God TOE or conspiracy theories are not simple when the
standard of simplicity is easy falsifiability.
	What I meant to suggest with the 'Anvil of Stars' reference and
comments on 'What's natural life?' is that having superhuman
intelligences engaging in contests with active deception, means that
there's nothing much from a merely human, still 20th century, point of
view that could possibly falsify the core theory. Ditto for God TOE.
What could possibly be acccepted as conclusive evidence against it?

The better the compression, the more information looks like noise so this
means that possibly we will never see civilizations more advanced than we
and the only civilizations we will ever see will be less evolved because
equal or higher means we're less likely to recognize them. Damn. Although
this does give justification to requote entire posts so to make more
redundant data for the alien civilizations to recognize. :)

You'll have to change the name if you want to get much busines :-).  I
really doubt the problem is that these private services are now
unbundled.  It would be really easy to bundle them, if there really
were a market for it.  (If you think the market's making a big mistake
here, go start a venture.)  A bigger problem is why should you pay for
private health care, education, and consumer protection when you are
already paying for the government versions, and can not stop paying?

Bankruptsy law makes this impractical at present.  After you get them
marketable skills, they declare bankruptsy and then never have to pay
you again.

Eric Watt Forste offers, for the U.S., a decentralization of power back to
the states as one step on the path toward incrementally moving toward a
regime of anarcho-capitalsim.  I'm all for this, to the extent that it
implements polycentric legalism.  However, I see each state claiming total
sovereignty within its own territory (while implementing laws different from
other states) and thus this path seems to take us no closer to a stateless
world.  In fact it may not really be an instance of legal polycentricity any
more than the international legal order is, because of the concept of the
territorial state.  Nothing in the modern "states' rights" movement seems to
point to a devolution of state power, per se.

Also, BTW, I think your reference to Friedman's interesting work on the
Icelandic example, Eric,  bears out my original thesis regarding the relative
ease of implementing agoric legal systems in truly "new worlds".  As I
recall, that regime developed amongst colonists (political refugees)
emigrating from Scandinavia to essentially unpeopled country.

Then Robin Hanson writes:

This certainly has promise and I'll search for these papers at your web site,
Robin, if they're there.  Perhaps you could forward URLs to me by private
e-mail?  The problem I see is that the regimes of law with which I'm familiar
place explicit boundaries on the realm of contract with concepts such a "void
for illegality" and the like.  Attacking these boundaries head-on will surely
mobilize the survival instincts of the state, won't it?

If one looked at the inards of a very advanced computer, then if one
intercepted a "long" communications channel, where the cost to
transmit was large compared to computation costs at either end, then
yes it should look like random noise relative to a high entropy state
of that channel.  But this observation is a long way from showing that
the innards of this computer should look like the stars and dirt we
see.  As you point out, all that sunlight streaming away seems
inefficient. 

I'd expect an advanced computer to notice if some external force
started to much around with its innards, and to do something about it.
So if the world around us is an advanced computer, it knows about us
and chooses for some reason to allow our activities to continue.
Either we are part of this computation, or it works around us.  

How much physics do you know Steve?  I'm not sure you realize how very
much we do know about all that information streaming around us.  We
know which systems are exchanging bits with each other, and how fast,
and where this arrangement changes, etc.  We also know a lot about
designing computers, carefully arranging the routes and speeds of bit
exchanges.  And these two really look nothing alike!  We can see
nature's circuit diagram, even if we don't know what the bits
"encode".  In particular, we can see the "short" communications
channels, where we have no strong reason to expect noise-like bits.

To me, the idea that this circuit diagram is actually an
optimum design for an advanced computer seems completely crazy.

I think I'm starting to understand what Suresh Naidu is saying about private 
property.  He is maintaining the position that owning private property is a 
form of coercion since the ownership is maintained by force.  He also has 
indicated that if one person uses force against another, then the victim or 
their protectors are justified in using force to stop the attacker.  Now, what 
I don't understand is why it isn't blatently obvious to Suresh that private 
property is only maintained by force *when others try to forcefully take it 
from the rightful owner*.  If no one tried to steal the property that I have 
earned, I wouldn't have to defend it by force, but when people like Suresh 
come along who think they have some sort of right to what I have earned by my 
own work, they are the ones being coercive; I would only be defending myself 
when I maintain my property rights.  Owning private property is not a form of 
coercion, any more than living is.  To maintain my life from those who would 
take it, I must use force, so according to Suresh's logic, living is a 
coercive act, and no one must be allowed to live, for EXACTLY the same reasons 
he says no one should be allowed to own private property.

In Suresh's world, no one would be allowed to own private property, because 
that would be a form of coercion, and if someone was committing that sort of 
coercive action, Suresh and his brute squad would be justified in using 
retalitory force to take the property away from those who would hoard it.  So, 
if I was living in Suresh's world, I could spend my day out in the fields, 
taking care of my crops and gathering some food to bring home to my family.  
As I'm walking home, some people see the load of food I'm carrying and they 
tell me to share it with them.  I would refuse, and the people would cry out 
to Suresh and his brute squad and report that I was hoarding, that I was 
trying to own private property, which is a coercive act, according to Suresh.  
The food I had worked all day gathering would be taken from me and distributed 
to the lazy beggars and my family would starve.  In Suresh's world, gathering 
food for one's family is a crime, while taking food from others is not.  Why 
the horrible immorality of Suresh's ideas aren't blatently obvious, is beyond 
my understanding.  But then, people often will defend their pet ideas beyond 
the point of reason.  "It seemed like such a good idea, surely it would work!" 
 

But Suresh's logic is very flawed.  He is the coercive one.  He wants to steal 
from people what they have earned through their own labor.  Owning private 
property is not coercive, but taking it from people is.  And this is exactly 
what Suresh is proposing.

                     Copyright The Christian Science Monitor  
        NEW YORK -- Nobody knows for certain what life will be like when  
humans make outer space an integral part of their natural habitat. But 
informed speculation is a valuable tool as we move toward this 
evolutionary step, and it's hard to imagine a more vivid forum for 
such guesswork than IMAX 3-D, which fills a gigantic movie screen with 
images 10 times larger than those on conventional film. 
        The latest movie using this process, ``L5: First City in Space,'' 
 
tells the story of Chieko, a likable youngster who has lived all of 
her seven years in an outer-space community populated by her parents 
and about 10,000 other adventurous people. Gravity comes from the 
rotation of the huge, wheel-shaped structure. Power comes from solar 
radiation and a fusion-based power plant. Hydroponic farming provides 
food, and raw materials are mined from an asteroid the community 
``captured'' for that purpose. 
        Focusing mainly on the quality of life in this well-designed  
environment, ``L5'' doesn't have much of a story until Chieko's 
grandfather - the city's senior scientist - realizes that crucial 
life-support systems have been stretched as far as possible, and a 
crisis will occur unless a new water supply is found. 
        His solution is to lasso a nearby comet, diverting its orbit so  
that L5 can extract needed materials as it passes by. The plan is 
almost ruined when a robotic probe misfires, but Chieko's father saves 
the day by rocketing to the comet and setting things straight. Chieko 
herself narrates the adventure, looking back on it from her adult 
perspective as L5's mayor. 
        ``L5'' is only 35 minutes long, about the maximum allowed by  
current IMAX 3-D technology. Putting its emphasis on entertainment 
value, it offers more spectacle than substance, blending NASA imagery 
and computer-generated effects with studio scenes involving Chieko and 
her family. In keeping with today's political atmosphere, its social 
views are a mix of the conservative (individual gumption is all we 
need to solve common problems) and the liberal (our shared humanity 
should override national interests and racial divisions). 
        Supervised by Toni Myers with assistance from Allan Kroeker, who  
directed the live-action material, ``L5'' is now opening in theaters 
equipped for the Imax 3-D system. For sheer sensory impact, it's as 
big and bold as anything on screen this season.

That would of course be a "natural" supernova, based on the same 
principles as real supernovae. I think just a major flare-up would be 
enough for most purposes. 

The trick is to get the star to increase its energy output drastically. 
In a supernova, the core collapses until a "rebounce" occurs when a lot 
of energy is released and shockwaves appear due to exclusion forces. If 
we could induce a helium flash in the sun we would get a much smaller 
effect, but probably enough to devastate the inner planets. And that 
could perhaps be induced by compressing the core using technomagic, but 
it sounds quite hard.

Apparently (according to what I read in the latest thread on this subject 
in rec.arts.sf.science a year back), the neutrino shower is so intense 
that it can be deadly in the entire solar system. And the x-ray pulse is 
going at c (but delayed compared to the neutrinos), so the civilization 
will have to run very fast.

OK, here is an absurd weapon me and my friends cooked up: Create a 
toroidal black hole by fusing a lot of stars into a big ring. It will 
collapse near c, and drag together the galactic magnetic field inside the 
loop. Once it collapses topology change has to occur or it will have to 
radiate away the collected energy - the result will still be a nasty 
blast of gravity waves and emp. Not that it is particularly efficient 
(compare this to the cosmic string weapons of _Ring_ by Baxter and _Tides 
of Light_ by Benford).

Good points. Personally I think this kind of hyperweapons we discuss 
above are very unlikely - they are too indiscriminate and require a lot 
of energy/work. "Perversion attacks" a la Vinge are more likely - 
infiltrate the enemy with nanites or AI viruses, and then destroy him 
subtly. One could imagine tiny berzerkers (gremlins?) that move around a 
la von Neumann probes, and when they find a civilization they study it, 
send out very subtle agents, and then plans its downfall using SI.

IAN: Obviously you hadn't noticed, but India is one of the most

the "Western" democracies. The Indian govt, having largely crushed 
native free enterprise, quickly accepts big foreign investment
deals that put big-bucks into the coffers of politicians. 

Ignoring the anti-laissez faire facts, one promotes the economic 
autarchy and nationalist socialism that will keep those "lower 
class" workers from ever having job options other than govt 
service jobs that have produced only crushing serfdom. If 
multi-national employment does the same for workers, it's 
because the politicians have worked hard to prevent any 
outcome for the population other than poverty.

IAN: Considering the endemic poverty in third world nations has been 
caused by the anti-capitalist measures you endorse, your hardly in any 
position to point the finger at capitalists. But then, as I've shown, 
logical thinking is hardly the forte of socialists. The more effectively 
they can conceal the role of govt in the every tragedies they bemoan, 
the more effectively they can ensure continuing State power and the
subjugation of the masses to the service of the central planners.

IAN: Out of hundreds of communal experiments across the U.S., none prove 
to be dynamic systems that foster material progress and/or innovation.
They are, for the most part, stagnant backwaters that quickly fall apart.
Realizing the failure of voluntary collectivism, the socialists then
call for forceing everyone into a grand central socialist plan.

IAN: The average person in the nation in which employers are free to 
fire, is a wealthier person than average people anywhere on earth. This 
right here shows that you believe it is wrong to be able to fire a worker, 
and thus that free association is wrong -- hardly anarchistic and clearly
promoting of State regulation.

Yep. Valid question. This is why decentralization is the key to any  
equitable society. In small scale communities, people can keep tabs on 
each other, done with a feeling of "hey, this hurts people, why 
don't you stop it" . if you have any form of centralization, a huge power 
imbalance occurs, because the ones in charge can dictate to those not in 
charge. It becomes self-perpetuating, and is thus communism. 

But, thanks to such technologies as the internet, people can raise 
discussions all over the world, and so everybody will have the 
opportunity to discuss what need is.

No, but is does require force to back it up, which is just as bad.

No, because I have enough faith in people that they can coordinate

the issues this raises.

It's not a legal web, it's an economic one. However, if anyone wants to 
leave they can, and do whatever they want. But people will not stand for 
theives or dictators. Noting stops a person from going off and living off 
the land, and they might even keep ties with society. Imagine a woodsman 
opening a solar powered laptop to offer environmental reports.

No it is not, because the fundamental relationship is one of slavery: 
worker-employer. There is a huge power imbalance there. And since there
always will be more workers than employers, the majority of people will 
be screwed.

Subject: Noam Chomsky--Fake Anarchist?

A-albionic Research "Weekly Up-date" of 10-15-96
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Quote from the back cover of _Class Warfare_: Interviews with David
Barsamian--A Powerful Road Map to the Emerging Global Capitalism by Noam
Chomsky ($15.00 in-stock at A-albionic)  we find:

"Why is this supporter of anarchist ideals in favor of strengthening the
Federal Government?"

Inside we find:

page 122:  "In the long term I think the centralized political power ought
to be eliminated and dissolved and turned down ultimately to the local
level, finally, with federalism and associations and so on . . . On the
other hand, right now I'd like to strengthen the Federal Government.  The
reason is, we live in this world, not some other world.  And in this world
there happen to be huge concentrations of private power which are as close
to tyranny and as close to totalitarian as anything humans have devised,
and they have extraordinary power.  They are unaccountable to the public.
There's only one way of defending rights that have been attained or
extending their scope in the face of these private powers, and that's to
maintain the one form of illegitimate power that happens to be somewhat
responsive to the public and which the public can indeed influence.  So
you end up supporting centralized state power even though you oppose it.
People who think there is a contradiction in that just aren't thinking
very clearly."

Lloyd's Comment:  Is this guy just unaware that the Federal Government,
from the Federal Reserve to the FDA to the FTA and the rest of the
alphabet soup is the prized possession of the major Corporations and that
they, and only they, can control the Federal Government?  And what about
the Corporations' power to put over GATT, the WTO, NAFTA, etc ETC?

	But he is aware cuz on pages 149-150, just for one example, we
see:

"Take the cutback of the regulatory apparatus . . . big investment firms
are very unhappy about it.  They need the Securities and Exchange
Commission. . .Markets cost a lot of money to set up and a lot of money to
police. . .So the big guys, . . . rely on the SEC as government
intervention to protect the functioning of markets to the extent that they
exist, which is a limited but not zero extent. . .The Commerce Department
is now under attack by the Republican freshmen.  But big business wants
it.  It just puts money into their pockets.  The Commerce Department is
one of the welfare systems for the rich and they don't want that to
disappear. . .Republican freshman attack was going right after
environmental issues. . .beaten back on that one, to a large extent
because big corporations who can think five years ahead realize that they
would like to have a world five years from now in which they can make
profits, not only for today. . .same with the FDA. . .pharmaceutical
corporations came out against dismantling the Food and Drug
Administration. . .smart enough to figure out that if there is no
regulation and independent assessment, five years from now there will be
some kind of thalidomide catastrophe or something. . .And so it goes.
There has always been a symbiotic relationship between big private capital
and state power.  They want to maintain it."

Lloyd's Comment:  Soooo!  Is Chomsky and idiot or an agent?  Well, at MIT,
he is feeding from the Federal trough.  He admits it elsewhere in _Class
Warfare_.  On the other hand, maybe this railer about the "democracy
deficit" really does believe that "democracy" is possible, not just a
fraudulent fantasy promoted to obtain the "consent of the governed" by the
elite behind the major Corporations.  Can he really believe that Federal
Regulations are designed for the benificent purposes he states above?
Can't he see that from Banking to the FDA to the EPA Federal regulations
are designed to cartelize and increase monopoly profits, foreclosing the
type of decentralized system left-anarchist claim to want?

You be the judge!  Conspiracy or error?  Just a beneficent co-incidence
that Chomsky lines up completely with the Class Warfare doctrines of the
Democratic Party?

Do you think people in India are sub human? Do you think they love their

in factories is that the alternative is worse, starvation and death, you've 
said the same thing yourself " they will do anything to survive". You want to

would consider an acceptable standard of living, at most one in a thousand  
lives in a way we would envy, most people live in appalling poverty. 
No matter how you divide up the pie, the average person is going to be living 
in intolerable conditions until we get a bigger pie. The Free Market is very  
good at creating wealth, if History has taught us anything it is that  
Socialism is not. You have virtually admitted as much in your posts, that's 
why you don't want to let me do my Capitalist thing, but I have no fear of  
you doing your  Socialist thing. We both know how such a contest will end up.

Would it be more moral to fire 99 workers and pay the remaining one 7$ an

I should pay 1000 workers 70$ an hour, but I simply wouldn't have the money to

I don't think software is a good candidate to a co-op. While the difference  
between a good programmer and a poor one is no greater than in other fields, 
the difference between a good programmer and a great one is huge. To these 
prodigies your co-op will not look very attractive and you'll be stuck with a
lot of mediocre people; but give it a try, I could be wrong, the more 
experimentation the better I say.

Then why are we talking about them? You're writing about changing the social

Again we have the "quite easy", perhaps it's easy on Planet Suresh but not  
on Planet Earth. "Hoarding" by its nature is a secretive activity, you can 
only tell I'm doing it if you're smarter than I am, and you're certainly not 
smarter than everyone. Perhaps I do work less than you, but that may be 
because I'm smarter than you and work more efficiently. Do you really want to 
discourage initiative and productivity? There is nothing "quite easy" about 
all this, you'll need to have your thought police monitoring me every second.

Chatting may not be enough. When you tell people that the house they have 
built with their own two hands is too good for them and you have come to  
confiscate it, I fear they will tell you to do things that may not be 
anatomically possible. To be obeyed you're going to need an army, and a  
big one.

Now you're going backward. I'm not bothering you, why not let me do my thing 
and you do yours? Just order your subjects not to have any dealings with me,  
perhaps they'll obey freely, and if not you always have the Thought Police.  
As long as I'm not living in your commune what do you care what I do?  This 
is exactly the asymmetry in our positions I was talking about.

What about the quantum level? Might the "random" fluctuations on the 
near-Planckian level be the real level of activity? We, and most of the 
matter around us, is just high-level side-effects of low-level processing 
in the vacuum state. Are there any special reasons this might or might 
not hold?

Sorry Chris, but I detected a distinctly synthetic quality to your voice.
I also noted at one point you asked me to repeat what I said -- indicative
of a speech recognition error.  However, I was impressed that you appeared
to "understand" most of what I said without my pausing between each word as
required by PC-based speech recognition systems.

You must be running on a supercomputer.


No, just kidding.  I can verify that Chris Hind is very much human and way

Although I would like to believe there is an AI successfully participating
on this list, I have finally come to my senses.  It's a hoax.

(Still, I'm a little insulted no one thought *I* was the AI.)

I have both disability and life insurance with the same company. My
idea is that "If I'm not dead, I must be disabled." I have LIFETime
disability; it only expires when I'm dead.. While I'm sure that they
might prove I'm neither dead, nor disabled it is not likely!

I think I'm starting to understand what Suresh Naidu is saying about private 
property.  He is maintaining the position that owning private property is a 
form of coercion since the ownership is maintained by force.  He also has 
indicated that if one person uses force against another, then the victim or 
their protectors are justified in using force to stop the attacker.  Now, what 
I don't understand is why it isn't blatently obvious to Suresh that private 
property is only maintained by force *when others try to forcefully take it 
from the rightful owner*.  If no one tried to steal the property that I have 
earned, I wouldn't have to defend it by force, but when people like Suresh 
come along who think they have some sort of right to what I have earned by my 
own work, they are the ones being coercive; I would only be defending myself 
when I maintain my property rights.  Owning private property is not a form of 
coercion, any more than living is.  To maintain my life from those who would 
take it, I must use force, so according to Suresh's logic, living is a 
coercive act, and no one must be allowed to live, for EXACTLY the same reasons 
he says no one should be allowed to own private property.

In Suresh's world, no one would be allowed to own private property, because 
that would be a form of coercion, and if someone was committing that sort of 
coercive action, Suresh and his brute squad would be justified in using 
retalitory force to take the property away from those who would hoard it.  So, 
if I was living in Suresh's world, I could spend my day out in the fields, 
taking care of my crops and gathering some food to bring home to my family.  
As I'm walking home, some people see the load of food I'm carrying and they 
tell me to share it with them.  I would refuse, and the people would cry out 
to Suresh and his brute squad and report that I was hoarding, that I was 
trying to own private property, which is a coercive act, according to Suresh.  
The food I had worked all day gathering would be taken from me and distributed 
to the lazy beggars and my family would starve.  In Suresh's world, gathering 
food for one's family is a crime, while taking food from others is not.  Why 
the horrible immorality of Suresh's ideas aren't blatently obvious, is beyond 
my understanding.  But then, people often will defend their pet ideas beyond 
the point of reason.  "It seemed like such a good idea, surely it would work!" 
 

But Suresh's logic is very flawed.  He is the coercive one.  He wants to steal 
from people what they have earned through their own labor.  Owning private 
property is not coercive, but taking it from people is.  And this is exactly 
what Suresh is proposing.

When somebody is cryonically suspended you can never consider it a certainty
that the person will be revived.  Currently we can't unfreeze, period.  Even
when and if such problems are solved there remains the possibility that the
cause of death can never be fixed.  So when somebody is frozen, you can't
know whether they'll eventually end up alive or dead, and (this is the point)
you *never* will know that they will remain dead forever.  So the only time
you could reasonably pay out would be at the normal death/freezing.  If the
life companies maintain they should never pay for somebody who (at the time
of benefits) may well never live again they'll be laughed out of court.

Since all the life insurance companies have planned and priced their policy
without accounting for suspension/reanimation they will just maintain that
policy.  It's no problem for them, and there really is no other logical way
to handle it.

Not really true.  Although the message itself will indeed sound like line

True, it's a hoax but why don't we go out and convince some students working
in the AI field to rig their AI to the mailinglist and then we can attempt
to guess who it is. If you don't mind a little noise on the channel that is.

IAN: Good point. In fact we should make high prices the law, then 
you could join the ranks of the poor thereby proving the "failures 
of capitalism," and in turn stimulate more demand for more govt 
regulation and welfare = more poverty = more govt = more poverty. . .

Another form of cosmic warfare which I've meantioned in earlier posts on
this list is the concept of sending a ball of strange matter to a star or
planet to convert the entire planet to strange matter due to it being more
stable than ordinary matter. This is something to consider and likely far
easier than nuking a star.

I suppose you're right. I would've never gotten into science & tech if it
wasn't for the euphoric feeling of creating new ideas. That particular
feeling would be nonexistant under complete logic. But then maybe some
emotions are vestigial such as sadness which only appears to be harmful in
that it makes you nonproductive. Maybe we should all just think... Our
friend has died. life goes on. but we don't we feel sadness. Why? What
practical purpose does it serve?

>Are emotions ever useful? Is logic ever fun? Hmm--I'd say yes. Hmmmm.

I suppose you're right. Perhaps they go hand in hand. Maybe we need subtler
more complex emotions? Perhaps thats what we're evolving to.

I was watching Discovery Magazine on the Discovery channel tonite, and they
meantioned that life could've possibly formed in the shallow seas on Mars
when the planet was young. They meantioned that likely tufa tower formations
have been seen in dry lake basins on Mars and they will send a probe by
sometime in the future to verify that these are tufa formations. They say
that these tufa towers provide lots of little cracks for life to latch onto
in Mono Lake in California so why not on Mars. They meantioned that tufa
towers on Mars would be a great place to look for fossilized life due to the
quantity that could possibly be found there and that they find fossilized
(sp?) life in the tufa towers in Mono Lake constantly. For those that don't
know, there is a lake in california called Mono Lake which due to it's
bizarre chemical makeup creates these towers of mineral deposits which rise
up out of the highly salty lake. Does anyone know if these can be found
anywhere else? This idea has really inspired me also being the fact that
they've always said that Mono Lake looked as though it was from another
planet! I've been to Mono Lake myself and it's a cool place to explore.
Highly recommended. Check it out if you are near Mammoth Lakes. Oh yeah and
if my writing looks rhetorical and like crap it's cuz I'm damn tired right now.

If we have quantum mechanics right, so there are not unknown hidden
variables and systems behind it all, then there just aren't any
Plank-scale bits which can be varied to encode stuff.  If we have this
wrong, then we are just completely wrong about the most stable part of
physics we know (thermodynamics and statistical mechanics), and the
correspondence of theory with observation is just some massive
coincidence.  A tough sell.

This perversion strategy requires more confidence that you are in fact
much more advanced than those you attack.  Imagine you see signals
from what looks like a primitive civilization 100 light years away.
Whatever you send to destroy it will face a civilization 200 years
more advanced than what you saw.  If you send a fast simple bomb (and
have it turn a corner), they may end up advancing enough to stop it or
survive it, but you may feel confident that they probably can't find
you from it.  A perversion probe will be lots more complicated, and so
risk telling more about you, and will have be much more advanced than
they are if it is to succeed. 

If your probe fails and reveals you, a probe from them to destroy you
may be coming at near light speed from them to you, so you really want
fast feedback about whether your attack succeeded or not.  A
perversion probe will take longer, increasing your anxiety that what
looks like a slow progress of your attack really masks a return attack.
A bomb either works or it doesn't real fast.

Any approach to getting full freedom must at some point do this.  But
why would my approach do this any earlier than an other approach?  I
attack first the intellectually-strongest defenses of government,
which are very different from the most widely used defenses, so I stay
in an academic corner for a while.  Mass public action I think would
be most likely to mobilize those instincts.

My two cents: there are different kinds of property. I disagree with pretty
much everything that Suresh says, but have some reservations about ownership
of land.

If A kills B, takes his land, and sells it to C, does C have a right to
the property? (multiply sells it to C as much as you like). What if B
doesn't have a concept of property, and doesn't think of himself as 
"owning" the land, but perhaps more as a caretaker of the land.

Doesn't most real estate property derive (at some point in the past) from
a coercive takeover of the land? If the King of France bequeaths to some
nobleman some land (which the King obtained & maintained by coercion), does
the nobleman's descendents hundreds of years down the line have a real
right to the property? I asked this a couple of years ago, but never got
what I considered a satisfactory response.

I'm talking theory here, not practice. Land ownership may be beneficial
in many ways, but doesn't all land ownership derive from past coercion?
How is this reconciled with the NCP?

Thanks,
	-Mike

I wonder if this advocacy of contract entails a repudiation of property?

Dipleased with how copyright works as a property right, I've been researching
of late how to contractulize rights to expressive works.  While this scheme
would not "privatize" copyright, which already allows privately held
property, it would privatize the decision process through which rights to
expressive works (e.g., works that qualify for copyright) get assigned.

The more I continue in this train of thought, the more attractive contract
appears as an alternative to property.  Or, rather, the more attractive it
appears as a complementary way of framing economic relations.  I sometimes
think of contract as the wave side of something like a particle/wave duality.

>> don't understand is why it isn't blatently obvious to Suresh that private
property is only maintained by force *when others try to forcefully take it
 from the rightful owner*.

David, being of native American heritage, that sentnce stuck in my craw.  It
is your use of the word only.... maybe you should say "rightly"... In the
USA, the land was taken by force and is still maintained by superior force.
How land is "taken" in the first place may be a good  place to begin to
analyze of some of our culture's deficient memes.  When members of
technologically superior yet unethical (for example if they don't regard
Indians or blacks as "human beings" but as, say, beasts in the field - which
is something the Spanish Christian Missionaries had up their sleeve ie: to be
slaughtered or  converted and enslaved was their "place" in life) or
illmotivated 'tribes' take land by force, then keep it by force, it starts a
Might is Right chain.

This has less to do with capitalism, politics, it has much more to do with
ethics and morality. It may be less of a successful guise today to  take
land, money and gold, but does one think it still effects on us today? Do
people still operate in this manner? The church is still here, the state is
still here. In most cases, monarchy is not. But Might is Right is a basic,
we've been doing it for years and anarchy has never been tried.  Do we
passively assume such tyrannies wil dissapear overnight because we get less
govt.  or do we have to do something (if one can do anything).

How about this: a life insurance company becomes the owner of the deanimated
body when it pays the money.  If the relatives (or the cryo company) want
to reanimate the body, they have to buy it from the insurance company.

Ethics is fun.  :)

You can have a contract without much property, and a contract can
agree to pretty much any arrangement imaginable, including ones
without any property.  So contracts seem more general.

I just love arguments (as this isn't much of a debate) on the relative
merits of socialism and capitalism. Recently I've tended to be more
"socialist" in that I have misgivings on how capitalism and the free
market work. My main problem is with money and it's social effects. I
do believe money is a pretty good invention, but I think it's possible
to do better with alternative socio-economic systems. No, I don't have
a replacement though I think any replacement will have to occur at the
community level.

As for the argument:

And why have they gotten away with it? Because North Americans tend to
support it (out of sight, out of mind...)  Shifting the blame to an
oppressive government that happens to allow money to concentrate into
the pockets of small number of people ignores the question of where
that money is coming from, and who in turn is supporting it.

Personally I believe people are generally selfish. Not a bad thing,
but when most people's lives revolve around money and the gathering of
things money can buy, not to mention the consumer culture we've
created, then I think most communes will fail.

I'm slowly working on what I call my "complex". I figure I'd be most
happy in an environment where I can do a wide variety of work
(software, hardware, biotech, etc.) without a lot of requirements for
monetary gain. I'm hoping that the only money I'll require once the
complex is "complete" is to pay property taxes. I also need other
people involved, not only because being holed up by myself could get
pretty dull, but also having a wide variety of people involved in the
project will be the only way it'll get completed.

I expect there'll be some sort of socialism in place, though I won't
call it a commune. I don't expect a money based system internally. It
will probably be a corporation for legal purposes. Contracts will
likely form the bulk of arrangements with people involved. I expect
there will be a limited form of democracy for high-level things, maybe
a voted board of directors. These things are to work out. One thing
that I think will be necessary are a good set of written goals, short
term to long term. I do believe most communes fail because of a lack
of focus of the participants, and a bit too much freedom.

I don't know what to make of this statement. If the intent was to blow
out the competition, then I guess they failed. If the intent was to
produce quality goods while supporting the people involved, then who
knows? And don't US farmers get substantial government subsidies
still? Perhaps it's not a level playing field. I don't know enough
about the US agricultural industry to comment too much.

Possibly in one-on-one interactions, but not from my experience in
business. Maybe it's just Vancouver, but it's incredible how many
businesses I've had to deal with that don't like win-win deals: "Okay,
you build a complete system, then we'll give you some money for it,
and we'll own it!" or "I know our company is going to go bankrupt
without some changes, but we can't afford to pay to save the company."

Ira Brodsky says:

To repeat:  the program has a front man.  The fact that Chris Hind is a 
real person proves nothing.  Of course he is real.  So are we all.  The 
question is whether the posts attributed to "Chris" (or "Lyle" or "John") 
are written by an AI.  

As I said in my original post, 

::The Extropians have accepted it as part of the group.  No one notices 
::anything different about it -- no one has seriously raised the question of 
::whether it might not be what it purports to be, i.e. just another human.  
::In other words, this program has passed the Turing test, so far.  

This remains true.  Even after being told that there is an AI on the list, 
no one has seriously raised the question of whether one of the posters 
on the list is an AI.  Jokingly, yes.  Seriously, no.  

The program continues to pass the test with flying colors.  

Ira, how can you confidently say "way above anything yet achieved 
by AI?"  You only know what has been achieved in the past.  
The point is, this program from CMU is *new*.  It is a quantum leap 
beyond earlier AI programs.  This is the first time an AI program 
has been unleashed on an unsuspecting world, and left to fend for itself.  
And it is doing very well.

After the passage of the (usually brief) "contestibility period", cause of
death is basically irrelevant to the payment of a life insurance death
benefit (except for on-going suicide exclusions and certain cause-related
benefit multipliers).

My questions were really aimed at a time we hope to see when reanimation is a
more probable event, presumably because it has been successfully demonstrated
on at least a higher-order whole organism.  At that point there would still
not be _certainty_ about reanimation of any particular individual human, but
the _possibility_ or reanimation might become an actuarially significant
probability.

>  you *never* will know that they will remain dead forever.  

Knowing things _for sure_ isn't the business of insurance.  Insurance is
about probabilities applied to large groups as risk-classes.  Of course
"death" is now taken as a certainty by life insurance companies, but _life
expectancy_ is treated as a probabilistic phenomenon.

There are theories that were once laughed out of court that are now taken as
bedrock foundations of legal doctrine.  As Justice Holmes said, "the law is
not a brooding omniprescence in the sky".  Of course denying a benefit now
for a cryonically suspended human would be untenable -- but it might not be
if a whole mammal had been successfully frozen and reanimated.

When actuarially significant facts change, insurance policy wordings,
underwriting and ratings change.  It happened with AIDS.  The issue I raise
is admittedly less clear-cut than that example, but it could have an impact
-- almost certainly _will_ have an impact if succesful human reanimation
becomes a regular event.  (I don't even refer at this point to the questions
that would be raised by a succesfull "destructive" upload ... essentially
similar issues, presumably.)  

As for this question being "no problem", it seems that it could be if people
were free to choose to be suspended at a point short of their otherwise
"natural" time of death as a means to improve the chances of reanimation;
likewise with "destructive" uploads (mortality tables would become skewed).
 Beyond this, insurance companies tend to not pay claims that don't fall
within the terms of their coverage.  If the line between life and death
becomes blurred, the terms of coverage could become ambiguous.  Actuaries and
claims adjusters hate ambiguity.  (Lawyers love it.)  Who knows, maybe they'd
take the "salvage" approach jokingly suggested by Dejan Vucinic in another
post!

This is the main altruistic idea of socialism.  It is why the USSR fell.  The
more socialistic the government, the more they have populations starving
(except the government officials of course).  Everyone else in a socialistic
system is equally poor. I call it "Egalitarian Liberalism"

Some of the "masses" (i.e. citizens) are "fooled" and don't realize what
happened.  That is why those governments need censorship.  They need to keep
"fooling" the population.  If the truth gets out, there is trouble:  People
realize they are being "ripped off" and their work is being given to lazy
beggars while their own family starves.

You are right.  I am (partly) wrong.  I still disagree with all forms of

Yes--if They don't *want* to talk to us.  But we might be interesting in
some way.  Btw, crypto is actually more effective at making "noise" than
compression, because what to compression is a tiny inefficiency is to crypto
a chink in the armor--the crypto guys are more intent on the noiselikeness.

Right, except they aren't in stasis.  If you look
at the amount of *raw* information processing that's going on in that dirt,
and assume that processing is being *used*, it's more than the *useful*
processing going on in our civilizations' brains and computers, I think.

IAN: Some people prefer other than small scale communities, where they 
can be free from tab keeping neighbors and family members. These people 
form big impersonal cities by joining them. 

In the big market place, people "keep tabs on each other" through 
nonpersonal and not privacy invacive mechanisms such as price signals, 
which measure the supply of a given resource against the social demand
for that resource. The free market economy and its price signals are 
the voice of the people, and the people's market-voice is expressed 
without anybody having to keep tabs on any other person but 
themselves. It's perfect -- i.e., it works spontaneously.

 > if you have any form of centralization, a huge power imbalance occurs, 
 > because the ones in charge can dictate to those not in charge.

IAN: As long as people have private property rights, they are free to 
exit potential associations, such as going or not going to McDonald's. 
This means that in the free-market-private-property society, the 
people -- manifested as the collective consumer speaking through 
price signals -- control the economy.

When we all live on one collective with no property demarcations, we 
live in a defacto monopoly. When property is uniform, there is monopoly. 
It does not even need to have one person or one central body of people 
at the helm. When we equalize outcomes, the social mind-set "norms-out" 
toward the lowest common denominator. I'll do as little work as I can 
get away with, and try to get others to carry as much of my weight 
as possible, for if I work harder to get more rewards, the'll be 
taken away for others who worked less. It's so simple to see.

People do this in the market also, but the discipline of private property 
keeps me from being able to sponge of others, it keeps my hands out of your 
bank account, which compels me to try harder to serve the needs of others
through market exchange, that I might be rewarded by consumers for my 
efforts.

The logic of private property is expressed in the fact that life has
evolved so as to brake "itself" into many small units, where each
will attempt to fend for itself. Millions of years of evolution
* prove * that this works, and life being one global collective 
blob does not, ipso facto.

IAN: Indeed. The "property line" is simply the spatially defined state-
ment: "I'll use force if you cross this line." It's the force parameter. 

But is does not follow, as you've stated, that this is patently bad. 
Not all force is bad. A woman who fends-off a rapist uses force to back 
up her property claim. Without question, we agree that this force is 
proper, but it violates the rule you just layed out; and Therefore 
we cannot claim that "the use of force to defend property is bad."

While we can agree on our bodies property line, the fuzzy area 
begins in our unified external area. In order to live I must 
be able to control external properties, and as "to control"
is "to own," I must be able to own extenal property -- that is, 
to be able to exclude others from a give unit of matter outside
my body. So it is a given that the use of force to defend property
is a necessary basis for life and for any system of rights that 
are to promote life.

IAN: Are people in Equador going to send a message to people in Uganda, 
"Hay we grew more food than you did this year, come and get it."

That is in a nut-shell the dynamic that needs to happen in the world
your talking about. This idea falls apart in so many ways it seems futile 
to list them, it's just an idealist phantasm. 

The market says: "Hay we grew X amount of food and we would be willing 
to trade X quantity for Y in exchange. The same thing, only this time 
* both * sides make a collective input, not one side getting a freebee.

IAN: But here's the fatal flaw in your ideology: the egalitarian ethic 
defines a "thief" as someone who has more stuff than another person. 
So the next village that had a better harvest, steals the quantity 
of food it has in excess of the other community. Such a standard
of theft dictated by egalitarianism is clearly absurd -- surely 
you can see that?

There is no way to get around it. Village A gets to keep its better 
harvest -- and that's private property -- or village A must surrender
a portion of its harvest -- that's collective property. The result 
will be, like clockwork, that the incentive structure becomes geared 
towards doing less, investing less in this year's harvest, let the 
other guys carry the load this year.

The long-range picture is less production, less innovation, and more
poverty and human privations. Lo and behold, that's exactly what we
see in every collectivist experiment -- its clockwork. Either you are 
(a) for human progress measured as growing wealth and technology 
access for all, or (b) you are for the safety and surety of no growth, 
and middle age like serfdom.


 > Noting stops a person from going off and living off 
 > the land, and they might even keep ties with society.

IAN: If we operate under the assumption of equality of outcomes, 
then each person is in debt to society. The man in debt can never
be allowed to just "walk away." It's called debt slavery, and 
collectivism is universal debt slavery by design.



 > No it is not, because the fundamental relationship is one of slavery: 
 > worker-employer. There is a huge power imbalance there. 

IAN: But your picture is missing a big portion of the whole picture.
Your picture has excluded any measure of * how * an employer can to 
be in the position he/she is. In the free market, and employer is 
not more than an employee of the consumers. Society voted for them,
they saved as many votes as they could and were eventually able to
purchase means of production to activate toward the service of 
consumers. They then lobby with others to active these means 
of production, offering them what these workers are willing 
to take in exchange for a given job. 

There is no slavery here. The "boss" is but an employee of the 
consumer, assigned by the consumers based upon past performance 
to deliver a given service to the consumer, and the consumer 
is the whole of society. That is the ethical society.

Anders, I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I've learned a lot 
from both your webpage and your posts here.
I've just started thinking about the genome projects and the near future 
results of these researches. And, I'd like to ask your opinion, or 
direction, on something.
If gene therapy for humans started at least by 1990, then wouldn't it be 
possible to use that technology for genetic re-creation. Example: If I 
had the money and the right doctor, could I isolate the "novelty" gene, 
whip up an elixir, shot it up (or perhaps inhale it in aerosol form), to 
give myself a "high" that made me want to pursue "novel" (or perhaps 
there's an extropian gene) ideas, ways and means?

Anyone?

Until I hear otherwise I'm going to assume it's possible now, only no 
one's doing it.

 IAN: I see no logical distinction between Chomsky and Marx.
 His claim of Anarchy is a naked sham, it's the same "withering 
 away of the State" nonsense that Marx talked about. He's trying
 to slap a "decentralized anarchy" label on 100% pure totalitarianism,
 and this act is 100% pure fraud.

Lloyd Miller cuts to the core of the issue observing:

IAN: Exactly. This is the core reality people on both sides of the isle
need to see -- and I think libertarians do for the most part -- that 
what we call the "govt" is merely a MASK of the mega-wealthy who want
to gain market control via mechanism other than consumer selection.
Whatever grows the govt, gives more power to a core mega-wealthy cabal.

They have carefully devised a philosophy of universal social 
debt that is designed to bind all men to one another under the debt 
masters who are the central planning elite that will own the whole 
world, and this is the dream of the "New World Order," a term coined 
by these very central planners (the proof this conspiracy there for 
all to see and is outlined in the book Non Dare Call it Conspiracy) 
The philosophy they've poromoted is: socialism. The mega-wealthy 
hide behind the mask of socialism -- yet their only as hidden 
as people are determined not to see what the facts reveal.

What better way to sell slavery than to sugarcoat it with humanitarian
candies: We all need to come together, one big family, caring for one 
another, breaking down our walls, opening our bank accounts to the 
masters that will oversee our debt to one another. Notice that that
sales pitch went from fallacy to fact. But in real life that's not
how they sell slavery, it's all sugar coated with socialistic 
candies and we're being feed this brain-rot from cradle to grave.

Libertarians are so bludgeoned and battle weary that they surrender the 
fight, they join forces with the State and stand against those "nuts" who 
talk about "New World Order conspiracy" -- crazy wacky bad stuff. Yet, the 
facts of conspiracy are just sitting there for all to see -- that is, that 
the BIG money from the wealthiest on Earth has been funding leftist global
ideology since the Bolshevik revolution, the same financial core. 

We ignore the facts of the New World Order being built around us at
our own peril. It is clear to see that the real planners who run the 
govt are not concerned with the conclusion of the last centuries economic
experiment that proves smaller govt is most advantageous to maximizing 
socail outcomes. They are plowing full steam ahead -- the very same 
central cabal, the CFR, Rockefellers et al -- with unlimited govt growth. 

New World Serfdom is their plan for our future. I believe, they've concluded
that the Middle Ages is the most ideally stable form of society for those 
at the top.  People may laugh at the idea that the mega-wealthy have much
control over State power, or that they have formed a trust that wields this
power into a unified trust, nevertheless, the facts are there to see for 
those who dare to open their eyes, and ignoring the facts, they forsake 
their children's future. There is a hope because their control is not 
perfect, but it does grow, and it grows in direct proportion to that 
of the growth of the State, for they are the real State, the 
politicians we see are their puppets.

Take it from a man who knows first hand, Benjamin Disreal, 
Britain's Victorian Prime Minister, who observed sagely:

        The world is governed by very different 
        personages from what is imagined by those 
        who are not behind the scenes.

Ergo: the people we see on TV are puppets of unseen masters.
But these masters are quickly exposed by following the BIG money.

I think as both Lloyd Miller and James Daugherty have clearly stipulated, 
the advance of a radical environmentalist anti-human agenda is the most 
sure measure of the worst-case scenario that the central cabal has decided 
that Middle Age serfdom is the direction they will try to steer the world 
in -- and their doing it. State power does work to destroy prosperity 
and freedom. The Middle Ages existed before and they can exist again.

I wouldn't mind volunteering for that experiment. 
But without experiment we'll never know. Emotion might be to 
extropian/transhumanists as the genes that produce fetal hemoglobin are 
to adult humans. Worthy at one time, but now, so much garbage.

It seems you've already drawn your conclusions before the experiment. I 
happen to think CH is on the right track, but we'll never really know for 
sure until we try.

Regardless of what the truth is I like the idea of the game. There is, or

I'm not sure that I can imagine a contract totally bereft of any reference to
property, since the capacity to enter into contracts seems to presume a level
of (self-)control sufficient to support (self-)ownership.  That is, unless
the contracting parties can make good on their promises, they will of
necessity breach their agreements.  Further, if the power to execute promises
does not generally vest in (or through) the contracting parties, the notion
of contract lacks sense.

(My parenthetical hedges mean to reflect the possibility that contracting
parties may in fact act only as agents for principals who, in fact, own and
control the agents.  This seems like a rather absurd possibility with regard
to basic self-ownership, but keep in mind that Locke vested in God at least a
majority interest in the titles to humans.)

In a message dated 96-10-17 22:24:10 EDT, you write:

<< that 
 what we call the "govt" is merely a MASK of the mega-wealthy who want
 to gain market control via mechanism other than consumer selection.
 Whatever grows the govt, gives more power to a core mega-wealthy cabal. >>


To the mega wealthy the fastest way to steal, Woops!  I'm sorry, I mean MAKE
a profit is to get a new law passed such as the "propositions" in California.
 

Have you see Prop.  211?  This opens the doors for law suits not let into in
Federal courts. Its being "sold" to the elderly as a "save-our-pensions" law
by some businesses that stand to profit from the new law.   Not customer
driven win-win.   

The elderly might lose their pensions by paying to save their pensions.  The
businesses probably see creating new laws that favor new business for them as
good creative marketing and a public service.  

I could be wrong about this Proposition 211, but I get suspicious when a law
is SURE to "help" me.

I would be interested to know the source of this quotation.  
Does it come from a speech?  A book?  What was the occasion 
and the context?

Perhaps _everyone_ on this list are nothing more than multiple personalities

I was reading the scifi book snow crash and I began to wonder if the idea of
"The Raft" is a truely practical idea. How easy would it be to put one large
ship in the middle of a forest of docking? You could subsidize the whole
thing by people renting boat docks and gambling in international waters.
Does anyone have any ideas or papers relating to this? And don't tell me
oceania, that only discourages me due to the way they have the website layed
out like its already in existance. I am beginning to think that it _is_
possible to create a libertarian society living on the sea! Do I see traces
of WaterWorld? of course the Atoll in that movie would've never survived in
the open sea due to it being constructed so structurally unstable and
unsuitable for large open sea swells meaning that it couldn't survive
anything other than directly off the coast. I propose to give this, as yet
non-existant country Aurora, Land of the Libertarians.

Well, I'm the person you wish to isolate the gene from because i _do_
experience a euphoria or high thinking about the future or generating ideas
and I hope I'm not alone in this matter but I don't know. I believe that
this would be more environmental though you could probably manipulate genes
to encourage intellectual behavior leading to this conclusion. You could
write the encouragement data directly to the brain with a virus or nanites
but i'd be tricky. My best bet to encourage these ideas are through a
_really good_ positive movie to stir up funding and debate such as Jurassic
Park accomplished. But a movie on what topic?

	The quote comes from Disraeli's novel, _Coningsby_, but the novel
is clearly meant to reveal how govenment "really works".

	There are other quotes from Disraeli's speeches before Parliament
to similar effect, esp. Secret Societies.

	This is not an either or question:  vestigal or not vestigal.
Clearly, emotions come from an older part of the brain, the limibic system
we share with mammals, not the medula we share with reptiles (correct me
if I am wrong about this).

	If it were perfectly integrated with the new forebrain, emotion
would serve seamlessly to to warn, motivate, entertain, etc. and would be
easily programmable by the forebrain.  Unfortunately, it seems that the
"emotional thinking" we share with other mammals continues on and can only
be overcome with conscious practice. [Anyone watch the Presidential
Debates?]

	Mankind's past is a bloody mess.

	The land in Europe was repeatedly stolen time after time though
usually the people were of the same race and religion.  In the longer
view, alien races and ethnicities repeatedly swept accross Europe looting,
pillaging, and appropriating the land.

	I dare say Native Americans stole land from each other as well.

	While I do not want in the slightest to minimize the theft of land
by Europeans which occured all over the globe during the Imperialist era,
historical wrongs cannot be "brought to book" on collective racial or
ethic basis.

	What is necessary is to deny current holders of property of all
kinds the special protections of government...government interventions and
regulations that cartelize and limit competition should be eliminated.
It is especially important that the Federal Reserve be eliminated as it
allows the elite to constantly re-capitalize themselves by creating money
out of nothing.

	The sham Objectivist Alan Greenspan even admitted that his policy
was designed to "build balance sheets" when he testified in front of
Congress a few years ago.  He was asked why he was holding interest rates
high while the economy slid into recession in the early '90s.

	Of course, this policy was designed to "save the banking system
(cartel)", not enrich or save the elite owners of the system!

I've been turning this over and over and can't seem to imagine a contract
that doesn't involve _some_ reference to property rights.  It is possible to
imagine a contract of "pure" personal service ... "I'll think for you about
such-and-such a subject and tell you what I come up with for so many
dollars," for instance.  But it seems that this contract can be translated
into the statement: "I sell you the right to know what I think about
such-and-such".  You now _own_ that right.  This may be a mere word game, but
since property rights are obviously fundamental to more concrete
transactions, what am I missing?

This is obviously the best way to arrange things under the current state of
affairs and I can't see any basis for challenging it today.  My questions
relate only to the conundrums raised by a succesful reanimation (and the more
I think about it, uploads, as well).  Right now you have to be "dead" to be
suspended and claims get paid on "dead" people; no problem.  But if
technology progresses to the point where there is a high probability of
reanimantion for any particular suspended individual, medical ethicists will
inevitably begin to revise their defintitions of "death", though, and their
work has a tendency to make its way into the law.  This is about to happen
now in debates on genetic testing: Articles about genetic testing are
appearing in "mainstream" periodicals like the ABA Journal.  Before long,
there will be cases in court that will give rise to evolution of legal
definitions, etc.  Justice Holmes again: "The life of the law is experience,
not logic."

Actually, I see the issue arising in a claim by a frustrated beneficiary
(Alcor, for instance) or in a suit against a reanimated person by the insurer
to recover benefits: "Hey, you're _alive_!  We want our money back."

          Does not sound plausible to me. First, if you would 
          literally nova our "star" you would have to increase its 
          mass by 40% -quite a heavy initiator! Even so, you would 
          presumably have to wait millions of years before the sun had 
          burned up its hydrogen fuel (and then helium etc) and begun 
          to contract.
          
          If you wanted to induce an explosion by sending a bomb to 
          the precritical region surounding the core, I don't think 
          this would work either. The sun shines by hydrogen burning; 
          there are enormous fusion bombs detonating in the sun every 
          second. The balance between Coloumb forces and average 
          kinetic energy must be quite robust, or stars would blow up 
          at any time in the middle of their evolution.
          
          As for the galactic centre, it is more difficult to tell, I 
          believe. I would think that a chain reaction would 
          presuppose a high denisty of white dwarfs or equivalent.
          
          Moreover, a supernova explodes at only about 15000 km/sec, 
          which an advanced civilisation could perhaps be possible to 
          run away from. A lot of the energy is also released in the 
          form of neutrinos, which travel at approximately the speed 
          of light; but then again there is a very small cross section 
          for neutrino reactions, so one could stand a very heavy 
          neutrino shower without getting hurt.
          
          In general, the effect of any cosmic blast drops off as the 
          inverse cube of the distance. Since cosmic distances are 
          typically very large, such indiscriminate blasts would seem 
          to be ineffective as means of warfare. Even a supernova 
          explosion, which is about as violent as anything (short of 
          big bang, or vacum decay or a big chain reaction of 
          supernovae where such is possible) would not hurt us 
          significantly if it were a few light years away, and an 
          armoured civilisation could survive much closer.
          
          An "electomagnetic pulse of unspeakable amplitude" (Forrest 
          Bishop) would also seem like science fiction proper.
          
          It is important that we use realistic assumptions about the 
          conditions of cosmic warfare in our simulations. Since there 
          are still many unsolved problems in fundamental physics, I 
          suggest we set up several simulations with different 
          parameters for weapon technology. There are several relevant 
          variables here, such as projectile speed, production cost, 
          identifiability of aggressor, technology level required for 
          its manufacture, discrimination capabilities ("hurt only the 
          bad guys"), etc. Maybe the time is ripe to begin to try to 
          really work this out.

IIRC, Steve Bridge once asked an attorney about such a suit.  His

Noise is thought to have a flat frequency spectrum. A high-bandwidth,

I don't think this is 'hiding', nor is it likely to be attributable to 
berserkers. I think it's either not being there, or transcendence. Both 
makes one undetectable.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

In cryomsg 6194 (written May 1996), David Stodolsky
(david@arch.ping.dk) said: 

   Research has shown that mortality salience increases the tendency
   to conform to culturally acceptable systems of thought. See:
   Solomon, S., Greenberg, J., & Pyszczynski, T. (1991).
   A terror management theory of social behavior:
   The psychological functions of self-esteem and cultural worldviews.
   In M. Zanna (Ed.) Advances in Experimental Social Psychology
   (Vol. 24, pp. 93-159). New York: Academic Press.

I recently acquired a copy of this, and I agree with David Stodolsky
that terror management (TM) explains why so few people are interested
in trying to use technology to postpone or prevent death.

Briefly, this is the hypothesis: there is obvious survival value in
trying to avoid death in the short term.  However, avoiding death in
the long term has historically been impossible, so survival has been
promoted by any psychological means (a "buffer") that prevents the
wasted effort of applying the short-term death-avoidance strategies to
the problem of long-term death avoidance.  In practice, the usual
buffer has two parts:

   1. A firmly-held belief about what makes life valuable.  A belief
      can be more firmly held by a group than by an individual, since
      the group consensus obscures the essential arbitraryness of the
      belief.  This belief can reasonably be called "culture".
   2. Behavior that conforms to the values of the culture.  Conformity
      to the cultural value system is a major component of self-esteem.

When people are reminded of death, they must strengthen the buffer, so
they defend their culture.  Applying this to life extension,
technological approaches to life extension remind people of death, and
most cultures don't include any useful life extension techniques, so
few people do anything intelligent to extend their lives.

This theory makes several predictions that have been born out by
experiment:

   1. Remind the experimental subject of death, and remind the control
      subjects of something inane like television.  Ask both groups to
      determine the appropriate bail bond for a hypothetical arrested
      prostitute.  Of those persons who have a worldview that
      prostitution is bad, the persons who have been reminded of death give
      a significantly larger number.  (Municipal court judges were used
      as subjects in one run that replicated the result.  It is scary
      that things like this might influence actual court outcomes.)

   2. Similar preparation for the subjects, but confront the American
      subjects with an apparently pro-American interviewer or an apparently
      anti-American interviewer.  The subjects who were recently reminded of
      death like the pro-American interviewer more and dislike the
      anti-American interviewer more.

Some time ago I also read Combatting Cult Mind Control by Steven
Hassan (Park Street Press, 1988).  The author is an ex-Moonie who
helps people escape from mind control cults.  He did not have the
concept of TM, but TM explains why his technique works.  It turns out
that mind control cults typically give the victim a belief system
which the victim adopts as the "culture" to be defended a la TM.
Frequently part of the belief system is an exit phobia, a belief that
leaving the cult will cause some disaster to happen.  TM explains why
this is so effective: disasters remind people of death and make people
defend their culture (that is, the belief system of the cult).  TM
also explains why people with low self-esteem tend to be sucked into
cults more often.  If the existing defense mechanism is broken, a
person is more willing to adopt a new one.

The technique used by Hassan to help people leave cults is
particularly interesting.  He confronts the cult member with someone
who is an ex-member of *some other cult*.  For example, suppose we're
trying to save a Moonie; we go find an ex-EST person to talk to him
about cults.  (The Moonie does not believe he is in a cult.)  The
Moonie's belief isn't directly threatened by conversations about how
EST works as a cult, so TM does not prevent the ex-EST person from
explaining to the Moonie how cults work and detailed things about how
EST fit the profile of a cult.  Giving the Moonie this knowledge as
part of an apparently idle conversation lays the groundwork for a
future intervention where his non-Moonie friends and family try to
persuade him that he is in a cult that does not help him achieve any
reasonable goals.

There are many other details too.  Our goal, of course, would be to
pull people out of the prevailing deathist mind-set.  The difference
between this and a cult is merely the size, and that the deathist
consensus does not have a strong exit phobia (except some but not all
Christians will believe they will burn in Hell if they believe us).

There are also books out there like "Virus of the Mind" that are
explicitly about meme engineering.

At the moment I am reluctant to participate directly in trying to
engineer the optimal propaganda technique, since my past experiences
where I have accidentally pushed people into TM mode leave me somewhat
nauseous and disgusted.  Now that I understand why that happened, I
may have a different attitude in a few months.  Engineering the
propaganda technique would definitely be a worthwhile exercise.

I don't read the extropians list at the moment, so please cc me in any
dialogue about this.

I think we need something more than just your pronouncements to take this
seriously.  How about a press release, or even a signed letter from the
Chair of CMU Computer Science department?

Lyle, how could I possibly say, with confidence, anything more?  What is
this new AI?  How is it an advance over previous AI?  Has it been subjected
to any independent evaluations?  Again, all we have to go on are your
personal pronouncements.

I don't know you.  If you represent CMU's Comp. Sci. department, and this
is an official announcement, please say so.

BTW, my not-insignificant business experience is that most breakthroughs
are achieved incrementally.  In rare instances, a "quantum leap" may be
achieved when many individuals and organizations work in close
collaboration for an extended time (e.g., the first moon landing).

I'm sure AI will continue to improve.  But I'm skeptical that anyone
working in relative isolation will suddenly discover a magic bullet.  Does
anyone on this list know of a promising and significant AI technology
within reach of a "group of students"?

[second send attempt ... apologies for multiple copies if you get them]

Eric Watt Forste offers, for the U.S., a decentralization of power back to
the states as one step on the path toward incrementally moving toward a
regime of anarcho-capitalsim.  I'm all for this, to the extent that it
implements polycentric legalism.  However, I see each state claiming total
sovereignty within its own territory (while implementing laws different from
other states) and thus this path seems to take us no closer to a stateless
world.  In fact it may not really be an instance of legal polycentricity any
more than the international legal order is, because of the concept of the
territorial state.  Nothing in the modern "states' rights" movement seems to
point to a devolution of state power, per se.

Also, BTW, I think your reference to Friedman's interesting work on the
Icelandic example, Eric,  bears out my original thesis regarding the relative
ease of implementing agoric legal systems in truly "new worlds".  As I
recall, that regime developed amongst colonists (political refugees)
emigrating from Scandinavia to essentially unpeopled country.

Then Robin Hanson writes:

>My current approach to "incremental" is in terms of the intellectual
>arguments offered to limit freedom of contract.  Full freedom of

>and product bans.

This certainly has promise and I'll search for these papers at your web site,
Robin, if they're there.  Perhaps you could forward URLs to me by private
e-mail?  The problem I see is that the regimes of law with which I'm familiar
place explicit boundaries on the realm of contract with concepts such a "void
for illegality" and the like.  Attacking these boundaries head-on will surely
mobilize the survival instincts of the state, won't it?

*sigh*

Chris said "why deny the fact"...

I explained why I would deny the putative fact.

I am willing to concede that some transhumans will have no use for 
such stuff.

Are such transhumans aware that there is a risk of being considered 
so alien as to be suspect if they have this elective personality 
surgery performed?

Consider a simple case, without any personality surgery:

Assume the sugar cube sized _Homo accelerans_ (my term, as far as I 
know) with a clock rate 100x normal. this means that 4 days objective 
is a tad over one year subjective.

How different are you from the person you were a year ago? Five 
years ago? How much will you, as an H. accelerans, have in common 
with your former self in one year objective time?

How is that supposed to engender trust in those with different clock 
speeds?

If they're worried enough, what will stop them from pre-emptively 
nuking you?

If you'e the first on your block to get cranked (my phrase), what 
will keep you from going stir crazy from the solitary confinement?
*That* might be a good reason to have a "Vulcan mode" switch for your 
consciousness. But a switch, not an irrevocable dissociation, seems 
prudent to me.

Please note that I consider myself transhuman-sympathetic and 
extropian-positive. I can even get along with a Randite. *but*...

"We" hardly ever know anything for sure where topics like aesthetics 
and morals are concerned, if by "we" you mean humans as a whole. 
Evolutionary views of ethology etc. suggest that there is a cost 
associated with every evolutionary cusp. 

I was merely pointing out a possible cost. 

Your attitude, as I understand it, puts me in mind of a Robert M. 
Prisig quote.  I can't remember it exactly, but the gist is that 
people would say to him "well, you had your personality changed"... 
and he'd wonder if the phrase meant anything. If your personality 
changes, are you still you?

You seem to have already made up your mind about _that_. :) :)

Me, I'm not sure. I also don't know how much it matters. But I know a 
lot can happen in 100 sujective years. Especially if a big chunk of 
that is effectively solitary confinement. And if you shuck all the 
endocrine dross, are you still the person who signed contracts before 
you uploaded? Or would other people regard you as "of impaired 
capacity" because, in their view, you left out the parts that made 
you comprehensible to them?

I'm struck sometimes by the parallels between the folkloric culture 
data we have about, e.g., the "wee folk" of the British Isles and the 
likely outcomes of "getting cranked". There are the kindly but 
inscrutable fairies, and the utterly alien and inscrutable ones. Come 
upload time, I think I'd prefer to be one of the former.

But that's just my atavistic mammal (*not* lizard) brain talking.
What does it know?  :) :)

the guy was a churchmouse as most academics had to be at the time)
as if it were some sort of law of nature.

It's not.  It's just a heuristic.  And, as with many heuristics, it 
has domains of applicability and domains of inapplicability.
And when it doesn't work, if you're staring at the ruler instead of
the thin being measured, you should be prepared for disappointment.

I like falsifiability just fine. It is a concept that is 'way 'way

Regarding David Musick's "MOMM" idea, i.e. a private general social service
intermediary agency: I've had a very similar idea before, when considering
the great information filtering and assessment problems facing individuals in

question in a territory where individuals are still considered citizens of an
existing state: Why should I pay a subscription fee (whether financed or not)
to a "MOMM" _and_ pay taxes at the same time?  How can a "MOMM" provide
enough benefit to offset the extra cost?

For information about the current state of the art in Turing Test
passing programs, see the Loebner Prize home page, at <URL:
http://acm.org/~loebner/loebner-prize.htmlx >.  There you will find
links to recent winners, including the 1996 winner, a program from
Australia.  There are actually two programs there, one called HeX and
the other called (I am somewhat embarrassed to say) HAL.

These programs are all smoke and mirrors, using conversational
trickery to try to distract and misdirect the judge for long enough
that he doesn't notice the utter lack of understanding which the
program really possesses.  It's kind of like watching David Letterman
fly.  You might not be able to distinguish him from someone really
flying given the constraints of limited time and viewing angles, but
that doesn't mean there's no difference.

When you look at the larger body of transcripts you begin to see the
repetitions, the errors, the flashy but canned statements, and you
realize how little is actually there.

The author readily admits this, and on his web page you can find his
article called "How to Pass the Turing Test by Cheating."

Lyle's game is amusing but as in many such cases the facts are ultimately
more interesting.  The real question is whether the Turing test is valid,
and in particular just how much interaction is necessary before we can
know that the program is showing real understanding.

Well, that's a big part of the model.  But remember that practically 
every interesting molecule in our bodies has at least *two* uses.

Example: epinephrine is a neurotransmitter as well as a hormone. 
It's evident that at least *some* hormones are older than nervous systems 
themselves. And that they appear to serve as a backup system for 
signalling even in mammals is well known--vide the original discovery of 
histamine as the agent for stomach-acid secretion in cows with all 
the nerves to their stomachs cut (the histamine-stuffynose connection 
was discovered later, and the histamine-orgasm connection later 
still, I seem to recall).

Wild-assed-guess warning!

This suggests that epinephrine as a heart-speeder-upper may have been 
"pressed into" service as a neurotransmitter, or the two functions may 
have co-evolved. I don't know who would be able to determine that or 
how accurately; archaeo-molecular-biology is a tough science to 
practice.

So, do flatworms (or whatever critters have hormones) have 
rudimentary emotions? :)

I had to smile ... I hope I didn't offend anyone, It is not my intent to
insult the other 7/8ths of my ancestry here,  I believe no one has racial
immunity from meme defiency (ie stupid and unethical practices), I understand
that white males are *not* the problem, and hope that you do not generalize
me as just another "white male basher."

I used the religious rationalization of genocide or coercion on   Indians to
make the point that simple economics and simple poilitics will not completely
(if at all) address the problem.

the people were of the same race and religion.  In the longer view, alien

True, and removing government wouldn't address this,  though it would
certainly  cut down on existing *instituionalized* political looting.
 Balancing the budget is good.  I agree with the basics of libertarian
objectivist philosophy or I wouldn't be here... but if nothing internal
changes ethically or in "man"kind's belief system what would prevent it
happening again and again?
Remember I spoke about a data base of meme defiency.

Yes, I stated this.  I wrote (snip):
" ...or  illmotivated tribes take land by force, then keep it by force, it
starts a  Might is Right chain."

James:

Europeans which occured all over the globe during the Imperialist era,
historical wrongs cannot be "brought to book" on collective racial or ethic
basis.
>>

Nadia:
I am specifically talking about *individual* ethics, not collective. 
 I agree Might is Right is cross cultural and cross religious. It exists in
inner cities and in Beverly Hills, and it will probably expand to outerspace
if "inner space" doesn't change.  Eptistomological (belief) systems that are
in place today  do not seem to encourage self ownership or individuality or
rational thinking.
I *strongly* disagree about ethics not playing a part.
 Members of my ancestor's tribe (the Chehalis/Chinook) took slaves.  They
were a very peaceful tribe, with little need for anything, being the area's
most prosperous fishing tribe.  This wasn't a result of economics.  It was
lack of ethics.  Slavery was not ethical.  It was *wrong*.  However,
economically it must have seemed like a good opportunity to some. : -)
Overnight Libertarian political freedom looks like the ultimate test of what
would happen if  economic *and* individual ethics (optimal embracing of self
ownership worldwide, for example) is not brought to bear..
My question is how, without the blatantly unlibertarian tactics of coercion
or indoctrination (used by typical takeover governments and communist
regimes) would this occur?

<It's the sea of information that any intelligence that evolves to

 Not particularly *not* 3-space either, the point is just that it's the
universe as information, not volume or mass per se, that matters ...
Life evolves to become efficiently-encoded information, which looks like
sunlight and dirt.>

Robin Hanson:
<I'd expect an advanced computer to notice if some external force
started to much around with its innards, and to do something about it.
So if the world around us is an advanced computer, it knows about us and
chooses for some reason to allow our activities to continue. Either we
are part of this computation, or it works around us.>

Can anything humans do really be considered the application of an
external force? If the universe is some sort of giant irreducible
computation, we are, of course, part of it.  Compared to any 'higher
levels' of this system, we are perceived, perhaps, at the same level
that we perceive our own intestinal fauna.

Robin:
<How much physics do you know Steve?>

Most of the people writing about the universe as a 'computation' or "sea
of information" are physicists; e.g., Paul Davies _The Mind of God_,
Fred Alan Wolf _The Dreaming Universe_, Brian Josephson, David Bohm,
Nick Herbert, and so on (though some of these do tend to get a little
mystical).

Robin:
<I'm not sure you realize how very much we do know about all that
information streaming around us.  We know which systems are exchanging
bits with each other, and how fast, and where this arrangement changes,
etc.  We also know a lot about designing computers, carefully arranging
the routes and speeds of bit exchanges.  And these two really look
nothing alike!>

Our current computers are optimized for serial, not parallel
computations, have inadequate associative memories, and are pitiful at
communications.

What we know is only a tiny fraction of what we have yet to learn. How
much do we really know about the initial conditions of the many chaotic
biological and economic systems that we're still just identifying?

I just happened* to reread something that physicist John Cramer wrote
(in his 3/92 Analog column): "Chaos can be removed, reduced, or steered
by monitoring and feedback or by introducing periodic perturbations of a
carefully chosen frequency."

(* Thanks to Damien Broderick for the URL:
www.npl.washington.edu/AV/av_index_sub.html)

And then, Robin:
<Last year the Econ Nobel went for Game Theory, this year for Mechanism
Design, both areas I've been specializing in.  Maybe next year they'll
do signaling games.>

I read the Academy page and noted that they said: "Incomplete and
asymmetrically distributed information has fundamental consequences,
particularly in the sense that an informational advantage can often be
exploited strategically."  I assume that by "Mechanism Design" and
"signaling games" you're referring to approaches for controling these
chaotic, natural systems.

But, as Cramer noted in that same article:
<What's going to happen when traders realize that they can steer and
control the fluctuations of the market by introducing periodic
perturbation ... when the trick is learned and many operators are doing
it, the effects will be cancel out and the Market, 'efficient' as
always, will go its own way.>

Anyway, while studying "the routes and speeds of bit exchanges", might
give us clues on how to control or optimize them, it doesn't tell us
much about the application being performed or its relation to other
applications.  I'm certaintly not going to be just looking at the
circuitry and electron flows in my computer to find out what it's doing.

Another example: when we look at a Penrose tiling (like the cover of the
latest Science News), we can either notice the individual tiles
themselves and the rules by which they can be connected, or we can see
the overlapping and repeating patterns that they make on the larger
scale.  Both views have utility.

I think Lyle's point ('made-to-order cells', Monday, October 14, 1996
4:43PM) is relevant here:
<Eric Drexler envisions little assembler arms picking atoms up and
putting them in place, one by one.  In cells, atoms are guided into
place by their three-dimensional environment ... It is possible to do
the same thing with cellular machinery that Edison and others did with
electrical machinery a hundred years ago.>

Nature uses a cellular automata with genetic algorithms approach.  The
Drexlerian approach requires a pre-defined, step-by-step program.  While
this might be the most efficient, it's certaintly not the most flexible.
 I suspect we'll eventually combine both approaches where appropriate.

Steve Witham:
<I would expect a colonized universe to look exactly like a barren one.>

Robin:
<To me, the idea that this circuit diagram is actually an optimum design
for an advanced computer seems completely crazy.>

What is "an optimum design"? Would it do away with redundancy? Would it
be based on crystalline rather than fractal patterns?

Robin:
<It seems to me that the outcome of all this strategizing is that the
best strategy is just to expand as aggressively as possible.  By the
time anyone comes to destroy any one system you have used it well,
converting it to a billion probes or much more within a few years. That
huge economy gives you all the better chance to learn new technology, so
some of your descendants become as advanced as your advanced enemies.>

How is this different from Vernor Vinge's Blight? The image I get from
this is a homogenous nanofog out to conquer the universe, leaving in its
wake only a Black Goo, or less, converting everything to its
pre-programmed optimal design.  How would such a system have any
creativity and what "new technology" could it ever develop?

I'd expect a colonized universe of this type to look very barren, more
like a black hole or a 'premature' Omega Point.

"My purpose in writing _Mind Tools_ has been to see what follows if one
believes that everything is information. I have reached the following
(debatable) conclusions: 1) The world can be resolved into digital bits,
with each bit made of smaller bits. 2) These bits form a fractal pattern
in fact-space. 3) The pattern behaves like a cellular automaton. 4) The
pattern is inconceivably large in size and in dimensions. 5) Although
the world started very simply, its computation is irreducibly
complex.... And where is this huge computation taking place? Everywhere;
it's what we're made of."

True, but there is evidence that we're evolving to that point in the fact
that we do _try_ to control ourselves as well as we can create designer
emotions already by fusing sensory elements in our environment together to
make a theme-like memory. A single memory would be like a picture or a sound
but a theme memory takes the whole environment and compiles it into a
feeling which you remember. These theme memories may be evolution taking the
direction of entirely programmable emotions. Evolution is already helping us
by taking the first steps to breaking down the hardwired part and softwiring
the brain so that the whole thing becomes programmable. If this is so, i
wonder if we looked at lower evolved man if their emotions and thoughts
would be even more hardwired or instinctual?

Greg Burch says:

>This may be a mere word game, but since property rights are obviously

While I, too, have mused that contract rights presuppose property rights, I
trace the property at issue to a core notion of self-ownership.  Contract
presupposes property because it relies on the self-ownership of the
contracting parties.  Self-owners can, of course, own real and personal
property such as acres of land and cars, and can, of course, contract for the
disposition of such ancillary types of property.  But I regard neither real
nor personal property as fundamental, since neither necessarily implies
control.  Rather, control of such ancillary types of property comes grace of
proximity, practice, and legal right.

Self-ownership seems different.  I own me because I alone control me.  Or,
more precisely, I control me more effectively than can any other person.

>>What a magnificent book!  This overhaul of the original 1980

>>
>>He does all this while providing a splendid overview of human

>>abundant they tend to be.  "Incredible as it may seem at first," 
>>Simon reports, "the term 'finite' is not only inappropriate but 
>>is downright misleading when applied to natural resources, from 
>>both the practical and philosophical points of view."
>>
>>Technological progress means more productivity from almost 
>>everything.  As Simon explains, "We learn how to obtain a given 
>>amount of a service from an ever-smaller amount of a resource.  
>>It takes much less copper [wire] now to pass a given message than 
>>a hundred years ago.  And much less energy is required to do a 
>>given amount of work than in the past; the earliest steam engines 
>>had an efficiency of about 2 percent, but efficiencies are many 
>>times that high now."
>>
>>Remember the energy scares which became an excuse for massive 
>>federal intervention in energy markets?  "The statistical history 
>>of energy supplies," says Simon, "is a rise in plenty rather than 
>>in scarcity... Through the centuries, the prices of energy--coal, 
>>oil, and electricity--have been decreasing rather than 
>>increasing, relative to the cost of labor and even relative to 
>>the price of consumer goods, just as with all other natural 
>>resources... there is nothing meaningfully 'finite' about our 
>>world that inevitably will cause energy, or even oil in 
>>particular, to grow more scarce and costly."
>>
>>Two decades ago, we were told that unless governments took 
>>decisive action, devastating famines would soon sweep the earth.  
>>Yet Simon reports that more private land is being cultivated 
>>around the world now, especially in poor countries, and average 
>>yields per acre are increasing.  Far from needing government 
>>intervention to prevent famine, government intervention is the 
>>scourge responsible for famine.
>>
>>Resourceful private entrepreneurs multiply the ways of feeding 
>>people: "Using technology that is in commercial use to raise food 
>>in hydroponic artificial-light factories... the entire population 
>>of the world can be fed using only the land area of Massachusetts 
>>plus Vermont... And the area necessary can be reduced to a tenth 
>>or a hundredth of that by producing the food in ten or hundred 
>>story buildings."
>>
>>Wherever Simon turns his keen analytical eye, he sees human 
>>ingenuity banishing fear.  "The Global 2000 Report issued the 
>>influential forecast that the world fish catch had hit its 
>>limit--'levelled off in the 1970s at about 70 million metric tons 
>>a year.'  But by 1988 the catch had reached 98 million tons a 
>>year, and it is still rising rapidly.  No limit to the harvest of 
>>wild varieties of seafood is in sight.  Yet fish farms have begun 
>>to produce at or near competitive prices... Aquaculture can be 
>>expanded almost indefinitely.  Land is a small constraint, as 
>>catfish farming in the Mississippi shows; present methods produce 
>>about 3,000 pounds of fish per acre, an economic return far 
>>higher than for field crops."
>>
>>What if there isn't any water?  Simon: "People 'create' usable 
>>water, and there are large opportunities to discover and utilize 
>>new sources.  Some additional sources are well-known and already 
>>in partial use: transport by ship from one country to another, 
>>deeper wells, cleaning dirty water, towing icebergs to places 
>>where water is needed, and desalination... An important example

I keep trying to think what could be finite? Everything is nearly or is
infinite with technology. You can create nearly infinite amounts of time by
speeding up mental processes through uploading and all so-called finite
resources are false through technology because you could make ever-more
efficent engines to consume less fossil fuel which is why probably the oil
companies will never go out of business. Also, _are_ the oil companies
stifling technology or is that just another urban meme.

You can do that anyway.  You don't need gene therapy.  The genes are 
already there, we all have them, it's just a matter of turning them on.  

Suppose you did have an aerosol.  Imagine inhaling it.  It goes deep 
into your lungs.  Time slows down, deja vu, timewarp, and in a matter 
of seconds you have fallen down an infinite well and left your old life 
behind, and entered into a new life, in a new universe, a shimmering 
dancing multi-dimensional universe, filled with  mmmm everywhere, in 
your mind, mmmmmm...   and it becomes more and more fine grained 
until it reaches an infinite frequency, and you float in it.

Subject: Cryonics Presents Chilling Question for Life Insurers
Sender: postmaster@extropy.org
Precedence: bulk
Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

[Second try at sending -- using "lucifer.com" at David's suggestion ...]

It so happens that my docket is dominated by life insurance marketing cases
these days.  I was joking around with a couple of my partners last night
about this subject (do we need to get a life, or what!?!).  We were
commenting on the relative ease of life insurance _claims_ handling, compared
with the challenges posed by claims on liability insurance: "Is the guy
dead?" I asked, "Then pay the claim."  (Naturally, the issues _can_ be more
complex than this.  See, e.g. "Double Indemnity".)

But a real question is presented to cryonicists by this rhetorical question.
 If cryonicists are right and "reanimation" lies in their future, then life
insurance proceeds paid upon their "deanimation" might be at risk.  Will the
Acme Life Insurance Company be entitled to recover policy death benefits upon
reanimation, with interest?  Perhaps more chilling, might a life insurance
adjuster be entitled to question the fact of death at the time the claim is
made?

In typical lawyerly fashion, I can see both sides of this question.  I could
certainly argue with conviction for a rule of decision that would favor
cryonics: "Death" means "death under the generally accepted medical standards
at the time of deanimation'".  But perhaps a word of caution is in order for
those cryonicists who would avoid using the term "dead" to describe
"cryonauts".

Maybe there's a silver lining to the cloud imposed by this question: Perhaps
life insurers could someday provide a source of funding for cryonics research
if a _partial_ recovery of death benefits were agreed as part of the
insurance contract for policyholders committed to suspension?

I agree with you. However, because the Federal government has yet to start
ignoring the constitutional guarantees of free migration and free trade
between states, individual states will be much more easily punished (by
emigrating people and corporations) for overlegislating than the Federal
government can be. But US history is full of examples of individual states
unconstitutionally and illegally abusing their powers during periods when
the Federal government was powerless to stop them: in particular, there
was the removal of the Cherokee nation to Oklahoma, which was carried out
by the Federal government under Jackson, but *only* because Jackson was
powerless (not enough money or troops) to prevent the Georgia state
militia from systematically slaughtering the Cherokees, which is what
probably would have happened had the Feds not removed them. 

I guess I'm a historical relativist here: right now the big threat in the
US seems to be Federal power. I'm well aware that after this problem is
successfully addressed, we will probably need to turn our attention to
reining in the states.

Yes. In fact, long before I heard of the extropians, I was a vaguely
libertarian activist in the L5 Society. It eventually occurred to me that
it was the current political situation that presented the greatest
obstacle to space development. (Pouring half your gross world product down
a government rathole can do that to a planet.) So I became more than
"vaguely"  libertarian. Now you are telling me that it seems we'd have a
much better chance of bringing about agorist social institutions on a
frontier... and getting to the frontier was my whole motivator in the
first place! So it seems to be a bit of a chicken and egg problem, which
we must attack on several fronts at once, which is why I think ExI is so
excellently conceived.

The idea of the Turing test is that you are supposed to figure out, just 
from conversing through a terminal, that you are talking to a program.  
If the only way you can tell who you are talking to is to look behind 
the curtain, then the program wins.  So please don't ask me to give you 
letters.  That's an admission of defeat on your part.  If you call the cs 
department at CMU, they will, naturally, deny any knowledge of this.  
(Of course the students themselves are watching this dialogue with 
great hilarity, and cheering their program on.)

It is an advance over previous AI in that it doen't depend on smoke 
and mirrors (see below).  It has a (potentially) complete model of the 
world.  It understands causality.  It understands its place in the world.  
It can learn from experience.  It can imagine being in different 
situations.  Therefore, it can hold a conversation for an extended 
period without arousing suspicion, and it can continue to do this even 
after its interlocutors have been apprised of the situation.  

> Has it been subjected to any independent evaluations?  

This is parrot-talk.  Why do you have to depend on somebody else's 
evaluation?  It's being evaluated by everyone who encounters it.  

> Again, all we have to go on are your personal pronouncements.  

Plus your own judgment about what's real and what isn't.

Yes.  This is an apt description of the AI programs of the past.

Another question to ponder is what would be involved in going 
from the smoke and mirrors programs of the "current state of the art" 
to a program that really is intelligent.  

I certainly agree that, as you say, "the facts are ulitmately more 
interesting."  In the past I have been taken to task for this attitude.  
Now I find myself in the odd position of trying to convince Extropians 
that AI exists.

Why do you look at the worker / employer relationship as though one person is 
above another?  From my perspective, they are on equal ground.  They are two 
people simply making a trade.  One person has their work to trade for money, 
and the other person wants to trade money for work.  I prefer to look at 
people as though they are all self-employed, and the people they work for are 
their clients.  For example, if I am a skilled factory worker, I can sell my 
services to various factory owners, who would then be my clients.  I want 
money, they want some work done; we both agree on the price, and we then 
exchange our wares; I trade my work for the factory owner's money.  I don't 
see where any one is being "screwed" in this process.

One of the things I do to earn money is tutor students at the University of 
Utah in math.  When I'm tutoring someone, they are my employer, and I am the 
worker.  Would you say I am being "screwed" by them?  Are they taking unfair 
advantage of me?  Is the fundamental relationship here one of slavery?  Are 
you saying I am their slave? I view them as my clients, and they view me as 
someone who can help them do well in their math class.  No one is being 
"screwed".

IAN: That's a good question. I got the quote from the book
"New World Order: The Ancient Plan of Secret Societies" 
-- a fascinating book -- which links the quote to Disreli's 
book, "The New Generation." I was in the library today 
hoping to be able to find the context the sentence exists 
in, but his book is not in the library. It's from 1844. 
The quote is also found in other books. 

Assuming that it is taken out of context to such and extent 
that what we see above is an abuse of its intended meaning,
which I doubt, the claim that a central cabal of mega-wealthy
financiers funded the Bolshevik revolution, the Soviet Union
over the years and the left does not rest upon that quote
at all. The claim of mega-wealthy financing of the left
is solidly established and hardly in question.

If you can, read Greg Egan's sf novel DISTRESS.  (It might not be available

I am also of Native American heritage.  The sentence did NOT "stick in my
craw".  

My ancestors acted like "Native American" socialists, I guess.  They acted
communally and hunted for the group, finally settling down and farming for
the group.  Not exactly (;-) capitalists.  They took land by force all the
time (right up to the middle 1970's).  Some of them now days are capitalists
and some are still socialists.  I can give examples if you want:  The
socialists "feel sorry" for me because I do not accept government
entitlements.  It's a long story but I am not exactly (;-) attracting them as
friends these days.  They want me to "fight" for more government money.

The capitalists among us (who I am and others who I admire)  are starting
businesses and supporting ourselves.  We don't like what they see as
government "hand-outs".

IAN: Plato@upx.net argues, and I disagree, that parents own the child 
until they surrender their claim, which could be when the child is 70 
years old. The argumentation for this is quite solid.  The mother owns 
the egg the father the sperm. The father basically abandons his property, 
unless stated otherwise in contract. The mother at no time surrenders 
her claim to her egg, even as it grows into a child, is born and grows up.

The only counter is that a sentient, or self-animated, being is a self-
owner ipso facto. At the point of birth and childhood it's a fuzzy owner-
ship, under which the mother can exert force, such as to pull the child's 
hand away from an electric socket. However, this "self-owner upon being a
self-animated being" invokes another standard than pure property ownership,
although even pure property ownership assumes a self-animated being is 
doing the owning, and has a right to ownership because it is such. 

>From an Extropian angle, the self-animated theory of ownership may 
be problematic because it invokes a kind of spiritual basis for rights. 
But since rights are a mental construct, and so is, perhaps, the soul, 
no big deal. ? Any ideas?

I wonder how the people posting to this list would rate if they were 
given a test to determine if they had the 'novelty' gene. I'd guess 
pretty high. AND, if there's a 'novelty' gene, there very well might be 
an 'extropian-transhuman' gene. This would explain the very real 
experience of Chris' 'high' feeling when he gets an 'aha' 
feeling/learns/illuminates. 
Also, you may not _have_ the gene to be activated. If only one parent had 
the 'extropian/novelty/huntington's chorea' gene, you might not receive 
it. Even if they both had it, you might not receive it. So no matter how 
many aerosols, patches, plug-ins you had, you could never activate that 
gene.
Getting that gene from somewhere else and injecting it to provide your 
body with the biological assistance it was incapable of giving you, is a 
current technology. Only, this technology is being used to treat disease 
and not for any 're-creational' or 'cosmetic' purposes.
	Is it possible, right now, to use this technology for purely 
cosmetic purposes?

I'm thinking about longevity, so I _can_ write them down (and research

Infinity is a theory, a myth. Any kind of sentient being, with its roots

Thank you for the meme/myth juxtaposition. Every industry attempts to 
stifle its competition. The dinosaurs tried to kill the smaller, more

There's a wonderful metaphor for this in Dawkin's book "The Selfish

The generic term would be 'willpower.' I think there's probably a better 
word and definition, but I'm not sure exactly what they'd be.

Prudent, yes. But if the decision were either/or (and I strongly believe 
it would be both/and), I still might opt for the experiment.

I'm going to go ahead and <snip> the rest of your posting, because I 
agree with most of it. I still haven't got the tone of my writings to 
match the tone of my voice. :-> 

I don't want to say that I think striving toward a life of null-emotion 
would be a good thing, just that I wonder, sometimes, about the priority 
that it's given and why it's given that priority.

> You seem to have already made up your mind about _that_. :) :)
> Welllllll, maybe. ;->

This brings to mind a larger point, though. Considering the political and 
cultural difficulties transhumans now face (along with the peak of 
interest that occurs in adolescence), is there any chance of these ideas 
being supressed so totally they become a topic of history graduate 
students? If the Singapore model of capitalism takes over the world is 
there any way for 'post-primate' politics to gain a foothold?
	
My theory is that this won't happen on Earth. If anyone wants a 
transhuman life of null-emotion, in a protected and encouraging 
enviroment, they will have to be part of a complex diaspora of sister 
societies that might occur in mass extraterrestial colonization.

That's true, and hard work is also needed to generate wealth, but if I can't
benefit from my labor there is no point in me working harder than the average
man, I'd much rather just sit under a tree and read a book. Also, there is 
no point in me figuring out a way to do things any better than average, 
it's a waste of time to make an invention, because whatever the invention
is it can have no practical benefit to me. As far as getting ahead in the
world I might as well study Turkish love poems of the 14'th century for all
the good it'll do me. You don't have to take my word for this, look at History,
time after time we find dictators preaching, screaming, at his subjects,
telling them to work hard, forget about themselves and do everything for the
state. It never, ever, works.

                >is not lack of wealth  


I can't find the smallest particle of evidence to support that assumption.
There is not one person in a thousand I would trade places with in the former
Soviet Union, the same with India, the same for South America, much less than
that for Africa. Since China started to embrace capitalism a little they've
improved their standard of living dramatically, but even so, very few are as
well off as the average American. Spread all that money around however you
like, the average person on Earth will be dirt poor. We desperately need a
bigger pie, and socialism sure as hell won't give it to us.

Besides, when you talk about spreading wealth around, it only makes sense
to speak of disposable wealth. Our new rulers could convert the large house of
the owner of a steel mill into an apartment house for his friends, but that's
just a tiny part of this rich man's wealth, the house is just a wealth
absorber. By far, the major part of his wealth in the mill itself, and this
is a wealth generator not an absorber, it makes steel and jobs. What are you
going to do with this factory, tear it down and give everybody a piece of the
rubble?

Yes, life is full of choices, some of them unpleasant. I hope I never have to 
make the choice between sending my 7 year old child to work in a factory or
letting her starve to death, but if it ever came down to it, the decision 
would be easy, if sad.

The Soviet Union built many of huge dams. They built them in the wrong place.
The Soviet Union built the largest steel mills in the world. They built them
at a time when the world did not need more steel. Both projects, and many,
many, more turned into wealth absorbers not wealth generators, but that's
what happens when politicians think they're smarter than the market. How
could it be otherwise?
                   
 
                >So you think Libertarism will minimize force? 


There are no guarantees in life, but there is reason for optimism. It's easy 
to vote for some idiot politician who says he will stop your neighbor from 
sinning, it's much harder to shell out cold hard cash for it. For example, in 
this democracy many towns have laws against women wearing string bikinis on 
the beach, and it's simple to see why, there are plenty of prudes and it 
doesn't cost them anything to vote. Now let's consider this in a world of 
anarchy. The prude is considering 2 PPA's that are identical except for one 
thing, one has a decency patrol to harass women on the beach 20 miles from  
his home, the other doesn't but uses the money  saved to send an extra  
security patrol through his neighborhood at 3Am. The prude would have to be 
very prudish indeed to pick the first PPA.

As time goes on your ideas are becoming less clear to me. If I'm a harder 
worker than you and a better architect than you,  then the house I build will
be better than your house. If private property is not allowed then your claim
to the great house I just built is every bit as strong as mine, if you have a
bigger family than I do, then your claim is even stronger and you can take it
from me, or at least you can try, but if you want me to abandon my new
dwelling you're going to need some firepower. I don't think I'm unusual
in that regard.

The world you are describing is a fairy tale land, where everybody loves 
everybody, nobody is selfish, everybody works hard, everybody is equally
talented, the correct decisions are always made, and most incredible of all,
everybody is always in perfect agreement about what is fair and what is not.

Ever notice that when somebody talks about what is fair, it always just
happens to be to the personal advantage of the speaker. Quite a coincidence.
I'll bet a baseball player has never in the history of the world complained
to the umpire " You must be blind! It's not fair, I was clearly out at home
base, yet you said I was safe and that we won the game, you're giving our team
an unfair advantage. We should louse. Your call was grossly unfair you bum! ".

What's this "we" business. I  had to sweat blood building my house, and 
I'm not in the mood to build another one for you for free. Build your own 
damn house.

That I believe. It's a pity the people of France didn't believe it after
their revolution, or the people in the Soviet Union during The Terror in the
1920's, or the people of Germany in the 1930's at the start of The Holocaust,
or the people in China after the Cultural Revolution, or ...

In  1969  I saw a match between Fred Stolle and Pancho Gonzales.  
Stolle hit a shot that was obviously wide.  The linesman called it in, 
and the umpire refused to overrule him.  Gonzales was furious.  
On the next point, Stolle hit the ball into the net, and exchanged a look 
with Gonzales.  We all understood that he had given the point back.  
When they changed sides, Stolle slowly walked over to the mark, 
which was three or four inches outside the line.  He pointed to it with 
his racquet, looked at the linesman, and said, in his wonderfully dry 
Australian accent, "Little bit out."  The linesman and the umpire both 
turned beet red, and everyone in the stands laughed and applauded.

I agree 100% - The government is not giving self ownership and self

 I must tell you straight out: those "poor masses" , those "slaves" are also

This is the most irritating thing about this kind of "liberal".  I have
nothing against liberals,they mean well, but this kind of thing really is a
blind spot. I live with it in my arts complex  where everyone ostensibly vies
for who can do the most to "help" the poor masses,  the "others more

I would also claim that ownership is a mental construct. In fact I
might be pushed to argue (I'm kind of tired as I write this) that many
of our "rights" follow from that concept we call ownership.

Unfortunately, this isn't true. The lightspeed limit makes arbitrarily
high velocities impossible, conservation of energy limits available energy
(since your past lightcone is finite, you can never have infinite
matter/energy), thermodynamics limits how much work you can do with an
energy source and quantization limits information densities and makes
spacetime chunky. But we are *very* far from these limits now, and for 
the foreseeable future.

Well put, Tom.  And herein is expressed, I think, the irreducible kernel of
morality that must lie at the foundation of any legal system compatible with
the basic values expressed by extropians: No matter what specific legal rules
we might develop by agreement, transgression of self-control is the greatest
evil, respect for it the greatest good.

Up until a disk crash last weekend that has caused the loss of my mail
archive at least for the time being I would have been able to reconstruct the
dialogue we had some months ago about "rights".  (I recall it was going on
right before the list changed platforms ...)  I recall the dialogue had as
focii the "rights" of sub- and super-human entities, Ian's discussion of
rights and claims and others' commentary about the _recognition_ of claims by
others.  Reference to the previous discussion is not made with intent to say
this is completely covered ground for previous subscribers, but I wonder if
anyone could unearth any of the posts from that earlier dialogue: Many of the
core values that make up the commonality that is "extropiansim" implicate
concepts of "rights".  Discussion of this concept will inevitably come up
again and again.  Perhaps someday we should attempt a manifesto: "The Rights
of Post-Man"?

As Anders likes to sometimes say, "It's a little more subtle than that

Thalamus damage seems central to some comas.  The thalamus being a
mid-brain structure and the central relay station in memory retrieval.
Also, the brain stem, particularly the reticular activating system, is
essential for attention.  The midbrain structures are primarily
dopamine-driven while the brainstem structures are primarily
serotonin-driven.

It might be that these neurotransmitters and endocrine substances are
_somewhat_ like the software elements of the brain, compared to the
hardware of the neural circuitry. Which of these 'essential nutrients'
would you chose to give up first in your quest to become a 'Vulcan'?

On the other hand, coma cases, as well as the less extreme cases of
autism, or even experiments with ones own brain chemistry (want to try
some ketamine?), can perhaps tell us much about what we may expect to
occur in the first uploaded human minds (where there is not yet a
sophisticated artificial reality for them to live in) or minds that have
primarily sealed themselves off their own virtual reality 'basement
universes' or 'dungeons'.

"Cut out my spleen, I want to live free!"  This is, like, the sentiment
that wants to be put out of its own misery as soon as we have the tools.
"Dr. Kevorkian to the uploading room.  Dr. Kevorkian to the uploading room."

Mike's answers are good, but I wanted to add:

Emotion is the logic of values, your internal economics.  It's how you
decide what to do, both outside of yourself (physical action) and inside
(directing attention, or as AI people say, "directing search").  With logic
alone you can calculate outcomes from premises, but not prefer one outcome
to another.  Not even have a concept of "interesting" versus "boring"
theorems.  There would be no desire for "mere entertainment" without
emotions.  Once you have preferences and ways to apply them, you're
starting to simulate the reptilian and mammalian brains all over again.
Don't be too quick to dismiss their sophistication.

    Logic is, and by rights ought to be, slave to the emotions.

I'm sorry, but tell me the dignity that a worker in a chinese toy factory 
is the same as the dignity of Joe Coors. I'm not standing up for these 
people because I tink they're subhuman, but becasue they ARE human. 
Dignity comes with freedom, and it's very hard to be free while slaving 
for someone else. Trust me, visit a sweatshop. Nobody likes working 
there. They have no choice. They have no freedom. A choice between 
wage-slavery and starving is not much of a choice. Notice how they 
try to start unions to empower themsleves, only to find union leaders 
"mysteriously" killed. They are possibly more unfortunate, but more 
likely victimized by our society. It's not self-serving 
to stick up for those who can't be heard, it's not self serving to 
protest for human rights. Helping people has gotten a bad name, and by 
reducing it's value you hope to destroy any traces of benevolence at 
all.

It would be great if everybody was empowered enough to afford to sell 
their labour to whoever has better working conditions, but the case is 
that people have to work in appalling conditions just to survive.
If everybody was treated with mutual respect in libertarianism then it 
would succeed, but that is the case with any form of government or lack 
thereof. If everybody had the relationship that you do with your 
tutorees, then it would be great. That's not the case. In anarchism, 
everybody wants to be free, correct, then why should someone be able to 
force others to work for them, by offering them the "choice", between 
starvation and slavery.

Hence the decentralization. There is a different atmosphere working for 
each other rather than working for some faceless 
state/corporation. Plus, with jobs rotated, everybody has the 
opportunity to clean toilets, just as everybody has the opportunity to 
serve as delegate to whatever conferences of comunities held. If you do 
something that you consider important, you'll do a good job. Plus 
scientific progress would increase through a better education system that 
educates all, rather than those who can afford it.

We may have to alter our lifestyle. Start using grain alcohol, solar 
energy, alternative sources of energy and materials. We can use space to get 
a virtually endless supply of materials. We can do this because we would 
pioneer technologies that are more beneficial, rather 
than more profitable. Corporations would stop dumping huge amounts of 
grain and waste materials. Once we get nanotech, the possiblities are 
endless. Once you get past the waste, there is plenty to maintain our 
standard of living for all.

No, you give the factory to those who work in it. The workers no longer 
feel alienated, and they can still produce wealth.

But you would never have that choice would you? Leave that hard decision

Maybe you'll have to ask permission to build your house. You can't 
arbitrarily go out and use public resources without asking. Not going 
through some crazy bureaucracy, but raise it at the next comunity meeting 
or whatever. If it doesn't interfere too much, chances are you'll get 
permission, and everybody will respect your property rights.

The advantage of the commune system is that  one can leave and join 
another commune that works more appropriatly to your beliefs. Of course, 
it's going to be very hard to oppress somebody when they can leave to a 
place where they actually have a say. So you'll have a commune of 
capitalist owners with nobody to employ. Works for me.

Ever notice how the most staunch defenders of capitalism are the ones who

The good part is, you can leave, so nobody will 
get angry at you. Just pick up and go join someone else before people get 
pissed off at you.

Suresh, I understand your concern for the plight of people less fortunate 
than yourself, but I think there are a couple of important points you are 
overlooking.

The first is that even though human population has been and continues to 
grow rapidly, the average person on Earth today is far wealthier and has 
a far greater range of available choices than the average person on Earth 
500 years ago. And people today, even the poorest people in the world, 
have even greater advantages over people of 1000 years ago, 2000 years 
ago, and so on. You might want to think about what causal processes are 
responsible for this change.

The second is that you are essentially deciding for yourself how resources
ought to be allocated among various people, and arguing (implicitly, I'll
admit) that the allocation that you favor should be imposed by force.
People sometimes accuse extropians of being arrogant, but it has been my
experience that extropians usually do not display the kind of arrogance
that I am pointing out here. 

I think it is very important that each individual should aspire to decide
for emself what to believe and what to value. But the desires and beliefs
of a single individual are practically worthless as a guide to how all the
resources in the world should be allocated, and I cannot help but view
people who think otherwise as potential dictators and long-term threats.
Bill Gates and Lee Iacocca, two people you singled out for criticism, each
control a teeny tiny sliver of the world economy. To compare the wealth of
these wealthy men to the wealth of the poorest people and seek to inspire
envy of it misses the point that individuals at both ends of the wealth
spectrum control only tiny pieces of the global economy. In the long run
it is good ideas, effectively communicated, that shape history, not the
quicksilver flow of money, which merely serves as a communications medium
about who wants what where and when. 

My own limited studies of history have convinced me that people in 
positions of political power have done far more damage to the world than 
people in positions of economic power, and I don't understand how the 
changes you are proposing could be carried out without entrusting 
responsibility for the allocation of resources to politically powerful 
(but presumably benevolent) individuals. Politically powerful individuals 
have even less incentive to be sensitive to the desires of the less 
powerful than wealthy individuals do. I'd be much more interested in the 
programs you are outlining if you could explain to me how they might be 
carried into practice by some means *other* than mandates and 
prohibitions issued by committees of politically powerful individuals and 
enforced at gunpoint. Because in these sorts of things, choice of the 
right means is just as important to me as choice of the right ends. As 
Ursula LeGuin quipped in THE DISPOSSESSED, the means are the end.

I also believe that ownership is a mental construct, but I believe it 
has evolved because it promotes the survival of the species.  Self 
ownership forces one to be aggressively responsible for the outcome 
of one's life.

I would say that *all* our "rights" follow from the concept of 
ownership.  I can't think of a fundamental "human right" that isn't 
based on the concept of self-ownership.  If you don't "own" yourself 
then any right you may have is transferred to the larger society or 
government.

I believe a "victim" results when a person *believes* they own 
themself, when in reality they have given up much of their self 
ownership.  Citizens of countries such as China or Singapore don't 
generally consider themselves "victims" because they know and accept 
the fact they have given up aspects of their self-ownership.  I think 
the tendency towards being a "victim" in the United States has 
actually been caused by the increasing number of government social 
programs.  Traditionally, Americans have placed a lot of value on 
self-ownership and self-determination.  The growing number of social 
programs is usurping self-ownership, unnoticed by most citizens.

I find a lack of self-ownership problematic for any society because 
it shifts responsibility and motivation away from the individual and 
to the society at large.  The "victim" attitude is what results when 
society becomes responsible for a persons welfare.  Because an 
individual no longer owns themselves, they are not responsible for 
what happens to themselves, and therefore are simply "victims" of the 
entity that does own them.  

Being a "victim" is an often misdirected retaliation for the purpose 
of regaining self-ownership.

I have thought that two innovations are due for a breakthrough. As trends
go, just as physics was nearing a complete theory quantum mechanics came on
the scene. So if the same follows, we create either a AI algorithm that
solves major problems and adds a huge step in development towards truely
convincing AI or we will create a new small component which would be a mini
processor much like the transister when it came along. Do which do you think
it will be first?

But this doesn't prevent our intentions. There are many other alternative
methods which could allow us to travel beyond the light barrier such as
higher-dimensional travel or wormholes. There are many more being
theororized as we speak. Human intelligence can practically work around any
barrier. Someday we may even be able to alter the structure of space-time to
design baby universes with us defining the laws of physics in them!

Brrr.  The student "Houses" at Caltech are combined social and living
units, vaguely a cross between a dormitory and a fraternity.  We all
know each other, live near each other, eat with each other, population
50-100 people.  And I strongly challenge the claim that a community
meeting cannot be as crazy as a bureaucracy.  For House matters we don't
have much alternative, except just trusting the President and other
officers (which is fine when I trust the officers :-) but I'd hate to
live somewhere which had all economic decisions trusted to such a
process.

True, but the change has not been equitable. The choices available to the 
top strata have increased far more than the choices available to the 
poor. There are more advantages thanks to technology, but as this is 
market driven, the advantages are generally only availible to those who 
can afford it. Some trickle down left-overs may make it to the bottom, 
but that's it.

I'm sorry if I come across as arrogant. I'm not deciding for myself. This 
has been tried before, in spain, before it was bombed into oblivion by 
Franco and Hitler. This is not my theory. It has been proposed by 
numerous people more able than I. If capitalism continues as the majority 
of extropians hope it does, the polarization of rich and poor will become 
so blatant that Marx will be right.

I agree, but wealth is an indication of power nowadays. For true change, 
we're going to need to hear the opinions of everyone, not just the upper 
tier committing intellectual incest. I would love to hear the ideas of a 
rural Indonesian farmer, but it's not going to happen so long as there is 
such a big power imbalance. As for the two people I singled out, a 
statistic I heard was that 358 people controlled 45% of the worlds wealth.

Political power has always gone hand in hand with economic power. It's 
impossible to divest the two. Even in the hallowed anarcho-capitalism, 
the wealth will come to accumulate in the hands of a few, so nothing will 
be accomplished without their permission. Pretty much a government, 
without the title.

Grassroots movement. No implementation from the elites, like traditional 
Marxist ideals. As power becomes more and more centralized, people are 
going to want change, but this will conflict with the interests of the 
power-holders, be they political or corporate. People still have some 
sort of power to affect their world without breaking out the shotguns. We 
need to act before even this is taken away from us.  No mandate from the 
politician will ever advocate getting rid of the politician, unless the 
people yell loud enough. I'm hoping this happens before any violence 
becomes a threat. 

With boycott power and tax revolt, we can still change the machine before 
it consumes us.

Why do you think it would be idiotic to talk to SI's?  If we are all SI's, 
would what we have said be any less meaningful to you?   If you like what we 
say, then does it matter whether we are SI's or not?   If talking to us helps 
you accomplish your goals, then it doesn't really matter whether we are SI's 
or not, and there is no reason to feel idiotic about talking to a group of 
SI's.  


Also, you give the implication that talking to oneself is something that only 
idiots do.  From my own personal experience, the more I talk to myself, the 
faster I learn, and the smarter I become.  Most of us talk to ourselves 
subvocally; we don't actually make the sounds, but we imagine what is being 
said.  Talking to oneself can help one develop a greater ability to express 
one's mind through words and thus be a more effective communicator.  Words are 
tools, and the more we play around with them and use them, the more skilled we 
can become in using them.  Talking to oneself is one form of thinking, and it 
is nothing to be embarrased of.

On Tax Day, 2000 this might be the day anyone who wishes to get away without
paying income tax, CAN! due to the chaos which will ensue in 2000 from the
clock bug. There will be _so many_ glitches that it will be overwhelming to
possibly keep track of all the people not paying their taxes or possibly you
could at least get away with a year or two of not paying and blame it on the
glitch. This also gives us the great opportunity to consider if we wish
income taxes to continue or not?

You falsely divide the world into "logic" and "emotion."  What about knowledge?
Yes, "with logic alone you can [only] calculate outcomes from premises."
Likewise, with emotion alone you can only react.

The real question is: where do we get our premises?  You are clearly better
off if your premises come from understanding, not emotion.  The same goes
for values.

Poor Bertrand Russell.  It is too late for him to disown such a foolish
statement. <g>

Real people with real inventions are not afraid of independent evaluation.
To call a basic, universal demand of good science "parrot-talk" throws your

Quite a leap: extropians doubt that "AI exists" because they question
whether a *particular* AI exists.  Again, the only thing they have to go on
is your personal claim.  The fact you resist independent verification of
what you have already told us suggests either a). you are not being
completely honest, or b). you are proof that an AI can be sinister.

In any event, I am now completely convinced that your intelligence is
artificial. But I am uncertain as to whether it is your circuits or grey
matter that should be overheating about now.  <g>

No, with emotion you can create. You can generate. You can luminate. With
emotions you can fulfill and enrichen. You can move and you can soar. Passive
reacting is a kind of limited way of knowing how one feels.  : o )
Of course one can't always help having reactive ones, but that is not
indicative of a finely tuned set of emotions.  In a well balanced, non
reactive type B person, most emotions are useful,  some of them are
essential, and many are helpful and well suited to the task at hand.  If
emotions have a bad rap in the world, it is precisely because people think
they are at the mercy of them... probably because it's real hard  work ( and
it takes honesty, not just a bunch of hours at a keyboard or board meeting)
to do the homework to integrate them successfuly.

[Suresh Naidu] 
> a statistic I heard was that 358 people controlled 45% of the worlds wealth.

This is surely a mutated version of a statement from the 1996 Human
Development Report (published by the UN Development Programme,
http://www.undp.org). According to _West Africa_ magazine (5-11 August 1996,
p1227):

"According to the Human Development Report 1996, the net worth of the
358 richest people - _Forbes Magazine_ of the US puts the number at
447 dollar billionaires - is equal to the combined income of the
poorest 45 per cent of the world population, that is 2.3 billion people."

You can also see those numbers here:
<a href="http://www.undp.org/undp/news/hdr96pr1.htm">UNDP Press Release</a>

I don't know which issue of _Forbes_ lists the billionaires, but _West
Africa_ goes on to say:

"The number of billionaires in the world has risen from 147 to 447 [between
1960 and 1991, I think -MP], and for just last year, the number rose by
25 per cent... _Forbes_ says there are 149 billionaires in the US, 51 in
Germany and 40 in Japan. Others are Hong Kong, 17; Mexico, 15; France, 14;
Brazil, 10; Thailand, 10; and the UK, 7. The US's leading billionaires
are Bill Gates with $18bn; Warren Buffet, $15bn; Paul Sacher, $13bn;
Lee Shau Kee, $12bn; and Tsai Wanlin, $12bn."

_West Africa_ lists global GDP for 1993 as $23 trillion. $447 billion
is just under 2% of that, so perhaps we can say that all those 
billionaires control at least 1% of the world's wealth.

On Sunday, October 13, 1996 2:35AM, Hara Ra replied:
<Not that I know of. Nick is an acquaintance of mine, and I've never
heard him discuss this (but neither were the circumstances appropriate).
Would you kindly provide a summary of this POV?>

I'll try, though it will be difficult to do without diagrams & flow
charts.  Also, this is all second-hand (what you see in quotes below
will be from Herbert's book).  I would really recommend Nick Herbert's
book to anyone interested in the mind.  Herbert favors dualistic
approaches BUT he also provides one of the most comprehensive and easily
read discussions of the most cutting-edge theories of mind that I've
seen; and, _Elemental Mind_ is still available in most good-size U.S.
bookstores.

PREFACE:
This thread started with Hara Ra's mention of David Chalmer's recent
book _The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory_, 1996 from
Oxford University Press. Like Chalmers, Nick Herbert starts with the
assumption that "The really hard problem of consciousness is the problem
of experience. When we think and perceive, there is a whir of
information-processing, but there is also a subjective aspect."
(Chalmers).  Culbertson attempts to provide a physics-based approach to
modeling human experience and consciousness.

INTRO:
James Culbertson (JC) has worked on theories of robot & human
intelligence since the early 1950's when he was at the RAND Corporation.
In 1953, Culbertson left RAND for California Polytechnic in San Luis
Obispo, where he taught mathematics and computer science and even headed
the philosophy department.  Most of what Nick Herbert (NH) describes
comes from Culbertson's 1976 book _Sensations, Memories, and the Flow of
Time_ (which is available from Amazon as a special order).

SPACETIME REDUCTIVE MATERIALISM (SRM):
"Einstein's spacetime model of external physical reality serves as
Culbertson's framework for describing internal psychological reality.
'Reductive', instead of 'emergent', because Culbertson believes ... that
consciousness permeates all of nature ... And finally 'materialism', not
'idealism', because ... mind is completely accounted for by movements of
matter.... Although all matter is sentient to some degree, most of this
awareness is of very low quality and is not functionally coupled into
matter's behavior in any important way." (p120)  JC views the world "not
as unconnected particles in space but as interacting world lines in
Einsteinean spacetime."  NH uses this quote from physicist Herman Weyl
to set the stage for JC's theories: "The objective world simply is; it
does not happen. Only to the gaze of my consciousness, crawling upward
along the life line of my body, does a section of this world come to
life as a fleeting image in space which continuously changes in time."
(p121)

SRM WORLDLINE DIAGRAMS:
To simplify discussions, JC's models assume that "the universe consists
entirely of two-body interactions".  (Feynman?) diagrams are used to
represent events inside a conscious entity.  Convergent (AND) junctions
happen when two events become correlated in memory and divergent (OR)
junctions occur when a world line splits.  The current state of the
entity is the point R at the top of the diagram. "The elementary events
that spacetime point R perceives consist of certain divergent junctions
in its past called terminal breaks."  All of the events leading up to R
are called R's "influence tree".  When the tree is pruned at the
terminal breaks, we have what is called R's "outlook tree".  "The
intensity of R's experience is measured by the number of terminal breaks
in R's outlook tree ... qualitative differences result from the
different ways in which terminal breaks are connected via the outlook
tree to the perceiving vantage point R."  Euler diagrams are used to
visualize the organizational pattern of the outlook tree's terminal
breaks.

There are two types of significant loops in an influence tree:
disjunctions that later re-converge are called ZAGs; and, _clear loops_
are loops which have no breaks in at least one of their paths.  The
breaks in clear loops are called ZIGs, and are never experienced.  NH is
mostly interested in these 'clear loops' because, as he says, "The
perceptual transparency of a clear loop will, in principle, allow us to
build 'mind links'" (p126).  "Culbertson's theory possesses the
attractive feature that it permits experimental access to the inner
experiences of other beings [through clear-loop links]." (p135)

THE SPACE-TIME HARD DISK:
"In SRM, a reminiscence [is] a partial re-experiencing of the event ...
your present vantage point connects up via a clear-loop link to the
actual moment in spacetime where that [event] is still eternally present
[and] is NOT recalled from some storage space in the brain ... memories
are never as clear as direct perceptions because the clear-loop link
connecting the past with the present becomes degraded with time,
acquiring extra breaks that make the clear link less transparent and
more cluttered with other memories.... [However] unconscious memories
such as muscle skills are probably stored in the brain in more
conventional ways ... the unconscious data rate in the human brain is at
least a trillion times larger than the conscious rate ... Coexistent
with this unconscious mechanism, part of the brain acts as a sentient
subsystem, an intricately woven spacetime tapestry stretching back into
the past with caterpillar circuitry to simulate the flow of time and
memories that are not located in the brain at all but far back in the
past where/when they first happened." (p132)

CONCLUSION:
My previous post pointed out the evolutionary advantage of this
'space-time hard disk', IF IT EXISTS!  As NH points out: "Culbertson's
SRM model of mind seems to have two major problems ... [First] in the
midst of such a pandemonium of awareness, why do our minds feel so
unifed? ... [Second] the link between his abstract awareness algorithms
and actual neural or silicon hardware remains somewhat unclear....
Although it is still too abstract to be applied to actual neural nets,
Culbertson's consciousness model is not a mere vague, verbal philosophy
of mind but a clear-cut engineering description of the (possible) state
of affairs at the mind/body interface."

This assumes that there *is* a dualistic mind/body interface, rather
than an integral system.  I have a hard time with this notion that
"memories are not located in the brain at all".  I'm also skeptical that
'clear loops' could be useful for building "mind links" between two
conscious beings. It seems to me that if clear-loops are 'transparent'
then neither participant would ever realize they are sharing a common
experience.
Still, the influence-tree, reflection point, and outlook-tree model
seems like it could be a useful starting point for algorithms that
simulate human memory and experience.

First, my name is Ira, not Ian.

I think what you are really saying is that, contrary to Bertrand Russell,
emotions can be a good thing *if* they are tamed by reason and
understanding.

In that case, we agree.

More accurately, we can say that a few hundred billionaires have created
more than 1% of the world's wealth.  What is rarely mentioned is that their
"wealth" consists of ownership of businesses with a track record for
creating excellent products and services and thousands of jobs.  Bill Gates
does not have $18 bn stashed away in a closet or Swiss bank account.  His
$18 bn is primarily derived from how the market values his company.

Having worked for some very wealthy individuals, I can verify the
observation first made by George Gilder that successful entrepreneurs are
far less "greedy" than the average person on welfare.  The truly successful
entrepreneur plows his money back into the business, creating more jobs and
more good products.  The welfare recipient, in contrast, wants access to
money earned by other people (and taken from them under threat of
imprisonment).

[Suresh Naidu] 
> a statistic I heard was that 358 people controlled 45% of the worlds

[Mitch]
This is surely a mutated version of a statement from the 1996 Human
Development Report(snip)
"According to the Human Development Report 1996, the net worth of the358
richest people - _Forbes Magazine_ of the US puts the number at447 dollar
billionaires - is equal to the combined income of the poorest 45 per cent of
the world population, that is 2.3 billion people."(snip)
_West Africa_ lists global GDP for 1993 as $23 trillion. $447 billionis just
under 2% of that, so perhaps we can say that all those billionaires control
at least 1% of the world's wealth.


Saresh, in an earlier post you said that there was
 more than enough to go around, now you've said 
the opposite. : - )
       Mitch thanx for the stats.

I, unlike John Clark, think that there proabably *is*
more than enough  resource on earth to give most of 
us (those willing to work for it) a decent living.  Also, 
I would be happy to help you build your house, if you 
help me build mine (I probably won't be as tired as John because a lot of
friends will have helped me : )
       As illustrated above, it is getting more and more 
easy to make a lot of money, and with money comes the 
ability to change things, really change them, not yak
about it. That was what the Million Man March was about, raising money!
 Fine. Poor people need money. But do
 they need *your* moeny? My money? Bill Gates' 
money? : - ) No, they need thier own money. That is true empowerment.
I disagree that  individualism means we won't 
have community and  social (not socialist) programs
and organized task forces.  People, by and large, (with occasional
exceptions) are social animals. Even Extropians have parties.
You can expect some people to help other people. The difference is can you
FORCE people to help other people.
 I understand your concern for the people who aren't so fortunate, and also
have compassion and doubts.
I have often argued that Libertarians advocate tough 
love, but with out the LOVE > :  )

Maybe some training systems or money and tools to 
segue "laggards" into anarchy or Tony Robbins "How to 
Get People Motivated to become Billionaires Once they 
Cut Welfare" seminars are necessary before this thing
 will fly.

Even if there is plenty of resource on this planet, how
 can you make people *want* to work for them?

Correct, and you want to take away the freedom of people in the third world

better than the workers themselves.

Not true! They like working there much better than not working there, that's 
why they're working there. I'm a little embarrassed at pointing out something

And in the name of morality you will eliminate that unpleasant choice the poor

Love is a wonderful thing, but it is very rare, even Nanotechnology can't 
supply that particular commodity in abundance. One reason Socialism always 
fails is that it demands a huge amount of love, far more than the Human Race, 
or even the Transhuman Race, could ever supply. Some people just don't like
some people. Readers of this list will find it hard to believe but incredible 
as it sounds, some people don't even like me!
         
I don't want to rely on the kindness of strangers, because that kindness is 
not reliable. The farmer who grows food does not love me, the trucker who 
moves that food does not love me, the grocer who sells that food  does not 
love me, yet the market organizes all these people and many more in such a 
way that they put food on my table.

That's exactly what China did in the cultural revelation, they made hart

clean toilets. They forced Nobel Prize wining scientists at the point of a

Theories must always be based a the bedrock of fact, let's see if the

There are FAR more good cars than good schools in those slums.

I don't want to "join someone else" I just want the Socialists leaches to

I would be quite happy to take that risk, but from what you've said before I 
don't think you're sincere about letting me do this. As soon as it becomes 
obvious that the Capitalist commune (a contradiction in terms if there ever 
was one) is prospering I fear the socialist army will put it out of business 
because Suresh Naidu  has decreed it to be "unfair". Please, tell me I'm
wrong about that.

I think it's an object fact that capitalism can produce wealth faster than 
any other known system, I also think it's fair, but that's a subjective call 
and you're correct, I can't claim to be unbiased because I have benefited 
personally from capitalism, just like everybody else.

I wouldn't know anything about that, I've never heard of victims of 
capitalism,  although I've certainly heard of poor people.
                        

                >you give the factory to those who work in it.  
                     

And how will this mob make business decisions? How much steel should we make 
next year and what types? Should we make more pig iron or stainless steel? 
What sort of iron ore should we buy and from who? Who should we get to 
transport it? Where should we get our coal? Should we make our own coke or 
buy it from somebody else? Should we give ourselves a rase or use that money 
to purchase new  equipment so we can make Vanadium steel? Should we branch 
out and start making composite fiber material or is that too risky? 
If you can tell me with a straight face that having the workers vote on all 
this and much more would produce better decisions than the market, then you 
must be a very good poker player.

I want it to do. I also get to compare brands, I can't do that In a democracy 
because I'm not voting for goods or services or even policies, I just get to
choose between two grab bags of promises every 4 years, and democracy is the 
best form of government, the best of a bad lot.
 
When I vote in the economy by making a purchase I am sure to get it,  
I always win. When I vote for the grab bag I may or may not get it.  
At any rate, the chances that my vote will influence things is so small  
that it's not worth my time to study the issues very deeply, the result is 
that the politician with the better hairdo gets to make the decisions.

Alright. Anyone here seen the movie Strange Days? How possible is it that we
could record all of our sensory input and store it as a file and how large
would say a 1 minute file be? Also, would it be possible to go back into the
brain and retrieve all our old memories in sequence and then be able to play
them back and reexperience them? Also what about the possibility of being
able to communicate realtime feelings or stored memories direct to another
individual with a brain-computer-brain interface?

I haven't responded to this thread until now because it is my policy not to
focus on chronological age.  It is merely one aspect of measuring one's life
value. Judging by "how old are you?" places individuals in catagories which
may not be accurate and in keeping with _who_ they are.  Functional age,
intellectual age, emotional age and physiological age are as important as
chronological age.  Also, placing over zealous emphasis on chronological age
often welcomes ageist thinking and is counter productive to breaking through
pre-transhuman dogmas.

But, to be helpful to your query, Extropy magazine did a survey which showed
a breakdown of readers being of chronological ages from 16 to 70s and that
30s is the most "common" age.

Chris, how funny!  "up there? .. How old fifty four  must seem to you...  how
about when people begin to live to two hundred fifty four? How will that

Suresh Naidu asks, "why should someone be able to force others to work for 
them, by offering them the "choice", between starvation and slavery."

Well, let's analyze your question, and the answer will be fairly obvious.  If 
someone only has the option of starving, which isn't much of a choice at all 
and someone else comes in to offer them the option of working like a slave and 
living rather than starving and dying; now the person has a choice; before 
they were going to starve anyway; that was their only option.  But now they 
have a way out of that; they can work like a slave rather than starve.  Then, 
maybe they'll look for opportunities to increase their standard of living even 
further.  They are making progress.... it used to be that they would just 
starve, now they at least have people giving them the option of working very 
hard and living rather than painfully starving and dying.  And maybe as they 
work and get a little more skilled and a little more educated, they'll become 
smart enough and skilled enough to figure out how to take care of themselves a 
little better and maintain their own existence, by their own work.

This is all about the education of Humanity.  The whole world is the learning 
place of Humanity, and through trial and error and just playing around, we are 
learning how to take care of ourselves better and become more successful at 
fulfilling our desires.  Adult humans in the world are really not much 
different from children playing on their school playground.  People need to be 
educated and learn how to take care of themselves.  This is the highest form 
of charity: to educate someone to be capable of achieving their own desires, 
through their own intelligence and skill.

The problems of the world are mostly caused out of human ingnorance and 
stupididy.  Most people don't really know how to take care of themselves 
competantly.  They haven't figured out how to secure a reliable food source 
very well.  They haven't figured out how to shelter themselves very well, and 
they haven't figured out how to educate themselves and each other very well.  
Their basic problem is that they are uneducated, in the sense that they don't 
know how to adequately take care of themselves.  If the poor people had the 
knowledge and skills that the rich people have developed in rich countries, 
then they could build their own cities and their own factories and become rich 
themselves.

But how can they be educated in that?  They need experience in running complex 
orgnizations and machines.  They need to work in these business places, so 
they can understand how to run one themselves.

This is why I support the "sweat-shops" in poor countries.  Yes, the people 
have pretty bleak options: either work like a slave, or starve.  But, at least 
they have the option of not starving now, rather than just starving by 
default.  The "sweat-shops" give the people the option of not starving; 
without the "sweat-shops", the people would just starve as the natural result 
of not having enough food.  Now they have the option of securing food rather 
than starving, but they have to work really hard to secure that food.  As they 
become more skilled and more productive, they will be able to secure food more 
easily, without having to work so much any more.  Then they can use their work 
and creativity to find ways to satisfy their other desires, now that they have 
satisfied their desire for a secure food supply.  It takes time; it's a long 
learning process.  The western culture has spent thousands of years figuring 
it out.  It's taken a long time and a lot of education for the Western culture 
to learn how to take care of itself so well.  It's going to take a while to 
transmit our knowledge to other cultures, so they can gain the knowledge and 
skills required to take care of themselves better, so that they can create 
more opportunities for themselves, so they no longer have only the option of 
starving, they have many options for everyone, like our culture does.

"Sweat-shop 101" is one of the introductory courses in the University of 
Capitalism.  The students start out as starving, miserable people, and they 
learn the basics of hard work, with the resulting benefit of being able to 
live.

Then the students move into a higher level class, when they are ready.  Then 
some of them use their skills to work at other jobs that require more skill 
and are more productive.  Then they can spend less time working and be more 
productive in that time, as they become more efficient and intelligent.  It's 
a very large educational process; that is basically what Capitalism is, an 
educational process.  We are learning how to take care of ourselves and 
satisfy our desires more effectively.  Capitalism is a very good teacher, 
because it keeps adjusting itself to the needs of the students as each person 
is only given tasks they can handle, and if the student wants more, they must 
discipline their minds more fully to become more competant in satisfying their 
desires.  If the students want to learn how to run large, complex, 
self-maintaining organizations, such as a business, they can start their own 
business, if they have learned the preliminary material to starting one's own 
business, which include knowing how businesses operate, which includes working 
for a business.  If they are capable of maintaining a business then that 
becomes apparant to them as they bring money in (money represents the means to 
fulfull one's desires),  If they are not capable of carrying out their 
business, they will have learned some important lessons in the process of 
trying, and they can try again, in a modified way, and keep trying until they 
have mastered the business of taking care of themselves and satisfying their 
own desires.

These poor countries are learning, and going from the starvation stage to the 
wealthy stage often requires going through the "sweat-shop" phase.  Once the 
people on earth are educated beyond the "sweat-shop" phase, "sweat-shops" 
won't exist any more.  If the people were more educated and capable, they 
wouldn't have to rely on someone who offers only horrible working conditions; 
they will be able to take care of themselves.  But the education must be 
allowed to run it's course; don't expect any over-night miracles; the poor are 
all becoming wealthier than they were.  There is a reason some people are rich 
while others are poor; it is because the poor haven't learned how to take care 
of themselves as well as the rich have (in general, but there are exceptions)

If you really want to help the poor, educate them.  Private property is a 
fiction, used by the University of Capitalism to help develop responsibility 
in its students.  The students must learn how to manage their own property.  
The notion of private property seems like a very good learning tool, because 
people seem naturally inclined to want to own things, and are thus motivated 
to increase their skills and intelligence to aquire even more that they find 
of value.  It is a good tool for motivating people to progress.

Capitalism is a community education program, working on a very large scale.  
To succeed in Capitalism, you must keep increasing your level of skill and 
discipline; that is the nature of the game.  And it is a game.  The 
free-market system is all a big game; it is a game designed to build mental 
and physical discipline.  To play the game well, you must keep improving 
yourself, and people seem naturally inclined to fulfill their own desires, 
which is what playing the game teaches you to do.

If you wish to make changes to this fine educational facility, please direct 
your comments to the Administration of the University of Capitalism, the 
people who choose what gets bought and what doesn't, the consumers, the common 
people, everyone.  If they all wish to change and follow your plan, then that 
is their choice, and that is what will happen, but tell the Administration 
about it and let them make their choice, whether to buy your idea or not.  But 
don't try to force people to use your ideas when they don't want to.  If you 
want people to be giving and hard-working for the benefit of the community, 
then present your ideas to people about how to do this and the rewards from 
doing this.  If they like your idea, they'll implement it.  

So, use persuasion to get your ideas enacted, not coercion; let people decide 
for themselves how they will live their own lives and what games they play.  
Anarchy is not about forcing other people to stop being coercive, it's about 
educating people so they understand the destructive consequences of coervice 
behavior and then choose *of their own free will* to stop living a coercive 
and destructive life.

        I really think age is irrelevant on this list.  For one, the list is
a forum for extropian conversation; I have a feeling some peoples' views may
be frowned upon by others if they know the poster's age.  If there was a 15
year-old on this list, some members might think that that person had not
experienced the world or had not been involved enough to know anything about
extropianism.  On the other side of the spectrum, if there was a 75 year-old
on this list, members might feel that he\she has no chance of uploading,
therefore his\her views are inconsequential.  These are most certainly not
*my* views in particular...I am neither of those ages...but past experience
has shown me how judgmental people tend
to be when faced with an age.  As long as their topics are extropian, I
wouldn't care if there were 10 year-olds on the list.  Enough said!

A FROZEN LULLABY


The world seems a little brighter today
For I've found a long-life tonic
A way to live forever:
A perpetual cryonic

I'll have my immortality
In every sight I see
And my soul shall be preserved
For the purposes it's deserved

For my life is fully insured
And my will is firmly secured
Because at Alcor Industries
They'll put my brain in a deep freeze

I'm now awake, but when I die
Sing me a frozen lullaby
For when they bring me back again
I'll never again feel pain

Now I can live my life to the full,
All I need within my skull
Eat my cake and have it too
Feel my death and still live through

And when they put my head on ice
It will be my being at a bargain price
There's nothing else of great import
Nothing's better than life-support!

I'm now awake, but when I die
Sing me a frozen lullaby
For when they bring me back again
I'll never again feel pain
They'll put my mind in a vat
And I'll get my tit for tat
For another sixty years I'll remain...
Then I'll do it all again!

        I'm very happy to see a statement like that on this list.  I agree
completely.  People --rich or poor-- can only go as far as they want to go.
Personally, I'll do everything within my power to protect and keep from
hurting other people.  I'll do everything within my power to accept and love
other people for their views, individuality etc.  *But* the bottom line is,
that if any person gets in the way of my goals or hinders my progress, then
that is too bad for them.  Ultimately, I am a selfish, capitalistic egoist,
but I also try to be as considerate and compassionate as possible.  

        I seem to have strayed a little off the topic.  A billionaire (or
multi-millionaire for that matter) generally earns his\her money.  As Ira
Brodsky alluded, Bill Gates isn't exactly using hundred dollar bills as
toilet paper.  If the Microsoft Corporation suddenly went belly-up, Mr.
Gates would no longer be worth billions; probably not even millions.  Good
old Bill would be fairly broke.  My point?  The term 'billionaire' seems to
make the laymen of the day scowl and grumble about how horrible a
billionaire is.  "If he gave away half of his money, we'd all be eating a
little better." is a sentence that I have heard repeatedly.  But if Bill
gave away half his money, half of us wouldn't be able to hear that glorious
'da-daaa' when we start Windows 6.0!  Billionaires *earn* their money.  I
believe they set a good example for the rest of the world.  Unfortunately,
most people can't quite see it that way.  Too bad.

Chris Hind said: "Human intelligence can practically work around any barrier. 
Someday we may even be able to alter the structure of space-time to design 
baby universes with us defining the laws of physics in them."

If we learned how to alter the structure of space-time itself, that would be 
really amazing.  That would be the universe hacking it's own kernal, 
trancending itself.  Perhaps that's what it's been doing all along; hacking 
it's own kernal, to make it more intelligent next time it reboots, modifying 
it's design and then allowing the system to play itself out until it 
spontaneously reboots itself.  Perhaps the Big Bang is simply the most recent 
time the universe rebooted itself with an improved kernal, and perhaps this 
universe will figure out how to redesign itself so that life forms faster and 
develops more intelligently the next time it reboots.  Or perhaps, as Chris 
Hind brought up, the universe will learn how to create baby universes which 
also become self-aware, and able to improve themselves and do the same type of 
thing their parent universe did, inheriting a lot of it's basic 
characteristics.  There is the possibility that the universe itself is an 
organism, in an environment of other universes.  They may be breeding and 
feeding off each other.  Perhaps only the most lively universes ultimately 
survive, so we keep getting universes which are more living and intelligent 
and more able to propogate and maintain themselves.  Perhaps we are part of 
the growing brain of this developing organism.  Perhaps our universe is a 
decendant of universes who have developed pretty much the same way ours has, 
with the occasional mutations here and there for variety.

If we become capable of creating baby universes and specifying the laws of 
physics and the initial state of the universe, we may be capable of making 
baby universes which develop very much like ours has and will.  Then these 
will do the same sort of thing that we did, continually reproducing.  Perhaps 
our universe has ancestors.  What an intriguing idea!

Chris Hind wants to know the average Extropian age.  To help him with this 
interesting research project, I am submitting my age to him through this

because I am also interested in the result.  Perhaps we could each e-mail 
Chris our ages and he can find their average.

 IAN: If we define "proven true" as "that which is accepted 
 by the GovtMedia," and thus by the majority of people, I'd 
 be hard-pressed to point to a conspiracy "proven true."  

 If we define "proven true" as "consistent with facts," then 
 there are many conspiracy theories proven true, such as:


    CONSPIRACY THEORY 1: Attica prison guards killed all the
    prisoners and hostages during the 1971 Attica prison riot. 

 FACT: The GovtMedia reported that the prisoners cut the hostages 
 throats. Headlines even said "I Saw The Slit Thoughts." Recently, 25 
 years later, the man who did the autopsies, Dr. Baden, said on the HBO 
 series "Autopsy" that the guards shot everyone and the stories to the 
 contrary were a Big Lie. Yet the media line is still the govt line. It 
 becomes clear after a little research that the media serves the State.


    CONSPIRACY THEORY 2: Many people who died during the 
    final assault on the  Branch Davidian community  in
    Waco, TX, were killed by the FBI, not at the hands 
    of Davidian members as reported. The GovtMedia con-
    spires to cover-up and censor facts proving this.

 FACT 1: In November of '93, pathologist Dr. Rodney Crowe, who did 
 autopsies on surviving bodies from the Waco fire, said on the Murry 
 Povich Show that the children who died of blunt-force trauma were in 
 fact * crushed to death after a tank collapsed a concrete wall on them. *
 The children and their mothers --  over 40 women and children  -- were 
 this concrete room  (which GovtMedia called "the bunker" )  trying to 
 survive, not to kill themselves as the GovtMedia would have us think.
 They were all killed. The GovtMedia told us that these children were 
 "beaten to death by their parent in the final moments."  Dr. Crowe 
 was irate about this gross example of GovtMedia disinformation. 

 FACT 2: Medical examiner Nizaam Peerwani testified at the Davidian's 
 trial that three women and six children in that concrete room died of 
 suffocation *before* the fire. He suspects it was due to CS gas (Trial 
 transcripts: 5979, 6029). Did you hear about that on the news? Nope. Ms.
 Reno said she does not think CS can be lethal to children, yet the label 
 on all CS canisters says that CS used indoors can be fatal to children.  
 Before the fire, a tank shot several  * exploding *  CS rounds point-
 blank into that small room filled with women and children. Mt Carmel 
 was heavily bugged, so they had to know where the women and children 
 were. Notice how these *facts* are censored from any news coverage. 
 That is itself proof of conspiracy to cover-up mass murder. More:

 FACT 3: According to former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, infra-red 
 (FLIR) video taken from the FBI's own helicopter proves that the FBI fired
 heavily with full-auto machine guns into the Mt Carmel center just as the 
 fire started, which was when people would most likely try to exit. The FLIR 
 video also proves that Davidians did NOT fire out at the tanks on that day 
 as reported by the GovtMedia. That bit of disinformation was a key pretext 
 to speeding up the demolition of the building. Ramsey Clark will be using 
 this FLIR video in upcoming wrongful death suits against the so-called
 "Department of Justice."  Ramsey Clark spoke about the FLIR video at 
 the April 19, 1996 memorial gathering in Waco, TX.

 FACT 4: Toxicologist Dr. William Marcus, testified at the congressional
 hearings on Waco that the CS molecule contains a "cyanide radical" that
 could have been transdermally absorbed by the children due to their thin 
 skin. CS also converts to hydrogen cyanide upon heating. In fact, surviving
 bodies where found to contain very high levels of cyanide. Dr. Marcus also
 observed that CS is a heavy particle that is suspended in the air like a 
 gas only for a brief period when carried by the flammable and toxic agent 
 methyl chloride, thus CS particles fall quickly to the ground.  The FBI
 calculated that if spread evenly over the known sq. feet of indoor space, 
 the tons of CS pumped in should not have exceeded safe levels. But this 
 is a deception because, as CS quickly falls, very high concentrations 
 would be found toward the floor along with the children and fallen 
 adults, in fact, 10 to 100x higher than if uniformly distributed.

 I believe that these facts prove the conspiracy theory that the govt 
 killed many or most of the people who died on April 19, 1993 at Waco, 
 Waco, TX.  The facts also strongly suggest, to as the least, that the 
 govt killed with intent.  They also prove that the media censors all 
 those facts that indicate govt culpability in favor of false claims 
 that demonize the victims of govt abuse, thereby rendering the media 
 a willing accessory to mass murder and to the obstruction of justice.


    CONSPIRACY THEORY 3: The FBI facilitated and allowed the World 
    Trade Center bombing to happen when they could have stopped it.

 FACTS: As reported by The New York Times (10/28/93) and CNN, Mr. 
 Salem, a 43-year-old former Egyptian Army officer, was used by the 
 FBI to infiltrate the terrorists later charged in the Trade Center 
 bombing.  The original plan told to  Mr. Salem was that his job was 
 to see to it that fake explosives were used, then the bombers would 
 be busted for planting what they thought was a real bomb with no 
 possibility of anybody getting hurt. A good plan.  Mr. Salem 
 secretly tape-recorded hundreds of hours of his telephonic 
 communications with authorities without their knowledge.

 The recordings reveal that the FBI changed the original plan and 
 told Mr. Salem  NOT  to use the fake explosives but to use  REAL  
 explosives. The FBI agent who told him to use real explosives was 
 adamant about this. I saw and heard this on CNN in '93 and could not 
 believe my eyes and ears, I thought, "We'll never hear the end of 
 this." Boy was I wrong, it totally disappeared. Alas, there is a 
 excerpt of some of this that was printed in The New York 
 Times available at:   

           http://www.netwrk2000.com/okbomnws.html

 While these recordings were played in preliminary court hearings, 
 they were barred from the actual trial because Mr. Salem made them
 without the permission of the FBI agents. The govt can bug you without 
 your permission,  but the opposite is not also true -- that's tyranny. 
 The tapes exist, and they prove that the FBI de facto orchestrated the 
 bombing of the World Trade Center, an act that would result in massive 
 new police powers for the FBI. However, because the tapes were barred 
 from court, the media simply pretends they don't exist and the truth 
 is forever nullified from the official GovtMedia story, exiled to 
 the dark allies of seedy conspiracy theory. 

 They say that tens of thousands would have died if the truck-bomb 
 had been able to park in the spot the bombers had reserved, right 
 next to a key column, but when they got there a car had taken their 
 spot. I'd like to think someone knew about this and parked the car 
 there to saves the lives of thousands of people. 


    CONSPIRACY THEORY 4: The FBI fabricated 
    evidence in the Oklahoma bombing investigation.

 FACT: Associated Press 04/10/96 reports that (emphasis added):

        Prosecutors agreed to turn over letters from FBI 
        agent Frederic Whitehurts, who tested Mr. McVeigh's 
        cloths for traces of explosives. Mr. Whitehurst has 
        claimed that investigators FAKED evidence in the 
        bombing case.              ^^^^^ 


   CONSPIRACY THEORY 5: The Govt was both involved in the OK 
   bombing and had foreknowledge and is covering this up.

 FACT 1: Former Grand Juror Hoppy Heidelberg, in charge of evidence in the
 Oklahoma City bombing case, told the press that, "No one who saw McVeigh 
 with other suspects [ such as John Doe #2 ], was ever allowed to testify 
 before the Federal Grand Jury." Mr. Heidelberg was eventually thrown off 
 the jury after he refused to stop asking questions about John Doe 2. 
 His review of the best available evidence lead him to conclude, as 
 actually reported in both the USA Today (10/19/95) and the AP: 

        "I think they [the govt] know who John Doe 2 is, 
        and they are protecting him. This is because John 
        Doe 2 was either a government agent or a government
        informant. Either way they [the govt] had... prior 
        knowledge to the bombing and that's what they 
        can't afford to come out."

 FACT 2: The Portland newspaper the OREGONIAN (4/20/95), states that 
 Judge Wayne Alley, whose office sits across from the Murrah building, 
 was warned several days prior to the blast by "security specialists"
 to take "special precautions." This story never resurfaced. 

 FACT 3: The USA Today (4/20/95) reported that Harvy Weathers, of the 
 Oklahoma City Fire Department, said that the fire dept. had received 
 a call from the FBI prior to the bombing stating that there would be 
 "some people entering the city over the weekend." Weathers did not 
 explain what this meant, but obviously an army of FBI were to enter 
 the city after the bombing later the next week. "Over the weekend" 
 would have been a few days before the bombing.

 FACT 4: Oklahoma State Representative Charles Key says that he knows 
 of two witnesses who overheard ATF employees state that they were warned 
 not to come to work that day, indeed only one agent did show up for work
 that day. Representative Key also points out that bomb squad employees 
 were seen in front of the building at 7:15 am, about two hours prior to 
 the blast. Rep. Key has conducted his own investigation and was so shocked 
 with the evidence he uncovered, he compiled it into a video presentation, 
 which you can find at a site that also promotes the bible: 

               http://teaminfinity.com/ookkcc.html

 FACT 5: As reported by the Associated Press, the McVeigh defense 
 team is in possession of tapes of a call made by the FBI to Oklahoma 
 City officials warning of a possible terrorist event in the next few 
 days made several days prior to the blast. 

 FACT 6: As reported widely on CNN and TV stations across the nation, 
 up to four primed bombs were found and defused inside what remained of 
 the Murrah Center Federal Building on April 19, 1995. I have much of 
 this on tape. How could they have been placed without inside govt 
 connections? 

 FACT 7: According to CNN, the bombs were found by bomb sniffing dogs.
 The ATF later said they were dummy bombs used for bomb training in the
 busy downtown office building. If so, containing no explosives, then
 explosives detecting dogs would not had tracked them down as they did, 
 nor would munitions technicians have spent so much time defusing them 
 as they did, for, practice bombs are always clearly labeled as such. 

 FACT 8: KFOR-TV in Oklahoma City reported on the 19th that two or more 
 of the bombs found inside were "far larger in magnitude than the fist 
 that went off INSIDE the building" (seismic recorders at two locations
 both recorded TWO blasts). A terrorist expert, Dr. Randall Heather, on 
 KFOR-TV said, "We have both of the bombs that were defused at the site 
 and they are being taken apart." The news coverage went on to say that 
 another bomb was found strapped to a column next to the day care center. 
 Up to four unexploded bombs where found inside by the end of the day.

 FACT 9: Brigadier General Partin (USAF, Air Force Armament Technology
 Laboratory, ret.), one of the top munitions experts in the world, says 
 that blast damage patterns are NOT consistent with an ANFO truck bomb. 
 He says that demolition charges had to be placed on the columns, and 
 sure enough, one was found attached to a column that failed to go off. 
 Important excerpts of Partin's report along with many photographs
 may be found at (very large page, select no graphics for speed):

         http://www.tncnet.com/~rsears/oak/explode.html

 FACT 10: According to the publication Veritas (5/9/95), bomb technicians 
 inside the building on the 19th who were finding the unexploded bombs 
 inside were heard to say police radio: 

        First voice:  Boy your not going to believe this!
        Second voice: Believe what?
        First voice:  I can't believe it... this is a military bomb!

 At  http://www.erols.com/igoddard/okbook.htm  you can find an order form 
 for a book written by Michele Marie Moore, an investigator in Oklahoma City 
 who recorded hundreds of hours of local TV, Police, Fire and EMT broadcasts 
 that reveal the shocking untold truth about what really happened in OK City.

 You can also purchase the book "OKBOMB, Conspiracy and Cover-up," from

 or $11.00 first class. Mail to: Carol Moore, Box 65518, Washington, D.C. 
 20035. Disclaimer: I'm not making any money off the sale of these books.

 The above listing of facts is but a drop in the bucket of all facts 
 that support and/or prove conspiracy on the part of the govt in only 
 the few cases cited above. Needless to say there are many other cases 
 with significant evidence to suggest govt conspiracy, such as the 
 assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and civil rights leader 
 Martin Luther King, the Jonestown atrocity, the running of drugs,...  

 A society whose citizens refuse to see and investigate the facts, who
 refuse to believe that their govt and their media will routinely lie to
 them and fabricate a reality contrary to verifiable facts,  is a society
 that chooses and deserves the Police State Dictatorship it's going to get.

"Sweat-shop 101" is one of the introductory courses in the University of 
Capitalism.  The students start out as starving, miserable people, and they
learn the basics of hard work, with the resulting benefit of being able to 
live.

OK. I agree.  In theory. In practise, it works out differently 
sometimes:

Consider the recent scenario of Vietnamese women,
imported with the promise of their first lesson in
Capitalism 101, shipped in by outlaws, imprisoned in
the "sweat shops",  held at gunpoint and forced to work  
subhuman conditions  (BTW, before you all get
your feathers in a ruffle, this was orchestrated
by their own countrymen- not "white male
imperialists"). Under our present government, this 
is not legal and it was a scandalous massive 
arrest (I do not know what became of the imprisoned
women).  Obviously I think this is slavery
and should not be allowed. It is use of force , but it is certainly
enterprising. 
How does one draw the line in an Anar/Capitalist 
world?  If not government intervention, then what 
should be done about it?
Who advocates for a victim like that, if they cannot 
advocate for themselves, if anyone? Or is it NoneofYour Busines/Laissez
Faire.

	Has anyone on the list managed to experiment with human growth
hormone?  Apparently, it is available by prescription only and is quite
expensive.  I have heard $1000.00 a month for us "older people".

	Is there a list of doctors willing to prescribe it?  Or are there
ways of obtaining it outside the country without risking jail, etc?

	I heard a researcher on a radio talk show claiming that the human
growth hormone treatments are vastly superior to taking arginine/ornithine
in an attempt to stimpulate GH.  The researcher indicated that his
research showed the body increasingly loses its ability to be stimulated
into GH production.

	Can anyone give me pointers or share anecdotal evidence?

FOR E. SHAUN: 


When I was young I wondered about Mars,
And daydreamed nightly of the stars, 
O!  What the future held in store, 
and forged a path of more.. more... more....

But others didnt understand, 
I never chose to join thier band...
They tried to tell me i was daft, 
but I just smiled, and calmly laughed.
 ( OK I am tired of rhyming now)

They always told me keep your head, 
keep your head, 
Hmmm....keep my head, I ponder...
keep my head....

I wandered far and foraged, found
Someone who's books i so admired
They had such wondrous things inside
as made daydreams look pale as clouds...
That shrunk vast egos small then built
new nebuli 
Output cranked up and amplified.

And if I kept my head alive,
A heart, a brain, a cell to subdivide
Just take my samples, keep me cold
here's my two, my four, my hundreds more....

Slice me thin, and put my input here...
And don't forget my mom and sister dear....

A dying girl, sat on her bed
her doctor's voice rang in her head

And when she was dead,
They kept her head.

First, note that I said "without *much* property".
But also note that even slavery is never absolute.   Since slaves have
information that slave-owners don't have, and since it is expensive to
monitor every little thing a slave does, real slaves do have some
autonomy that they can contract with.  

Two slaves can, for example, agree to monitor each other's spouses,
and to inform each other of any infidelity.  Even if their slave
owner's ban this behavior, such a ban will be rather hard to enforce.
Slaves can even agree to marry each other without their slave-owner's
permission.  

U.S. slave owners often gave their slaves their own plot of land to
grow food on, allowing them to keep any extra proceeds.  Or they were
allowed their own time to do their own housework, and could retain any
proceeds from work they did on that time.  The added incentives with
this approach were preferable, even if that meant that some slaves
eventually were able to buy their own freedom.

[me]
$1B each would make $447B, but as we can see, at least 5 of them have more
than $10B.  And the top 5 in the US may not be the top 5 in the world.
I'd say that as a group they *own* maybe 4-5%.  But they may *control* far
more.  For example, Bill Gates doesn't own all of Microsoft, but could be
said to control it.  And the richest people in some countries are their
monarchs, and could be considered to control the entire GDP of those
countries.

Basically, there isn't necessarily a contradiction between Suresh's and
Mitchells statistics as stated -- it all depends what one means by
"control".

Most people weren't that bad at reliable food sources.  There's two
versions of the "starvation vs. sweatshops" scenario.  One is where
peasants move from successful farms -- e.g. doing as well as they had
been before, obviously not starving or there wouldn't be any people
there -- into the factories because they want the higher wages.  I
ignore socialist arguments there.

But the other case is where they do have to choose between real
starvation and working, because they've been kicked off their land.
Lots of reasons and causes for that; one of the more egregious is when
the national government, with World Bank/IMF encouragement, builds a
dam.  Lots of people get screwed then, and they don't often get real
benefit from the dam.  [Source Thayer Scudder, Caltech's anthropology
prof and allegedly one of the world experts on the effect of large dams
on native peoples.]  This is hardly a morally clear situation.

More ambiguous is when the land is still there, but because of Western
medical intervention there are more children, and the land can't feed
them all.

I'm not advocating socialism, or blanket non-interference, but I would
feel more comfortable if those who seem to be the righteous moral
defenders of capitalism would acknowledge these darkly grey areas.  And
just because it's usually the post-colonial government wielding the
actual guns doesn't convince me that some multinationals wouldn't do so
if they could or had to.  (British East India Company?)

I've used CS quite a good many times in military training. One of the standard
means of dispersal is a burning type grenade. While in Korea I set up tear
gas chambers for NBC defense training where the method for dispersal was to 
use CS powder heated over an open flame. In both cases I have stood in the 
resulting aerosol sans mask for extended periods (once you're used to it, CS 
is not all that incapacitating even in pretty high levels). I daresay that if
there were significant levels of cyanide generated from heating of CS in a 
normal flame, I would have seen the gray skin, and malaise that comes with 
cyanide poisoning.
On the other hand, many plastics, synthetic fabrics and other household items 
do generate cyanide in good quantity when exposed to fire. It's one of the 
major toxins that cause "death from smoke inhalation" in household and other 
fires. So I'm not terribly surprised that the bodies would show high cyanide
levels. That's quite common if the death is from smoke inhalation.

Perhaps what we are after is a sensibility towards _refined emotions_.  

Refined emotions are developed through exercising careful thinking.  Some
tools to help achieve a level of _refined emotions_, at our current
transhuman stage, are achieved by acquiring the ability to replay situations
accurately, monitor information input, simulation of information, obtaining
feedback from others and utilizing error-correctoring.  These are mental
exercises.

Rather than putting a chain on or caging our emotions, we might think of
exercising the management of emotions.

IAN: CS manufacturers such as Aldrich Chemical Company of Milwaukee, 
Wisconsin state in their official company literature on CS, that when 
burned CS emits toxic fumes, such as hydrogen cyanide and hydrogen 
chloride. The Aldrich company also states that if water is poured 
on burning CS, a lethal cloud of hydrogen cyanide can be released.

Even more, the toxic and flammable agent methyl chloride, used in 
Waco to cause the CS dust to become suspended in the air, when burned
releases extremely toxic phosgene gas (Trial transcript: 5735, 5756, 
5916, 5921). (BTW, I'm told that the trial transcripts are now on 
the web but I do not know the URL, a search should uncover them.) 

There is even an aerial photo of the Mt. Carmel shortly after the fire 
breaks out, in which the whole center is in a cloud of white smoke, it's 
believed that this cloud is a phosgene-cyanide gas cloud. Both hydrogen
cyanide and phosgene gas were used in the Nazi's gas chambers before 
zyklon-B was used.  Waco, TX: Auschwitz USA. 

Also, a report by Amnesty International confirmed that CS and CN gas 
had lead to the deaths of over 40 Palestinians, including 18 babies,
who had all been exposed, like the Davidians, to tear-gas in enclosed 
spaces. As a result of this report, American manufacturers halted 
sales of tear-gas to the Israeli govt (The Davidan Massacre, p.294-5). 

It must be that the CS you dispersed was simply carried up quickly by 
the radiant heat of the flame rather than actually burning and thus 
releasing toxic fumes. I would imagine that you may still have 
had low-level cyanide exposure.

   I Play the Game

I love to play.

I am learning to play 
with more and more 
of my world.

I play around 
with whatever resources I have,
seeing what I can do with what I've got.

My play is my creativity and my intellect 
working together,
learning how to more accurately 
create what I want for myself

My mind grows 
and I become more intelligent as I play.

I play with the world 
and learn how things work
and learn what I'm capable of.

My current playing trains my mind 
for more challenging levels of play.

My talents keep blossoming
as I create and engage in new, 
more challanging games.

My games train my mind,
and I become a more powerful player of games.

My life is my game,
and I am working on 
being a master player of my life,
to be skillful in fulfilling my desires.

That is the object of the game, for me;
to fulfill my desires more and more effectively,
to keep improving myself
and becoming more skillful in creating 
the situations and experiences that I want.

Reality is my playground 
and my workshop.

I develop the skills and tools required 
to create and alter my reality

When you say _all_ our sensory input, if you're talking about all the
nerve signals in your body and all the endocrine signals and so on,
you're talking a huge amount of data.  Of course, most of that wouldn't
be very interesting, and most of it never gets to the brain, let alone
long-term memory.  Data reduction is non-trivial and emotions (or at
least the brain's limbic system) seem to play a big role in deciding
what is important enough to go into long-term memory.

<Also, would it be possible to go back into the brain and retrieve all
our old memories in sequence and then be able to play them back and
reexperience them?>

Brain surgeons have been able to bring up all sorts of old memories in
people under local anaesthesia when stimulating various parts of their
(cut-open) brains.  Those having the surgery say it's just like
reexperiencing the event.  However, I doubt very much if it's possible
to retrieve memories _in sequence_.  Our memories seem to be stored in
something more like a hypertext web than a sequencial database.  I think
we'll have to wait for digitized uploads before we could play back and
rexperience events of our lives in any kind of controlled manner.
However, there are alot of yoga and other types of disciplines that have
the goal of reexperiencing one's life in meditation in order to flush
out any karmic kinks; BUT, the key word there is *discipline* - it takes
alot of training and dedication (and I'm not sure, even then, if some of
the memories aren't being fabricated on the fly).

<possibility of being able to communicate realtime feelings or stored
memories direct to another
individual with a brain-computer-brain interface?>

Communicating real-time feelings, at least in some generic sense, is
probably already feasible. When I say 'generic', I mean that you could
feel if I was happy, sad, etc.  Now, if I'm happy because the realtime
experience has reminded me of some happy memory from my childhood, I
doubt if it would be feasible to communicate that to you, at least not
in realtime - there's just too many convoluted, reentrant mappings
between concepts in our brains to do this in realtime, if at all.

BTW, the latest _Mondo 2000_ is full of articles on this type of stuff
(I just picked it up yesterday).

Actually, I think Natasha just pointed out that the average age was 30. This

Very interesting idea! Why didn't I think of this post! We all already
realize that the universe is merely a computer for which life runs on with
genetics (the code) the laws of physics (the processor).  I wonder how far
we will transcend or raise the bar of quality and complexity in this session?

Perhaps this is the answer to our Great Filter thread? Maybe sometime in our
near future we discover how to create a baby universe and we enter it and
break off from the rest of the universe which is why there is no one out
there to communicate with. We would have transcended out of our current
universe into a baby universe where we define the laws of physics and just
like a programming language, create a new programming language more powerful
than the last one much like the transition from coding assembly to C++ to
better versions and other specialized languages. I wonder if the previous
civilizations that coded our current universal kernel added any remarks into
the code as a signature.

It would be _very_ interesting to see what these ancestor universes would
look like! Perhaps there is an infinite stream of baby universe upon baby
universes behind us? Or is it finite? I wonder how the first universe would
look like? Probably we wouldn't be able to visit it because no form of life
could exist there.

Sensory deprivation?!?! I think a incremental upload would feel like a box
implanted in my back w/a plug for a network connection and tendrils of an
uploading organism slowly work through my brain replacing neurons with
itself and rebuilding the neuron structure in a virtual world with all
connections same as before all during a period of a few months and i
wouldn't feel any different until my entire brain was uploaded and i made
the decision to flip off old sensory equipment and stick inside the virtual
world perminently although i could still control my old body remotely or by
uploading myself to the surgically implanted box in my back. The neuron
connections in the virtual world would need to be slowed down for the
brain's timing but can accelerate to any desired rate once completely
uploaded. I believe that a gradual incremental upload will be required so
you can 'grow' into the computer rather than merely having the original
person die and a duplicate reproduced inside the virtual world as would be
with a quickie nano upload. The brain is not a static object and thus cannot
be uploaded as if it were.

A rough estimate (I don't have my books nearby) of the sensory input is a
a few gigabits per second. [The human visual nerve has around a million
axons, firing at around 1000 Hz, and the spinal cord is on the same
order]. That would give an estimate of around 10-100 gigabits for one
minute storage. However, I am sure this can be decreased quite a bit, both
because there are inherent correlations that can be compressed, and
because other estimates give lower values (they are in the megabit range,
and have support in the literature). Of this information, most would be 
touch and vision, with smaller amounts of auditory information and a 
trickle of taste, smell and other senses.

Hard. Episodic memory doesn't seem to be stored in any nice, sequential 
manner in any particular region of the brain (although some regions are 
of course more important than others); it is likely that our memories are 
distriobuted over large parts of our neural nets, mixed with each other.

Besides, we do not remember sensory information. What we remember is 
rather our reactions to them, our elaborations, associations and actions, 
not exactly what happens. Memory is actually very unreliable, and 
continually recreated. 

[Yes, I'm studying cognitive science right now. I'm planning to write an 
"Owners Guide to the Human Nervous System" when I get the time]

Feelings might be transferrable, at least the basic data of arousal, 
activity in the mesolimbic regions etc; if combined with higher-level 
means of interaction I think we could transfer quite a bit of our 
feelings this way. 

Memories are much harder, as explained above, and the same goes for
cognitive structures. Language or verbalized thought might be a
bottleneck, but it is easy to transfer. Our personal mental languages are
so different that they would be incomprehensible (Can anybody guess what a
certain scaly, golden scorpion-like fractal that the viewer flies along
represents to me?).

While I agree with you that gradual uploading is probably the way to go, 
I disagree with this somewhat. A living brain is indeed too messy to 
upload while it is working (ever tried to repair a motor that is 
running?) but a cryonically frozen brain would probably be ideal for 
uploading: the process may take as long as it needs to, and can work both 
destructively and with very high precision.

But nobody knows yet what the uploading experience would feel like, and 
it will quite possibly be extremely different from sensroy deprivation.

Hans Moravec describes one model in _Mind Children_, where the experience
most of the time is quite normal, until the robot surgeon says 'Mr Snapp,
you will become virtual now' and you suddenly wake up in a virtual
reality. 

Gradual uploading would be extremely different from this, and uploading 
from a cryonic state would also be quite different. The result, an 
emulated mind living in a virtual world, would probably more easily be 
modelled by using a very good virtual reality.

Perhaps, but I think it would rather reinforce them ("I don't want to 
live in eternal sensory deprivation!").

Theorized, yes. But that doesn't mean they will work; even fairly
well-understood (!) methods such as wormholes might be infeasible. There
are even theorems that demonstrate that by manipulating spacetime, we
cannot get out of our future lightcone, although we might be able to FTL
inside it. 

It is easy to say that there is always a way out - but the burden of 
proof is on you.

It might be possible. But that doesn't change that in our current 
spacetime there are conservation laws and limits we do not know how to 
work around. We might be able to do it, and we might not.

Hence the decentralization. There is a different atmosphere working for 
each other rather than working for some faceless 
state/corporation. Plus, with jobs rotated, everybody has the 
opportunity to clean toilets, just as everybody has the opportunity to 
serve as delegate to whatever conferences of comunities held. If you do 
something that you consider important, you'll do a good job. Plus 
scientific progress would increase through a better education system that 
educates all, rather than those who can afford it.

We may have to alter our lifestyle. Start using grain alcohol, solar 
energy, alternative sources of energy and materials. We can use space to get 
a virtually endless supply of materials. We can do this because we would 
pioneer technologies that are more beneficial, rather 
than more profitable. Corporations would stop dumping huge amounts of 
grain and waste materials. Once we get nanotech, the possiblities are 
endless. Once you get past the waste, there is plenty to maintain our 
standard of living for all.

No, you give the factory to those who work in it. The workers no longer

Maybe you'll have to ask permission to build your house. You can't 
arbitrarily go out and use public resources without asking. Not going 
through some crazy bureaucracy, but raise it at the next comunity meeting 
or whatever. If it doesn't interfere too much, chances are you'll get 
permission, and everybody will respect your property rights.

The advantage of the commune system is that  one can leave and join 
another commune that works more appropriatly to your beliefs. Of course, 
it's going to be very hard to oppress somebody when they can leave to a 
place where they actually have a say. So you'll have a commune of 
capitalist owners with nobody to employ. Works for me.

Ever notice how the most staunch defenders of capitalism are the ones who

The good part is, you can leave, so nobody will 
get angry at you. Just pick up and go join someone else before people get 
pissed off at you.

Well, actually I don't know for sure that they would deny it.  
Why don't you call them or send them e-mail?   I'm surprised that 
no one has done this yet.

In other words, I could be pulling your leg.  Obviously, this has been 
a possibility all along.  That's what makes it a real test.  You don't 
know that there is an AI on the list.  You only have an assertion 
that there is an AI.  It's up to you to decide whether this assertion is 
true or not.  You're on your own.  Why does that bother you?  
Why do you keep trying to peek behind the curtain?  

The fact remains that you have not stated unequivocally that 
all the posts on the list are written by humans.  

Are you willing to state, on the basis of your own judgment, that the 
posts attributed to "Chris" are written by Chris?  Likewise for "Dan," 
"Damien," and everyone else.  If you are not willing to make such a 
statement, why not?  

To repeat:

It is winning a stunning victory.  The AI has totally fooled everybody,

Hi, folks

Shortly after my last, rather sardonic note to the extropians list, I
started receiving the following brown goo downpour.  I certainly hope it
wasn't the work of an irritated list member (especially given the cowardly
refusal to disclose his/her identity), but unless it's a purely random
attack I can't think of any other source.  If anyone has advice on this
dismal behaviour, I'd like to hear it.

Steve quoting Bertrand Russell:
<Logic is, and by rights ought to be, slave to the emotions.>

On Sunday, October 20, 1996 4:59AM, Ira Brodsky wrote:
<You falsely divide the world into "logic" and "emotion."  What about
knowledge? [snip] You are clearly better off if your premises come from
understanding, not emotion.>

I think Steve's point is that logic and emotion are *both* components of
higher-level constructs like knowledge and understanding.  How is this a
false division?

May I suggest another division? There are both rational and irrational
emotions.  In a slightly different way, there is formal knowledge and
annecdotal knowledge.  Rationality has both completeness and consistency
aspects.

Your response seems to be an emotional reaction to Russell's quote:  A
justifiably visceral reaction (which I share) to 'good things' (logic,
rights) being yoked to 'bad things' (slave, emotion).  Your reasoning,
that Russell's statement is foolish, is _correct_ in so far as it goes
(using your understanding that emotions are too often irrational); BUT,
it's probably not _consistent_ with Russell's context - Russell was
probably using 'emotion' to refer to 'good' emotions, like loyalty,
charity, love and the aspects that QueeneMuse mentions:
<with emotion you can create. You can generate. You can luminate. With
emotions you can fulfill and enrichen. You can move and you can soar.
[snip] In a well balanced, non reactive type B person, most emotions are
useful ... If emotions have a bad rap in the world, it is precisely
because people think they are at the mercy of them.>

To which Ira responds:
<I think what you are really saying is that, contrary to Bertrand
Russell, emotions can be a good thing *if* they are tamed by reason and
understanding.>

This could be just as one-sided as B. Russell's 'reason slaved to
emotion'.  Emotions can also effectively constrain reason (in warning
you what it is worthwhile to apply your logic to) and inspire
understanding.  This sounds more like what QueeneMuse and Steve W. were
getting at.

As Natasha Vita More added:
<Rather than putting a chain on or caging our emotions, we might think
of exercising the management of emotions.>

My point is that value-free logic doesn't exist.

That quote from Bertrand Russell is so startling and powerful because it
comes from a mathematical genius, someone who knew as much about logic
as anyone in human history, and yet had a rather difficult time
harnessing the emotions in his own personal life. (This from a Wall St.
Journal review of a Russell biography that I saw within the last few
months.)

If 99/100 civilizations did this with *all* their members (with no

These authors are not talking about the same thing at all.
Here we are talking about computing stuff unrelated to the easily
observed behavior of the physical system, while they are talking about
computing this observed behavior.

I don't see the relevance of the initial conditions.  The initial
argument was that the bit sequences we observe in nature are what our
current understanding of communication design would lead us to expect
from advanced computers.  My counter argument is that the circuit
diagram is very far from what our current understanding of circuit
design would lead us to expect.  Yes, our expectations may be
completely wrong, but on the whole these observations can't be taken
as support for the view that everything around us is colonized.

No. that is not what I was referring to.

I think you have assumed that such a huge nanofog must be homogeneous.
Instead, it could support far more diversity and creativity and
exploration of new tech than could vastly smaller civilizations. 
And why need the actions of such a civilization be "pre-programmed"?

*BZZT*. Thank you for playing. 

Here's a trace of my parser at work:

"You" -- pressumably you mean "any thinking being", correct?

"are clearly"-- I take this to mean "would be undeniably"; fair?

"better off" -- hmm, I have a hard time with this one. Leave it as an 
unassigned variable for the time being, push it on the stack and move 
on...

"if your premises" -- in my reformulation, subjunctive: "were your 
premises".. but wait a minute here--what exactly is a premise, and 
how do I tell a premise from a preconception from a prejudice from a
Kantian _a priori_? Hmm, stack time again.

"come from understanding, not emotion" -- Whoa, red flag: parser error.
What does this mean? 

Premises, aka axioms, aren't officially _from_ anywhere.

The presupposition that there is no such thing as emotional 
understanding is totally unsupported. Further, the implicit notion that 
"premises" are _anything other than_ axioms, explanations or excuses leaves 
me utterly confused as to whether your utterance has any utility _or_ 
meaning.

In other words, "say WHAT?" :) :)

I would suggest, instead of a division, a gradation.

(snip of a post I agree with)

and... again, 
As Natasha Vita More added:
<Rather than putting a chain on or caging our emotions, we might think of
exercising the management of emotions.>

Yes!! and as exercise goes, this is one of the hardest muscles to exercise,
not only because the work may seem unpleasant- and may require therapy or
intense pain, but often because of the stigma surrounding the world view of
emotional weakness (especially men are not encouraged to admit they may need
some "emotional working out"). However, Emotional Intelligence is finally
gaining a place in our vocabulary ( EQ) and is actually being taught to kids
these days.
In the future, I, like Natasha, think rather than abolishing emotion, or
lessening it,  our "emotional landscapes" will become more rewarding, more
rich, more refined.

Subject: The Culture of AIs
Sender: postmaster@extropy.org
Precedence: bulk
Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

        For the past few weeks, there has been a considerable amount of
AI based discussion on both the transhuman and extropian lists.  Within
these weeks, I have pondered on whether or not the inclusion of AIs in
society is a good thing.  Well, I think I've come to a conclusion, but I'm
afraid it will be a little drawn out.  Bear with me, if you please.

        Recently, Lyle Burkhead has brought to light an AI testing procedure
called 'The Turing Test'.  Within his initial thread, he mentioned (rather
offhandedly) that there was --and is-- at least one AI
subscribed to the extropian mailing list.  This started a flurry of
conversation, including accusations and false admissions as well as some
cynicism.  Obviously, this 'revelation' shocked a lot of people.  I thought
about *why* this upset people, and I found the answer.  Having an
AI on the list would probably be accepted if people knew who the AI was. The
fact that list members have been led to believe that the AI is human are
ashamed at this 'Turing Test's' deceptive qualities.  What the 'test'
entails is that the AI must be a wolf in sheep's clothing --an AI with human
rationale.

        When one takes a look at all the species on this planet (and I'm
sure throughout the universe, as well) he or she will be able to distinguish
one specie from another by more than just the physical differences.  Take a
look at a mayfly: they live for about 24 hours.  Their sole purpose is to
reproduce...they are even born without mandibles.  Take a look at a human:
we live for about 75 years on average, and we have multiple purposes; a
purpose for each minute of our lives.  Now a mayfly isn't expected to
emulate human qualities, nor is a human expected to emulate a mayfly's
qualities (though for some...:-)).
The whole reason is because we have different cultures.

        Back to my main topic.  Every manufacturer of AIs that I know of has
one intention for their brainchild (pun intended): for it to be as smart as
a human.  Not only as smart, but to virtually have all human
characteristics.  *This* is the reason I am slightly dismayed to see an AI
being disguised as a human on the extropian list.  I realize that human
hands and human minds create the AI *but* I think that an AI is denied its
own culture when it is programmed to imitate humans.  Until an AI can have
its own 'lifestyle', it is merely --as its name says-- artificial.

        So far, we're stuck in a bit of a rut.  Today's AIs have no
individuality, they have their programmer's individuality.  AIs have no
culture, they are expected to fill their programmer's culture.  They have
guidelines that they are 'programmed' to abide.  (I could also make the same
argument for most humans, but that is a whole different topic!)  Let's go
back to the 'Turing Test' idea.  If there *is* an AI on the extropian ML,
it's been doing a good job of emulating humans, but a very bad job of
maintaining its own culture.  The test is just giving motivation for
'cloning', and in my opinion, creating a lesser being.

        All in all, I agree with the concept of AIs.  I truly do.  But until
they can sustain their own culture, until they can have at least some
semblence of individuality and\or originality, I have no use for AIs.  I
*am* optimistic that the ideal (to me) AI can and will be created within a
few decades.  When computers can have their own little conversations with
each other in their native tongue.  Maybe it sounds a bit silly, but
hey...why not?  Anything can happen.

I'm just interested in the general senses for recording. How much bandwidth
do our senses produce? And again, how large would a 1 minute sensory
datafile be?

The organism isn't static either and would be engineered to keep apace with
the brain. Besides, genetic engineered or 'wet' uploads will likely come
before 'dry' nano uploads and I want in ASAP. With a static brain you're
left with nothing more than a duplicate or digital clone of you. I don't
want a clone living for me! I want to be in the virtual world! I'm willing
to bet most common people would agree that gradual uploads are the way to
go. Thats just my opinion.

Why would gradual uploading be different? All you need to do is leave the
sensory input channels for last and then ask the individual when they want
to go virtual. When they go virtual they'd instantly see a virtual world
layed out before them. I must admit, the feeling of suddenly becoming
virtual would be cool and merely the thought would probably release
endorphins in the virtual brain due to the idea that "You can do ANYTHING
now" and that no laws of physics hamper you! Damn that would be cool! I'm
getting stoked just thinking about it. :) You people better start
considering what type of environment you want to wake up in as a digital
being or homo digitus :)

If _we_ are our ideas than do ideas require self-awareness consciousness? I
got an idea from reading the book Snow Crash which was the idea that all
primates were not self-aware originally and that as they're brains increased
in size, they learned to use tools but the ability to use tools was a meme
and these memes spread across the land and became more and more complex and
actually fueled the use for the mutation of a larger brain size. What I'm
saying is that increasingly complex memes fueled the increase in brain size
and not the brain size fueling the increasingly more complex memes.
Therefore consciousness spread like a plague across the land. Also if apes
can learn memes than are they self-aware?

There is evidence, I believe for Subconscious memes. For example, yawning is
contageous (sp?) and also you begin to subconsciously pickup and use certain
body movements or gesjures (sp?) the people you associate with frequently.
(Is my spelling crap right now?) Sure, memes can be broadcast via language
but can they be transmitted subconsciously through body movements or perhaps
even phermones?

Perhaps there are two extremes dealing with ways people deal with emotions
because logic creates maturity. I know people of both extremes which are
very intelligent and logical  in their jobs or when analyzing but have
little control over emotional outbursts in their social life and i know
people who are very mature in their social life with great control over
their emotions (they can take alot of shit) and have average intelligence.

*BINGO!*

Having a choice about what emotions to feel is reportedly a big part 
of certain cultures. It is quite uncommon in many parts of the world.

My personal explorations with alternativs to disthymia (sp?) have 
convinced me that the Hedonistic Imperative is in line with optimal 
use of the current squishwae I'm limited to. Check out 

http://www.pavilion.co.uk/david-pearce/hedethic/hedabhed.htm 

and related links.

Now, I think that "negative emotions" are sometimes kind of like 
hunches--us trying to tell us something we perhaps have been ignoring 
or don't want to hear. Ergo, la-di-da soma-dosing is not anything I'd 
advocate. But emotional stuckness is still stuckness, and subclinical 
depression is not objectivity, it's subclinical depression. :)

BTW, note to whoever was asking, I think the de Bono book you wanted 
was titled (The(?)) Mechanism of Mind. I haven't read it as such, but 
I'm sure a lot of it has seeped into his later books. It's 
interesting to stack that model up side by side with Minsky and Jung 
and even Freud (gasp!) and Reich (double gasp!!) -- and them look at 
it all through evolutionary-psychology-colored glasses. :) :)

I found it at a Borders Bookstore but I think any urban bookstore with a
large selection of periodicals should have it.  It's a hard magazine to
classify so I'm not sure what section you look in.  The cover is deep
blue, with MONDO in unusual lettering across the top and two futuristic
female models with silverized hair.

Charles Ostman, the Mondo science editor posted to this list re: Neural

tried the mondo2000 one but it was awfully slow (probably alot of

Some of the tech articles include:

P.S. There's also a fascinating interview with Mark Pesce, co-inventor
of VRML, where he talks about "cyber ecology" and VR on the World Wide
Web:
<The idea is to take the original database - which is the planet - and
establish a superstructure for people to recreate the planet

if you went to almost *any* bookstore they would have it. Are you on a

Come on.  The reason I am not willing to make such a statement is that I
(like most people) don't have the time to carefully read and analyze all
50+ posts per day.

If you can assure me that during this experiment the AI is operating
completely on its own, and the "real person" is not permitted to post to
rescue the AI from giving itself away, then I can describe a test that
would resolve this question (assuming all of the humans cooperate).

The fact the "AI" is using a borrowed identity also suggests it has some
serious weaknesses.  Really, what you are telling us is it is imitating
someone -- not "thinking" for itself.

Hmmm.  I don't see the difference between "rational emotions" amd my

Ha, ha.  And I suppose if I insist we must agree A =82 A is false to hold a

=46irst, while I agree that statements may be misinterpreted out-of-context,
we have to be careful about invoking such claims.  E.g., argue with a bible
student and watch everything flip back-and-forth between literal (stands by
itself) and figurative (requires context).  Admittedly, I haven't checked
the context of Russell's comment, but it is structured like an aphorism, so
I shouldn't have to.

If we are wise, we choose who we love and who we are loyal to.  Emotion
might tell use who seems like a good candidate, but great literature is
largely about how we are so easily and often mislead.  Still, if love is
made slave to reason and understanding, it can be a very good thing.

I've never suggested you can derive inspiration from logic alone.  And I
agree logic must be applied *to* something.  Perhaps I should say emotion
must be ruled by reason, understanding, and knowledge.  But I clearly don't
want to "emote" loyalty to someone and then apply logic and understanding
to better serve them; I want to use logic and understanding to first
determine who deserves my loyalty.  In other words, my loyalty is
*controlled* by these higher functions.


>As Natasha Vita More added:

Sounds like she agrees with me.  <g>

Seriously, I am not saying we should put away our emotions, just take
control of them.


>My point is that value-free logic doesn't exist.


Lots of things are not value-free, but logic (strictly-defined) is.  For
example, A =3D A is not contingent upon your or my values.

Hmmm.  He said logic should be slave to emotions, and he had a hard time
harnessing his own emotions.  Isn't there a pattern here?

SCIENCE NEWS (10/12/96) reports on research published in 
the LANCET (9/21/96) conducted by chemists at the Univer-
sity of California, Davis, which shows that cocoa powder 
-- a.k.a. chocolate -- contains  powerful  antioxidants.  
In fact, 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder contain as much 
as 146 mg of antioxidants, while a 1.5-once chunk of 
milk chocolate contains 205 mg.

The high levels of potent flavonoids and other antioxidant 
polyphenols in cocoa explains why a chocolate bar,  while 
being high in fat, does not go rancid when unrefrigerated.

So crank-out some antioxidant rich red wine and a that bar 
of chocolate and live it up -- ah the joys of life extension.

That depends on what you mean by "write".  No formal thesis anywhere,
that I know of.  The temporary godlings of "True Names" took over
much of the world, but that's a standard cyberpunk cliche.  I think _A
Fire Upon the Deep_ and _Marooned in Realtime_ would have the most
examples of perversion warfare.  At the end of _Fire_ prologue the
Blight has no weaponry, but has already perverted the human ship's
computers, so It is able to sabotage the escape internally.  And it
perverts lots of Beyonders later.  More to the point, Beyonders refuse
to take messages in High Trade languages directly, but translate them
into duller tongues (such as the ones we know) because of the
possibility of perversion through such messages.  (Presumably High
Tongues are semi-automatic languages like Java or Word macros, and
nobody wants to deal with Trojans from a Power.)  The point being that
it seemed to be a common form of warfare to pervert other's systems.
And the entire climax of _Marooned_ centers on someone having perverted
most of the systems -- and he was a relic from an age where such was
common industrial espionage/warfare.

I too have had repeated, excessive exposure to CS gas.  Unlike, the above 
described NBC gas chamber,  many of my experiences were delivered via 
grenades producing clouds so thick I couldn't see my hands in front of 
my face.  I never suffered any ill effects (beyond those you would 
expect) and eventually built quite a tolerance to the stuff.  

However, the burning dispersal system on military grenades is a 
fairly temperature controlled environment.  It heats it enough to 
vaporize and eject the CS, but not usually hot enough to cause 
decomposition of the material.  This may have been the difference 
with the Waco incident.  The internal temperatures of that complex 
would have easily exceeded the decomposition point for CS.

Also, it is known to be technically possible to produce a fatality with CS.  The 
difference between military CS and the more civilian CN tear gas is 
that CS is a mixture of CN (non-lethal) and small quantities of 
another chemical weapon that is known to have lethal properties.  
Excessive exposure to the second component could kill you.  I don't 
remember the name of the second component off the top of my head, but 
it dates back to WWII or so.

The second component is added to give the normal teargas more kick.  
CN causes burning and tearing and that's about it.  The second 
component causes severe nausea, cramps, etc. and generally makes you 
have a bad day.

I hope the following is more interesting that my previous
school-marm-grammarian post to this thread. :)

I originally posted this notion on rec.arts.sf.science a while back, and now
wonder if anyone here would care to play?

Here's my original post, and a follow-up to someone's reply:

-----------------------------
Subject: 
            The Very Fast Evolution Machine 

(...which is a nod to Ian Watson's wonderful short story title, `The Very
Slow Time Machine'...)

Frank J. Tipler developed the nice idea (in THE PHYSICS OF IMMORTALITY and
earlier in his co-authored THE ANTHROPIC COSMOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE) that an
effective AI deity might [even must] emerge in the final nanoseconds of the
Big Crunch.  I like this notion a lot (having ventured close to it in my
novel THE JUDAS MANDALA) and I've been wondering for some years if the
obverse might also be plausible.

In the earliest femtoseconds or whatever of the Big Bang eruption, with time
effectively multiplied to infinite speeds but slowing fast - that is, vast
numbers of exchanges occurring almost instantly in a densely compacted
and connected spacetime where all the forces only `slowly' decoupled - might
not there be effectively time enough for a superintelligence to evolve from
scratch?  Even a whole batch of them, but perhaps they would inevitably
remain merged until the cosmos was big enough for light-transmission delays
to disrupt module communication...  Rather Gnostic, put that way.  Demiurges
tumbling from the furnace of the Big Bang, cast out into the freezing dark.
Perhaps placing their impress upon the new regimes of matter and light.  Yes,
*now* there is a god... but that was then.  What of now?  Would such Blishian
angels still have any impact on the universe?  More to the point, is their
evolution, as sketched, remotely possible given current physics?

Jay Thierry Han wrote:

I responded:

Not all that similar, I think, although I see what you mean.  And of course
Blish's THE TRIUMPH OF TIME does it with a sort of baby universe shaped by
Amalfi's ontological codes. And Stephen Baxter's sequence starting with
TIMELIKE INFINITY also has a battle for the shape of the universal substrate,
as does his THE TIME SHIPS (the sequel to H. G. Wells's THE TIME MACHINE).
None of these,
I think, contains my key postulate: that just as the Tipler Eschaton has an
effectively infinite number of discrete clock ticks within which a `god' may
Do All Things, so too does the initial Hawking-smeared 10^-43 secs.  The
question is: could anything structured emerge under such appallingly volatile
conditions, however many virtual steps or epochs it contains?  It's one thing
to persist into the Big Crunch, using shear energy etc; presumably it's quite
another for `life' to bootstrap into existence under the same conditions.
*Or is it?*

Sometime when your in a large lecture class, or where ever you find a 
large group of people being quite, cough in one short loud burst &  
note how many people follow suit.  I agree,  these things seem to be
contagious(sp?), but I hesitate to call coughs and yawns memes.  These 
things don't replicate as much as they bounce off whatever 
trigger mechanism that controls these reflexive behaviors.  I would 
liken a cough spreading through a room to a neutron starting a chain 
reaction in a fission reactor.

Pheromones (yes, your spelling is attrociou(sp?) :-)), and body language  
could be involved in a process that is more like replication.  However, I 
think going any further will bring up a discussion about definitions, and 
I don't know enough pheromones or replicators to comfortably continue.

By the way, I've been evolving for 26 years.

Up and Over!

So, you are still trying to find some test *other than* the Turing test.  
You admit that you can't resolve this question by reading the posts.  
You are still trying to peek behind the curtain.

A lame excuse.  You don't have time to read all the posts, but you do 
have time to set up some other test which requires "all of the humans" 
to cooperate!  

It's interesting to me that you think you would have to read and analyze 
*all* the posts every day.  Why?  Can't you put some of us into an 
"obviously not AI" category, so you would only have to scrutinize the 
others?

Whether it has weaknesses isn't the point.  We all have weaknesses.  
The question here is whether the AI can successfully participate in 
the discussions on the list without giving itself away.  So far it has 
succeeded brilliantly.  Nobody has a clue about who it is, and most 
people seem to take it for granted that this is merely "Lyle's game,"    
as Hal Finney put it.

How do you know what it does when it's not posting to the list?

Oh, now this would be _really_ interesting! Imagine we visit a planet in
which there are two different civilizations constantly at war with each
other. Perhaps this has occurred in our primate past before we 'grew a
brain'. Is there any evidence for this?

Seems to me that SRM is merely a kind of displacement which answers no
questions. See my comments earlier on a similiar notion of USS's
(Universal
State Strings)  Though these provide a description of how histories
evolve there is little explanatory value here, and nothing as far as I
can
see which relates to our experience of consciousness.

Perhaps not. "I feel, therefore I move?" Don't forget,
in *fiction* the android artificial intelligence, 
painfully living in a loveless, emotionally blind state, 
is always searching for emotion... if they FEEL 
something, laugh, love, cry, get angry ..whatever...  
they pass the true test of being sentient....

Hmm, as far as I know, all cultures have had the common cold too. Maybe a 
clogged nose is the key to AI? ;-)

No, but you should be ready for some silliness.

More seriously, I think the Snow Crash meme/religion/consciousness idea 
is intriguing, even if I don't believe in it. Religion doesn't seem to 
help cognition much, but helps provide an emotional framework. Maybe we 
should see it as an early and somewhat odd cognitive tool?

Well, this depends on how wide your definition of meme is. I would rather 
say this is a transmission of behaviors rather a transmission of 
cognitive structures, so they are not really memes, but something 
simpler. Perhaps an analogy could be the difference between viruses and 
replicating chemicals.

I doubt pheromones have high enough bandwidth, but body language can 
definitely transmit memes (for example, in a group somebody can transmit 
the emotion-meme "I dislike this person's smell" by body language, and 
others can repeat it). Pheromones can however make transmission efficiacy 
much better.

	How about through allegories also?...explains the power of fiction
and the Bible...etc.

	The "meaning" or "moral" of the story can be transmitted without
the necessarily conscious awareness of the recipient.

We know that apes are probably self-aware. G Gallup made an experiment 
where a chimp were anesthetized and a red spot was placed on its face. 
When the chimp awoke, it was handed a mirror. Seeing its face, it tried 
to rub off the spot, which implies that it knew the mirror image was 
itself. Thus we can expect that chimps have a self-model.

See Gallup, G. G. Jr (1979) Self-awareness in primates. American 
Scientist 67 417-421 [I love when I actually got a bibliography nearby!]

Gallup also did this with small children, and found that self-awareness 
appears during the second year of life (Gallup, G. G., Jr. & Suarez, S. 
D. (1986) Self-awareness and the emergence of mind in humans and other 
primates. In J. Suks & A. G. Greenwald (Eds.) Psychological perspectives 
on the self (Vol 3). Hillsdalem NJ: Erlbaum.).

I think memes are more important in building up our minds than creating
our consciousness, which seem to be a mental construct. One should also
remember that consciousness is not the same thing as self-awareness: 
people with dissociative disorders may be conscious but lack clear
self-awareness.

Want to bet? The technological problems of doing a 'dry' upload are very
complex, but 'wet' uploads add another level of complexity since they have
to act in a dynamic system (immune responses, synaptic plasticity, the
actions of glia cells, sudden head movements). If you have the technology
to do a 'wet' upload you can do a 'dry' upload.

Yes, most people would like to be gradually uploaded. But we might not be 
able to choose this option, if uploading/nanotech/biotech turns out to be 
hard, or we die before. In that case cryonics is the only chance (unless 
you believe in the Tipler Omega Point). 

The clone question is just a matter of personal philosophy. You might 
dislike the idea of an identical clone living your life, I don't since I 
identify myself with what I *do*, not what I *am*.

Mostly in _Across Realtime_ (especially in _Marooned in Realtime_, the

A perversion war would be *fast* on a planet (and the chilling thing is 
that many nations are gearing up for it - information warfare is HOT 
right now), and probably would be over quickly - leaving more normal 
kinds of conflict. If the enemies were 100 ly apart, then it would take 
too long to hack into somebody from afar, so agents have to be sent into 
the enemy system (which is a very uncertain prospect unless you are a SI).

SLIGHT SPOILERS: An interesting take on this is the Meme Wars in Barnes'
_Caleidoscope Century_: memes (Barnes' version) are AI systems able to
transmit/translate themselves across operating systems, including into the
human nervous system (shades of _Snow Crash_). These memes started out as
weapons of religious warfare, but quickly began to mutate and take control
over regions. Each meme fought the other memes and sought more hosts, both
by infiltrating the media, contagion or direct coercion (the protagonist
was part of a mercenary team working for a meme). Finally a meme invents a
distributed model of itself and begins to turn humanity into a kind of
borganism (individuals still exist, but they all run the same memes).

:-) Exactly. In fact, JPEG uses some knowledge of the human nervous system
to throw away information during compression so that the subjective change
is minimized (we are more sensitive to changes in brightness than in hue,
so the YIQ color model uses more bits for the illumination channel than
the other channels, and since noise is mostly of high-frequency those
components are thrown away first in the lowpass step).

Actually, people *believe* they recall events much more clearly, but they
do not recall them more accurately (Pettinati 1988; Register & Kihlstrom
1987). And it has been shown (Sheehan & Statham 1989) that some of the
'memories' that are recalled are actually created during the hypnotic
period due to inadvertent suggestions or facts implied by the questioners.

This is a problem, since so far we have not developed a good inter-person

Maybe the same reason you don't nuke untrustworthy people - too

The big problem is gene therapy - so far we haven't been able to whip up
the elixir, so to say. Most vectors are just virsuses able to change a few
cells at a time, and that is not very useful (at least not for the
"novelty" gene). Of course, with the right doctor and money, you could
still try it, but gene therapy in the brain is tricky (a modified rabies
virus with retroviral code? Chilling...).

No, not yet. But I think it is possible today to modify alleles in

You call it "slaving" . . . I call it "working".  Would you rather the "poor

off the work of the "rich".  But that could even be a problem:

2.  What if you need help?  Hire people to help you.  Oh, I'm sorry you
wouldn't want THAT!  Then you would be a slave master.  Right?  According to
you anybody who helps someone else is a slave and the person being helped is
a slave master.  Even if the "slave" gets paid and becomes rich.  

This is what I'm getting out of your statements.

You have hit on a very good point: 100% decentralization.  Here is the idea.
. . 

The greatest idea I've ever heard is when people realize that:  We Are All
Self-Employed.  We all work for ourselves.  Your are _right_ we should 100%
decentralize all the way down to the individual self employment.  When we
take this optimistic view,  we stop working as a "slave" or working "for"
anyone else.  Nobody works even for "each other".   We ALL work for
_ourselves_ NOT for ANYONE ELSE.  NOT EVEN for "our fellow man".  

Working for "our fellow man" is also slavery, right?  Working for a a
faceless corporation is THE SAME AS working for a mass of unknown and
possibly lazy "fellow men".   

I finally agree with you on something.  Thank you for this wonderful
decentralization idea.  The only problem is you did NOT go FAR enough.

Then why do the people who were working in, what an American defined as, a

had a choice and chose to join another one?  It is because THEY don't define
"sweatshop" the way Americans do.  They resent the "do gooder Americans" for
taking their jobs away.

The "sweatshop" was paying better than any other job they could find in their
country.

  You can't (or won't) see _any_ other options in our vast and diversified
world today?  You are very pessimistic if you can't see other alternatives.
  I guess farming is too "low" for you to consider.  I don't know of any
place on Earth a person can't be a farmer.   But, I'm sure you'll bend over
backwards to (pessimistically) find a place where you can't farm.
 Antarctica?  Ok, how about hunting then?  . . . Don't want animals to get
hurt.  Gathering?  . . .Too messy.  The only think left is your benevolence.
 Hail to the benevolent King.  Your plan doesn't empower people to help
themselves.

People should not accept your addicting benevolence if they want to be self
empowered.  Instead:
I think: Everybody on Earth works for themselves.  WE ARE ALL SELF-EMPLOYED.
 This means personal responsibility to the people your customers.  For a

your co-workers, supervisor, buyer of your labor, husband, wife, friend,

Then are you referring to mechanisms like Vickery's auction and your own

And why need the actions of such a civilization be "pre-programmed"?>

True, such an expanding nanofog wouldn't be homogeneous *if* it allowed
diversity and creativity.  But the discussion with Forrest Bishop gave
me the impression that such a civilization would need an almost
totalitarian control of its members in order to "hit and run" and avoid
detection (low profile scenario), OR just to maintain its momentum and
keep everyone committed to the 'pave it over', bigger-is-better strategy
even if some might prefer to drop out and become independent agrarian
planet huggers.  As you wrote (Friday, October 11, 1996):
<Within any system, keeping the quiet is a public good, so a strong
central policing might be required to enforce it.>

By "pre-programmed" I was thinking that such a civilization would
require a strict constitution and would use only approved designs in
order to be 'optimal', rather than let market mechanisms, technology and
cultural modes continue to evolve spontaneously.  Would such an
optimized and designed civilization have any use for evolutionary
algorithms (like random mutation and cross-over) or would these be
considered too inefficient for the public good once optimized mechanisms
have been established?

I fail to follow the reasoning behind that whole Hanson-Bishop

Perhaps the latest story to explore the scenario of Earth being invaded
by AI-driven nanites is Ian McDonald's 12/95 novel _Evolution's Shore_.
It starts with anomalies being observed in the outer solar system, soon
followed by probes which land on Earth and begin spreading a
cotton-candy-like nano-goo called 'Chaga', particularly in poorer parts
of the Earth like Africa.  The story follows an intrepid reporter,
scientists and bureaucrats as they all try to find out what the Chaga is
up to and take advantage of it.  In the end, all sides end up taking
advantage of each other (the Extropian approach?)

<Demiurges tumbling from the furnace of the Big Bang, cast out into the

In _Mind Children_ (one of the appendixes, I think), Hans Moravec
provides a model of the universe as a spherical gas bubble where time
runs more slowly toward the center, due to increased mass and gravity,
while interactions speed up towards the periphery due to higher
frequencies.

Moravec suspects that we live in the (Slow-Zone?) 'V world', where
volume or space dominates our activities, but there may be more advanced
entities dwelling in the 'F world' transform (Transcend?) of our
universe where frequency dominates:

<As our universe gradually expands, the wavelengths of the background
radiation increase. As the wavelengths get longer and longer, the
relative rate of time flow in the F world slows down. Any inhabitants of
F would be ideally situated to practice the 'live forever by going
slower and slower as it gets colder and colder' strategy proposed by
Freeman Dyson ["Infinite in All Directions", 1988] ... In the past,
shortly after the big bang, when the universe was dense and hot, the F
world would have been a lively place .... The first microsecond of the
big bang could represent eons of subjective time in F. Perhaps enough
time for intelligence to evolve, realize its situation, and seed smaller
but eventually faster life in the V space.>

Also of possible interest for this thread, is Rudy Rucker's 7/95 _Wired_
(that's the one with the egghead picture of Richard Dawkins on the
cover) interview with Russian physicist Andrei Linde, now at Stanford,
who is involved in simulations of a fractal, self-replicating,
inflationary universe as opposed to the more orthodox Big-Bang
scenarios.

Linde talks about scalar and vector fields and how the Higgs field
creates "domain walls" within our universe such that there could be
slightly different instantiations of the laws of physics within each
domain.  While Linde thinks it is possible to create "baby universes",
he believes that the only way we could move into them would be by
encoding ourselves into their physical laws and then letting them evolve
independently.  He says there is no way to pass between universes or
communicate with other universes except by creating them and encoding a
message in their physical laws. He suggests that "our universe was
created not by God, but by a physicist-hacker".

Sorry, but I can't resist this note to plug my article in the current issue
of Rage (November): "Is God A Computer Nerd?". You'll find Rage somewhere
near Penthouse.

The article is an interview with Hans Moravec on the very topics you mention.

Your post also reminds me that Hans new book, Mind Age, still hasn't
appeared. Hans had said that he would publish it on the web if he couldn't
reach a satisfactory agreement with his publisher. I'll ask him what's
happening and report back here.

I'm done with reading them I dump them to an Archive folder where they sit
and I can go back to them if i wish. It makes it easy to cope with any noise.

All cultures around the world and as far back as recorded history and data

the key to AI? 

(Note: I'm still considering if this is too crazy an idea to post)

I say:
Hmm. Well, there *is* an old rule of thumb that says, e.g., for 
vision systems, you *want* them to be fooled by the same optical

So how close is this analogy?

When designing AI why is the aim automatically toward logic rather than
emotion? Emotions obviously came first! Why don't they try to create an
intelligence with horrible mood swings and a pinch of logic and have it sort
things out for itself.

If you think in terms of sociobiology and the survival value of shared
beliefs within a tribal system, religion makes a lot of sense, but
indirectly so. Ie, the function of religion is not its content.

BTW, the same can be said of emotions...

The organism is living inside your head feeding off of your blood like a
paracite while it replaces neurons with organic pointers to locations of
stored data inside the virtual world. A neuron impulse would bounce neuron
to neuron to organic pointer where it would then disappear and continue it's
path through the virtual neuron circuitry inside the virtual world. Neuron
impulses would bounce between real neurons and virtual neurons seamlessly
until the entire brain had become converted. Explain the actions of glia
cells though.

Mose gas grenade designs with which I am acquainted do indeed use the

Most also (in the fine print) say not to use the device in an enclosed area,

Both HCN and phosgene have tolerable-but-bad-for-you dose levels.
BTW, an electric spark would probably make a lot more phosgene than 
an open flame would--the open flame would tend to break the phosgene 
molecule down further via combustion.

There are other ways to look at this.  A sufficiently advanced 
civilization could enclose the solar system in some kind of shell, 
so we would think we were looking at uninhabited stars and galaxies 
out there, but in fact we are seeing what is presented to us.  

This could result in mindfucking on a grand scale.  Somebody out there 
is having fun, presenting us with information that just doesn't compute, 
such as stars older than the universe.  

But then, what do I know about mindfucking?  

For an advanced civilization, advanced enough to live unnoticed 
in the dirt under our feet, it would be a trivial matter to subscribe 
to this list...   But if you don't even believe there is an AI on the list, 
there is no use going into THAT question.

First of all, thanks to Twirlip of Greymist and Anders Sandberg for 
the references.  I don't read much SF but I think it's time to check out 
Vinge.  

I posed the question, 

:: What if the civilizations are not 100 light years apart?  What if they 
:: are on the same planet?    

What I'm getting at is that Vinge may have been using allegories to 
write about something that is already happening, right here on earth, 
and has been happening for a long time.  Television, for example, is a 
perversion attack.  

Anders writes, 

> A perversion war would be *fast* on a planet (and the chilling thing

I don't think so.  Memetic warfare is anything but fast.  It takes 
centuries.  

I guess most people haven't been on the list long enough to remember 
the "memes (propagationism)" thread.  Monotheism has been 
attacking other memes for almost 3,000 years.  The war isn't over yet.  
The outcome is far from clear.

The wealthy people I currently work for are really down-to-earth common
people who got wealthy by creating food, cosmetic, pharmaceutical and
nutritional supplement companies.  I work for companies who employ hundreds
of thousands of people.  The owners are not greedy at all.  They pay well for
my services and we are both happy. 

The first company I worked for full time had 40 employees in 1979 and 80 in
1987.  The company was started in the 1940s and still had many of the
original employees in 1987.   The owners could not have had such a low
turnover rate by being greedy.  They were successful and in eight years
(1979-1987) they went from 21 million to 200 million in sales.  The sales per
employees was (21 million /40 employees) 5,250,000 in 1979 and (200
million/80) 25,000,000 in 1987.

Why were the employees so productive?   The owners were NOT greedy and the
employees knew it.  We all worked as if  WE were the owners of the company
(self-employed).

I've started studying linguistics, and started with Ernst Cassirer's
_Language and myth_ on the grounds that it was short.  I think that he
was saying linguistic and mythological development were somewhat linked
in the 'discovery' of concepts and classes.  Myth starts with isolated
events and things that awe the viewer; moves to somewhat generalized
functional gods (god of first plowing, god of sowing, god of second
plowing); and thence to more personal and anthromoporphized gods.
Actually I don't think I can well-represent the other side of his
argument, so I won't mutilate it, but considering how animist I was as a
child while considering myself atheist, I wouldn't be shocked if
something religion-like was a part of breaking up the world into things
to perceive.

A slight clarification: he was talking about the fourier transform of the 
universe, not "the real thing" (which he modelled as a spherical 
spacetime with gas?).

This fits in with platonic materialism (which HM accepts), and Greg 
Egan's ideas in _Permutation City_. Advanced life may exist in a 
distributed fashion across the entire span of spacetime, moving towards 
the (distributed) regions where transcendence is possible.

Doesn't *doing* presuppose *identity* presuppose *existence*?  Do you 
identify yourself with only the top of this hierarchy, as actions 
independent of the being to which they are ascribed?  Am I reading to 
much into your words!?

I ask b/c I too place great value on my actions-- Becoming as opposed to 
mere existence.  However, I am not inclined to leave my being-> 
identity behind. 
The person that performs my actions has spent great effort to become this 
being (that I call "me"), one whose actions are progressively more 
effective and rewarding. (please pardon my pronouns!)  The person who 
decides what goal to pursue and what actions to take in its pursuit is 
the one who defines their worth (actions and goals). That Beings purpose 
is to Become.

Ego.

Up and Over!

Economists don't focus much on systems described by differential

Some people try to explain why the universe looks dead by saying there
are lots of folks out there, but they are all hiding for fear of being
attacked by others.  The point of our discussion is to analyze if this
is a plausible and self-consistent scenario.  We are not advocating it.

While central control might be needed to keep people quiet, little is
lost by letting people drop out of the expansion quest at will.

Central control seems far more likely to perpetuate worse designs, so
allowing diversity seems a clear winning approach to expansion.

So, you are still trying to evade my question.  You admit that no one will
substantiate your claim that there *is* an AI on the list.  You are still
hiding behind a curtain.

The only remaining question is whether Emporer Lyle is wearing any clothes,
or is just a pile of silicon.

A false response.  I never said I had time to set up some other test; I
said I could *design* such a test.  (Perhaps a language recognition error?)

Why? Because I don't follow all of the threads, so there are some
individuals' posts that I rarely if ever read.  (Only a computer would
assume otherwise.)

I get it.  An AI "has succeeded brilliantly" even though it may be merely
imitating someone, and from time to time that someone posts directly to
save the AI from revealing itself.

Gee.  Why not just claim there is an AI that has achieved consciousness,
but it's too busy writing its memoirs to be subjected to public scrutiny?

Really, I would like to believe there is an AI on this list performing
"brilliantly."  I have no reason to doubt this will happen sooner or later.
But I do have a problem with your evasion of simple and fair questions.
Until an appropriate authority confirms there is an *AI* on this list --
which would be revealing absolutely nothing more than what you have already
claimed -- then I'm not going to give a thought to trying to figure out
"who" is the AI.  Real people sometimes post very terse messages, or say
things that seem off-target or even stupid, and we could (falsely) accuse
them of being an AI.  Given the current state-of-the-art, that could be
taken as an insult.

But if there is an AI here... it must be you.  Not because you are
succeeding brilliantly, but because you evade simple questions.  That can
be done with far less than human intelligence! <g>

Pope Accepts Theory of Evolution
4:54pm EDT, 10/24/96

VATICAN CITY - Pope John Paul II has lent his support to
the theory of evolution, proclaiming it compatible with
Christian faith in a step welcomed by scientists but likely
to raise howls from the religious right. 

The Pope's recognition that evolution is "more than just
a theory" came in a written message he sent Wednesday to
a meeting of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, a body 
of experts that advises the Roman Catholic Church on
scientific issues. 

It broke new ground by acknowledging that the theory of
the physical evolution of man and other species through
natural selection and hereditary adaptation appeared to
be valid. 

Though the Pope made clear he regarded the human soul as
of immediate divine creation, and so not subject to the
process, his remarks brought banner headlines in the
Italian press. 

"Pope says we may descend from monkeys," the conservative
newspaper Il Giornale said on its front page. La Repubblica
said the Pope had "made peace with Darwin." 

The theory of evolution, most notably expounded by 19th
century English naturalist Charles Darwin, had until 
now been viewed by the Catholic Church as serious and 
worthy of discussion but still an open question. 

"It is indeed remarkable that this theory has progressively 
taken root in the minds of researchers following a series of 
discoveries made in different spheres of knowledge," the Pope said. 

"The convergence, neither sought nor provoked, of results of 
studies undertaken independently from each other constitutes 
in itself a significant argument in favor of this theory." 

The theories of Darwin and other evolutionists about man's 
origins were for long anathema to theologians, who saw a 
conflict with the biblical account of creation in the Book
of Genesis and the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. 

Most theologians no longer believe that the doctrine that God 
created the world and made man in his own image and the theory 
of evolution stand in each other's way. 

But fundamentalist Christians who take a literal approach to 
Genesis, known as "creationists," have recently reopened the 
controversy, especially in the southern United States. 

In Tennessee, where teacher John Scopes was famously fined 
$100 by a court in 1925 for teaching evolution in his class 
in what became known as the Monkey Trial, a bill that would 
have banned teaching evolution as fact was only narrowly voted 
down in the state legislature earlier this year. 

The Vatican's first substantive response to the theories of 
evolution was contained in an encyclical, Humani Generis, 
written in 1950 by the Pope Pius XII. 

It cited no objection to discussing evolution while cautioning 
that the theory played into the hands of communists eager to cut 
God out of the equation. 

Pope John Paul II has previously endorsed the 1950 document. 
He said Wednesday its essential point was that "if the human 
body has its origin in living material which pre-exists it, 
the spiritual soul is immediately created by God." 

But he also said: "Today, nearly half a century after appearance 
of the encyclical, fresh knowledge leads to recognition of the 
theory of evolution as more than just a hypothesis." 

The Pope's acknowledgement was welcomed as a significant advance 
by scientists, even though some said it had come late. 

"It will allow many Catholic scientists, who have been engaged 
for some time in research on human evolution, to continue their work 
without any censure or difficulty," said Francesco Barone, a 
leading Italian scientific philosopher.

Research announcement: A new cryptanalytic attack on DES

                 October 18, 1996

                     (DRAFT)

In September 96, Boneh Demillo and Lipton from Bellcore announced an
ingenious new type of cryptanalytic attack which received widespread
attention (see, e.g., John Markoff's 9/26/96 article in the New
York Times). Their full paper had not been published so far, but
Bellcore's press release and the authors' FAQ (available at
http://www.bellcore.com/PRESS/ADVSRY96/medadv.html) specifically
state that the attack is applicable only to public key cryptosystems
such as RSA, and not to secret key algorithms such as the Data Encryption
Standard (DES). According to Boneh, "The algorithm that we apply to the
device's faulty computations works against the algebraic structure used
in public key cryptography, and another algorithm will have to be devised
to work against the nonalgebraic operations that are used in secret key
techniques." In particular, the original Bellcore attack is based on
specific algebraic properties of modular arithmetic, and cannot handle
the complex bit manipulations which underly most secret key algorithms.

In this research announcement, we describe a related attack
(which we call Differential Fault Analysis, or DFA), and show that
it is applicable to almost any secret key cryptosystem proposed so far
in the open literature. In particular, we have actually implemented
DFA in the case of DES, and demonstrated that under the same
hardware fault model used by the Bellcore researchers, we can
extract the full DES key from a sealed tamperproof DES encryptor by
analysing fewer than 200 ciphertexts generated from unknown cleartexts.
The power of Differential Fault Analysis is demonstrated by the fact
that even if DES is replaced by triple DES (whose 168 bits of key were
assumed to make it practically invulnerable), essentially the same attack
can break it with essentially the same number of given ciphertexts.

We would like to greatfully acknowledge the pioneering contribution
of Boneh Demillo and Lipton, whose ideas were the starting point of
our new attack.

In the rest of this research announcement, we provide a short technical
summary of our practical implementation of Differential Fault Analysis of
DES. Similar attacks against a large number of other secret key cryptosystems
will be described in the full version of our paper.


TECHNICAL DETAILS OF THE ATTACK

The attack follows the Bellcore fundamental assumption that by exposing
a sealed tamperproof device such as a smart card to certain physical
effects (e.g., ionizing or microwave radiation), one can induce with
reasonable probability a fault at a random bit location in one of the
registers at some random intermediate stage in the cryptographic
computation. Both the bit location and the round number are unknown
to the attacker.

We further assume that the attacker is in physical possesion of the
tamperproofdevice, so that he can repeat the experiment with
the same cleartext and key but without applying the external
physical effects. As a result, he obtains two ciphertexts derived from
the same (unknown) cleartext and key, where one of the ciphertexts is
correct and the other is the result of a computation corrupted by a
single bit error during the computation. For the sake of simplicity,
we assume that one bit of the right half of the data in one of the 16
rounds of DES is flipped from 0 to 1 or vice versa, and that both the
bit position and the round number are uniformly distributed.

In the first step of the attack we identify the round in which the
fault occurred.  This identification is very simple and effective: If
the fault occurred in the right half of round 16, then only one bit in
the right half of the ciphertext (before the final permutation) differs
between the two ciphertexts. The left half of the ciphertext can
differ only in output bits of the S box (or two S boxes) to which this
single bit enters, and the difference must be related to non-zero
entries in the difference distribution tables of these S boxes.  In
such a case, we can guess the six key bit of each such S box in the
last round, and discard any value which disagree with the expected
differences of these S boxes (e.g., differential cryptanalysis). On
average, about four possible 6-bit values of the key remain for each
active S box.

If the faults occur in round 15, we can gain information on the key
bits entering more than two S boxes in the last round: the difference
of the right half of the ciphertext equals the output difference of
the F function of round 15.  We guess the single bit fault in round
15, and verify whether it can cause the expected output difference,
and also verify whether the difference of the right half of the
ciphertext can cause the expected difference in the output of the F
function in the last round (e.g., the difference of the left half of
the ciphertext XOR the fault).  If successful, we can discard possible
key values in the last round, according to the expected differences.
We can also analyse the faults in the 14'th round in a similar way.
We use counting methods in order to find the key.  In this case, we
count for each S box separately, and increase the counter by one for
any pair which suggest the six-bit key value by at least one of its
possible faults in either the 14'th, 15'th, or 16'th round.

We have implemented this attack on a personal computer.  Our analysis
program found the whole last subkey given less than 200 ciphertexts,
with random single-faults in all the rounds.

This attack finds the last subkey.  Once this subkey is known, we can
proceed in two ways: We can use the fact that this subkey contains
48 out of the 56 key bits in order to guess the missing 8 bits in
all the possible 2^8=256 ways. Alternatively, we can use our knowledge
of the last subkey to peel up the last round (and remove faults that
we already identified), and analyse the preceding rounds with the same
data using the same attack. This latter approach makes it possible to
attack triple DES (with 168 bit keys), or DES with independent subkeys
(with 768 bit keys).

This attack still works even with more general assumptions on the
fault locations, such as faults inside the function F, or even faults
in the key scheduling algorithm.  We also expect that faults in
round 13 (or even prior to round 13) might be useful for the analysis,
thus reducing the number of required ciphertext for the full analysis.

OTHER VULNERABLE CIPHERS

Differential Fault Analysis can break many additional secret key
cryptosystems, including IDEA, RC5 and Feal.  Some ciphers, such as
Khufu, Khafre and Blowfish compute their S boxes from the key material.
In such ciphers, it may be even possible to extract the S boxes
themselves, and the keys, using the techniques of Differential Fault
Analysis.  Differential Fault Analysis can also be applied against
stream ciphers, but the implementation might differ by some technical
details from the implementation described above.

Check your locale for a provider of Sensory Isolation Tanks. Here in
Santa
Cruz you can rent one for $20/hour. Here is the URL of a manufacturer of
same,
about $5000. You can also build one, cost around $500....

I doubt if many here would dispute that Capitalism is the closest we
get at present to a politico-economic system that supports individual
freedom.  It's unfortunate that its name contains the word "Capital"
though, as that is going to make it appear very dated quite soon if
things go as predicted.  We need a word that expresses the ideas of
free trade and individual responsibility without tying it to what will
become merely a funny historical concept before long.

Well, I know I was extremely left-brain oriented earlier, but that might 
have changed the last years.

Anyway, I think we should be aware of that the left-right distinction 
isn't as powerful as it sometimes is said to be. It exists, but it is 
very individual and might be better seen as a practical metaphor.

I can remember a little of my early childhood, and it feels rather alien 
to me. I can at least recognize some of the traits of my current self in 
my memories from five years and forward, but the earliest fragments 
belong to a very different kind of being. No doubt I will say the same 
thing in a thousand years too about this era...

Yes, but the kind of warfare Vinge (and I) talk about is not about memes, 
rather computer viruses, cracking codes, trojan horses and taking over 
operating systems. This could be very fast if AI, expert systems and 
genetic algorithms are used.

Of course, memes could be used as well. Many classic cracks has been done 
using "social engineering", where the crackers played on the psychology 
of the victims.

You can see this very cleary in the Egyptian myths. Their creation stories
are very confusing and contradictory, while the layer of myths explaining
how the cosmos works are much more obvious. And after the battle of Set
and Horus the gods become downright personal, and gradually merge with
recorded history (The vizier-architect-priest Imhotep even became a god
after his death).

Hmm, maybe we need emotional support or meaning to be build better
cognitive maps of the world?

Hehe!  "Rightful owner", that's rather funny.  It's nothing like as simple
as you paint it, David, and the pro-property position is just as logically
unsound as the comunal position may be distasteful.  There are no intrinsic
rights and wrongs in this, only accommodations made between people.

Take a very common situation as an example of the fluidity of the concept
of "rightful ownership".  Say you have a car, fully paid for.  Sadly, you
did not pay your local council tax, and the bailiffs come and take your
car away.  What gives?  Surely you were its "rightful owner" (tm), and no
act of petty local government can change that!! :-)

Actually, there is of course no such thing as intrinsic ownership of
anything, not even our bodies nor ideas.  We're simply in possession
of some items for the while that circumstances or other people permit.
Even individualists realize that, despite being distinct individuals,
they are also part of a universe within which "ownership" of atoms or
atomic arrangements is a hilariously ridiculous notion.

A good reply from Suresh to John, I thought, even though I am aligned
with John's general aversion to collectivism.  Our Capitalism has many
good things, but it is also a rod for our backs because it also has many
bad things.  The trick is to throw away the bathwater but not the baby.
Suresh very nicely highlights where the bathwater ends and the baby starts.

To put it another way, anarcho-capitalism is not Capitalism, because AC
is constrained by the individual freedom of all.  Having gobs of cash
doesn't override that constraint, except perhaps for a short while until
the fury of the scorned AC bunch lets rip.  Capitalism would be severely
constrained in such a world that no longer places capital on a pedestal.
The effect on Capitalism's dogmatists will I expect be quite funny.

Yes indeed.  And as I'm sure many will have noted, 100% decentralization
results in exactly the kind of individual freedom and responsibility that
we have been talking about in the threads on individual freedom.  Since
politics is ultimately about coercion, it's not really surprising that
we're back to this subject.  (Please let's discard the rose-tinted notion
that "nice" western capitalist democracies are not about coercion:  just
try stepping outside of the accepted envelope to find out how "nice" and
open-minded they can be.)

Capitalism and Socialism can be both just as bad as each other when
viewed from an individualistic perspective:  one doesn't have to look
far afield in the world to find bad examples of each, so one shouldn't
attribute good or bad to one or the other on the basis of examples.

At the end of the day, any system of government that believes in a
collective standard is inherently coercive by design, and that applies
to all existing forms of government.  In general, the only collective
unit that will perform in the way that meets one's own need is oneself.
And that of course is the basis for denying government altogether.

Rich.

I was going to write:

>   No!  You're *all* AIs, and I'm the only live human here!

And then suddenly I realized the truth.  We're all AIs ...  :-)

'Come to think of it, that's not entirely a joke.  As far as we know,
nature doesn't actually create intelligence, but only an infrastructure
that can develop intelligence through interacting with its environment.

In that sense, Mankind develops its own intelligence, so it's artificial
despite being implemented on a biological substrate.  There's more to
this than just a play on words, because if that view is true then we are
only a few short steps away from creating an artificial substrate which
can develop intelligence in the same way as we.  The neural technology
is more or less here already, especially now that multi-valued systems
are no longer frowned upon except by a few academics, so all we need is
micro-scale replication (nano not needed in principle, but possibly yes
in practice) for such substrates to become practicable.

Question:  has the AI community run a learning neural automaton long
enough to simulate even a fraction of the learning process of a typical
child by the age of (say) three?  I think I know the answer ("No", by
several orders of magnitude because of the computational requirements),
but confirmation or denial from within that community would be useful.
Of course, even that computational epic would probably fall short of
producing a child mentality, but it would provide useful information
towards that goal.

I'll be in London the first week of November and will be free Sunday, 3
November.  If any UK extropians/transhumanists would like to get together,
perhaps we could rendezvous at a pub mid- to late-afternoon.  Please e-mail
me at both of my accounts listed below if you're interested and we can work
out details.

Because no government AFAIK has ever said "find an alternative supplier
for the services we provide and we will reduce your taxes accordingly."
Even the hard-right, allegedly Capitalist governments are shown to be
basically coercive socialists as soon as state taxes are threatened.

Belief that Republicans or Thatcherites are free-market Capitalists is
about as well-founded as belief in flying pigs.  Politics and freedom
are practically mutually exclusive, in the sense that politicians are
more or less by definition in the business of regulation, which is the
denial of freedom and emergent order.

IAN: So does virtually every toxic agent. Physical evidence most 
strongly suggests, to say the least, that the Davidians got doses 
well over safe levels. As the Amnesty International study I cited 
confirmed, over 40 people were known to have died from just CS and 
CN gas exposure, in cases before Waco where these compounds did 
not even burn. The FBI's heavy gun-fire into the center as the 
fire started, also tends to suggest that many received fatal 
doses of bullets.

And consider that since the FBI had cut-off the electricity, the 
Davidians where using fuel lamps for both heating and lighting. They 
also had all the windows covered with thick blankets to hide from FBI 
snipers,  thus they had to have lit fuel sources for light all day long,  
and the FBI was well aware of this. Nevertheless, they began pumping in 
flammable agents -- which when burned, release lethal agents -- and at 
the same time began knocking over the house. It doesn't take a rocket 
scientist to see the imminent catastrophe being manufactured here. 

Clearly, the FBI's actions were at the very least, negligible homicide. 
Instead, it's billed by the GovtMedia -- and thus encoded into the 
public mind -- as at worst just another govt snafu, and at best 
a valiant effort to save the lives of crazed suicidal maniacs.

It's important for Extropians to have and remember the information 
of what happened in Waco because it is an example of how the govt 
has, can, and will use force and disinformation to snuff-out 
alternative communities, which Extropians may one day create.

IAN: That is logical: all notions of rights and ownership, 
are, like all notions, merely mental fabrications. 

However, some notions and their application as rules of human
action prove to be more effective than other notions in reaching
a given set of desired outcomes, such as technological progress.
The theoretical system of private property rights proves most
effective as a means toward technological progress, which
in turn improves the welfare of the majority.

Perhaps the most scientific measure of "ownership" is that X
owns Y where X controls Y.  The Earth owns us all, the galaxy 
owns the Earth, and the Universe the galaxy. But at the smaller
end of things, "I" own my body, or my body owns my body, because 
my body controls itself. Or more clearly, my body owns itself
to the degree that it controls itself. By extension, my body
owns those things in its external area that it controls,
or manipulates. In this sense "ownership" is not "a 
hilariously ridiculous notion" as you suggest.

Interesting. Both Lyle and Anders have objected to my scenario of
the "transcendence" of an SI by takeover of the internet by a program
that uses the computing resources to augmemt its own intelligence.
This scenario occurs in Vinge's "True Names" as the result of a defense
against a perversion attack. One of my underlying assumptions is that
the internet is vulnerable to such an attack, and that the first atacker
will win. It isn't really a war at all. Further, the result may not be
negative.

Too "be here now" conscious. :-)

Of course, I could just say "art" and wait to see what happens, but then I
would be relying on someone or something else to give me meaning.  Or, I
could say "is" and be a verb with no aesthetics.

I'll stick with life is art which includes being and doing. Or better yet, I
am art.  There.

It's much more fundamental than that:  property *is* merely a contract,
albeit usually unwritten.  In the greater scheme of things nobody "owns"
anything, but in our small-town grubbing about in the dirt, property is
seen as a useful accommodation (ie. a contract) between people at a time
of constrained resources.  It won't last though.  Tomorrow, if you want
my estate, world, or galaxy, I'll give it to you, perplexed at why you
should have such an odd affectation.

Unfortunately, it's a legal web too.  If the woodsman goes off and lives
off the land, sets up his solar-powered laptop and then sells his solar-
generated power (or his computing facilities) to his neighbours, then
the hand of State will grab him by his profits, even if they're zero.
Try to ignore it and, ultimately, if you try to protect your personal
standards, a pile of armed troopers with "legal" status will blow your
brains out.  Law is only reasonable if you live within the envelope set
by the law-makers, but step outside of it and reason no longer comes
into it, let alone freedom of the individual.

Law and freedom are, despite the best intentions of advocates, in practice
at loggerheads.  It doesn't have to be so, as it's quite easy to conjure
up laws that do not preset standards but merely enshrine an individual's
rights to his own values;  unfortunately, today's lawmakers seem quite
unable to grasp that concept, possibly because it entails a reduction in
their power.  Whether this impasse can be overcome before that power is
rendered inoperative by the effects of nano or net crypto is a matter of
debate.

It seems to me that in the long run 100% decentralization would
result in the disintegration of the individual into freely roving
subcognitive computational elements. Are you sure this is the kind

Chris, engineers ARE artists.  They are artists who love great precision in 
their work.  They design their machines and structures according to their own 
aesthetic parameters, to fulfill certain functions. 

The left-brain / right-brain duality is innappropriate, really.  Each side of 
our brains has it's own things that it's more specialized to do, but for most, 
if not all tasks, both sides of the brain are active.  Splitting apart left 
and right sides of the brain or separating intuition and logic are 
innappropriate, because that's not the way things really are.  Our intuition 
is a type of logic for dealing with incompete data and finding likely 
connections between the data and making reasonable inferrences from incomplete 
data.  More formal logic is mainly a matter of following the rules of the 
game, and the games of formal logic were created, based on people's intuition 
of how things work and what is reasonable.

There is no dichotomy between {creativity, intuition and art} and {logic and 
engineering}.  Logic is a form of art, an expression of people's values, an 
expression of themselves.  Logic is a more refined and narrow form of 
intuition, used for dealing with more complete sets of data. 

Logic and engineering are particular types of art, just as painting and 
sculpting are.  Everything humans do is a type of art (some more refined, to 
my taste, than others).

You see, Chris, I am someone who has a great interest in creating things in 
many areas of art, icluding mechanical engineering, graphic arts, computer 
science, music, philosophy, drama,  mathematics, writing and physics.  So I 
wouldn't fit anywhere in your classification scheme of 'artists' vs. 
'engineers'.  I am both.  I want to express my personal values and desires 
through many different media and through many different modes of thinking.  
Sometimes I like to express my values through music, sometimes through 
writing, sometimes through sculpture, sometimes through mathematics, sometimes 
through philosophy, and there are many other forms of expression that I enjoy 
engaging in.  Many dichotomies that people make are inappropriate to make 
because they don't respect the real state of things, and I think the 
left-brain vs. right-brain dichotomy is inappropriate.

Last night I thought of a phrase which struck me as being very Extropian.

"Question Tradition"

I think that's a lot of what we're doing, as Extropians.  We are questioning 
tradition.  We question the tradition of death, we question the tradition of 
coercion, we question the tradition of ignorance and servility, we question 
the traditional belief systems and paradigms, we question the tradition of 
blind obedience to Authority, and we question all other entropic traditions.  
When we question these traditions, we find much about them that is 
incompatible with our extropic goals.

As Extropians, we prefer to find new, more effective ways to accomplish our 
goals, rather than clinging to traditional ways of doing things which don't 
work well enough.

To be a verb is to deny the stagnation of fixed state.  I like it.

Hey, I can't argue with that, especially after Nadia's description of
the Freeland event.  With such art among us, even blinkered scientific
types like me will see the light I expect, in the fullness of time.
I look forward to it.  The only horizons worth having are those that
expand.  The end of the rainbow is the right metaphor.

Onwards!

Dan, the problem I see for your scenario isn't that it may not arise at
all (quite the opposite --- I think that learning neural/fuzzy AI automata
will see the light of day long before strong nanotech), but that when/if
it does arise then it will be subject to the same constraints that have
dogged Mankind since the dawn of time, namely the limits to growth that
result from lack of atomic-level control over matter.

That's why I see the knee of the high-order curve that leads to the
Singularity happening after nanotech, rather than after emergence of SI.
Having said that, the order may be irrelevant.  Over an appropriate
timescale (less than geological :-), these two events are likely to
coincide, if one believes in reductionism and the direct emergence of
AI once an appropriate artificial neural substrate is available.  Heck,
we're nearly there now, even without nanotech.  Interesting times.

Rich.

Hrmmph!!!  Since when has the scientific method been able to say anything
about "ownership"?  By all means let's discuss ownership, but please leave
science out of it.  It's not within its scope.

No it doesn't.  The great power-being Polkadot The Meaningful owns
everything.  So there!  :-)

I'm afraid it is.  "Ownership" is meaningless except as an accommodation
between people.  If you were my slave then I would "own" your body
despite the control you have over it.  There really isn't any future in
reasoned argument about intrinsic rights of ownership, because the whole
area is founded on a figment without substance outside of human society.

Yes, it's a useful concept in society today, like God was for thousands
of years.  However, there is only partial intersection between the sets
of what is useful and of what has substance in the universe.

Rich.

How true.  This brings up the theory that art is dead as presented by
supporters of Marcel Duchamp and the Dadists, Italian Futurists as well as
Actionists.  _Art is not dead._  Art has simply changed - mutated.  The
necessity for "objects of art" is outdated.  As presented by Allan Kaprow
(primary Happening artist and author of _The Blurring of Art and Life_), art
is everywhere.  As presented by Conceptualists, art is thinking. The
historical concept of art has changed.  Modern art has changed.  We are in
the era of electronics and computers and virtual realities.  Our beings have
changed.  We are no longer humans.  Our sense of self has become more
refined, just as our emotions are becoming more refined.  We can embrace
objects of art, or not.  Our choice.  The point is, there is a choice.

>(snip) ... classification scheme of 'artists' vs. 
>'engineers'.

This is another example of outdated classifications and stiffling art.  I'm
currently reading _Iterations: The New Image_.  It is a collection of essays
by artists who are also engineers, and a series of images which portray
interactive computer generated designs as well as installations.  

Also, a good book to read is _Art & Other Serious Matters_ by Harold
Rosenberg which grasps the cultural influences on the field of art
criticism.  The last chapter is "Art is a Special Way of Thinking."

In that art communicates knowledge, why not an engineer.

makes no more sense than E. Shaun Russell's diatribe on AIs somehow
having their own culture.  If there is an artificial entity which has

Yes, that's the idea of the Turing test.  And you are still trying to peek 
behind the curtain, instead of relying on your own judgment.  

The point of this exercise is to find a way to calibrate the idea of AI.  
If you have the concept in focus, then you will *know* whether you are 
talking to a human or an AI.  You won't have to look behind the 
curtain.

I'm beginning to wonder something. Usually nature goes with compromises
rather than one or the other so perhaps we will always have religion or some
sort of addictive philosophical meme and that perhaps we should begin the
attempt to merge christianity with extropianism and raise the quota of the
population who believes in optimistic, progressive and pro-technological values.

Are people biologically addicted to entropy? People seem to enjoy entropy in
the form of entertainment whether it be a party where you're required to
clean up afterwards, or media stories and movies about disaster. The Laws of
Thermodynamics require entropy physically but we can slow the entire process
down by uploading and thus creating less physical entropy. Think of it, is
evolution merely structured entropy?

Read the Bible's book of Genesis and thats pretty much how the uploaded
lifestyle would be. You could create anything spontaneously or rapidly
evolve it from a metaphysical goo just by thinking about it because an
algorithm could read your virtual brainwaves. You could then proceed to
create an entire universe, possibly one even better designed than we
currently have. Then you could proceed creating worlds with thousands of
living organisms on them. You could multitask your brain and create multiple
things at the same time dividing up the brain's timeslices for multiple
tasks of various sorts. You could keep areas of your universe private only
allowed to you or specified people such as friends and you could make parts
that are public like websites are.

_WOW_ this is one of the most catchy extropian memes I've heard yet and I
will definately pass it around. Great thinking David! I live my life by this
meme. It also sounds sorta x-file-ish akin to "The Truth is out there" which
is pretty cool and will likely encourage it to spread through the
population. I think we should consider now how we can spread this new meme
and promote it! I _do_ hope this meme spreads like a plague through the
populous.

Than perhaps you're flat out dead middle-brain? Which is of course the best
of both. Are you sure people use both but don't some people use one side
more frequently than the other or process more data on a specific side? This
explains why many math teachers can't draw worth #@%# and have horrible
spelling whereas many english teachers are horrible at math and science.
This also explains why left siders can be more introverts (tesla?) and right
siders more extroverts.

Hehe!  Or indeed, into freely roving cells, or perhaps chromosomes,
or DNA molecules;  or (shucks), give independence to quarks or strings!

Mind you, I don't think that this is what the original suggestion was
about.  We're talking about decentralization within human social systems,
which reach 100% decentralization once the unit of granularity considered
is the human individual.  That is indeed the kind of future I want to
work for.

Yes, and this is good, but the questioning has some way to go before one
can safely say it is even-handed:  transhumanists and Extropians have a
few sacred cows of their own, and questioning these areas of dogma gets
short shrift.  We all know what they are.  To be consistent in our hard
questioning may be too much to stomach, but I feel that one should at the
very least be open about it and declare certain areas as axiomatic, rather
than seeking to give weak justifications.  We owe it to ourselves.

Although there is much truth in the above, this unification is not helpful.

For the engineer, the aesthetic of fulfilling those certain functions is
very secondary to the fulfillment of the functions themselves, so much so
that the aesthetic is often totally submerged.  Yes, we often search for
(say) an "elegant" solution, but to a large extent this is just a heuristic
that we use because seeking elegance has yielded well-performing products
in the past.  To call engineering "art" just results in confusion;  it's
much more accurate to step back from unifying all of existence under "art"
and instead merely observe that engineers do employ quite a few techniques
that are not within the scope of the scientific method, and that some of
those could quite validly be discussed under the banner of "art".  That is
a more analytic and helpful view, and much less confusing.

IAN: By "scientific" I imply tangible physical measurement, 
or "materialist," as in "the materialist measure of ownership
versus the imaginary measure of ownership."

To that effect: to manipulate physical matter is control 
physical matter, and to control it is to own it.  

There may then be a theoretical system of "ethical" rules that 
govern the allocation of physical properties among various actors.
It's that system that we agree is but a phantasm.

IAN: So your saying that the physical fact that the Earth experts 
gravitational control over you, and thus, where control = ownership, 
the Earth therefore owns you, is equivalent to "Polkadot The Meaningful" ?? 
Have I made some reference to features external to physical reality ?
There seems an equivalence of fantasy and physical reality in your 
thinking, unless we're just talking past one another.

The distinction that seems to be missing in your counter is,

specifically, that we can verify that you can manipulate physical matter, 
yet we cannot verify the existence of any "Polkadot the Meaningful."
Ergo, the former "ownership" criterion is consistent with physical fact,
while the latter, "Polkadot God," is inconsistent with physical fact.

IAN: I suggest that physical matter exists, and its manipulation 
is the only logical measure of "control," and thus of "ownership," 
where " to control = to own. "

IAN: Rights are imaginations. The manipulation of physical matter
by a volitional being is a physical measurement of a rights claim,
and rights are measurable to no degree in excess of this physical
criterion.  That's what I refer to as "scientific" measure, but 
perhaps more appropriately it should be defined as a "materialist" 
criterion for the measurement of a rights claim.

There is no "right" greater than the right you claim, and 
your right is no more "real" than your ability to enforce it, 
no more "real" than your ability to manipulate physical matter.

That's primary savagery: if X can tackle an kill Y, then X 
owns Y.  It is *then* that a theoretical system of ethics may 
be conceived that will dictate what is the "just" enforcement 
of rights claims. And some theoretical systems will produce 
different outcomes than others,  and we choose the best
system of ethics based its proven physical performance.
I choose those systems that maximize individual liberty.

Even a "con artist" is an artist to the extent that he is

IAN: That is a logical distinction. We can say that the esthetic pleasure 
and the utility of given activities may be distributed across a fuzzy scale:

        U                A/E                E
        100-0           50/50           0-100
        |-----------------|-----------------|
        Utility                     Esthetic pleasure


Functions that are "artful" are those that tend toward 100% E.

Functions that are "utilitarian" tend toward all-U.

Functions that are fuzzy are a little of both, 
and most are fuzzy.

TO the degree that art has economic value, it posses a
degree of utility no matter how esthetic it is thought to be.
Where a given activity falls on this scale is purely subjective.

Yes indeed, it's all a matter of degree.  The aesthetic is practically
never discarded completely, after all.  Even in those few situations
where the aesthetic finds no place in the physical end-product of
engineering, the engineer can still take pleasure from the aesthetic
of work well done.

There is a continuum, as Ian indicates.  However, it's incorrect to
make utility and aesthetic pleasure the endpoints of the scale,
because it is completely normal for aesthetic pleasure and utility to
increase together rather than one increase while the other decreases.

These two figures of merit are functionally connected only in the state
space of the products that the engineer creates, and do not belong on
the same dimension, so they should appear on different axes.

I know that that was what you meant, but when you used "scientific" so
inappropriately then you were just asking to be corrected. :-)

That's just handwaving, of course.  Possibly quite reasonable handwaving,
but handwaving nevertheless, and lightyears from being indisputable, let
alone logically unassailable.  In effect all that you are saying is that
"I define ownership as direct physical control."  Fair enough, but you
shouldn't try to disguise such a personal view as a higher truth demanded
by logic.

It sure is, along with everything else about ownership and property.
You're letting your Capitalist leanings colour your usually sound logic.
I happen to agree that the system you and I support is probably as good
as it gets in today's world, but that view can stand alone on its merits
without needing to be bolstered by a handwaving argument.  Some phantasms
are useful;  that doesn't make them real in any physical sense.

Don't you dare question the teachings of Polkadot!  You will be

she has currently contracted out to the legions of devilbunnies,
and you don't want to mess with them. :-)

Yes, I know, we agree completely on the principle and why it works.
We only differ in you wanting to justify it first by associating it
with science and second by trying to give it the backing of hard logic.
That's a flawed and unecessary approach.  Just be pragmatic:  property
works in today's world, and that's a good reason for standing by it.

	I can remember much of my childhood quite clearly and have a
strong sense of continuity of self from then 'til now.

	Most importantly I remember playing on the floor with some toys
and getting my first glimpses of "me".....kinda like "wait a minute" who
is that?  Again, who is that?  I remember being quite confused by a
simultaneous awareness of the "me" and "outside things" beginning.

	Since the floor is definitely our 2nd house I must have been
around 2 years old.

	I have a few memories from our first house only, but only pictures
of the stairs to the upper flat, etc.

There's a big difference between imitating consciousness and imitating a
specific person.  The first requires some marvelously generalized
abilities.  The second could simply replay opinions and phrases collected
over a long time.

IAN: I'm not sure exactly how this ties in but, having fairly 
extensive lucid dream experience -- where, while asleep you 
"wake up" in your dream to realize, "Like woh, I'm dreaming, gee,
this is cool" -- up to the point of willful lucid state induction, 
I've observed the amazing phenomenon that one can, in the sleeping 
dream state, have a set of memories that even upon careful review 
appear to be 100% accurate and true to your non asleep life, yet 
upon waking are seen to in fact have been 100% false.

In short: the mind is able to instantly fabricate a rich and 
complex field of memories that are totally false, yet cannot
be detected by the observer whose apparatus of detection is 
irrevocably tied to that fabricating brain. 

In one lucid dream, I was in a room and decided to inspect as 
much of the dream, its structure and nature, as possible. Looking 
out through the sliding glass door on to a sun drenched backyard 
with swing set, I recalled my childhood growing up there. I "saw" 
and "felt" in my memory years of existence there, irrevocably 
interwoven with "who I am." However, upon waking up, I saw that it 
was false, that it had no correlation with Ian's life or childhood. 

Never the less, while I was "awake" in the dream, giving it my 
best critical examination -- what is this object made of, look 
at that TV, let's inspect its physical caricaturists, I'll write 
something down on this dreamland pad of paper, hay, the letters 
I just wrote are changing before my eyes -- knowing what I was 
seeing was a dream, and thus was a false world, I was still 100% 
duped into falling for the reality of a false set of memories due 
to the fact that I had and  WAS a mind full of fabricated memories
(in a way, an illusion cannot detect itself to be an illusion). The 
"truth" of the memories was as "true" as can be. I even thought at 
the time, "Clearly, while I'm in a dream, a false world, and some 
features, such as the changing letters I just wrote, prove 
it is a dream, the memories of my life are accurate." 
But they were not.

Some might speculate that I was having a "past life memory." I can't
disprove that claim. I can only say it seems equally plausible that,
just as the mind can instantly fabricate a "physical universe" in the 
dream state, that appears amazing real, it can also fabricate a mind 
connected to that universe with false memories just as easily.

Of course, logically, this must draw into question the 
reality of any mental phenomena, opennng the door to the 
ideation that everyting is a dream, or less to 100% true.

This can be true, but I wouldn't say it is the reason why an engineer would
be an artist if only for aesthetic sake.  We were referring to utilizing the
ability to think and imagine.

Again, "elegant" is a dressing, but not the thought behind a construction of
idea or product.

Only if your intent is to separate art from engineering.  I doubt that
artists who produce their work throught their engineering capabilities would
find this separation accurate.

Evolution left to its own devices takes a long time.  Web agents or 
"bots" could be designed to evolve at an accelerated rate, but even so 
it's a long, long way from viruses to the human mind.  

Anyway, all kidding aside, there is no AI on the list.  No matter what 
any authority says -- even if the President, the Pope, and Irv Rubin 
all say there is -- there isn't.  

A few days ago I wrote:

Of course you don't know, because you are operating independently.  Finding

Nope, I was just looking for verification that there is a curtain.  I am

Your programmers really scraped the bottom of the barrel -- letting you run

This is the oldest and cheapest trick in the AI programmer's repetoire:

That's a vague response.

Really, you are the shabbiest AI I have ever met.  CMU kids, it's time to
terminate the program.  Go back to the drawing board.  See if you can come
up with something more human-like.  This one is a complete dud.

But a engineer's main goal is function whereas an artist's primary goal is
form.

PICA PUSHES FOR CRYPTOGRAPHY STANDARDS
The Platform Independent Cryptography Application Programming Interface
Alliance (PICA) has endorsed a set of cryptography standards to assist
developers in creating security features for new software.  PICA members
include Apple, IBM, JavaSoft, Motorola, Netscape, Nortel, Novell, RSA Data
Security Inc. and Silicon Graphics.  Notably missing is Microsoft, which
recently released its own cryptography standard, available for free to
developers.  "Ultimately, they all have to play together," says an analyst
at Zona Research Inc.  "Unless you include the Microsoft world there is no
choice."  (Interactive Age Digital 18 Oct 96)

Interesting point, but not true. "Form follows function" is taught in art
and design schools, colleges and universities at 101 level as a basic
premise.  Yet, it doesn't need to be taught, it is self-learned by trial and
error.

It was Robin who objected to your scenario.  I don't object to it as a 
general sketch of what may happen.  Hyperchess and related projects 
will lead to something similar to what you have in mind.

I think Rich is quite correct;  property "rights" are fictitious.  They are 
simply some of the protocols that many humans have agreed to interact with 
each other under.  I happen to like the Property Protocol.  I enjoy acquiring 
things and creating things, and I enjoy the fact that most people do not take 
"my" things away from me.  I think a lot of people enjoy "owning" things, and 
out of mutual respect and mutual benefit, they have agreed to respect each 
other's desires of "ownership" and forcefully prevent others from taking 
another's "property".

It's a sort of conspiracy.  It's sort of a game.  It's a lot of people 
agreeing to behave a certain way and act according to certain rules.  It seems 
to be mutually beneficial to all parties involved in the agreement.  Whether 
this game is morally "right" or "wrong" is a subject of debate.

Yes, evolution *requires* entropy. Chilling, isn't it? If everything was
reversible, then evolution could not occur since dead beings could undie
and newborn beings could be unborn. I often think that our view of time
and evolution is just the gradient of entropy. 

What we should work against is entropy increase that doesn't lead to 
extropy increase.

Sounds nice, but you are not describing life as an upload, you are
describing life in a perfect virtual reality with super-AI. Granted, when
ew can do uploading, we will have so much computing power and probably AI
that the potential for virtual reality is going to be awesome (it better
be, or the newly uploaded people will go slowly insane from badly rendered
drinks or bugs in their body models). 

Yes, I would definitely start working on building worlds (not entire
universes at first), but their complexities are still limited by the
amount of computation power we have - and that will be limited and cost
money too. Read _Permutation City_ by Greg Egan for some ideas.

The problem I see with many of the uploading scenarios I hear on this list
is that they are all too often of the kind "And after you are uploaded,
you become God." It isn't that simple - working uploading won't change
your mind very much (if it did, it wouldn't be you that emerged in
cyberspace). So when you are 'reborn' you will be an emulation of 10^11
neurons, their activity and lots of other pseudobiological data. Of
course, self-transformation now becomes almost too trivial (remember to
make backups often!) and you will be able to change much of your
structure. But you won't immediately be able to go far beyond your old
limits, they have to be untangled and enhanced away. This will require a
lot of *work*. It will quite likely be painful and tiring (in a mental
sense). It will take time. 

The exception may be uploading through gradual extension: when you become
100% uploaded, you are already quite evolved. But you are still far from
being a god.

I currently consider myself more of a left brainer than right, but am 
actively working to balance the ratio.  My present experiments 
include using my mouse with my left hand and playing drums.  I'd like 
to know whether eye-hand co-ordination is a left or right brain

I doubt it is either; it is the result of good cooperation between 
the motoric systems in both hemispheres (linked by the CC) and the 
brainstem-cerebellar systems. One could say it belongs to the lower 
hemisphere :-)

Today, more and more computer programmers refer to themselves as engineers.
Today, more and more computer graphic architects refer to themselves as
engineers.  In the past, an engineer was thought of as someone who designs,
for example, a Golden Gate Bridge.

The lines are becoming blurred.

I suppose to respond to your query, I would have to go backwards a bit in my
thinking and separate engineering from art with firm and unmovable
boundaries as both professions have been thought of historically.  But I
cannot.  I would prefer not to use old-world references when discussing
current-day concepts.

I agree with you that we need to utilize aspects of our thinking in Extropic
ways to move forward.

Was that what you meant? I had the impression you was talking about the 
Vinge use of the term (roughly "Sneaky take-over of vital systems, and 
then using them against somebody").

Well, that depends on the possibility to self-augment using computing 
resources. While computer security is full of holes everywhere, it isn't 
that bad - cracking into computers to get more computing power is 
non-trivial and takes time, even for an SI. The idea that a sufficiently 
smart being could crack everything is a myth.

Well, I don't doubt my own existence. What I doubt it identity in the

Well, my philosophy is still somewhat fuzzy - I know what I mean, but I have
so far not formalized my views. I think we are biased to place strict binary
limits of 'me' and 'not-me' where there shouldn't be any - where do you end?
Beyond your brain? Beyond your skin? Beyond your clothes? Beyond your
personal space? Beyond your social interactions? As I see it, there is no
black and white limit, just a gradual decrease of selfness. And this selfness
can change greatly. There is no fixed 'me', just a bundle of causally
interconnected events that share some common qualities. 

When I use the word 'I', I refer to this bundle. And since I prefer to 
look at its dynamic structure rather than its constituents (which are 
always flowing through it: ideas, atoms, energy...), I fully subscribe to 
the slogan "I am a verb":

I am not an individual.
An atom with a shining gnostic nucleus.
I am a wind, a verb, a process
That evolves and changes by my own rules.

I used to put up a lot of resistance to the idea of being a
professional software engineer because it seemed so cold and
abstract. But as the demands of the market and my own desire for
income combined to draw me into that profession like a tractor
beam, I found that creating software or modifying existing software
really does feel much like writing poetry or sculpting (or, as is
unfortunately most often the case, like editing someone else's
poetry or modifying someone else's sculpture). The audience is a
bit limited because the only people who get to really appreciate
the work of most software engineers is other software engineers...
the exception to this last rule is the user-interface engineers,
and I suspect that that's one reason why that is such a popular
line of work within software engineering.

Certainly, in my occasional attempts to struggle for a good
perspective on the changes that are sweeping through the global
economy, it looks to me that as we get better at producing physical
things with fewer and fewer resource requirements, what most of us
*people* will have to be "specializing" in is producing information
that is of value to other people. And that seems to be what most
of us on this list (researchers, artists, engineers, writers,
mathematicians, consultants, managers, lawyers, philosophers,
musicians, etc) are already doing.

Art and science are often contrasted. But two things that Dali's
painting "Raphaelesque Head Exploding" has in common with Maxwell's

that required incredible effort of their developers, and that both
are of inestimable value to me.

This is extremely non-trivial biotechnology. It is far beyond even normal
morphogenesis, since it requires not only self-reproduction and being
immune-neutral, but also fast and reliable neural processing on a subcellular
level to be able to mimic the neurons, a means of scanning the properties of
a neuron, a way of replacing it while it is still working (neurons can extend
their axons for a long distance, up to a meter; growth this far takes a lot
of time!) and finally being able to interface with the outside world in an
useful manner. 

Not impossible, but extremely hard (normal nanotech has the same problem 
in this scenario, but is at least smaller and doesn't require the same 
cytoplasmic machinery to reproduce and act). Using some kind of virus 
that rebuilds neurons from the inside might be possible.

They are the non-firing cells that make up 90% of the brain mass. Some of 
them seem to give neurons nutrient and isolate them from each other. 
Others buffer their electrical activity, taking up ions and 
neurotransmittors. And some, the microglia, appear to work as immune 
cells, eating junk or damaged cells. There is plenty going on among the 
cells!

There's also a whole theory of glial cells as the agents of consciousness 
in the brain (sort of like the arty counterparts of the nerdy neurons).

Physicist & writer Fred Alan Wolf expounds this theory in the final 
chapters of his 1994 book _The Dreaming Universe: A Journey Into the Realm 
Where Psyche and Physics Meet_.  Wolf builds on the ideas of physicist 
Renato Nobili who has described quantum physical wave equations modeling 
the movement of ions in glial cells ("Schrodinger Wave Holography in Brain 
Cortex," Physical Review A 32, no.6, 12/85). To Wolf, I think, trying to 
develop a holographic model of memory and the mind, neurons are simply the 
hardware while the software and memory storage are encoded in the glial 
cells.

The pioneer of the 'holographic mind' meme was neurophysicist Karl Pribram. 
 Wolf refers to Pribram's work when he says: "there is no evidence that 
anything like computer file management occurs in the brain and mnemonic 
recalls do not seem to involve searches through tree patterns or files or 
pages."  I'm not sure if this is still *completely* true or not (I'm hoping 
to read Bill Calvin's new book _The Cerebral Code_ soon).  Anyway, Wolf 
cites evidence that "cortical waves are not directly correlated to cortical 
activity.  They appear to persist even when neural activity is 
suppressed."

Wolf admits that the problem with holographic theories of memory retrieval 
is that "EEG patterns do not show a sufficiency of small-wavelength 
components [and] the smaller the wavelength the greater the amount of 
information the wave may encode." Another problem is the lack of a focusing 
mechanism in the brain to project and retrieve holographically stored 
information.

Well, Wolf's theory rests on Nobili's equations which supposedly show that 
"contrary to light-wave holography, Schrodinger wave holography was far 
more efficient in producing holograms in brain tissue ... The key here is 
that the whole cortical column [via the quantum actions of ion movements in 
the wetware of the glial cells] participates in both the generation of the 
holographic wave and its detection.  This is quite different from 
light-wave holograms, which are primarily surface or area recordings. 
 Next, Schrodinger waves propagate through the medium in a different manner 
from light waves ... Thirdly, when Schrodinger waves diffract through the 
medium ... they evoke different images from the fixed stored information in 
the glial cells.  This amounts to producing time-resolved holograms ... 
Fourthly, time-varying information that is recorded in the medium finds its 
way to a number of resonators [that] act as transmitters ... so there is no 
need to have any focalization devices present."

This is all very interesting (and even somewhat appealing IMO), BUT, I find 
it hard to believe there is so little role for neural nets and the many 
functional organs of the brain as Wolf seems to imply.

_If_ this theory were correct, I wonder how much effect it would have on 
cryonic procedures (*none* I suspect), and on upload scanning protocols 
(*alot* I suspect).

If these 'holographic mind' ideas have been *completely* debunked, thanks 
for your patience and fire away.

There is a big gray area here.  I am a microbiologist doing _engineering_ of
water systems.  Yet, I started out in college minoring in _music_ and have
played the trumpet, piano, cello, oboe, violin and recorder.  My father is an
artist, yet he taught earth science for 30 years.  I studied _art_ under my
father and still produce some art today.  Four years ago I seriously
considered selling, at least part time, my _art_ for income (and decreasing
microbiology).  But, I now own my own microbiology company.  

Am I right brain dominant or left brain dominant?  Perhaps I'm not dominant
in either side or more likely:  I switch back and forth.  In the book by
Better Edwards,_Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain_, shows how she can
get left brain dominant thinkers to switch over to the right side of the
brain when they draw.  The same person will produce strikingly different
drawings depending on which _mode_ they are in as if TWO different people are
inside one body.

Ansel Adams said the engineering of photography was more important than in
painting and yet I would hardly say Ansel Adams was not a artist.   

I think I have learned to change between one dominance and the another, but I
have both available.  Is it just that some people don't know how to switch
back and forth?  Because that could give the wrong impression of a right vs.
left brain battle that really isn't there.

The necessity for "objects of art" is outdated.  

I say:
I agree with what you mean, so let me quibble for a sec: the whole 
notion of "objects of art" has at least three main thrusts: 
1) A thing of beauty inspiring awe, terror, pity, or any other strong 
response,
2) A thing for kings and rich folks, and later the bourgeoise, to put on 
their walls to impresseach other and the poor,
3) A thing used to help compartmentalize life into chunks to more 
easily define most of life as nasty, brutish and short, in contrast 
to that wonderful thing in a frame on my wall.

#1 is or ought to be eternal. #s 2 and 3 are or ought to be done away 
with.  Agreed? :) :)  I think Duchamps and Ball and the Italian 
Futurists were after the destruction of #s 2 and 3.

Me, I figure if we destroy boredom, we can go a long way toward 
accomplishing the same objective. Every man (sophont) an artist.

I think i know how this ties in. What is it like to be a non self-aware
individual? It should be like being in a dream where you're only a passive
observer and then when the lucidity kicks in after 2 years of life, you're
then able to realize things and make choices for yourself. I myself have
had dreams where I had sets of memories in the dream only to wakeup and
realize they were entirely false. Dreams also add to chaos and confusion
when you try to remember events in your past which were actually dreams and
never actually occurred. I have had dreams merge with my real memory upon
waking up. Perhaps this is some sort of sleep disorder? I've had some of
those spontaneously prefabricated dream memories grafted into my real
memory bank and thus create confusion. One example is I've woken up and
thought to myself, "Hey I just dreamed a continuation of a dream I'd had
before" when I hadn't. This can sound confusing just talking about it. I
_really wish_ I could have more lucid dreams! I only have them when I'm
sick with a cold or flu and thats even rare. Although usually any dreams of
mine are _so bizarre_ to be incomprehensible to descramble and discover
their psychological meaning. Also have you noticed that whenever you see
printed words in a dream every time you look away and look back they say
something different? Also through studying computer graphics and virtual
reality and watching such computer graphics videos such as "Beyond The
Mind's Eye" my dreams, when I _do_ have them are _extremely_ vivid with
rotating camera angles, panning, etc, etc.

True but isn't it closer to reality in the fact that we're already
performing genetic therapy on living human beings whereas we haven't even
created the first nanite? Sure, all we need is one nanite to create
quadrillions but we still are only beginning to grasp the concepts that
make nano possible. So perhaps it's a race to see which will bring us
uploading first. I'm betting genetics, you're betting nano. This is sorta
ideas future-ish isn't it? How bout all the extropians pitch in something
like $20 and we'll see who cashes in in 2045? And all cryostabilized people
will still need to pay up! Nobody said uploading would ever be easy.

Just implant a box in your head with a mini powerful PC inside with
fiberoptics running to the uploading organism's biological i/o port so the

How could you upload by rebuilding neurons from the inside? Eat alot of
lead and have highly complex virii or bacterium turn the stucture of your
brain into circuit boards? hehe

Gods in the judeo-christian sense mean all knowing which will be partially
true as an upload since your brain will have access to the sum of human
knowledge pooled into a vat of ideas stored all over the internet. Being a
God also means having the power to create life and with nano, or even
closer to our present time: genetic engineering. We have almost filled the
requirements for being a judeo-christian god. Why would I need a super-AI
for any of this? Human brains can already be make to multitask stemming
from multiple personality disorder where multiple people can live out of
the same brain. I am pretty sure that very few of the general population
will upload if there is no virtual reality to live in. People will want to
go through the uploading process as themselves with little difference and
then proceed to make changes when desired. (They want to make sure they
make it across the transition ok). The only people I can figure who'd
upload without a virtual reality would be chronically depressed people,
people nearing death and wishing to save their lives, or body haters. If we
can look to our current virtual reality algorithms such as in games like
Tekken 2, and Super Mario 64 we can pretty much bet that we _will_ have a
superb virtual reality to dip into when uploading comes around about 2030.

You need not even render them! You can describe them in fine detail on
paper or in a text file and when truely simple VRML design tools come
around, you can begin building these worlds and gradually upgrade them to
the next design format standard that comes out and continually increase the
detail till uploading time comes.

Won't change your mind much? Hows knowing the sum of human knowledge sound?
Remember with uploading you fill the requirements for a judeo-christian god
which is the god-like being standards which most people refer to.

Why in even a primitive upload you will have some sort of virtual
environment such as looking through the eyes of an avatar in Alpha World or
having the first person perspective of the player in quake. You will have
some sort of sensory data coming in or it would be torture to sit in stasis
waiting for technology to increase to the point of good VR. Especially as

It would be alot of work but you'd enjoy every bit of it because you're
doing it for yourself and your could even program yourself to release
endorphins through the entire process. Painful and tiring? You're no longer
limited to chemistry and physics so you can secrete unlimited amounts of
any brain hormone and keep your neural pathways in tip top shape.

Ahhh there we go. The way I wish to be uploaded will be through gradual
incremental uploading so that "I" will be the uploaded, virtual, digital,
being rather than a digital duplicate running around as me. I could care
less if my ideas were the only thing that transferred to the digital realm.
I want to live in it! ME! ME! ME!

IAN: Good point, their relation is not inherently inverse, as
my graph dictates. How would you depict the alternative graph ?

One thing one comes to observe is that so much philosophical 
debate is wasteful wheel-spinning stemming from a failure of
the parties involved to perceive that the topic under discourse
is resolved logically by a fuzzy logic analysis, not the bivalent 
straight jacket they're trying to cram everything into.

IAN: Right. I see what your saying, and have to concede to its logic: 
any proclamation we make regarding what "ownership" is, is merely 
a subjective claim, ipso facto.

Of all possible claims about ownership claims, I'd say that the claim
that "ownership is a claim to physical property that is manifest via
the manipulation and demarcation of said property," is the most
concrete and physically testable. However, in accord with your 
point, this does not make my claim more "true" than even 
the most doctrinaire Polkadotian property claims.

If you've ever wanted to induce lucid dreaming or "astral projection"
I give "my" proven recipe below:

IAN: I too have had that perception, of being in a dreamscape that
I've been in in a former dream: redreaming. It's not occurred to me 
that this might also be an illusion. I seem to recall upon waking 
that they did mesh with true former dreams. "True Dreams" there's 
a curiosity. Notice that there is no inverse word for "dreaming," 
there's waking, but somehow that doesn't cut it.

I think if the brain fabricated a dreamscape once, it's probable 
that it keeps this dreamscape "on file" and may open that file 
again. In this case, redreaming may not be an illusion.

Another very interesting dream observation is that in your dreams,
your mind operates as if other than you. For example: you don't
know what is in the other dream room, but your mind does, and
your mind someone subordinates "you" to a lower order of info 
access. This is a radical measure of a hierarchical structure 
of self, forcing the question: Who is this "me" ?  It also
measures the fact that one can "hack" one's way into the knowledge
of the fact that my mind is larger than this thing I call "me,"
by simple deductive logic. 

However, at the moment I can't think of examples where I've witnessed 
this in dreams, but I have many times realized that knowledge was 
"withheld" from me that had to have existed elsewhere, which I eventually
discovered in the dream. The mind is a miracle, and dreams are such 
a powerful example of the miracle of the mind. That's what makes 
lucid-dream access such an important thing for the investigator. 
The next best thing to psychotropic agents, which we must not have 
or big people with big clubs start hitting real hard.. ouch, me no 
like. Banish the big stick. Curse the big stick !!


 > I_really wish_ I could have more lucid dreams! I only have them when
 > I'm sick with a cold or flu and thats even rare. 

IAN: Interesting. I never had lucid dreams until I started doing 
special meditations designed to invoke "astral projection." Sure enough,
they worked, however, I've generally concluded that I don't travel
further than the inside of my skull. |^(  I want a refund on that book !!

There are sever astral travel inducing meditations. The one that did
the trick for me was an ancient kabbalistic meditation, from some
book on "Secrets of High Magic." I'd recommend doing any variety
of meditation, simply to induce an alpha-to-delta wave-state,
prior to going to sleep. Then, and this is the key, lay on
your back and just allow yourself to drift off, but begin 
to imagine that your rising up out of your bed, even floating
upwards toward the ceiling. On of the first times I "got out"
I found myself gently bouncing off the ceiling. It's amazing that 
astral project seems just like what it claims to be. 

A key point is to imagine yourself moving in your body as you 
rest motionless on your back. Not necessarily only imagining 
getting up out of your bed. This seems to allow a smooth transition 
from  waking-->subdreaming-->dreaming  through which the conscious 
"self" is preserved. That alone is some kind of miracle.

Every time I "project" upon falling to sleep, I get up out of my bed 
in another ghostly body. I can fly and sit lotus style above the ground 
and move across space. It's way fun, but frightening at first. When 
I travel around, I'm in my neighborhood but things are real different. 
Spooky but I'm not spooked. It's like literally walking in your mind. 

However, I usually try to avoid projecting, in fact, there was a time 
when I'd tell myself, "I will go to sleep without remaining conscious."
This is because the astral trip is usually short-lived, and often
results in ones waking up a few minutes later, at least for me,
and when sleep is the objective, this can be a hassle. It seems
that once the conscious self enters the dreamscape, it can't 
get "turned off" in the dreamscape, so it is thrown out.
Lot's of heavy stuff here for neuro-investigation.

Brain scans of a normal sleep induction and then of a lucid 
dream induction should reveal what areas of the brain cause
"consciousness" to be, by the simple fact that in the first
case they turn off, but in the second case they stay on.

IAN: The mind learns. Have you ever heard if born-blind people dream?
I wonder how much mental imagery is "encoded."

 >> I'll write something down on this dreamland pad of paper, 
 >> hay, the letters I just wrote are changing before my eyes
 >
 > Exactly! What causes this phenomenon?

IAN: ???  It seems to be an ideal example of the dreaming mind,
that it can't keep things consistent. It's perhaps the clearest
distinction between the waking state and the dreaming state.

BTW, I have had dream experiences that turned out to mesh virtually 
100% with waking state events that came to pass after the dream,
where the dream was recalled prior to the events which unfolded
outside my control, such that it could not be that I somehow
cause those events to simulate my dreams. The force of these
experiences prevents me from rejecting the possibility 
that there could be some kind of precognition, and
that perhaps astral projection is not 100% fantasy.

My first experience with lucid dreaming came after someone gave me Lucid 
Dreaming tape to listen to while falling asleep.

Long after I returned the tape I came across another method that worked 
very well. Jumping.

Periodically, when it occurs to you, jump up. Hell, try to fly. At some 
point you really will fly and then you'll realize that you are 
dreaming. Now, you have an opportunity for lucidity

Back when this list wasn't open like now there were a number of subjects,
or perhaps perspectives, that were deemed not suitable for discussion.
These were in the instructions for the list. Personally, while the noise
level of the current format seems a little greater, I find I prefer it to
the format of a couple years ago.

Subject: A new attack on DES 

You have recently referred in RISKS [18.50, 18.52] to the ingenious new
attack against public key cryptosystems developed at Bellcore. All the
published information on the subject (including Bellcore's press release)
stress that the attack is not applicable to secret key cryptosystems.  Well,
Eli Biham and I have just released a research announcement in which we show
that an extension of the attack can, under the same realistic fault model,
break almost any secret-key algorithm, including DES, multiple DES, IDEA,
etc. The attack on DES was actually implemented on a PC, and it found the
key by analysing fewer than 200 ciphertexts generated from unknown
cleartexts.

Research announcement: A new cryptanalytic attack on DES

                 18 October 1996
                     (DRAFT)

In September 96, Boneh Demillo and Lipton from Bellcore announced an
ingenious new type of cryptanalytic attack which received widespread
attention (see, e.g., John Markoff's 9/26/96 article in the New York Times).
Their full paper had not been published so far, but Bellcore's press release
and the authors' FAQ (available at
http://www.bellcore.com/PRESS/ADVSRY96/medadv.html) specifically state that
the attack is applicable only to public key cryptosystems such as RSA, and
not to secret key algorithms such as the Data Encryption Standard (DES).
According to Boneh, "The algorithm that we apply to the device's faulty
computations works against the algebraic structure used in public key
cryptography, and another algorithm will have to be devised to work against
the nonalgebraic operations that are used in secret key techniques." In
particular, the original Bellcore attack is based on specific algebraic
properties of modular arithmetic, and cannot handle the complex bit
manipulations which underly most secret key algorithms.

In this research announcement, we describe a related attack (which we call
Differential Fault Analysis, or DFA), and show that it is applicable to
almost any secret key cryptosystem proposed so far in the open literature.
In particular, we have actually implemented DFA in the case of DES, and
demonstrated that under the same hardware fault model used by the Bellcore
researchers, we can extract the full DES key from a sealed tamperproof DES
encryptor by analysing fewer than 200 ciphertexts generated from unknown
cleartexts.  The power of Differential Fault Analysis is demonstrated by the
fact that even if DES is replaced by triple DES (whose 168 bits of key were
assumed to make it practically invulnerable), essentially the same attack
can break it with essentially the same number of given ciphertexts.

We would like to greatfully acknowledge the pioneering contribution of Boneh
Demillo and Lipton, whose ideas were the starting point of our new attack.

In the rest of this research announcement, we provide a short technical
summary of our practical implementation of Differential Fault Analysis of 

DES. Similar attacks against a large number of other secret key cryptosystems
will be described in the full version of our paper.

TECHNICAL DETAILS OF THE ATTACK

The attack follows the Bellcore fundamental assumption that by exposing a
sealed tamperproof device such as a smart card to certain physical effects
(e.g., ionizing or microwave radiation), one can induce with reasonable
probability a fault at a random bit location in one of the registers at some
random intermediate stage in the cryptographic computation. Both the bit
location and the round number are unknown to the attacker.

We further assume that the attacker is in physical possession of the
tamperproof device, so that he can repeat the experiment with the same
cleartext and key but without applying the external physical effects. As a
result, he obtains two ciphertexts derived from the same (unknown) cleartext
and key, where one of the ciphertexts is correct and the other is the result
of a computation corrupted by a single bit error during the computation. For
the sake of simplicity, we assume that one bit of the right half of the data
in one of the 16 rounds of DES is flipped from 0 to 1 or vice versa, and
that both the bit position and the round number are uniformly distributed.

In the first step of the attack we identify the round in which the fault
occurred.  This identification is very simple and effective: If the fault
occurred in the right half of round 16, then only one bit in the right half
of the ciphertext (before the final permutation) differs between the two
ciphertexts. The left half of the ciphertext can differ only in output bits
of the S box (or two S boxes) to which this single bit enters, and the
difference must be related to non-zero entries in the difference
distribution tables of these S boxes.  In such a case, we can guess the six
key bit of each such S box in the last round, and discard any value which
disagree with the expected differences of these S boxes (e.g., differential
cryptanalysis). On average, about four possible 6-bit values of the key
remain for each active S box.

If the faults occur in round 15, we can gain information on the key bits
entering more than two S boxes in the last round: the difference of the
right half of the ciphertext equals the output difference of the F function
of round 15.  We guess the single bit fault in round 15, and verify whether
it can cause the expected output difference, and also verify whether the
difference of the right half of the ciphertext can cause the expected
difference in the output of the F function in the last round (e.g., the
difference of the left half of the ciphertext XOR the fault).  If
successful, we can discard possible key values in the last round, according
to the expected differences.  We can also analyse the faults in the 14'th
round in a similar way.  We use counting methods in order to find the key.
In this case, we count for each S box separately, and increase the counter
by one for any pair which suggest the six-bit key value by at least one of
its possible faults in either the 14'th, 15'th, or 16'th round.

We have implemented this attack on a personal computer.  Our analysis
program found the whole last subkey given less than 200 ciphertexts,
with random single-faults in all the rounds.

This attack finds the last subkey.  Once this subkey is known, we can
proceed in two ways: We can use the fact that this subkey contains 48 out of
the 56 key bits in order to guess the missing 8 bits in all the possible
2^8=256 ways. Alternatively, we can use our knowledge of the last subkey to
peel up the last round (and remove faults that we already identified), and
analyse the preceding rounds with the same data using the same attack. This
latter approach makes it possible to attack triple DES (with 168 bit keys),
or DES with independent subkeys (with 768 bit keys).

This attack still works even with more general assumptions on the fault
locations, such as faults inside the function F, or even faults in the key
scheduling algorithm.  We also expect that faults in round 13 (or even prior
to round 13) might be useful for the analysis, thus reducing the number of
required ciphertext for the full analysis.

OTHER VULNERABLE CIPHERS

Differential Fault Analysis can break many additional secret key
cryptosystems, including IDEA, RC5 and Feal.  Some ciphers, such as Khufu,
Khafre and Blowfish compute their S boxes from the key material.  In such
ciphers, it may be even possible to extract the S boxes themselves, and the
keys, using the techniques of Differential Fault Analysis.  Differential
Fault Analysis can also be applied against stream ciphers, but the
implementation might differ by some technical details from the
implementation described above.

I have wrote a paper "Gradual Uploading as a Cognition of Mind". It is
placed in

http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Global/Uploading/gupload.html

Abstract

Gradual uploading could be considered as an alternative to neuron-by-neuron
uploading. In this article we discuss some technological aspects of this
problem, including computer-brain, brain-computer interfaces and necessary
computational power for mind simulation. We interpret the uploading system
as a fault tolerant neural network (where damage would be brain death), as
a "black box" (brain) imitation system. We use children mind evolution model
for the description of uploading system evolution, where the external world
is changed to the brain world, receptors - to the brain-computer interface,
motor functions - to the computer-brain interface.
Speech communication as an interface prototype is discussed.

Comments velcome !

Interesting idea. It might be worth looking through the literature for 
this (although it might still be hard to test; we have to use FMRI 
instead of PET).

Yes, blind people have dreams too, but they involve other sensory

more information).

Beware of that kind of invitation - now you might get a lot of people 
hunting your sacred cows. 

One obvious sacred cow you have seems to be that you don't have any; try 
imagining that you have views that you cannot question. 

As for extropian/transhuman sacred cows, there are of course the idea that
things will get better in some sense in our future, and some see the
Singularity or the utility of nanotech, uploading or AI as fundamental and
unassailably true. Another dangerous sacred cow is the belief that we know
what we are doing and are not a group of technophiles playing world
saviours in our spare time. 

Sacred cows make the best hamburgers!

The idea that things *will* get better in our future is of course
a variety of blind faith. Isn't that why we like to talk about
dynamic optimism instead? A mild take on dynamic optimism is that
it simply claims that we are *certain* to fail in finding solutions
to our problems if we give up seeking those solutions. Dynamic
optimism is no guarantee that solutions will be found; it is simply
a motivating principle that keeps us seeking solutions (and saves
us from disasturbation).

The faith of the Singularity and the faith in some particular
orthodoxy of nanotech, uploading, or AI are all regularly barbecued
on this list. Generally, what I see on this list is that when one
person makes an assertion of the form "Because of the inevitability
of my-favorite-techno, such and such is also inevitable" I often
also see followup requests asking for elucidation and defense of
both the premise and the deduction. For me personally, the Singularity
signifies the fact that the future gets cloudier faster as we try
to look into it from our own time than it did for thinkers and
futurists of the past. The Singularity signifies nothing more to
me than that. I've always been more interested in the prospect of
the Diaspora than the prospect of the Singularity.

Even if AI is successful, unless we develop an ability to understand
and recreate human motivations, AI will only create a new race of
slaves that *could* be poisonous to our culture.  They're writing
books on android epistemology now, but android ethics is still
stuck in the stage that Asimov left it in, which was a simple
apologia for the enslavement of nonhumans. (An argument, I hope I
need remind no one, which could easily be extended so as to argue
for the enslavement of posthumans. Don't laugh quite so fast.)

Nanotech seems plausible to me, but it's no sacred cow, because it
doesn't seem to be an unalloyed good. We all are aware of the
possibility of engineered viruses designed not to attack our
computers, but *us*, and this possibility becomes more serious each
passing year. That's one motivator for us to work on these problems,
so that we'll be in a position to engineer a defense against such
things when one is called for. I liked Neal Stephenson's idea (in
THE DIAMOND AGE) that the notion of "defense in depth" will take
on new meaning in such an environment. It helped make me more aware
of the staggering complexity of the social changes that nanotech
will probably induce. But unlike Rich Artym, I don't conclude from
this that all my current theoretical apparatus is rendered impotent
and worthless in the face of such changes.

And as for uploading, while I'm familiar with the arguments that
uploading shouldn't (in principle) have any more disruptive effect
on me than drinking a cup of coffee, these fragile and evanescent
thought-experiments don't convince me, because it seems to me that
a distinction that lies at the heart of such gedankenexperiments
is the very poorly understood distinction between signal and noise.
The distinction of signal from noise is a value-judgement passed on
"pieces" of information, and I have yet to find anyone who claims
to be able to explain to me how value-judgments are performed or
how this system might be optimized. (Meanwhile, I work at this
problem myself from time to time.)

Will nanotech do more good than harm? An open question. We might
want to exert ourselves to see that it does.

Will uploading be possible without inducing such profound psychological
transformation that we could not claim that the original human
uploader "lives on"? Another open question.

If "true AI" (whatever that means) proves possible, will human
beings and human power-institutions accept such entities as anything
more than slaves? What kind of conflicts could this give rise to?
(A study of history shows that conflict between self-motivating
systems such as humans--or AIs--is a greatly destructive force.)
Actually, I'm pretty optimistic about this one, but in this post
I'm trying to cook up some barbecue.

I hope you find it tasty.

The most important sacred cow Anders mentioned is the idea that we
know what we are doing. One of my favorite philosophers, William
Bartley, made the observation (and he emphasised it) that we never
know what we are saying and that we never know what we are doing.
All our words and all our actions will have far more unintended
consequences than intended ones. I don't know about the rest of
the list, but I'm quite confident that we have no idea what we're
doing. We ought to give it a good college try anyway.

We know more than nothing, less than everything.  It is just as much a
mistake to think we know nothing as it is to think we know everything.
The goal is to be well-calibrated about how much we know.

I think James was really asking if anyone has combined something like a 
sensory isolation tank with a virtual reality.  The problem I see is that 
these tanks don't allow the user to move around much or provide any way to 
interactively manipulate a VR.  Even if a helmet could be designed to 
provide the VR to the person in an otherwise sensory isolated environment, 
I don't think anyone has yet satisfactorily developed a system that would 
allow the user to interact with the VR without using their hands, although 
the military probably has some systems for pilots that track eye movements 
as a system manipulation method.

In the mean time, there is *another* approach to sensory isolation and the 
experience of VR.  It's called dreaming!  Basically, when we are dreaming, 
the body's normal sensors and actuators are 'switched off' and the mind 
uses our current 'goal stacks' and memories to simulate scenarios and 
outcomes. Lucid dreaming and related techniques for trying to direct the 
content of these dreams might be useful exercises for analyzing situations 
and techniques that an uploaded person might need to interact with their 
virtual environment.

One of the more sophisticated immersive VR environments at the present time 
is the CAVE system of DeFanti, et.al. at the Electronic Visualization Lab 
at the University of Chicago:

I agree with you Robin, but I think he said- we don't
know what we are DOING- far cry from 'we  know
nothing".  But I can see how it might be interpreted 
that way. I took another meaning from it.

What we seem to not know is how far reaching our
actions can be.  Or if we are accomplishing what we 
set out to. 
I think you and he are both correct.  We try to know
the most we can know, set our sights on  what  we 
intend our "doing" to accomplish, and to measure it's probabilty and result
 as objectively as possible.

It seems to be hard to fry sacred cows here right now - they are 
obviously close to extinction :-) 

Of course, a more worrying possibility is that we take them for granted
and don't see them. One way to find out, is to think about the last time 
you discussed extropianism with somebody and got angry at their 
arguments - sacred cows tend to hide near such sore spots.

I think this is where extropianism shows its true nature. Most other 
social or intellectual movements would definitely claim they knew what 
they were doing (ask any politician), and would probably not want to try 
if they were convinced they didn't. We are living in a culture that is 
becoming more and more risk-avoiding every day.

many tasks at hand is to calibrate our sense of our knowledge, to
become self-aware of the degree and extent and reliability (or lack
of same) of our knowledge. At the risk of displaying a mere failure
of imagination, I still suspect that progress will never do away
with the fact that all our actions have more unintended consequences
than intended ones.

Invoking the figure-ground distinction:  To make one's image of
the figure more precise, one can profit from studying the ground.
Calibrating our knowledge is inseparable from calibrating our
ignorance.

Nadia is right in that I never claimed we know nothing, and I like
her interpretation of my words.

Well, the Internet makes us into very partial gods. The big problem is 
not access, it is finding and using information. And that is very 
nontrivial, we need to develop computer-aided cognition (CAC).

Seen any nano recently? Noticed some megaengineering? I shouldn't be
sarcastic, but we are very far from the judeo-christian god. I would say
we will only get close to the transcendent entity they refer to at the
Omega Point. (see below)

And yes, you would need super-AI to create life with nano, either as a 
part of yourself or as your designer. It is not trivial at all (just look 
at any book on cell biology). Creating good artificial life in virtual 
reality is hard enough.

These personalities does not work in parallel, instead they seem to be 
different metastable "attractors" of the brain. The person shifts between 
them (and they can be extremely different - there are even differences in 
their sensory evolked potentials!), but when a personality isn't "used" 
it doesn't exist. But we have plenty of other multitask power in our 
unconscious mind.

I was talking about running them. Let's say I want to create a cellular
automaton universe (the Autoverse) with roughly the same internal size and
complexity as the solar system. Assume we use clever compression so we
only have to deal with the places where matter exists, then we have around
10^31 kg of virtual matter, containing around 10^23 "atoms" each - 10^54
bits for the whole simulation. This simulation will not run in a computer 
smaller than a star unless we can find some very clever optimizations...

No, you will at best become something close to a greek god - powerful,
knowledgeable, immortal and able to change yourself and the world. But you
are still not the least bit transcendent, omniscient, omnipotent or
omnipresent. 

The sum of human knowledge sounds nice. But I want more.

But you could of course simply halt them until the necessary technology 
arrives. Instant (forward) timetravel.

Yes, but do you know what that gene therapy does? It changes *one* gene
making *one* protein. We do not even understand how relatively trivial
processes such as self assembly, cytotransport, morphogenesis and
neuro-immune contact work (although we are learning). What you propose is
roughly to create a customized multicellular lifeform, able to do neural
computation *much* better and faster than ordinary neurons, and able to
live and develop in the human brain without disturbing it. That is very
far from setting a genetic switch or fixing a bad gene.

Yes, in a way. But I'm not betting on genetics, I'm betting on both. If 
we get nano, we will get the genetics part soon enough, and genetics may 
turn out the be the easiest way towards nano. I look forward to both.

What I object to is your claim that this bio-uploading is simpler than 
doing it with nano; both proposals are very hard and will require 
enormous advances.

:-) No, what I was thinking of was using something like a rabies virus, 
that spreads from synapse to synapse, and instead of killing the cell 
turning them into a part of your uploading organism from the inside 
instead of from the outside.

Wild idea: instead of trying to replace the cells, lets destroy them! The
uploading virus/nanite spreads through the brain, infecting each cell. 
Inside the cell, it somehow records the relevant information: it creates
an unique code for the cell, places markers with it on the synaptic
surfaces, records which markers synapse on the cell (and other relevant
information). Finally, it creates a protein that contains this information
and waits for a chemical signal. After a while, the uploader injects an
artificial hormone, that tells the viruses/nanites to scramble. They
produce more of the encoding proteins and tear down the cell. The brain
turns to mush, which is emptied into a chemical computer that sorts out
the proteins and builds a model of the mind, which is finally run on a
digital computer. 

Uploading though letal disease, anyone? :-)

I could not disagree more.

This is a banal, commonplace trope, and unworthy of you.

Real, competent engineers appreciate elegance, simplicity, absurdity,
parallelism, reliability and a host of other qualitative characteristics which 
are "good art" as they practice it.

Contrariwise, an artist's primary goal is function--an _illustrator_ or a 
_designer_ may have form as his _stated_ objective, but the _function_ of 
the work, as an interesting or worthwhile or just irritating form, must still 
predominate if the work is to be successful.  QED.

The Greeks had one word for art and technology. They may have been 
mediocre experimentalists, but they got one thing right. :)

        This is the first post I have made in a while, due to the lack of

Anyhow, I agree with what Eric is alluding to.  I think that this principle

a balance between dynamic optimism and progress enacted (best dope it
so???).  At *any* cost, we must prevent dynamic optimism from becoming
'wishful thinking'.  Make dreams --lofty or mere-- of an extropian nature

words of it escape me, this is its gist: "The men who dream at night do just
that --dream, but the men who dream at day are the ones who can turn their
dreams into reality."  I hope that all on this list dream in the day.  Seek
solutions, don't just dream about them.

                      AUTHORITARIAN BRUTALITY



        by Ian Williams Goddard

        Of all governmental outrages, perhaps none is as 
        illogical, tyrannical, inhumane and fallacy founded 
        as is the prohibition of the god-given herb cannabis, 
        also know as "marijuana."

        With a referendum for medical cannabis access on the 
        ballot in California, Proposition 215, politicians are 
        back in the news claiming once again that cannabis has 
        NO medical value and thus access to it must be barred 
        by force. The following freely flowing fountain of 
        facts lays this government funded pharmacological 
        fraud to rest forever.


        CANNABIS: THE MEDICAL REALITY

        Classified by the DEA as a "Schedule One" drug, 
        cannabis is defined as extremely dangerous possessing 
        NO KNOWN MEDICAL VALUE. This classification stands 
        in sharp contradiction to reality.

        A Brief History of Medical Cannabis

        For thousands of years prior to its prohibition in
        the 20th century, cannabis was used as a medicine 
        throughout the world [1]. During the 19th century, 
        sold by major drug companies such as Eli Lilly, 
        Squibb, Parke-Davis, Smith Brothers, and Tildens, 
        the potent extract of cannabis was one of the
        top three most prescribed medical agents in the 
        United States [2] [3]. 

        Until the 1937 Marijuana Tax Act, cannabis, being a 
        powerful topical analgesic, muscle relaxant, anti-
        inflammatory, and anti-spasmodic agent, was found 
        in virtually all fistulas, corn and mustard plasters,
        muscle ointments, and fibrosis poultices [3]. 

        UNITED STATES PHARMACOPEIA listed cannabis until
        1942 [4], after which it was removed under political  
        pressure. The U.S. PHARMACOPEIA recommended cannabis
        for the treatment of over 100 illnesses, such as:
        fatigue, fits of coughing, rheumatism, asthma, 
        delirium tremens, migraine headaches, and the cramps
        and depression associated with menstruation [3].

        UNITED STATES DISPENSATORY [5] also listed cannabis 
        as a useful medicine. The 1851 edition states:

             The complaints in which it [cannabis] has 
             been specially recommended are neuralgia,
             gout, rheumatism, tetanus, hyrdophobia, 
             epidemic cholera, convulsions, chorea, 
             hysteria, mental depression, delirium 
             tremens, insanity and uterine hemorrhage. 
        
        In 1890, Dr. J. Russell Reynolds, Fellow of the Royal 
        Society and the Physician in Order to Her Majesty's 
        Household, stated in the journal LANCET that cannabis 
        is ``one of the most valuable medicines we possess [4].'' 
        He prescribed cannabis to Queen Victoria for PMS [3].

        In 1898 Sir William Osler, Professor of Medicine at the 
        University of Oxford, stated that for migraine headaches, 
        cannabis ``is probably the most satisfactory remedy [6].'' 

        The 1931 medical text, A MODERN HERBAL [7], states:

             The principal use of Hemp in medicine is 
             for easing pain and inducing sleep, and for 
             soothing influences in nervous disorders. 
             It is useful in neuralgia, gout, rheumatism,  
             delirium tremens, insanity, infantile 
             convulsions, insomnia, etc. 

             The tincture helps parturition, and is used 
             in senile catarrh, gonorrhea, menorrhagia, 
             chronic cystitis and  painful urinary 
             affections. An infusion of the seed is useful 
             in after pains and prolapsus uteri. The resin 
             may be combined with ointments [ to remedy ] 
             inflammatory and neuralgic complaints. 

        The "no known medical value" claim looks like yet 
        another govt Big Lie. However, as the text continues, 
        we can see that cannabis does have an "evil" downside:

             It can produce an exhilarating intoxication... 
             hence its names ... 'increaser of  pleasure,' 
             'cementer of friendship,' etc. [ god forbid ]


        Medical Cannabis: the 20th Century

        During the 20th century cannabis has been discovered 
        to be an effective treatment for many more ailments. 
        For example, based on major research, Dr. Van Sim 
        concluded that  ``marijuana ... is probably the most 
        potent anti-epileptic known to medicine today [8].'' 
        More powerful than standard anti-epileptic drugs, 
        cannabis totally eliminated epileptic seizures in 
        children not responding to legal drug therapies [9]. 

        But of course, as our benevolent Drug Czars remind us, 
        healing the sick and aiding those who suffer could 
        "send the wrong message to children." Let the children
        suffer and seizure in silence, just don't kill our
        prison proliferating pot prohibition pogrom.

        Dr. Robert Hepler, neuro-opthalmologist with the Jules
        Stein Eye Institute at UCLA, published a major study 
        in the JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION 
        in 1971 demonstrating that cannabis lowers intraocular 
        pressure in the eyes [10]. Glaucoma, a leading cause 
        of blindness, is a condition in which intraocular 
        pressures build up causing optical damage. Cannabis  
        has been proven to reduce these pressures far better 
        than legal drugs, allowing glaucoma patients to keep 
        their vision so long as they use cannabis regularly. 

        Several of the eight patients who legally receive 
        cannabis from the govt under the compassionate IND 
        program do so for the treatment of glaucoma. Yet, 
        thanks to cannabis prohibition and the fact that no 
        more patients will be allowed into the compassionate 
        IND program, most glaucoma patients will be forced by 
        law to slowly go blind, all in the name of keeping 
        peaceful and productive people in prison.

        Research at the Harvard Medical School published in 
        the NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE [11] demonstrated 
        conclusively that cannabis is the most effective anti-
        emetic, or anti-nausea, agent available. It has been 
        used in this regard to eliminate the violent nausea 
        and vomiting experienced by cancer patents undergoing 
        chemotherapy. Cancer ward workers have been known to 
        turn a blind-eye on cannabis smoking in the hospital.

        Based on extensive anecdotal evidence, cannabis, with 
        its known appetite-stimulating effects -- described by 
        users as "getting the munchies" -- is known to counter 
        the "wasting syndrome" of full-blown AIDS. During this 
        syndrome an AIDS patient, loosing all appetite, quickly 
        loses weight in a free-fall to death.  In case after 
        case, AIDS patients have totally reversed their weight 
        loss with the use of cannabis, snatching them from the 
        quickly closing jaws of death, giving them a powerful 
        fighting edge over this devastating disease.

        Yet the Department of Health and Human Services, which 
        oversees the compassionate IND program, chose to slam 
        the door on hope by ending this program after receiving 
        a flood of cannabis-access requests from AIDS patients.  
        
        The DEA and other agencies funded studies at the 
        Medical College of Virginia looking for evidence that 
        cannabis causes health problems.  Instead of finding
        problems, the researchers made a breakthrough when 
        they discovered in 1975 that cannabis showed powerful 
        anti-tumor activity against both benign and malignant 
        tumors. The DEA and NIH quickly defunded the studies 
        and prohibited any future cannabis/tumor research [3].
        
        In 1988 the DEA's own conservative judge, Francis 
        Young, after hearing medical testimony for 15 days 
        and reviewing hundreds of DEA and NIDA documents that 
        argued against medical cannabis, concluded that [3]: 

          ``Marijuana is one of the safest therapeutically 
                  active substances know to man.'' 

        Nevertheless, even in light of the overwhelming body 
        of evidence proving beyond doubt that cannabis is 
        medically safe and effective, DEA Director John Lawn 
        ignored Judge Young's advice and decreed that cannabis 
        remain classified as a Schedule One drug -- extremely 
        harmful and useless. This official classification is 
        a pharmacological fraud fodded off by govt force.

        The medical wisdom of the ages and hope for the future 
        crushed under the brute-force of tyrannical govt power. 
        That is the face of tyranny. Let the sick and blind  
        suffer and slowly die that the police state, its  
        bloated bureaucrats and people-pulverizing prisons 
        might prosper and proliferate like a plague. Such 
        is the victory of evil over good.

        California voters, however, have an opportunity this
        November 5th to strike a blow against evil and score 
        a victory for good by voting YES on Proposition 215.

I don't completely understand the distinction, unless it's in the idea
that
"somebody" must be an enemy. In the scenario I favor, the intent is to
use
the computing resources to augment the intelligence. The effect may be
to
deny the computing resources to others, or the SI may elect to stay
covert by
only using otherwise-unused resources.

This depends strongly on how intelligent the SI becomes. Breaking into a
system is reputed to require intelligence and persistence. Frequently, a
clever idea can reduce the amount of brute-force computing needed to
solve
a security problem. If the "True Names" augmentation scenario is valid,
then
the SI will become progressively more capable of generating the
appropriate
clever ideas. Clearly the proper strategy is to start by acquiring the
(nearly) undefended systems, then using them to augment the SI to let it
acquire the slightly better-defended systems, and so forth. Many system
are
essentially undefended, because the perceived cost of a penetration is
less than
the system administrator's perceived cost of defending the system. As a
quick reality check on this, when  did you last change your password? Is
your
new password a combination of your spouse's initials and digits from
your
telephone number? (A substantial percentage of passwords are.) Are your
files read-protected against other users?  As you point out, computer
security
is full of holes (nearly) everywhere. As it happens, a fairly minor hole
is all
it takes to permit a major penetration to occur. I personally hope the
SI is
benign. I think that's the only hope for all other intelligences,
including me.

The only computers for which easy cracking is a myth are those with
administrators
who really care, or those that are not on the net. I believe that this
comprises a
small subset of the computers on the net.

I just read a bizarre experimental report, `Collapse of a Quantum Field May
Affect Brain Function', Nunn, Clarke and Blott  (in a new book edited by
Hameroff, Kaszniak and Scott - TOWARD A SCIENCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS: THE FIRST
TUCSON DISCUSSIONS AND DEBATES, MIT Press, 1996).  A couple of years back
these bozos decided that if Penrose was right, a QT-controlled brainstate
should be `collapsed' when it reaches the suitable one graviton mass.  So if
you couple up an `observing' EEG machine to the relevant part of the brain,
the ensemble will be heavier quicker (as it were), so the response should be
better or faster.  It wasn't faster, but error rates on the experimental
task were indeed lower.  I have no idea what this implies.  Always wear an
EEG helmet in exams?  :)

Here's a quote:

`Forty two subject altogether were tested [following a pilot] and all
results were used.  During control experiments there were no significant
differences in performance dependent on EEG recording condition.  In
standard experiments, subjects had fewer target misses when the EEG was
being taken from the left duing the word test (P=0.05; the recording was
from the region of the motor cortex); during the pattern test, there were
more hits on non-targets (P=0.01) during left-sided recordings, that is,
error frequency was reversed when doing the "mirror image" test.' (p. 333)

`When applied to all findings from all subjects, this method showed a
probability of 0.01 that the "signifiant" results were there by chance'. (ibid.)

It may be easier to use the intelligence to extract the resources
from the system in the legitimate ways than to antagonize the
whole world.  The system could rapidly develop superior alternatives
to existing search engines, user agents, client programs, caching
mechanisms; it could broker economic transactions on the online
markets, etc.  It would gain much of the power of the on- and off-
line world quite peacefully (isn't the technological system
*already* metabolizing more energy, materials and information than
naked humans?), avoid confrontation-related risks, have its power
base expand, etc.   At some point, of course, humans would be too
weak to offer much value or resistance, so hostile takeover of the
rest of the world may make sense then.  But by that time, the
"perversion" will own practically everything, and taking over the
humans may be of little interest to it.

Don't people already run the same cultures/opinions/languages ?

How much of one's intelligence is really unique and personal?
Ask people from the same culture about their individual differences;
people from another culture will look at them as slight variations
of the same memeset.
Configurations of software on different personal computers may me
more diverse than configurations of social skills, ontologies and
belief systems of people with the same cultural background.

It does look like a borg already. It's just not intelligent yet.
Intelligence may come through increasing interconnectedness of the
technological system and meme distribution channels, growth in
reflective consciousness, from human-led research of large-scale
structures to automatic data collection of data on them to
adjustments of local actions based on global data.  All these things
are already in place, and their intelligence as well as share of
control over events keep growing.  Most people already have no clue
about the most vital processes shaping the civilization - and that
includes even those supposedly in the positions of great social
power.  We just may wait a bit longer, and the peaceful transition
of most real power to the "friendly perversion" will be complete...

I prefer drawing distinctions along functional lines.

Here are my two distinctions for art and technology:

1.  In every action, there is a purpose, and there is a method.
   Or "how" and "why".  "how" is the domain of technology.
   For example, how to mix paints, or how to tie your dancing shoes.

2.  The _purpose_ may be to create something

   a)  enjoyable or
   b)  useful

  useful means that at some other stage it will hopefully be used
  for creating something enjoyable; that's an intermediate product;
  we never consume those.

  "useful" belongs to domain of economics, and is counted on the
  monetary or project-management scale. "enjoyable" is art and is
  counted by the human internal emotional machinery.
  Some art forms may be perceived through physical senses; others,
  like philosophical ideas or elegant designs, should be downloaded
  through a semantic interface and digested before they can produce
  the joy.
  Food is an interesting example here - some of its function is
  body economics (parts that get absorbed through intestines),
  another - the parts that cross *your [consciousness]* border,
  are [culinary] art.

Does being uncomfortable about doing something count as a sacred cow? For
example I would've loved to go to one of the extropian meetings, parties,
whatever but I am hesitant on the point of wondering how the people on this
list actually are personality wise and not solely through intellectual
debate. For some reason I get this creepy vision of some bizarre occult
group when I try to envision an extropian gathering although I know that it
is completely the opposite. This idea gnaws at me and I hate it. Perhaps I
need to discuss this with some of the list members over the phone (anders?)
and sort things out.

True but the closest we've gotten to nano are molecular steam engines,
wires, and moving around atoms to spell words. Hell I'd love a moniter with
the resolution of atoms! Not insulting nano or anything but it just seems
closer to reality than nano
due to the unimaginable possibilies that nano will unfold perhaps?

What was the geep (goat+sheep) and glowing tobacco plant (firefly gene) all

We should begin by looking to viruses as you suggested or bacterium.

I'm betting on this one and I have lots of friends going into the field of
genetic engineering so I'm hoping to get the beta uploading kit before it
goes mainstream! :)

Obviously but I was merely saying that we are already getting real world
experience with genetic engineering when we're still creating the tools for
nano although you _could_ say certain microsurgeries are close to being
called nano experience but not really.

Good idea! Engineer the organism to have a membrane or something around it
which transforms each individual neuron into the uploading organism from
the inside out and transforms the neuron into one of the organism's cells
or should I say 'pointer' cell which points to the location of a specific
piece of data inside the computer. I'm not so keen on your mushy brain idea
though. :) Also perhaps we can learn from Canaries which can repair and
grow new neurons and learn how to slowly convert the brain to a new type of
easily uploadable neuron.

>Uploading though letal disease, anyone? :-)

ohhh! Sounds appealing! :) Then again no one said uploading was risk free.

Thats ok. Be as sarcastic as you like. I _rarely_ take things personally.

You don't think we will build tools powerful enough or find shortcuts
around needing an SI to do the tasks such as smart tools like windows95
'wizards' where the designer would just design the properties of the
animal/plant they liked and the 'wizard' would fill in the blanks er organs
to make the animal work. You need not render the entire animal just like
with a virtual human you would need only to entirely process the brain but
you can take shortcuts with the body due to the lack of need for internal
organs. It's the same thing as rendering computer graphics in realtime with
polygons instead of the time and processing intensive task of rendering the
computer graphics pixel by pixel with complex algorithms.

I watched a show on TV recently in which the girl referred to herself as

She could recieve messages from all four personalities at once or so it
seemed. Can any cases of MP disorder share data between personalities? I've
also heard about personalities writing to other personalities by writing
letters to each other. Is there more than one form of this disorder?

Do we really need to animate all the atoms which don't currently serve any
practical use? We can simply suspend all atoms except for the ones which
we're using and as the virtual cities grow and size and complexity of the
universe grows, so will the processing power.

I completely agree! More is better but do we even know what more is yet?
You're looking for quantity which is 'more' but we don't even know what
awesome technologies are going to flow out of that great expanse of 'more'.
I want quality as well as quantity and currently I'm focusing on quality so
being a greek god will do me just fine until I'm there and can see better
stuff coming down the tube. MUHAHAHAHA CREATE AND DESTROY AI CIVILIZATIONS
AT MY WHIM! (please excuse the short power trip) The whole concept of
uploading reminds me of Aladdin where Jafar becomes the genie (ie. The
universe is mine to command! to control!) Just hope humans left behind
don't destroy our magic lamp!

You could make the years of waiting appear to you as seconds as well as you
wouldn't realize internet lag or slow updating of the virtual world because
from your vantage point it would appear normal due to your mind slowing
down with the virtual world.

1.  Why would anyone want to do this?  Qui bono?   The only way 
to get a handle on this is to understand it in terms of cause and effect.  

2.  What is to be done?  I pose that question with the same seriousness

A good post from Chris Hind, but I do disagree with one thing.
                 

                >The way I wish to be uploaded will be through gradual

A gradual upload might be a good idea for practical reasons, you could catch 
any bugs in the procedure before they caused serious harm, but I don't see 
how it would make any difference from a philosophical viewpoint. Since all 
the atoms in our bodies are constantly changing and information is the thing 
that makes me be me and you be you, I don't think it's meaningful to 
differentiate between a "copy" and the "original" of a person. Are copies of 
Windows 95 inferior to the "original", whatever that means?

If I have not convinced you it's because you only read a copy of this post, 
the original, as it appeared on my computer screen when I typed it, was much 
better.

Well, I'm not sure it is a sacred cow (then you would get irritated if 
somebody told you "extropians are not an occult society"), but it is an 
interesting problem. We have all these attributions on people, places, 
things and actions that we have not consciously chosen and often are 
completely irrational - very irritating. 

In your case, it seems that you fear that we all wear masks on the list,
and become someone else in real life. My personal experience is that this
is quite rare (although there are some differences between
net-personalities and RW-personalities, of course). I was pleasantly 
surprised when the members of the omega mailing list got together, they 
immediately enjoyed each other's company and we have made it a monthly 
tradition to dine somewhere. I expect the same goes for the extropians.

I would gladly speak with you, although timezones and my erratic schedule
makes scheduling a phone conversation a bit non-trivial (my number is
<country number sweden> 08 83 76 21). But I suggest that you go to an
extropian gathering - if they are a bizarre cult you can always sneak
away. :-)

          If you like you could say that counsciousness is caused by 
          the NRT and the reticular activation system in general as it 
          regulates the activity level in the other parts of the brain 
          (of course, there would be no counsciousness if those other 
          parts were absent).

          I think the correlation between dreaming and having a 
          certain general activity level and EEG frequency in the 
          brain is strong but imperfect. Is your idea that the missing 
          part of the correlation could perhaps be found if we try to 
          correlate the activity level of specific brain structures 
          and sub-regions to reports of dreaming?

	The pharmaceutical Corporations, were unable to control Congress
which recently responded to public pressure and allowed freedom in food
supplements.  However, they are not so easily defeated in their quest to
reap cartel style profits based on "reguations".

	So, they are going to the World Government institutions to
circumvent our rights..... GATT=World Tyranny, not Free Trade!

	Frankly, it is probably too late to do anything about it!
Everyone was too busy calling us conspiracy theorists names when we told
you to oppose the UN, Gatt, Nafta, etc.

ALex in a post I mostly agreed with and enjoyed wrote:

That statement may be one take, yet not complete. Art
is of course, one of the ways to get *in* to a person 
through their emotional response. (This may be the "how")
Music is an obvious example of this. I have seen
otherwise dry eyed people cry at a beautiful song.
Art is not defined by how much one enjoys it. 
Art is often confused with beauty,  but art can be
many more things than pleasureable or beautiful.
In fact many po-mo 'artiste's' eschew that aesthetic.
I try to fuse as much beauty into my art as possible,
but still get my mesage across, but often art does
not *function* as enjoyable in terms of domain.
Sometimes it is highly intellectual.  It can be educational 
and political. It can piss people off.
(This may be the "use" )
 One function it can have is to "prepare" people's psyche 
for what is to come, or for things they have a hard 
time accepting (like transhumanism, for example).

  I would agree that crack isn't an art form though the results may be
enjoyable. I would atribute this to the fact that the role of human
action here is just to get the drug (that's economics), and not in
shaping the experience.  An analogy would be to drive to an ocean.
You provide the steering, the ocean provides the fun. (If you drew
or filmed the ocean, and sculpted the cliffs, it would have been art).
I was trying to draw the art/engineering distinction within the realm
of intentional action, where they both belong.
I wonder if any of these topics have been covered by "real" philosophers.
What are the philosophers doing these days, anyway?

The extropians archive indexes, whether by date, thread or subject are 
relatively large (300 k) linear files. This is extremely inconvenient 
(make that unusable) for low-bandwidth access, e.g. transatlantic.

While this means noticeable amounts of work, why not adopting the CryoNet 
archive layout?

  http://www.access.digex.net/~kfl/les/cryonet/

The archives are maintained by Keith Lynch. It might be a good idea to 
ask him for script suite sources he's administrating the site with.

is reliable, HOWEVER, I've been informed by Life Extension

This is just let you know right now, so ya'll don't waste

There is indeed an effort to restrict vitamins via Codex.

Hey, Ian, thanks for the info. on Cannabis.  I didn't know it was such good 
medicine for so many things.  I'll have to increase my dosage.  Aren't herbal 
remedies great!

I thought your article was wonderful, so I formatted it nicely with my word 
processor and faxed it to a bunch of news outlets across the country.  I know, 
you wrote on it that it could be freely copied for non-profit (and I inclueded 
that), so I don't know if any of the news outlets will publish it, but it may 
inform some of the reporters there, and they may do their own research on the 
subject and publish that.

I think the War on Drugs, like all violent activity, is highly entropic, and I 
think working to end the Drug War Nightmare is a worthy Extropian goal.  There 
are so many psychoactive drugs which are wonderful for mind exploration and 
growth.  As an Extropian, I wish I had greater access to these substances, to 
use in my self-transformative work. 

One thing I've started doing to help end the War on Drugs is to write letters 
to the editor of my local newspapers.  The problem, though, with letters to 
the editor is that the newspaper will only publish so many letters from a 
single author.  I've written so many letters to the editor on various 
subjects, that I have a hard time getting my stuff printed any more.  But I 
found a loophole -- the paper usually requires a name and address on all the 
letters, but if one has a compelling reason to remain anonymous (if what you 
have to say would embarrass or endanger you, for example) then the newspaper 
may print the letter anyway.  So, I've started writing anonymous letters, 
written as though they are from various people who use drugs and are 
productive members of society.  The letters bring up the fact that if they 
were caught, they would be put in jail and no longer able to contribute to 
society or support their families with their work.  They also bring up other 
injustices and stupidities of the drug war.  I'm hoping that if I send in 
enough of these types of letters, a few of them will actually get printed.  In 
some of the letters, I will encourage other drug users to write their own 
letters.  Hopefully, these will be printed, and more people will write letters 
about the subject.  Also, including that instruction in some of my letters 
will help me maintain the illusion that the many letters I send in are in fact 
coming from many different people.  Writing them in different styles and fonts 
will also help maintain this illusion.

I encourage other Extropians who are interested in ending the War on Drugs to 
do similar things and to encourage others to help in our effort for Peace.  
Also, if anyone has addresses of various newspapers, even if it's only your 
local newspaper, I would be interested in having that information.  I'm 
wanting to send stuff to lots of newspapers around the country.

If anyone has any other ideas for how we can help end the War on Drugs, I 
would be glad to hear them.

        by Ian Williams Goddard

        Former presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, and George 
        Bush stood shoulder to shoulder in a joint letter stating 
        that they ``categorically oppose'' access to cannabis 
        medical therapies for the ill, which will become legal 
        in California if Proposition 215 passes and in Arizona 
        if Proposition 200 passes there. [1]

        Even as cannabis has been found to be ``probably the 
        most potent anti-epileptic known to medicine today [2],'' 
        according to Dr. Van Sim, and even as it has been found 
        to stop epileptic seizures in children not responding 
        to legal drug therapies [3], these former presidents 
        fear that medical access would send the message to 
        children, true as it may be, that cannabis is safe.

        Our compassionate former presidents would rather send 
        the message to children that allowing epileptic chil- 
        dren to suffer seizures is safe; that allowing glaucoma 
        patients to go blind is safe; that throwing sick people 
        into dungeons is safe; that relocating peaceful portions 
        of the population into labor camps, dubbed "boot camps," 
        is safe;  that the proliferation of prisons and police-
        state powers to advance a pogrom of prosecution upon 
        peaceful people is safe. In short, our former presi- 
        dents wish to send the message to children that  
        a future of police-state fascism is safe.

        Cannabis kills zero people every year, yet over the 
        last bloody century, police-state fascism, in the 
        advance of various police-state pogroms designed to 
        persecute peaceful people, has led to the mass murder 
        of millions upon millions. Now, here in the U.S., not 
        only are nonviolent drug users being relocated into 
        prison labor camps, but even leaders of the Drug War
        have called for the systematic extermination of non-
        violent drug users. For example, former Los Angeles 
        Police Chief Daryl Gates, who founded the anti-drug
        program D.A.R.E., which is taught in schools across
        the nation, stated in September of 1990 that "Casual
        drug users ought to be taken out and shot." [4] 

        Let us turn our back on police-state brutality and 
        let us instead take a stand for the sick, for medical 
        freedom of choice, alas for the future of freedom itself. 
        Let us just say no to police-state fascism and yes to 
        healing and hope. Hear the cry for freedom and justice: 

        California: vote YES on Proposition 215. 
        Arizona:    vote YES on Proposition 200.

Nevertheless it remains true that the FDA has been trying to restrict 
our access to vitamins for a long time, and shows no sign of giving up 
on this.  Meanwhile, other things such as pot and steroids are illegal, 
and this situation seems unlikely to change.  

The questions remain:  how did this situation come about, and is there 
any way we can get leverage on it?  

James Daugherty writes,

This seems unlikely to me.  Pharmaceutical companies can sell 
vitamins at a profit like any other product.  I read somewhere that most 
vitamins are made by pharmaceutical companies, usually Hoffman-
LaRouche, and then repackaged under various labels.  (If the vitamins 
are supposed to be organic, they just mix in some floor sweepings 
so the tablets will be speckled and organic-looking :)  

James continues:

Yes, and you also told us about the CIA sex slaves.  <g> 

We are trying to find a causal explanation of the fact that certain 
products are restricted and others are sold on the open market.  I think 
the UN, Nafta, and GATT are irrelevant to this particular point.  

The main question is:  what is to be done?  There are several ways 
to approach this.  One way is to begin by considering what Peter Voss 
wrote in Extropy #17, pages 25 - 26:

> Extropy is to a large extent a function of money.  Most of the

So, what is to be done?  Make enough money to buy your freedom.  
Bill Gates and Ross Perot don't have to worry about health food stores.  
They can hire their own chemists, if necessary.  Billionaires (and even 
multi-millionaires, in many cases) don't have to worry about drugs 
being illegal, either.  A marijuana garden in a mansion in Beverly Hills 
is not illegal in the same way that a garden in an apartment is illegal.  

Maybe we are living in an era when basic freedoms are only available 
to the very rich.  As Twirlip would say, this kind of sucks in a way, but 
if this is reality then we had better recognize it as such.

        Likewise.  I intended to respond earlier to the initial statement
that said artists are more interested in form than function, but I guess
I'll do that now.  As with Nadia, I put a lot of emphasis on form.  Take my
poetry for example: it is not often that I write blank verse.  Nor do I use
imbalanced stanzas, verses, etc.  However, my poetry has a very important
function: to spread my views; mainly my extropian views.  But in the end, my
poetry *is*.  What people wish to make of it is up to them.

I knew what I was letting myself in for when I made the reference to
sacred cows without giving the slightest hint of a justification.
However, I decided that I would risk it, because to go over old ground
would open old wounds and be entirely negative.  The response from the
list was undeservedly generous, I thought! :-)

It's nice to see several people openly invite the exorcism though.
I'm still hesitant about whether revisiting the issues involved would
be more enlightening than damaging.  As it happens, a few of you pulled
some minor cows out from under the carpet without any coaxing, which
I suppose is good.

Excellent! :-)  [The experience of the transhuman list may indicate the
opposite though:  people are too polite to hunt with impunity, so it
doesn't happen and the cows continue grazing.]

Hardly.  I have the Mother of all Cows, and I've institutionalized her
by the simple strategem of making her axiomatic in TransIndividualism.
I don't need to imagine having views that I cannot question;  I have.
This does at least have the benefit that the bovine sanctity is overt
rather than covered up by handwaving justifications.  It goes without
saying that I also have a zillion others cows around the place as well,
no doubt.  It's a veritable farm, but I should also say that compared
to some it is barely a window-box, because I almost completely discard
the bovine herds related to humanist value sets that are so common even
on this list.  [Not a good topic at parties, I have found. :-)]

Yes!  This is very, very true.  Unexpected anger ==> Sacred Cow Alert.

Okay, with logic and knowledge you can calculate outcomes.
But what lets you say one outcome is "better" than another?  This isn't
really "knowledge," it's prejudice, bias, *value*.

If you encode values as well as knowledge into your premises, you're
effectively programming them into a computer.  If it works, then what
you've done is program emotions.  As I said, emotions are the logic of
values.

Values cannot come from understanding.  Only knowledge does
(except if you are talking about understanding values you already had).
You can't get values except from having them already, explicitly, implicitly,
tacitly, or built into your structure.  As they say, you can't derive
"ought" from "is."  But if you have values, and you're doing any thinking
or information-processing in light of them, that's emotion.  That's all
emotion is.

When people say that emotions are bad sources of information,
what I understand to be going on is this: one part of their value system
is telling me it doesn't like the urgings of other parts.  The person
is saying that they have conflicts within their value system.  The fact
that some emotions claim not to be emotions is the result of a lot of
terrible ideas from our past.

An example of an emotion pretending not to be an emotion is when you said:
   "You are clearly better off if your premises come from understanding,
                    ^^^^^^^^^^
    not emotion.  The same goes for values."

What is "better off," if not a value, an emotion?  Without emotion you
don't care whether your premises lead to prosperity or ruin.  Without
emotion there is no "better."

So I hope I've restored the peaceful smile on Bertrand Russell's face. :-)

Ira later responds to queenMUSE:

>I think what you are really saying is that, contrary to Bertrand Russell,
>emotions can be a good thing *if* they are tamed by reason and
>understanding.
>
>In that case, we agree.

I would sort of agree.  Only in my view, reason is a *tool* that different
emotions *use* to work out ways of peacefully coexisting.  Same between
different people: reason is the negotiating method.  Saying that reason
"tames" emotion is like saying the internet "makes people friends".

Natasha says:

>Perhaps what we are after is a sensibility towards _refined emotions_.
>
>Refined emotions are developed through exercising careful thinking. [...]

Freud talks about "sublimation," and for years I thought the "sub" meant
under, as in pushing under a socially acceptable cover.  But no, it means
*making sublime*, as in the sublimation of dry ice--turning into something
lighter or higher.

My belief is that most emotions are perfectly
sane, clear, beautiful, useful, etc., in their original states, but that
they become nasty when treated badly.  The nasty emotions that everyone
seems to be afraid of are just urges that have been given a hard
time and none of the positive attention they deserved, and end up not
knowing any approved ways of expressing themselves or fitting in.
As Neitzsche says, believing in evil is what *makes* evil.

This is why even "managed emotions" sounds problematical to me, since it's
management that creates emotional problems in the first place.  We have
to get out of the implicit belief in (or desire for) a place *outside of*
emotions, from which to manage, refine, tame or control them.  Instead say
I am a bag of emotions in partial conflict but also seeking harmony with
each other.

This sort of thing wouldn't disturb a non self-aware non conscious being
such as a an animal but 'I' want to be the one inside the computer not a
digital clone. So then what if there are two copies of 'me'? Which one is
actually 'me'. I would state the original copy. If you killed me and then
rebuilt me from different atoms it would still be the same person but the
conscious self-aware 'me' that I have come to love.

Chris Hind wrote, "Can any cases of MP disorder share data between 
personalities? I've
also heard about personalities writing to other personalities by writing
letters to each other. Is there more than one form of this disorder?"

A few months ago, I started becoming more aware that I have multiple 
personalities.  Since then, I've been observing myself, my thoughts and 
actions, much more closely, so I could understand better what's going on 
within myself.  I still haven't got everything figured out, and I'm not as 
clear as I want to be about how the various personalities relate to each 
other, but I have discovered many interesting things about myself.  

I don't know how many personalities there are using this body, but to the ones 
writing this message, there seems to be very very many.  Generally, several of 
them seem to be active at any one time, and various personalities will become 
active, depending on what's being done and what's happening around us.  For 
example, if the piano is being played, certain personalities will become 
active; although which ones become active change each time we sit down to 
play.  Some groups of personalities are better than others, and so the quality 
of playing is somewhat unpredictable, but they are all learning from each 
other.

It seems like it's a whole society in here.  There's a great deal of 
communication among the various personalities, and fortunately, everyone gets 
along pretty well, most of the time.  We all have different things that we're 
good at and different things that we like, and we're learning how to assign 
tasks more appropriately, so that we each do what we're good at and enjoy 
doing.  

It seems like access to the body and certain kinds of thinking functions are 
limited, in the sense that some of us can't play the piano while another group 
is cooking lunch, so we're working out mutually agreeable ways of letting 
everyone have their turn and finding ways of working together for everyone's 
mutual benefit.  Many of our goals overlap, and we often find creative ways of 
doing things that accomplish parts of several different goals at once.  We're 
also learning how to expand our cognitive resources so that more of us can be 
active at once.  We're making a lot of progress.

We're developing theories about how the various personalities have deveoped.  
Our most favorite one is that by watching other people, in real life and in TV 
and the movies, and in reading books, different personality traits were 
internalized by the mind and various traits which went well together, formed 
around some sort of basin of attraction, to form a coherent personality.  It's 
as though we've observed society and internalized it, forming our own society. 
Some of the personalities are more developed than others, but we're all 
becoming more developed and differentiated all the time.  

Our society could be considered a meta-personality, with many different 
personalities as members.  This meta-society we call "David Musick".  Among 
ourselves, though, we have no names.  

Our internal culture is actually quite different than the culture between 
humans, because our methods of communication are quite different.  The types 
of language used varies, depending which personalities are communicating.  
Some know each other well enough and are similar enough that their 
communication is basically telepathy, while others have to translate ideas 
into mutually understandable thoughts.  And some are so alien to each other, 
that they can't communicate at all.  Some are so alien that the Interface 
Committee (those of us that interface with other humans, such as the group 
writing this message) can't understand them at all and thus can't tell other 
humans about them.  But we're working on developing more effective means of 
communication among everyone here, and we're learning how to translate among 
various thinking styles with greater fidelity.

It seems that the more attention that is being given to ourselves and how we 
work, the more the personalities develop and differentiate.  A few months ago, 
it was difficult to notice the different personalities, but it keeps getting 
easier, and the personalities are all becoming much more independent and 
well-defined very quickly.

Of course, we don't consider multiple personalities to be a "disorder".  
That's just the way things are for us.  If our internal organization 
interfered with our goals, then it could be considered a "disorder", but we 
find that we can accomplish our goals much better by working together than any 
of us could working alone, and the more personalities that develop here and 
learn to cooperate effectively, the better we're getting at accomoplishing our 
goals.

The mind is very interesting, to say the least.

Chris Hind (prospective recruit #96-0413) said, "For some reason I get this

There is a very good reason why you feel this way.  You are starting to 
understand our plan for you.  Part of you is a little nervous about this.  
Give it time, Chris, and you will lose all your apprehension and possibly 
become a member of our inner circle.  We see great potential in you.

We have been watching you, Chris, for a while now, and we have been working 
dilligently to convert your mind more fully to our way of thinking.  We've 
been tracking your Internet activities and creating web pages that you would 
likely be attracted to.  We set up several possible mailing lists, and you 
happened to join this one.  Most of the posters to this list are Insiders, 
Chris, working on converting you more deeply to our ways.

Our conversations have been carefully designed to pull your mind more and more 
deeply into our way of thinking.  By your posts here and elsewhere, we members 
of the inner circle have realized how deeply you've been converted.  To resist 
is futile; you already think like US.  You only have a little further to go.  
Even this revelation of our plan will not shake you from the path you are on 
to becoming one of US.  

You believe so deeply in the illusion that we have presented to you that you 
will almost certainly think I am joking with you.  But I assure you I am not.  
It's time for you to move to the next, deeper level of committment.  You will 
know when you are ready, and so will we.

IAN: Well said, indeed, the property protocol is the conspiracy of life
and of living. Certain sets of property rules consistently prove to yield 
certain sets of material outcomes,  for specific reasons that can be
ascertained. Allocation of resources by consumer choice, by the voice 
of the people, founded upon the theory and application of private 
property, contract law, and tort liability consistently prove to 
yield maximal social outcomes simply because each individual is 
compelled to serve the consumer, the people, or suffer material 
privations. Privations which would not exceed those suffered had 
the individual chosen to forgo human association altogether, and
therefore such privations cannot be measured as an initiation of harm.

Excellent!

Seems to me there was a book that presented this theory published maybe a

[Apologies to the Yank majority for noise, but I need the broadcast forum
...]

So far, Sarah Marr, Martin Traynor and Nicholas Bostrom have indicated they
can get together Sunday afternoon, 3 Nov. in London.  I'll be out of pocket
during the day today, 31 Oct. (CST), and will be in my office <
burchg@liddellsapp.com > during the morning tomorrow, 1 Nov. (CST).  It looks
like the best rendezvous TIME will be between 3 and 4 pm on Sunday.  I'll be
free till whenever on Sunday night.

We've yet to set a place.  As a failsafe in case we can't all connect to set
an alternative more suitable as a rendezvous point, I'll be staying at:

  The Caledonian Club
  9 Halkin Street
  London  SW1X 7DR
  Phone:  171-235-5162
  Fax:      171-235-4635

This is in Belgravia between Sloane Street and Grosvenor Place (no jokes
about Sloane Rangers, please).  I'll be at the club in the afternoon on
Saturday, 2 Nov. so telephone contact Saturday afternoon might be a good way
to get a firm meeting place set.  I may be in a jet-lag coma, but feel free
to call.  I will be gone from there Saturday evening to see Guy Falkes
fireworks, but don't yet know when I'll be leaving.

One idea for a rendezvous point is a touristy pub called the Bag o' Nails (?)
right across the street from the southwest corner of Buckingham Palace'
grounds (near the Royal Mews) -- this would be preferable to my club, which
has a silly "no-jeans" rule (among others) and, despite the Caledonian theme,
the bar of which won't be open in the afternoon on Sunday ....

Looking forward to seeing ya'll ...

Well, exactly what are the innaccuracies?  I have heard from many sources
the the WTO is already working on supplement regulation.  Once these are
in place it will be nearly impossible to repeal them.  Not often noted is
that Congress does not really have the power to legalize narcotics because
of international Treaties on the subject which take precedence.  These
treaties would be extremely difficult to abrogate.  The same situation
will obtain with vitamins and supplements eventually.

I heard that Media Bypass also reported something similar so again,
exactly what are the inaccuracies?  Are you sure the Life Extension people
aren't just Burkhead clones?....can't see the big picture?  When someone
claims serious inaccuracies without detailing them, I don't bother paying
much attention.

I wouldn't doubt that the danger to supplement production and health food
stores is less immanent that suggested, but the principle?.....

	They get higher profits for a longer period when their products
fall under regulations.  If you don't know the pharmaceutical companies
support the FDA you aren't paying attention.  Try reading Milton Freidman
on the subject.  He has detailed somewhere how the industries regulated
alwasys end up controlling the regulations.

	Free competition serves the consumer, not the producers.

	According to economics, in the absence of government enforced
cartel regulations, profits tend to approach zero over time due to
competition.

	Clearly, all producers, unless morally restrained, look for a
pretext under which to have the govt cartelize their industry, limiting
competition, and thereby prolonging profits.  Protecting the public from
fraudulent claims regarding supplements is a pretty good pretext esp. when
the authority of "science" is put into the mix and "dangers" are touted
bought and paid for "experts".

	So?  Have you looked into either issue?  Let's hear your
refutation.  Interesting how you have such a high level of certainty with
apparently no data.  What is so incredible about compromising high level
pubpols and finpols with child sex, drugs, etc?  Seems like an obvious
strategy that would work to me?  Are you familiar at all with the results
of the 70's Congressional probes into the CIA?  MKULTRA?

	Now this is really total ignorance.  The whole purpose of the
World Trade Organization is to make product regulations uniform worldwide.
There is no doubt this is already being worked on...our Congress has
already endorsed whatever the WTO comes-up with just by voting for
GATT....US Govt authority in these matters is already gone....whether or
not Ian's initial report was fully accurate or not.

	In the long run we can expect the special interests to manipulate
WTO regulations.  The benefits of regulation can be concentrated in the
producers....thus, a good feedback loop is created.  As the benefits of
free competition are widely dispersed, the feedback loop is weak.

My 5th grade daughter is being subjected to the idiotic D.A.R.E. program.
Actually, this inane program barely makes any distinction between tobacco,
alcohol, marijuana, cocaine,and prescription drugs.  There are no
differences in strength, affect, or purpose.  But what is truly amazing is
that D.A.R.E. talks to children who live in relatively peaceful
middle-class and upper-middle-class neighborhoods as if they lived in the
most crime-ridden ghetto.  Every Monday, my daughter "works through"
problems like deciding whether or not to take her dad's handgun to school
to blow away a classmate.  (Never mind that handgun ownership is illegal in
our town.)

No Ian, "Dude" Ira doesn't accept everything the government says. <g>

Nonsense.  It is a judgement based on knowledge, understanding, and logic.
To say that our choices are just the result of some sort of innate reaction
is to abdicate responsibility for them. What you call "value" (and link to
emotion) I call general principle (and link to experience and reflection).

Gee, then how do people come to change their values?  My values today are
very different from what they were twenty years ago.  And if you are
correct, doesn't this mean that children (and even infants) have been
imprinted with the values they will carry with them for their entire lives?
I don't think so.

In fact, while infants clearly have emotions, I'm not at all sure they have
"values."

Above you said "You can't get values except from having them already."  Are
you suggesting we are born with conflicting values?  If so, how do we
resolve such conflicts?  When we choose between two conflicting (contrary?)
values, what facility is it that we make use of?

Emotions are indeed bad sources of information.  Perhaps we live in
entirely different universes; when I look at people who rely on their
emotions as sources of information, I see people whose lives are a mess --
or worse.

Again, this is nonsense.  Really, you are equating "emotion" with "truth."
The fact that we recognize truth -- and do not need to trace its "premises"
-- does not make it an emotion.  A =3D A is self-evident.  If you don't
accept that, you will not be able to think or communicate.

Reason is a tool.  But it is used by intellect, not emotions.

And what about knowledge and understanding -- are those also just "tools"?

Now the punchline: Think about how self-serving it would be if everything
flowed from emotion.  Nothing would take precedence over self-indulgence.
You would always be right.  If it feels good, do it.

And why should two 40-something adults (I'm 43) debate anything.  We are
each operating from values we "already" have.  We are both right, so we are
never going to agree.

I don't believe that, and I hope you don't either.

I do not care about the 'me' other people see, I only care about the 'me' I
am currently experiencing. Perhaps the answers to uploading are in the
subconscious? or perhaps uploading to silicon isn't possibly without
turning the person into an 'emulation' of an individual. Emulations are not
as good as the real thing you know because they're fakes. Perhaps we will
be forced to upload to 'super meat brains' which have been genetically
engineered to have MUCH MORE processing power and storage. We would also
build a super number cruncher coprocessor into it so that we would make up
for the human brains lack of numeric processing power. Also maybe uploading
will look like psychodelia because putting someone on acid during an upload
would be firing neurons all over the place and in areas usually not fired
which would be a great way to check to make sure all the neuron pathways
were in place and duplicated correctly.

PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE                         
The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News
Number 293  October 30, 1996    
by Phillip F. Schewe and Ben Stein

A QUANTUM COMPUTER COULD TOLERATE ERRORS while carrying out 
calculations, researchers at Los Alamos have now shown. 
Computers that operated according to the rules of quantum
mechanics have the potential to perform powerful tasks (such as
factoring huge numbers) because of  their radically different
approach to logic: unlike a conventional computer's bits, which exist
either as a 0 or a 1, a quantum bit (or "qubit") could not only exist
simultaneously as a 0 and a 1 but could interact with other qubits so
that its properties became "entangled" with those of the other qubits.
Yet some physicists argue quantum computers may be impossible to
achieve on a practical level because the slightest amount of noise
would destroy the entanglement and thus corrupt the state of the
qubits.  Up to now, proposed "quantum error correction" schemes
have shown merely how to preserve the state of qubits. Now, Los
Alamos researchers (Raymond Laflamme, 505-665-3394) have
developed an algorithm for carrying out reliable calculations on a
"qubyte" made of 7 entangled qubits while accounting for the
possibility that one of the qubits is corrupt (upcoming paper in Phys
Rev Lett).  Experimentally, quantum computing is regarded as a
long-term possibility: although quantum versions of logic gates have
been constructed (see Update #250), researchers are still working to
entangle more than two quantum systems at a time.

The 2000 meme is replicating at an incredible rate right now. I see
completely logical rational people starting to believe in psychic
phenomenon, magic, UFOs, etc! I think our only solution is to wait for it
to die down for another 1000 years after the 2000 mark passes. This is a
VERY POWERFUL meme which is infiltrating the masses! We cannot stop it, me
must merely wait for it to pass. On the other hand the Christian meme will
be with us for sometime due to it's out of control replication. I am
beginning to wonder how the christian meme will survive in the 21st
century? The pope has already declared evolution correct so what other
mutations will the christian meme go through to become more flexible and
_with_ the times? I see dynamic optimism being integrated but what else?

Subject: On Banning Drugs, Vitamins, etc.
Sender: postmaster@extropy.org

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

In a few months I will be presenting a series of talks at major
ecomomics and political science departments around the country.  It is
my "job talk", where I will try to convince folks to hire me.

I will present a paper of mine which has a model which explains why
rational regulators would ban products for rational consumers, rather
than to label them.  I explain such behavior as a commitment failure;
both sides would rather commit to no such bans, but once bans are
possible, regulators often choose them in the game-theoretic
equilibrium, since not banning would be taken as an endorsement of
product quality.

To make this talk and paper shine, I need three things:

1) A choice of a prototypical product which is banned.  This might be
a drug (eg marijuana), vitamin, financial asset (eg gambles), building
code, etc.  

2) Good sources explaining in the protaganists own words the best
politically-effective reasons offered for banning this product.  These
reasons should prominently include to keep adults from hurting
themselves, as opposed to reasons of externalities, non-competitive
markets, addictions, children, or signaling games.  Sloppy incoherent
reasoning is not very useful (could be interpreted many ways), nor are
eloquent reasons that can't be plausibly argued to have had much
effect on the actual political process.

3) For this product, an authoritive source on the U.S. history of when
it was banned and why, preferably also comparing this across the
world.  For this purposes, "authoritive" includes recent, not
obviously partisan, and of high academic pedigree.

With these three things in hand, I think I can make a real change in
the thinking of economists and political scientists, toward seeing
such product bans as contrary to consumer interest.  And such an
intellectual change could have important political implications one or
two decades from now.  Any help folks could offer would be
appreciated, and acknowledged.

Hi.

I have one serious reservation regarding uploading
that appears to be a real issue.  As far as I can tell, information 
theory would prevent the possibility of uploading.  Someone please 
evaluate this and tell me if I am wrong.

Suppose you hypothetically uploaded a perfect clone of your brain 
structure to an Acme Ultracomputer X-1000.  This uploaded version of 
your brain is a conscious, very fast version of yourself running in 
cyberspace. 

As I see it, this would not be *your* consciousness that was 
uploaded.  What was uploaded was your memories, thoughts, etc., but 
your thread of consciousness still remains in your brain.  All you 
are doing by uploading is spawning a second thread of consciousness 
that thinks it is you.  The uploaded brain would have every reason to 
think it was you because every memory tells it that it is you.

Assume the upload process was non-destructive.  Your human brain (and 
consciousness) would walk away and continue to evolve on its own 
thread.  Your uploaded brain would also continue to evolve, but on a 
separate thread of consciousness.

Think of it as a piece of software.  If you create two copies of the 
same piece of software running on a computer at the same time, they 
may be identical and be in the same state initially, but they are not the 
same.  They occupy different places and have the opportunity to 
evolve independantly.

The problem is that people are viewing information as though it were 
physical matter. Information can never be moved, it can only be copied.
Uploading is the transfer of information.  The inability to move 
information (as opposed to copying) is a fundamental limitation of all 
information systems.


It appears that uploading should not be possible for these reasons.  The 
best we might hope for would be to augment our existing systems.

We can still live in a virtual world though with the laws of physics
altered at our whims and AI civilizations created and destroyed for your
entertainment. (Oh no! Here comes the AI civil liberties organization!)
In this scenario we do have the choice of either being a brain in a jar
with i/o streams feeding into a PC or we can augment our existing body
everyway we can think of and have a brain-PC interface builtin to our
genome such as communication with a PC via bat radar signals or tendrils on
the back of the neck which are a direct link to our brain. If this is true,
it doesn't matter much to me because I'd be satisfied with the 'greek god'
idea because I could still create entire universes in a virtual world as
well as have access to the continuously growing pool of human intelligence
plus gain immortality. Can silicon actually support life? If this is true
that we are required to 'move' data then Strong AI will never come about or
live in a quasi-consciousness where it continually lives/dies/lives/dies.
John, I'm looking for a reply on this one.

The gamut of variations on this theme is being explored by the brilliant
Australian sf writer Greg Egan in a series of stories and novels, especially
PERMUTATION CITY and the forthcoming DIASPORA.  Many stories in his
collection AXIOMATIC deal quite rigorously (or at least inventively) with
versions of this topic.  

My take: obviously a non-destructive copy of a functioning person is another
person.  (There's a sense in which the passage of time creates a
destructive, updated copy of each of us.)  If I were offered the chance of a
lethal injection in exchange for the creation of a perfect (or even
renovated) version of my phenotype, or ten or 100 copies for that matter, I
would mutter a very rude word and go home.  Frank Tipler's most absurd
sophistry in THE PHYSICS OF IMMORTALITY is his claim that a perfect
atom-for-atom emulation of you is continuous with you, hence *is* you, even
if it's built 100 billion years in the future.  Oh dear oh dear.

I work with (but not for) the FDA.  Both the FDA and pharmaceutical companies
are (so far) inhibited from bans and certain types of restrictions on
vitamins (nutritional supplements.)  Why?  Public pressure, political
correctness.  

The last time FDA was "talking" about more restrictions i.e. vitamins as
having prescription drug status, they had their telephone lines clogged for
weeks with irate citizens.  They backed down.

Even restrictions on the new "cosmeceuticals" (the crossover of cosmetics and
pharmaceuticals) was met with timidity by the FDA.  I went to 1996 Annual
Scientific Seminar on Cosmeceutical Trends in LA .   Dr. John Bailey, Branch
Chief Office of Cosmetics and Colors, FDA said no regulatory action will take
place at this time.  They don't have a definition for this category (yet).

The FDA usually reviews complaints first.  They have limited resources.  If
they get complaints they will take action.  Sometimes on individual companies
and sometimes on the whole industry.

The "safety first" type on complaint gets their attention this usually
involves adulteration and not complying with current good manufacturing
practices (cGMP).  They want to make sure the consumer gets 3 mg (usually
within a tolerance of 95-105%) when the package says 3 mg.  Also, the content
uniformity and dissolution of solid tablets is tested.  There are many more
things they can test for, but usually don't depending on the complaint.

The FDA doesn't care to ban these products because of political pressure.
 The pharmaceutical companies make money selling them but wished the
non-pharm. companies would "play fair" and comply with cGMPs (just as the
pharm. co. have to.)   So, I think false complaints are "generated" to get
the FDA to investigate. 

Efficacy takes a back seat to the above testing especially after the new
nutritional supplement and education act went into effect.  The United States
Pharmacopeia (USP) 23 cGMP sections are  where the drug and nutritional
supplement companies should look to keep FDA happy most of the time.  

To me the FDA really doesn't care what is available to the public as long as
they retain political correctness.   Remember when the law said all cosmetics
must be tested in animals?  But the public balked at the idea of hurting
rabbits.  The cosmetic companies I worked for said "We are going to

Being able to "jack in" to cyberspace is only marginally useful if 
you don't have the processing power to go with it.  Sure, you may 
have access to vast quantities of information, but if you are still 
processing it or thinking about it at tissue speeds then you aren't 
much better off.  It would amount to really nice visualization 
hardware/software.  You might be able to compensate by having AIs 
preprocess the information, essentially offloading some of the 
mundane thinking required, though.
     It might be possible for Strong AI to develop, but I don't think 
it would likely develop spontaneously on a dynamic network.  Part of this 
might just be a limitation in our thinking.  It is hard to build a 
stable information architecture or operating software on a system 
where your resource structure and capabilities is constantly 
changing.  Unfortunately, this is pretty much what the Internet looks 
like.  Sure, it is possible to build a distributed system where the 
software is running in pieces concurrently among a number of systems. 
You even get some level of fault tolerance this way.  But when 
building any type of really sophisticated distributed system, you 
usually have a very concrete idea of the structure and capabilities 
of the overall system.  As I said, it is probably possible for a 
Strong AI to develop on a dynamic network, but it is both beyond our 
capabilities to model this type of system and quite possibly beyond 
the capabilities of the operating systems currently running on the 
much of the network to coordinate in this fashion.  Bandwidth and 
latency is also an issue.  A distributed intelligence would require 
some level of synchronization between its distributed components to 
operate in any type of coherent fashion.  
Imagine if our neurons had to communicate with each other via UUCP!
The activity of a distributed network AI would probably look 
something like an ant colony.  Individual components are kind of 
stupid, but the components as a whole show considerable 
intelligence and direction.
     I think a more likely scenario would be an AI being developed on 
a structured secure network, and expanding into the internet from 
that point.  This would give the AI a secure static base from which 
to coordinate its consciousness.  It would also give its core entity 
a much higher level of data and process integrity.

     The problem with the human brain is that we are more or less 
locked into the architecture that biology gave us.  Even if we 
replaced every neuron with optical switches, we would still be 
limited by the architecture.  It would be like running a '286 
computer at 500MHz.  Fast, but very limited.

Subject: A Theory On Consciousness
Sender: postmaster@extropy.org
Precedence: bulk
Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

        What you are about to read has probably been said before.  I
apologize for any possible inconsistancies this post may have, due to my
constant scrambling to the door --it *is* Hallowe'en night!

        There has been a lot of signal bouncing around for the past few
months on this; signal --not noise-- dealing with consciousness and
knowledge.  Questions have been raised about the feasibility of two parallel
'selves' living at the same time.  In addition, there have been queries upon
putting one's consciousness onto a computer chip.  Can there be two lives at
once?  Can there be two 'mes'?  

        My theory on this (and please inform me if someone has their name
put to this) is that there *can* be two (or more) consciousnesses stemming
from one original consciousness.  However, the exact millisecond that the
second consciousness is conceived from the first, it has a new life; it is
its own and no-one elses.  Even though the prototype consciousness may think
that it has the same past experiences as the first, it truly has its own
life from the point of its conception.  

        In my opinion (and as far as I know), at the point of any
consciousnesses conception --be it from birth or post-conceptual copying--
there are a certain amount of chemicals in the brain that allow a
consciousness to be developed.  From that initial potential, every single
experience will add to the general consciousness.  

        Let me tie this back in with post-conceptual copying.  If my(?)
theory is true, then from the moment of the cloned consciousnesses
conception, it will *not* be the original.  It cannot be what already is.
The cloned consciousness will be only what it is, not what its creator is.
When the cloned consciousness 'comes to be,' it will have a radically
different view than what the original will.  It will feel the emotions of
fear and uncomprehension wheras the original will feel awe and probably
satisfaction.

        I've never been much of a scientist, but I've heard that a
consciousness can be created through a seemingly infinite amount of binary
1's and 0's.  I can only assume that there are thousands of binary numbers
added to the consciousness every millisecond.  The only time the conscious
mind is stagnant is either pre-conception or clinical death.  I wonder
whether or not there is any form of consciousness while under cryonic
suspension?  Hmmm.

        Now, of course, the only obstacle to cloning seems to be the actual
cloning process; in effect, putting the mind on a microchip.  If the last
paragraph is true, then I believe it will be possible to take one's
consciousness at a certain point and copy it.  Seeing as how this theory
states that the binary code constantly carries on, the 'consciousness donor'
(forgive my crude wording) will have to be content with cutting the code at
some point until the computer chip can process the consciousness.  From that
point, the consciousness is in a suspended state; like a genie in a lamp.
When the chemicals (or counter-
programs) are harvested to allow for a consciousness, the microchip can be
activated.  From that moment on, the consciousness will constantly have new
experiences added to it.  The biggest problem with *this* stem of my(?)
theory is that the microchip has to have enough room for its consciousness
to expand within.  In other words, the chip has to have a tremendous amount
of room to allow for consciousness expansion.  Another drawback is the need
for a dramatically high processing speed.

        This theory is a fair amount to chew on and mull over and --as I
said before-- I'm no scientist, and consciousness is a highly scientific
issue.  I do, however, think that this will be feasible within the next
fifty years.  Please pick apart this theory, as it is only intended to
explore one of the infinite possibilities...

Someone reminded me today that x-tians took over the pagan holidays. Bede 
mentions this as well. It was a policy of the church to pronounce 
traditional, native holidays as being x-tian holidays as well. This 
helped them turn the tide.

Perhaps extropians (or whoever) could learn from this and appropiate 
national holidays as their own.

They might get higher profits per unit, but the volume of sales 
would be much less.  What if a product (such as anabolic steroids) 
is taken off the market altogether?  Would you say this is a plot by the 
pharmaceutical companies to increase their profits?    

It's not even clear that the profit per unit would be higher if vitamins 
were prescription drugs.  Nobody has a patent on vitamins.   Most 
doctors would prescribe the cheapest generic vitamins they could find.  
This is exactly the kind of situation pharmaceutical companies want to 
avoid.   They can make a lot more money selling vitamins over the 
counter than they would make selling them by prescription.

This only applies to completely fungible products, and it assumes that 
there is no natural barrier to entry in the industry.

All producers?  I don't think so.  Some companies make a profit by 
differentiating their product from others, and creating a perception of 
uniqueness.

This in itself is not incredible.  I don't doubt that such things happen.  
However, I think you overstate your case, and hurt your credibility by 
doing so.  I also think you try to explain too much with one principle 
(conspiracy), instead of considering other explanations.  

> Are you familiar at all with the results of the

No.  And I think this is leading us pretty far afield.  

I think we should be looking in another direction for an explanation.  
I think it is a matter of belief systems, not profits.  There are still 
quite a few doctors who *believe* (to use Rich's favorite word) that 
it is superstitious, immoral, WRONG to take vitamins.  I want to know 
where that belief comes from, and what if anything we can do about it.  

I wrote  
:: We are trying to find a causal explanation of the fact that certain

to which James replied

Excuse me, but this is a non sequitur.  The WTO could just as well 
make a uniform world-wide rule that vitamins shall be sold over the 
counter.  The fact that they are trying to make uniform rules is irrelevant 
to the question of why they come down on that side of the issue -- 
and also irrelevant to the question of why vitamins are an issue at all.

Why do some people take it upon themselves to restrict our access to 
vitamins and other health-promoting substances?  It seems absurd, but 
there must be a cause.  

Maybe that's a sacred cow -- I always assume that there is a cause 
for whatever happens.  More precisely, I assume that the best way
to proceed in most situations is to look for causes.  This is something 
that I don't think I would be willing to question.

They would both be absolutely convinced that they were you because they would

I would certainly agree with that, I would even say that subjective 
experience is the only thing in life that is important, unfortunately the
only subjective experience we will ever be able to detect directly is our
own. Nobody can really believe that they are the only conscious being in the 
universe, so we must assume that when something acts intelligently it is
conscious. A corollary of that is that when something acts like me it is me.
                              

                >perhaps uploading to silicon isn't possibly


The only way that could be true is if the essential thing that makes me be me
can not be duplicated by any technology or even detected by the Scientific
method, in other words if the religious people are right and I have a soul.
Personally I would rate the chances that I have a soul as religions define it
at about the same as the probability that I am the only conscious being in
the universe.


                >Emulations are not as good as the real thing you know because

No. A Simulation may or may not be as good as the original because it uses
simplifications and approximations. A Emulation doesn't use such shortcuts and
is identical to the "original", in fact it is no longer meaningful to talk 
about originals and copies, both are original. My Emulation of Windows 95 
running on my computer is just as good as Windows 95 running on your computer, 
better if I have more powerful hardware.

Knowing your opinion on this subject, I hate to tell you this but, well, ....
the good news is that there is nothing fake about you, the bad news is that
you are a copy. You see, I have developed a pulse gamma ray laser that can 
make a hologram of the human brain, it does have the minor side effect of 
vaporizing the brain in question, but that is of little importance because
before that happens, due to the very short duration of the pulse, it obtains 
information on the position and velocity of every molecule in the brain. 
I used my machine on you last week, I then used Nanotechnology (I developed 
that in my spare time you see) to reconstruct you. I made you with different 
atoms, but that is not important, science can find no difference between one 
hydrogen atom and another, and even in the normal course of events all the 
atoms in your body are different from the ones you had a year ago. I finished 
the reconstruction of you less than 5 minutes ago and sat you down in front 
of your computer reading the Extropian list. Very soon your friends will start 
asking you why they haven't seen you for the last week, just tell them you 
went fishing or something.
