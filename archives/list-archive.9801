Umm, I believe I read an Analog speculative-fact article about foaming
asteroidal NiFe into (big, you bet) lifting bodies with a reasonable
(comparable to human free fall--ca. 200 MPH) terminal velocity back in the
1976-1983 timeframe. Part of the idea was that any significant hull segment
would have a specific gravity < 1.0, so even if it broke up at sea, the
pieces could be towed in. It was also claimed that aero heating should stay
well below the level at which any metal would burn off. 

The part of the author's claim I was most dubious about was the idea that
all the needed atmospheric guidance could be had by shifting the CG by
moving a mass around inside the hollow airframe. Nonetheless, I thought it
was cool back-of-the-envelope stuff.

Of course, like any ballistic mega-engineering, it's subject to a serious
NIMBY effect.

(solecism side comment: I originally mistyped the phrase above as
"ballsitic mega-engineering". :) )

I'm sure a Reader's Guide index search would turn it up.

While the Turing test is fairly safe from cheating, a responsibility
test carried out like a Turing test would be very susceptible to it.
You would not know whether the persons being tested tell you what they
believe or simply what you want to hear.

When AI systems will be available, you will of course have the tools
to read their whole minds directly, which would solve the problem above,
but this method would violate their rights.

Moreover, a responsibility test performed today would not give you any
certainty that the person would not turn bad in a year or so because of
certain influences.

Finally, if such a test came into existence, who would define what
would be ethically acceptable and who would assure that the rules of
the test would be adapted according to changes in the ethical standard?
Would it even be possible for the test not to lag behind the ethical
standard?

History will continue to be important in a society of immortal individuals for
two reasons: (1) The incompleteness of contemporary experience; and (2) The
educational needs of later-spawned individuals.  A couple of examples may
illustrate my first point.  Like many in my generation, I grew up with Winston
Churchill's History of the Second World War as the foundation of my
understanding of the events that served as the hinge of the 20th Century.  Due
to the seeming authority of his personal role in the events he described and
the undeniable power of his mastery of the language, Churchill's work molded
our views of WWII.  Unfortunately, large parts of it were self-serving
fiction.  After his death, people were willing to begin a full critique of his
account.  Furthermore, the disclosure of the Enigma materials cast a
completely different light on almost every strategic decision made by the
Allies, including especially Churchill's.

One of my own idols, Thomas Jefferson, provides another telling example on a
more personal level.  During his life and in the generations immediately
after, hagiography and counter-polemics of federalists and anti-federalists
obscured a clear view of the real person of Jefferson.  One of Jefferson's
most insightful comments, that "a man's letters provides the truest story of
his life" has ultimately provided the key to a more accurate view of the
private Jefferson which has, in turn, cast a more complete light on his public
life and that of his contemporaries.  Fawn Brodie's biography of Jefferson
(upon which the film "Jefferson in Paris" was largely based) would simply not
have been possible without access to all of Jefferson's private correspondence
and the letters of other people.  Although other factors (one of which you
identify below) might offset the effect of mortality on such candor, as things
have been up to now, it has been the death of the authors of such
correspondence that has made it available to us.

As for the second point, some individuals will continue to be truly newly-
spawned, as opposed to branching threads on the same identity-tree.  For those
entity-identities who come into being later, a knowledge of past events, i.e.
history, will be just as important as it is now.  They will want an accurate
account of a history to which they were not a party.

This may well end up having to take the place of the "mortality effect" on
historical candor.  I'm thinking of how Robert McNamara has in recent years
made a cottage industry out of revealing his own private knowledge on the
Cuban Missile Crisis and the Vietnam War.  Of course, one reason he has been
able to do this is that his bosses at the time are now dead.

The seminars McNamara has organized about the Cold War seem to be a good
example for how this might work.  They serve as good marketing devices for the
memoirs of the participants.  Perhaps disclosures by one key actor might end
up triggering counter-disclosures.  Naturally, I would be loathe to legislate
a "sunset" for all privacy, but limitations periods on specific causes of
action at law might well serve the same purpose.

I wonder whether we might not experience a new tension between personal growth
and development and reluctance to disclose the "sins" of one's youth ("ahh,
what a fool I was when I was a youth, a mere 200-year-old!)  For people in
"public life", it may be, as I describe above, that the desire to tell one's
own personal private story will trigger more or less full disclosure by most
of the participants in matters of wide concern.

These are good points, and ones I believe will be fascinating to watch unfold.
The sheer DENSITY of the historical record is growing exponentially, as data
collection and mass storage technologies advance.  I have pondered without
much insight the problems such a massive record will present to future
historians.  Instead of the challenge historians of most eras of the human
story have faced in the past, that of a too-small record requiring deductions
and interpolations based on largely theoretical mental constructs, future
historians will have the contrary problem of SELECTION from a perhaps too-rich
record, requiring the guidance of actors at the time.

More good points.  An immortal's conception of time will surely be very, very
different.  One of the fundamental heuristics of current historiography is the
"generation", a valid concept in many ways because the actors in one age
simply aren't the same actors in another.  With all of the difficult questions
of personal identity raised by constantly evolving but persisting individuals,
such a simple concept as the generation will become less and less relevant.

This would very cool indeed, but not this year, no. Unless that means to
define 'hybrid' very losely. Biosensors? Coating AFM cantilevers with

I've been talking with a molbio-friend of mine (he's sequencing archae) 
about using near-field proximal probe optics on fluorescent-tag-nucleotide
DNA polymerase reaction for sequencing purposes about a year ago. If we
can tweak polymerases into yielding current-reaction information & amplify
it to macro scales, cheap palmtop DNA sequencers would become possible.
Only a matter of time, this.

I'd rather hope it will be electronic. (Photopolymerizable) (multi-layer) 
Langmuir-Blodgett- Si wafer coating of liquid-mosaic engineered proteins
would seem the easiest route towards Si/molecular circuit hybrids. Most
likely, we'll see memories as first-generation instances of such
technology.

I hate to admit it, but I agree with Hara Ra.:)  Being in child abuse situations
myself, it is my recollection that physical abuse only taught the child that
whoever is stronger makes the rules: the grand lesson of dictators!

Also, when I was hit, I never thought I was wrong, I just thought I needed
to get even.

In the example that Mark D. Fulwiler used, of a kid kicking a cat into
unconsciousness, we should ask Why did the kid think this would
"work" as a solution to not getting his way?  I think it is because the
kid was spoiled already.  I've noticed that parents who abuse tend
also to spoil.  They go through cycles of heavy abuse and spoiling
permissiveness, often because they feel guilty about the abuse.
The child then grows up with unreal expectations -- he or she does
not know if any encounter will be injurious or indulgent.

I believe a few books have been written on these phenomena.

But that doesn't really address the problem. A lifting body would give you 
more control over where it hit the ground, but if a huge fast moving object 
is to come to a stop then the colossal kinetic energy in it must be 
transferred as heat to the Earth or its atmosphere. I'd rather rock absorb 
that mammoth force than the air, and if was a really big asteroid it wouldn't 
matter where it hit the ground.

Not necessarily. If you start to examine my innards without
permission, it would be a violation of my rights. But I can give a
doctor at least a temporary permission to examine my internal state,
and that does not violate my rights. So if you were an AI who wanted to
demonstrate your responsibility you could decide to temporary grant
the examinator access to your mind-states.

Note that we are not looking for responsibility here, but the ability
to understand and desire rights, with the responsibilities they
entail. There are plenty of people around who do not use their rights
(like free expression) in any useful way, but most of us would say it
is wrong to remove these rights unless they misuse them significantly.

These are important implementation issues. I'm not sure about the best
way of dealing with them, maybe a regular revision explicitely open
for general critique?

True. But it is hard to find sf that deals with the discoveries and
work being done *right* now. For example, what is the work in
micromachines leading to? Will it help develop nanotech, will it just
be expensive toys for graduate students, will it create a completely
unexpected industry on the mesoscale? There are simply too many fields
to explore, too much going on for the sf authors to do good
extrapolations. What I'm groping for is some kind of "review of
everything" that gives reviews of what is going on in many fields,
reviews of the reviews sugegsting how these might combine, and so on.

One method was used in Hamilton's _The Neutronium Alchemist_ (the
sequel to _The Reality Dysfunction_; some rather interesting
transhuman/biotech ideas together with space opera and an utterly
absurd menace). Ores are refined in space and turned into foam metal,
shaped into aerodynamical metalbergs. These metalbergs are then gently
dropped into the atmosphere, with the aid of a reusable engine
frame. They land in the ocean, where they are towed into a huge
disassembly facility where the metal is used. Needless to say, the
villains try to drop one such metalberg on top of the heroes... :-)

This sounds like great fun! What program was it?

(Hmm, might be a fun java applet for a transhuman website, a sketch of
possible future developments. Now link it to the Foresight

It would likely be significantly faster and denser than the chips. And
if we could tune the transition rules, then we could get lattice gas
dynamics with a wonderful resolution, or make universal computations
for real. Or just run the greatest Game of Life ever.

> What good is a microtubule? It has to be in water, no?

I think so. Normally the units form a cylinder, with a helical tiling
of the subunits (and some interesting stability properties; they are
dynamical structures, constantly being formed and dissolved at the
ends). The fun thing is that it is possible that the units flip
around, acting as a cellular automaton which can have all sorts of
dynamics. If this is used for the transport proteins (dyneins and
kinesines) that move vesicles along the microtubule is anybody's
guess. I really understand why some think microtubulu are "magical",
they are extremely subtle self-organized structures.

> Any other ideas for thin-film, nearly nanotech products?

What about using reaction-diffusion dynamics to create complex local
strucures? That might be useful to maximizing catalytic efficiency,
adapting to changes in the environment or changing color.

We might be able to do even better. Have a special-purpose machine 
that scans your mind and gives as output a binary answer to whether 
you are responsible or not. Then the memory of this machine is 
automatically erased and only the output remains. The subject to be 
investigated can be allowed to make any arrangements necessary to 
verify the validity and confidentiality of the proceedure.

Suppose such a machine existed for deciding with 100% accuracy 
whether somebody had commited a certain crime. It would then be hard 
to argue that the law enforcing agency did not have the right to 
apply this technique to any subject it wanted to (provided that it 
was quick and had no side effects). For to refuse the law enforcing 
agency the unlimited right to use this technique would be equivalent 
to refusing it to maximise its detection rate of criminals, even when 
no externalities were involved. What legitimate reason could anybody 
have for not wanting the law enforcing agency scan his mind with this 
device in order to find out if he had commited a crime?

Or do we perhaps *want* a certain failure rate of the law enforcing 
system, so that if the political systems lead to really screwed up 
laws, there will at least be some chance of escaping them and perhaps 
starting a revolution. Is criminality a little bit like random noice, 
so that a certain amount is beneficial since it makes the system less 
likely to get stuck in a "local maximum"?

Talk about global warming. However, considering that most of the earths
surface is water, even a drunk dart thrower in charge could put a rather
large tonnage in the drink rather than on someone's head. The trolley
sized ingot idea is the way to go. Merely dropping unrefined rocks to
earth is highly wasteful. Use solar energy to power magnetic induction
heated centrifugal refiners, as illustrated in Jerry Pournelle and
Charles Sheffield's sf book _Higher_Education_.

Better yet, why send any metal to earth at all??? Now that the Russian
metals industry is open to the marketplace, metals prices have hit rock
bottom, and since we aren't likely to have any huge world wars anytime
soon (wars are great for eating up metals), rigorous recycling programs
can help limit the need for new ores. Space based metal refining is
meant to eliminate the transportation cost of materials in space from
the present $2000-$10,000 per pound down to earthside commodity levels.
DOing this will open the door for large industrialization of space.

(ahem) My reply was mostly to Mr Genen, and I didn't want to confuse the

even "extroliberterian" ...

There are perhaps some functions that governments do now which may still
be best done by a government. I am not well read enough on privatization
to really argue this. There may be some global regulatory and military
functions which suit a governmental model. Others on this list are
invited to comment.

Casting this in less threatening terms, suppose you have a choice of two
societies to live in, one where you and everyone else voluntarily agrees
to allow themselves to be scanned whenever a crime has been committed in
order to decide who did it, and one where no such technology is used.
Which would you prefer to live in?

There is no need to argue that someone's refusal to be scanned is
illegitimate.  They may have their own personal or religious reasons for
not wanting their mind to be accessed in this way, and they are willing
to tolerate an increased crime rate as the cost for maintaining this
aspect of their privacy.  Each person's preferences can be accommodated.

As a practical matter, there would have to be some barriers to moving
between the two societies, so that one could not commit a crime in one
world and move to the other to escape detection.  Maybe there would
be a time delay or some considerable amount of red tape involved, or
perhaps emigrants from the scanning world would be required to submit
one last time to the machine to ascertain that they are not fleeing
after commiting a crime.

These worlds could be space stations, virtual realities, or even different
regions of the earth.  The requirement is that it should be difficult to
commit a crime in one world from the other one, so that people who agree
to the scanning benefit from the reduced crime rate.

Assemble really huge power storage devices (batteries, capacitors, 
whatever) and wrap them in something that will convert the re-entry

Oh exactly, however, concepts like enforceable personal sovereignty are
not recognized by the legal system we have, which indicates how little
weight the current legal system puts toward the idea of Natural Law. I
personally prefer the concept to the alternative, the force doctrine,
with the exception that I don't want to HAVE to beleive in an external
diety to confer those rights on me, but like the big bang, I don't
really see any alternative, so I live by the force doctrine. Since
devices like the Constitution were enacted as a result of the will (by
force) of a group of people to govern themselves, that is as close as
one can possibly come to my ideal at this present time. What I was
trying to point out with the references to that document was that the
statist document itself recognises that all rights an individual can
think of, that are not already enumerated elsewhere in that document, or
are not enumerated in a State Constitution the the individual resides in
(as permitted by the 10th amendment), do belong to and originate from
the people (i.e. individuals). Given this, I was pointing out how the
statists are not even obeying their own highest law in that they
routinely ignore the 9th amendment when it is to their best interest
(which is ususally all the time).

I don't see you or anyone else out fighting a geurilla insurgency
against the state, so don't tell me that I am blindly and willfully
bowing down to the state. I do act, on a daily or weekly basis, to
exercise those rights of which are presently most endangered in this so
called republic.

My point was that the fact that my father hit me a few of times (and on 
all occasions it was for a good reason) did not turn me into a violent 
person.(Actually, even most kids who really are abused do not turn 
violent-there is ALWAYS a choice involved.) I'm very happy you never 
have hit your kids. Good for you. However, do you really think your 
child rearing methods will work with any and all kids? At any rate, the 
idea that giving a kid a few whacks on the bottom once in a while 
(especially after the kid has been really bad, in this case he 
practically killed the family pet!) "perpetuates a cycle of violence" is 
just one of those cliches 
that I really don't find any empirical support for. How do you explain 
the low crime rates in the U.S. from 1932-60 when many, if not most, 
parents were giving their kids an occasional spanking?

Please note: I am not defending parents who cause physical damage or hit 
their kids for any idiotic thing.(I do not admire Joan Crawford in 
"Mommie Dearest.") And I have no problem with anyone who never, ever 
spanks their children. However, I really don't understand people who 
think that parents who have a different philosophy of discipline than 
they do are evil monsters who are turning their kids into sociopaths. 
Sorry, I don't buy it.

By the way, I don't have kids. "Good", I'm sure you are thinking , Mr. 
Ra.

Simple: The 5th Amendment. It is my right to not be forced to
incriminate myself. Scanning my innards with some whizbang device is
using technology to make me involuntarily incriminate myself. This is
also why you can't be forced to take a lie detector test. If you think
I've done something wrong, its up to you to prove I did it with evidence
that is external to me. I am innocent until you PROVE me guilty. I can
then, if I so choose, use your fancy device to counter your evidentiary
proof by volunteering to have myself scanned.

Now, in the case of an AI system wishing to prove its sentience and
attain some measure of 'human' status, the courts currently are bigoted
against anything that doesn't look like a human and can't prove a
natural birth. Note that with bans on cloning starting to appear, if one
is found to be a clone, one's humanity can be legally debated. I expect
that over time, this bigotry will go the way of the old parts of the
Constitution that stated that a black slave was only 3/5ths or so of a
man, etc. I don't know if we will have our own Clone Wars to push this
through.

Yes, perhaps it is good for the justice system to act as a filter,
weeding out stupid criminals. Unfortunately, with today's complex legals
system, it tends to devolve to who can hire the smartest lawyer.

On a similar note, I just won a legal victory against the City of
Seattle. They had been claiming for years that I was a resident of
Washington State, simply because I had once got a speeding ticket there
while stationed in the area in the Air Force. Everytime I was pulled
over after that, the cops would say that I was a resident, so my NH
drivers license was no good, and therefore my NH car insurance was no
good. SO it was typically an automatic $700 worth of fines every time I
was pulled over. SInce they would look stupid in court if they sent the
summons to my legal address in NH, they refused to use my legal address,
so I never got a summons. This caused multiple charges of Failure to
Appear to pile up in the docket, culminating in a suspension of my
license to drive in Washington, which screwed up my ability to renew my
license here in NH, and a charge of driving without a license in the 3rd
degree the last  time I was pulled over in Seattle. Well, I just got all
of the charges dismissed, and I am preparing to sue the city for the 2
years I've been without a license here in NH because their system was so
screwed up.

We almost have this now in the United States.

Ignoring the fact that nothing is 100% perfect, we do have technologies
that detect certain crimes to a very high degree of accuracy.  Drug tests
(high quality ones with lots of redundancy, not the cheap ones used for job
interviews) can detect illegal drug use in a body.  Fingerprinting can
detect presence at a crime scene.  Traffic stops can verify valid driver's
licenses and insurance.  Should we force everybody to undergo mandatory
drugtesting, fingerprinting and routine traffic stops to greatly enhance
the ability to detect certain criminals?  The current answer in the United
States is (theoretically) no.  We have to have reason to believe a person
is guilty before they are investigated in such a manner.  We do not
investigate everybody to make sure we catch the criminals.

My point is that this is not a theoretical question for the future.  We
have similar technologies now.  Are you proposing that we should submit to
these types of routine procedures today?

Not all crime is based on revenge.  I think most crimes are based on
personal desire or need.

- Theft, based on greed
- Fraud, based on greed
- Negligence, based on dangerous behavior
- Rape and Abuse, based on sociopathic behavior
- Tax and licensing and regulatory crimes, based on government paperwork
irregularities
- Victimless crimes, based on unapproved drug use, unapproved sex acts, and
unapproved entertainment.
- Skill limitations, practicing medicine or law or some technical expertise
without licensing.

Of course first: Happy new Year all !!

and yes.....I would like to kick off 1998, with a question ? :-)
(shigh.......of course I hear you think :-)

I tought the breakthrough was "the fact" that they could clone
a "grown" cell (and get a brand new sheep out of it)
, not the fact that they could clone !?

Or ......was it clear for everybody that Anders ment this part !? ;-)

For me:  it was sad to see, that this part was so largely left
out in the Media. All we got was "ban" the twins off Hitler

I don't know :-) Yes, I meant that cloning an adult differentiating
cell was the breakthrough. But having a real, photogenic animal (and
not just something squishy in a petri dish) was important.

> My wish for 1998: less Diana-emotions and more rational-love

How true. I'm definitely going to quote you.

Two messages illustrate the point I was trying to make about kneejerk
reactions.  Nick Bostrom proposed a hypothetical machine which would scan
a person and determine whether they had commited a certain crime, without
revealing any other information about them.  He asked:

It seems to me that both of these messages circumvent the main point,
which is whether this technology should be exploited (the messages made
other points as well, but I want to focus on the central issue posed
by Nick).  The messages appear to view Nick's proposal as a threat to
their freedom.  Michael Lorrey argues that the 5th amendment protects him
from being forced to submit to the device, while Harvey Newstrom also
describes the legal protections in the United States and asks whether
everyone should be forced to submit routinely to similar technologies
available today.  (He may be speaking rhetorically and in fact arguing
that we should not have to do so.)

Again, look at it not as a threat to your freedom, but as a choice.
As I wrote, imagine two societies, one where people voluntarily agree
to submit to these scans, and another where they don't.  (There could
be other cases, such as societies where people agree that they will be
scanned only if a court finds probable cause that they may have commited
the crime.)  Which one will you prefer to live in?  Will you voluntarily
agree to be scanned in this limited and specific way, knowing that by
doing so you will live in a world in which virtually all criminals are
caught, and hence that the crime rate is very low?  Much of the time and
effort you spend protecting yourself today could be saved, at the cost of
losing this part of your privacy.  Some people will accept the tradeoff,
while others won't.

The point is, by viewing Nick's proposal as a threat to rights and
protections you have today, you avoid the hard part of the question.
It's a knee jerk response.  Fifth amendment, legal protections, forcing
people to submit is wrong.  Fine, we can all agree about that.  But the
question is still there.  If it were done voluntarily as I described,
so that everyone involved was informed and everyone had agreed to the
conventions that would be followed, there are no legal problems and
no use of force or coercion.  Look at it beyond a shallow libertarian
analysis and you have to grapple with a much harder problem.

Personally, I am sensitive about my privacy, but I could see myself
agreeing to a rule that would allow scans under some circumstances.
I would not want to be subject to routine scans every time there was a
purse snatched or someone scrawled graffiti on a wall, but if there were
some mechanism to establish a reasonable chance that I had commited a crime,
then I could accept it.  I'd expect that this would virtually never happen
and so it could be tolerable.

Telomerase might not be the key for immortality. For example, the Galapagos 
Tortoise' cells also have a limited number of divisions and yet the members 
of the species appear not to age. Their cells also don't have telomerase. 
Why do you think telomers are the key to solving aging?

Some functions of government, such as persecuting people for victimless
crimes, should not be done at all.

Other functions can be privatized, as others have noted.  I see no limits on
this process.  Every legitimate government function was at one time done
privately.

For those interested in further reading on this matter, I suggest the following:
_The Enterprise of Law: Justice Without the State_ by Bruce L. Benson
_For a New Liberty_ by Murray N. Rothbard
_The Machinery of Freedom_ by David Friedman
_Welfare Economics and Externalities in an Open Ended Universe_ by
        Roy Cordato

I don't agree with all that is written in these works and they come from a
variety of viewpoints.  Benson applies public choice economics to the
realm of law.  Rothbard is a hardline Lockean rights advocate.  Friedman
is staunchly anti-rights.  Cordato argues from Austrian economics to why
there is no need, in principle, for a government.

However, despite their disagreements and differences in approach, they
all provide much food for thought.  The historical examples present in
the first three also bolster their theoretical arguments.

I'm not sure why you think we have circumvented the main point.  Not only
did we answer, but you summarized our answers pretty well.  You even givr
explainations for our answers.  I'm not sure how we could make our answers
any more clear.  We don't want anyone scanning us against our will.  Doing
anything to us against our will is a threat to our freedom.

You seem to propose a voluntary system where each person can choose whether
to be scanned or not.  But when we choose an answer different than yours,
you suggest that our answers are less valid and that everyone should choose
the same answer.  This does not sound like an argument for a voluntary
system of personal choice.

I agree that telomerase might not be the "immortality gene" but could you
provide a reference to support your statement that Galapogos tortoises
don't appear to age. I thought they just had a long lifespan?

What bugs me about this thread is the number of people who don't seem even
academically interested in what the kid's makeup and/or upbringing was
like, up to that point, such that kicking the cat seemed like an
appropriate thing to do.

_Something_ is/was clearly messed up. The reported timeslice is, in my
view, much too narrow to tell _what_.

I'm not defending anyone in the described scenario--just wondering at
others' snap judgements. "Spoiled" is not a label that makes sense to me
here. Then again, I never use it myself. *Shrug*

I don't know about the tortoises, but there are some species that do
not age, most notably some fishes and lobsters. They do not age, and
just grow slowly larger until an accident or lack of food does them
in. I don't have Leonard Hayflick's _How and Why We Age_ here, but he
discuss this subject.

"A nation which would surrender some freedoms for some measure of
security shall wind up with neither." - Benjamin Franklin

Yes, 1930's Germany traded freedoms for security from their paranoid
fears of jewish conspirators, and Russians from 1917 on traded their
freedom in its entirety for a greater measure of economic security, and
look what it got them, and the entire world for that matter. No thank
you.

Of course you can't ever get 100% of the people to agree on anything,
even something as simple as what kind of pizza to order, so you are left
with forcing somebody to involuntarily waive their rights, or you will
wind up making those who exercise their right to not submit into instant
social pariahs, since while the presumption of innnocence is the
standard in the legal system, it is the opposite in society. If I refuse
to be scanned then in the mind of society, I am already guilty,
otherwise why would I refuse? This is the typical argument used to
indirectly incriminate defendants and witnesses in courtrooms, no matter
what the judge says, the jury will put weight to it.

Ah, a law with no teeth. SO you are talking about phantom security, not
real security. Political puppeteering. Why waste the bandwidth???

Some areas much more so than others, but it is definitely having a

Nope, but other than *really* good armour (my preferred solution) it's
about the only last resort of any use against anything larger than a duck.

If the victim was armoured effectively it could be quite amusing to be set

Or rapid attacks.  There are plenty of instances where the aggressors flee
the scene before help arrives, in instances like this it might be able to
identify the attackers and have them suitably punished, but that is of
little comfort while the attack is taking place, I'm sure.

Holding a phone up and saying eight of your friends live one block around
the corner, and your finger is on the "dial" button, can be a useful
deterrent sometimes.

There's a better example in his "Diamond Age" but I forget what they were
called....

It's an example which has often appealed to me, but the problem lies in
having your phyle (what is the origin of this term, BTW?) defend your
widely dispersed interests in territory owned by others. How does the
cavalry get past the border patrol to rescue you?

The plans for a first gathering of Midwest Extropians
in Chicago on Saturday, 10 January 1998 are moving
forward. Anyone interested in this should follow this
thread backward and contact me at
mesmith@rocketmail.com.

While we have been slow to pick a location for this
gathering, I hope that now that the holidays are over
and we are a mere eight days away, progress on
reaching a decision will be swift. (A more detailed
message will be sent to the people who have expressed
interest in attending.) Happy New Year!

Actually home medical devices are a very popular market, ever since
the first home blood pressure kits became available, and of course
home pregnancy tests, and now, home cholesterol tests. I guess not
so surprising in this hypochondriac society of ours where people go
running to the doctor for antibiotics at the first sniffle.

Two of the more recent popular devices, a device that gives instant
temperature readings by reading it off the inner ear, and a new
device that uses a combination of infrared/ultrasound to detect
fluid buildup in the inner ear.

These make very extropian gifts by the way, and especially for
friends with young children.

I think these area's (home testing equipment and kits) will
continue to show above average growth. I will be investing
accordingly.

Funny you should mention  "The Diamond Age", I have it at my elbow
(re-reading) Are you refering to the neo-Victorians, the Ashanti,or
one of the many other "Phyles" mentioned.

I don't recall what phyle is short for, if I remember I'll let you
know. If you recall from the book our skull gun packing friend Bud
assaulted a member of the Ashanti (who were a tribe and not just a
phyle) as a result of which a large team of Ashanti flew in and
searched out the perpetrator, and placed him under "personnel
arrest". They immediately sought out the proper authorities and you
recall the rest. (no spoiler here) This is one possibility.

Nicely done I might add.

In addition to the 5th Amendment (Michael Lorrey) and personal or
religious reasons (Hal Finney), which are both good arguments against
such a machine, there is always the danger of fraud.  You will not
have the certainty that the state (or a corrupt employee) does not
use the information gathered in the mind scan against you. Even if
the state wouldn't do it, perhaps the firm which created the scanning
machine left a trap door in it so they could sell mind scans.

Please keep in mind that a mind scan includes your whole personality,
preferences and memory.  I would certainly not want my mind scan to be
stolen.

The Ashanti I think. As I recall they were stateless (?) but would rapidly
congregate in support of a citizen, or to avenge the citizen, if such were
the case.

I may be wrong about the statelessness of the phyle. There was also the
distributed nation who kidnap one of the characters, which strikes me as
being very close to an ideal nation, if you feel you need to belong to some
sort of extended social grouping for defense or other purposes.

> I don't recall what phyle is short for, if I remember I'll let you

My brother is in a mediaeval re-enactment group, doing viking stuff
(Varangian Guard stuff, actually, but anyways), and they train in "files",
a "file" being (I think) seven men and a "file" leader. It's seven or eight
or so.

Curious. I thought it might be a biological term, or some sort of
graeco-latin phrase.

aha! Yes. But did they have an actual state? I seem to recall that they
were more of a mobile distributed mutual self-defense league, or federation
of independent individuals.

> Nicely done I might add.

It set off all sorts of idea-storms in my head, that book. Aside from being
a fairly good author, he excels in coming up with new ideas as well as
making established ideas seem very familiar and commonplace, which made the
whole book hang together as a very believable near-future story.

According to my Liddel & Scott's Greek dictionary:
  _ _
phyle (phi ypsilon lambda eta): a race or tribe; a body united by ties of
blood and descent, a clan.
                __
Brom the verb phuo: produce, beget, engender, generate, bring forth.

I would like to see some sort of organism-wide testing device that could
monitor people closely so that they could tailor their life extension programs
to ongoing changes in their bodies.  Of course, there is much research to
be done, but such a device could provide lots of data -- if enough users
are willing to share it.

I'm sure someone has come up with the idea before.  Has anyone heard
of it?  And why has it not been built?

As a practical aside, which specific dimensions would be most useful to
measure?

>These make very extropian gifts by the way, and especially for

Good idea!  Getting people familiar with having/using such devices not
only helps to spread our ideals but demystifies medicine and medical tech.

There is another kind of fraud possible:

I have a box. 
I put your best friend in the box and a red light comes on. 
I say this means your best friend is guilty. 
Your friend is put to death.
You have my word that the box and light does what I say it does. 
When I put myself in the box, the red light never comes on.

Hmm, Joe Stalin had one of those. He even made a point of getting signed
confessions.

Another problem: someone commits a heinous crime, then doses eirself with
(say) a Rohypnol-Scopolamine cocktail that scrambles long term memory
fixation. Chemically-induced amnesia. What does a brain scan reveal?

"Quis custodiet ipsos custodies?" ...not to mention "Truth? What is truth?"

record will present to future historians.  Instead of
the challenge historians of most eras of the human
story have faced in the past, that of a too-small
record requiring deductions and interpolations based
on largely theoretical mental constructs, future
historians will have the contrary problem of
SELECTION from a perhaps too-rich record, requiring
the guidance of actors at the time. >

In another recent thread, I mentioned my research
into the movers and quakers of the 'Nation of
Nantucket' (Nathaniel Philbrick's _Away Off Shore:
Nantucket Island and Its People, 1602-1890_).  The
interesting thing about Nantucket for this thread is
that the people were mostly related to each other,
and had been for almost 200 years (a condition that
might also become very applicable to a society of
Uploads, especially if cloning becomes popular). 
Each family (or "phyle") had to continue doing
business with the others while knowing about some
unsavory skeletons in their closets.  They had, of
course, had their share of feuds and asset/liability
disputes.  For example, during the American
Revolutionary War, many Nantucketers were
opportunistic smugglers and not always sympathetic to
the American colonies' desire for independence.  This
continued even through the War of 1812.

By the 1830s, the feuds and allegations were
threatening to tear the island's long-standing and
unique social structure apart. In 1835, Joseph C.
Hart wrote a 'novel' called _Mariam Coffin or the
Whale-Fishermen_.  Most of the characters were
historical persons, but various fictional licenses
were taken - such as condensing the scope of history,
merging several characters together, etc. 
Descendants of many of the historical persons
collaborated with the author to produce a quasi-myth
that romanticized some of the more unsavory elements
while also spreading their ancestor's most virtuous
legacies more evenly among the various families.

The publication of Hart's novel helped to heal many
of the rifts that had built up during some difficult
historical periods.  It was also accompanied by the
much more accurate, though still selective, _History
of Nantucket_, co-authored by two elders of the
warring factions. We see a similar sanitization and
dramatization of history in recent movies such as
Disney's "Pocahontas" and Spielberg's "Armistad".

In a future of immortal 'persons', or 'teleological
threads', especially in light of the deluge of
historical data that will be accessible, a 'mythic'
view of history might become even more widespread,
especially for those who aren't scholars of history. 
(Though I suspect that endless genealogical and
historical forums will also become an enduring
entertainment industry for a society of immortals.)

Still, in the situation I describe above, the ability
to 'move on' flowed from the passing of older
generations.  Perhaps, in an immortality milieu,
eventual, if not constant, self-transformation will
have to substitute for these generational tides.

 It's quite interesting; it seems fair that a person should not have his income taxed
by more than one territorial authority.  If there should be one taxing authority, that
must be either the one where the person lives, *or* the one where he has his citizenship.
The IRS seems to want money in both cases.
In Russia now different authorities often demand taxes from a business whose total
exceeds 100%.  So nobody conducts business legally...

  On the name for the non-territorial entity:  "Earthlings" and other global sounding names
do not seem appropriate, as they imply uniqueness of this entity.  Some day there will be
many of them though, with names reflecting their origins and goals. Names like "First
Distributed Republic" or "Unbound Extropians" may be more appropriate.

All "crime" is based not on the act, but our need to punish it. 
Without that need then we can use any negetive experience that happens
to us as reason to improve.  Also, many of the reasons criminal (or
unwanted) behaviour occurs is because of the legal system (and our
need for revenge) and the fact that many people seem to think the
world owes them something (perhaps because we keep telling them it
does - the attitude of "..this is not right" causes much of what we
consider wrong.)

I would suggest you look at the concept of a "PT" (Perpetual Tourist,
Post Taxpayer, etc.) There are many references on the net and texts. The
plan is to divide your life into components so that one state does not
"control" you. In practice you would hold a passport of convenience or
two, work in or out of another tax free haven, bank in another,  hold
your assets again in another and live where you wish but not long enough
to be considered a resident there. US Citizens with significant assets
would need to take great care and time to successfully accomplish this.
Practically speaking you would need to have a portable profession and
the infrastructure is expensive so the payback period to recover those
costs could be years.
While I personally know the PT structure is viable and  accomplished  I
also know many more try than succeed.

But not all justice is revenge, nor does all law seek to attain justice,
and given the existence of unenforced blue laws and the concept of civil
disobedience as a social responsibility, as well as all of the
non-criminal regulations, not all unlawful behavior is therefore
criminal.

Yes, I've read these anecdotal accounts about the lack of aging in some
fish, sharks, and lobsters - but I cannot find any real scientific
articles on the subject. This is a pity, because if this phenomenon is
real, then it should be looked at very closely. Maybe aging is linked to
terminal cellular differentiation, which in turn limits body size. Having
a small body is an evolutionary advantage in some ecological niches. 
Judging from the size of some dinosaurs, maybe the unlimited body
size/immortal phenomenon existed long ago, and some prehistoric animals
lived hundreds of years! Some huge trees even live thousands of years!

I think we disagree on what constitutes child abuse. I do not consider a 
few whacks on the butt after a kid has just about killed a cat (an 
action that I believe would be considered a crime in all states) to be 
abuse. Now if this father hits his kid 5 times a day for any old reason, 
well, then I might agree with you. 

I also believe that parents should have broad discretion regarding how 
they raise their kids, not because they are stronger , but because they 
are paying the bills! If that includes an occasional whack on the butt, 
I'm not going to interfere.

Well, were you wrong? If so, I guess being hit was not effective. When I 
got belted, it was always for a good reason and it impressed on me (pun 
intended) the fact that if I misbehaved there would be unpleasant 
consequences.

Well, maybe. However, there are excellent parents who sometimes have 
problem children despite their best efforts. I would be interested in 
why the kid kicked the cat, but wouldn't you agree that the kid should 
get some punishment (and a severe one at that) for this really vile act? 
Shouldn't actions have consequences? If not, I'm afraid this awful 
little kid may be in Juvenile Hall at age 14 for murder.

Ive just finished reading 3001: The Final Odyssey, which attempts to
present a world 1003 years from now.  Arthur C. Clarke fails
admirably, but one line will stand out to anyone even vaguely familiar
with the singularity  Certainly, the people of 2001 who you were
just watching would not feel as utterly overwhelmed in our age as
someone from 1001 would have felt in theirs.  This comes from a 3001
new-millennium celebration television show.  If progress is truly
exponential a person from 2001 transported to 3001 would several
billion times more overwhelmed than a person transported from 1001 to
2001.

Even 20 years from now computers will be a millions times more
powerful, you couldnt even begin to imagine what to do with that kind
of power (full sensory network Quake?)  If we just think about fully
entertaining the visual senses (using ubiquitous Augmented Reality),
youve created what any one of us would perceive as magic in 10 to 20
years.  But dont forget the rest of our sense, the ability to see,
touch, smell, taste and hear anything our high power computers can
generate anywhere anytime.  It wouldnt be hard to imagine a sensory
wish machine that can be completely invisible, yet read and interpret
your every vocal command, movement, and gesture and seamlessly overlay
whatever information you need.  Full sensory magic!

Looking at politics we can already see the Internet undermining local
governments, what authority they have over their small areas cannot
stop globally connected citizens from accessing whatever information
they want.  We are heading rapidly (more rapidly than I dare to guess)
to what I see as a pre-anarchic state, where government still exists
but it feeds the chaos rather than trying to impose order on it.  And
everyday I hear more and more extropic thought coming from the most
unlikely of places (personally I dont think we have to worry about
spreading the word  just be there when people start looking to
further their perception.)

Although I could go into reams of text about nanotechnology,
biotechnology, medicine, cloning, thats already being covered by more
qualified list members in other threads.

Forrest -

Can you provide some information on the animated planner and 3D chart that
you mentioned.  This kind of visualization software sounds like it something
of interest to many of us challenged with presenting complex interrelated
information.

gives a more "gut' feel for progress than a 2D chart.

I'm not sure about animals living that long, but I've heard of certain plants
that do, but their lifestyle is clonal -- asexually reproductive.  So, it's
hard to
draw a line between generations.  How many philodendrons might have a
similar stab at eternity?

Anyway, I've also heard, but can't recall where, that long lived plants also
have higher quantities of antioxidants, which vindicates current chemical
life extension therapies -- if you happen to be a plant.:)

My point is that if things get that far, there is probably no hope for the child
anyway.  Some corporal punishment might avoid him from doing it in front
of his parents again, but the child has already demonstrated he has little
value for life and is willing to lash out at innocents.  My question: since most
kids don't do this sort of thing, why did he?

I never claimed I'd interfere.  There is a difference between believing
something is wrong and believing it should be forcibly prohibited.  I
often think wholesale slaughter of politicians is wrong, yet I doubt I
would lift a finger to stop it.  (OK, I would cheer it on!:)

At least your parents were consistent then.  My own experience, and not
mine alone (I also mean seeing how other abusive parents behaved) was
that punishment was inflicted for any number of reasons and almost never
fit the crime in its intensity and duration.

I agree here.  Of course, something should befall the child.  I just hate to
see these things brought up as isolated incidents.  Sometimes, parents
do have a problem child and only massive intervention might ever change
that, but I feel in most cases this is not so.  I think the family is the
training
ground for how the child deals with the rest of the world and life.  Ergo,
that's why I ask why that child would do what he did.

Do you really think a few beatings from now 'til then will change his

The one that first comes to my mind is Mazlish and Faber's _How to Talk
so Kid's will Listen and How to Listen so Kid's will talk_ (or is it vice
versa?).  It proved helpful in my life.

Anyway, would you be willing to admit there must be some limits on the
ways and intensities of force used by parents?  I'd hate to see someone
say, "Hitting is okay, therefore the next time Junior steals a strawberry
from the fridge, I'm going to beat him into a coma."

Maybe it would be helpful to create a detailed table/overview of species
which do not age, including their habitat. Parallels?

"How and Why We Age" by Leonard Hayflick, page 21 of the first edition.
He claims that animals such as some fish, amphibians, and reptiles (like
the Galapagos tortoise) appear not to age -- they don't age at all or
age so slowly that we are not capable of determining it.

Erik wrote on the same subject (and my reply also applies to what Tony
B. Csoka wrote):

It's a good idea, but I would focus on their evolutionary path rather on
their habitats. For example, do you know that mammals can't produce
ascorbic acid (a powerful anti-oxidant)? Little mistakes like that might
be behind aging! And did you know that the Galapagos Tortoise's cells
have more anti-oxidants than our cells (also taken from Hayflick's
book)? There are many other interesting phenomenons, I'm actually trying
to make a list of them (will be probably ready in a couple of months).

The only site I know in the Internet that mentions non-aging species
with some detail is my own. The URL is:

I'll post one tomorrow (promise) when I get to my office and can look
it up in Hayflick. I recall that most of the apparently "immortal"
species were aquatic, and most were "primitive".

It seems to me that it is likely (I'll check this) that the species
that are "immortal" live a fairly dangerous life but where it is
possible to find safe niches. Then selection would favor long-lived
individuals who produced offspring all life. For other animals the
basic strategy is simply making sure enough offspring survive, and the
fate of the parents after that is irrelevant; genes leading to a
gradual breakdown but increasing survival in adolescence would be
promoted. Of course, this means we can gradually select away at least
some aspects of aging by not having children before 30, then 40, then
50... (but I doubt anybody here has the patience for that scheme :-)

It's not just clonally reproducing plants that live that long. For
example the giant sequoia trees in California which can be up to 300 ft
tall and 40 ft in diameter, can live up to 2000 years! It that just
because of antioxidants?

This is likely true. "Immortal" animals never stop growing, but they
slow down their growth more and more (a logarithmic growth curve). But
size is determined by other factors too, so one shouldn't take it to
mean body size determines maximal lifespan (there is a correlation,
some power law, but I don't recall it right now).

I will buy Hayflick's book and check it out. I just hope he gives some
references to real scientific publications, or shows results of his own
work.  I am very interested in this story. As far as I know, though,
Galapagos totoise cells do have a limited lifespan in culture - they are
not immortal. I have not seen results for reptile, lobster, or fish cells
grown in culture.

maybe, but you've also got to realise that we are familiar with change, and
to some extent comfotable with it.  Back in 1001 change just didn't come
along all that often.

We *expect* things to be wildly different 1,000 years from now, but they

I started working on an essay on this very issue which I never finished,
but I coined the term Collective Autonomous Zone (CAZ) to describe a
grouping who are not very autonomous taken unit by unit, but as a group
are more than capable of acting as a national unit.

Okay, so I had recently read Bey at the time  :-)

I have been wondering about living for ever and ever. That if I was
uploaded and running a Gazillion times faster than now, and living
Billions of times longer than now.

Wouldn't life at some point get boring?

As far as I can see the solution is to not only become a weak super
intelligence. But to actually become more intelligent.

As I am now, the only things that i find interesting are the things I
find hard. Compare something like tic tac toe to chess. Any adult
playing tic tac toe and concentrating about it can hardly loose. At the
same time chess is a very complex game. The rules are a little harder,
but the main challenge comes in the complexity of the system and all of
the possible variations.

I find things interesting right now that animals doesn't. Storytelling,
Pretty pictures, music, science, philosophy, mathematics (well sort of),
Probably as a >H i will find things interesting too that I can't even
comprehend or fathom right now. Therefore I think it will be a long time
before I will get bored.

Thus Max M's first rule of >H ;-) is:

As i get more intelligent and understands the problems I currently have,
i will find new and interesting problems.

I Look forward to chess being as transparent to me as tic tac toe is
right now, and me playing some kind of 1000'th dimensional checkers.

Or maybe then I will still try to understand my own mind which will
probably race ahead of my "self" in complexity.

It's a little problem I have been puzzling with.

In the future when all we >H are uploaded and racing along at our own
speed, we will have a serious interface problem. Personally I am looking
forward to "the far side party" and am eager to participate. The only
problem is in the assumed exponential scale of development that all of
my backups and clones will have, as they race through the galaxy.
Exponential growths leads to exponential growth in difference. Thus my
(or should I say "ours" about me and the clones?) backups will have very
different speeds.

How on earth are we gonna dance at the party? With so different
perceptions of time, Pitch and tempo will seem different to me/us all.

This leads to a more general problem. How are we going to share our
memories at the far side? Speech is out of the question I think. Way to
slow and imprecise. Being uploaded as I/we are and converted to pure
information processing, there must be a better way.

We need to store what we have in common at the time of cloning, only
then can we compare our differences in some kind of meaningful way. I/We
should then be able to share those differences and have a distributed
collective memory with multiple backups, which can then race along to
"the really far side party" on the other end of the universe. Wherever
that may be :-)

Perhaps we should develop a generic human definition, so that all
interested transhumans, not only one self and clones, can share memories
and experiences? Sort of an icky thought. But who knows how a transhuman
will feel?

The "Human Core Definition" will be the smallest possible subset of
self. Probably the memories and feelings of each >H at the time of
uploading, stored in a well defined manner, and with some kind of
transmission protocol built in.

This would allow us to make a clone, slow down it's speed and experience
the farside party in some kind of real-time with others. When the
party's done, the clone can be merged with the other clones and be part
of the collective memory.

It would even make it feasible for some >H clones to stay on earth and
help out in something approaching human standard time. When they have
done their "tour of duty" they could then share the collective memory
and their own experiences could become part of the collective memory.

Thus my idea is to have a Human Core Definition that is endlessly
extensible with the memories and experiences of clones / Backups /
Agents / self, or whatever we choose to call them. Then we wouldn't need
to have every experience ourselves but could share others. Or wouldn't
that be us self after sharing... Hmm?

whew!!! sorry for the lengthy post. Had i had more time It could
probably have been shorter. (Wasn't that Mark Twain who said that?)

This line of thought reminds me of a short story I read... Can't remember if
it was by Asimov or Phillip K. Dick or Rudy Rucker or someone else along
those lines,  but it was about an evolutionary robot/computer that knew
everything and was to be immortal - and turned out in the end to be
suicidal.  I can't quite remember the exact details... maybe someone else
can fill this is for me...

Got news for ya: government is inherently adversarial - if it weren't,

where every action is a defeat for somebody.

Regardless of public good arguments, I expect any justice system

i.e. no disputant gets an advantage over others on account of some

No,  I'm pretty sure it was something else.  The robot went through a
whole bunch of commands so that someone particular could get to it's
mainframe so that he could be killed or something - my mind's a bit foggy
on the stuff I had to read in tenth grade... but I'm pretty sure it wasn't
Marvin.

While the boy did something wrong, something about the
BELT makes me wonder whether the father had taught the boy to act that way.
(Besides, on whose word do we have it that it was the boy who hurt the cat?)

We can?  What local governments are you thinking of?  For the US I
associate the term with cities, or at best states.  I haven't noticed
the Internet undermining these, or them attempting to restrict
information.  California is moving to embrace the Internet, which may
allow for stronger and better government through greater
accountability.

Elsewhere... it'd be nice for China to collapse, but it has yet to
happen.

These WA pigs. They said that since a) I was a stockholder in a WA
corporation, that made me a resident (even though the articles of
incorporation signed by the secty of state recognised my NH residency)
and that since I had a 'record' of a ticket, that that made me a
resident, even though I was registered to vote in, and kept my legal
residence in and DL in NH.

Well, even here, in Lebanon, NH, a lot of people work in vermont but
live in NH and have to deal with vermonts income tax. I'm currently a
contractor to a vermont located company, but since my office is in NH
and they have a post office box in Hanover, NH, I get all of my checks
paid to me through a bank account that is on their hanover PO box. A lot
of people in this area who both live and work in VT get a NH post office
box for a year to establish residency and to try to work this dodge.

I know that Washington State is a bit rabid about claiming as many
residencies as possible since there is a loophole in their sales tax
that exempts residents of states that have no sales tax (New Hampshire
happens to be one of the 8 remaining, which was the main reason for my
doing my utmost retain my NH residency, outside of coming from a state
with the cool motto of "Live Free or Die", for a while there in Seattle,
freinds were calling me "Sales Tax Mikey" since they were asking me to
make purchases for them... he he.), and the citizens do as much work
trying to get out of the consequences. Most southern Washington state
residents try at one time or another to get an Oregon address
established. One guy even got elected to the state senate in WA, but got
caught later having an Oregon registered car (which he stupidly used to
commute to Olympia for senate sessions).

PT sites would start with the one who coined the phrase, W. G. Hill at
www.britnet.co.uk/scope/, that is Scope International. Then for the
latest texts, PT Shamrock at www.ptshamrock.com/ , look at "What did
happen to W.G. Hill". I have to mention Adam Starchild since it was
through him I was introduced to extropians he is at
www.cyberhavens.com/starchild/, his website is titled " Living Without

all components. 
Trust this gets you started and good luck.

That bothered me a lot, I just didn't comment.  The little snot should be
spending every weekend and vacation till his 18th birthday cleaning cages and
feeding animals at the humane society.  for his birthday, he gets a suitcase

I can think of several reasons for not wanting the police to scan my mind:

1) I'm guilty, I committed the crime. 
2) I did not do it, but I don't believe the "crime" in question is a bad   
   thing so I don't want to do anything to help its enforcement. 
3) I did not do it and I think the law is just, but I think such brain 
   scanning can lead a society to disaster so I don't want to encourage it. 
4) I have no confidence in the accuracy of the procedure.

In the present day I have no confidence in the procedure, so I would only  
consent to a lie detector test if I was guilty of the crime. I read of a good 
way to beat the machine, put a tack in your shoe. They always start with 
innocuous control questions to get a base line, "Is your name John K Clark?" 
I jab my toe with the tack and say "yes", "do you have twin sisters?" I jab 
my toe with the tack and say "yes", " are you 6 feet 3 inches tall?" I jab 
my toe with the tack and say "yes", then they get down to business, "did you 
kill Mr. Smith?" I do NOT jab my toe with the tack and say no.

Because of this the first thing I do every day when I get up in the morning  
is put a tack in my shoe, after all, you never know. If you lack my foresight  
try biting your lip.


        >Hal Finney <hal@rain.org        
        >the main point, which is whether this technology should be exploited     
   

I agree, and my answer is no. A machine that could translate the states of 
neurons in my brain into memories and intentions and emotions and ideas is 
pretty sophisticated, we call such a machine a "mind". I can think of a lot 
of questions my lawyer would like to ask such a mind, "You say Mr. Clark 
committed the murders, not O J Simpson as most assume, because he has a 
memory of the crime, but couldn't this memory just be Mr. Clark imagining 
what the crime must have been like based on what he read in the newspapers?" 
and "is there  any reason you want Mr. Simpson to come out of this looking 
good" and "Do you personally dislike Mr.Clark and want to see him suffer?".
Naturally my lawyer would demand that all technological means available be 
employed to determine if the mind's answers were truthful, and naturally that 
would lead to an infinite regress.

Assuming for the sake of argument that the technology works as advertised 
I'd still much rather take my chances with being the victim of crime. 
Consider the alternative, anything, literally anything that Big Brother says 
is exactly the way things are going to be, if he say's nobody must ever think 
bad thoughts about the government then in actuality nobody will ever think 
bad thoughts about the government. Not ever.

The trouble is that if the powers that be become totalitarian, and history  
tells us that sooner or later they will, then that's the way things will stay 
for eternity . Nothing could ever change, revolt would be impossible.

What we do know is that most violent people were treated violently as
children. I agree that occasional punishment as you describe is unlikely
to be harmful, and my point is that there are often better alternatives.

Go back and read Alice Miller. I am not convinced that decisions made in
childhood represent true choices.

Your posting certainly had the rhetoric which comes from those who
espouse abuse as justified.... So I reponded to that.

I think violence statistics have many more causes than occasional
spanking. I can't remember the logical fallacy here, does someone on the
list know the name of it??

I think you are reading more into my post that what I was saying.

Well if you ever do so, be sure to examine the nonviolent child rearing
options available so you don't have to whack them...

No reason to use huge objects with reentry. One ton objects can reenter
easily, be readily recoverable and if over an empty landing zone (pick
the desert of your choice) unlikely to damage much.

No way to do that. And kinetic to thermal to electrical is not an
efficient method. I have read proposals where the KE was absorbed by
"catcher" satellites which used a reverse form of mass driver. However
the guidance precision needed is extreme.

Rights of the accused seem to function mostly as insurance against
law-enforcement error. If the entire law-enforcement process as a whole is
100% accurate, then there may be no reason for the accused to have
rights. But 100% accuracy is impossible. Even if the probability of error
is very small, it may be that most people are risk-averse enough to want
the accused to have the right of refusing being scanned.

Another possible answer is that we want law-enforcement to be less
efficient, not more. In an ideal world where all relationships are
consensual, no law (unless it's unanimous) would be enforceable.

If you could extract a single bit from someone's mind-state, what would
the bit encode, and whose mind would it be?

Um, no.  Someone can exploit information in a harmful way without 
ever revealing that fact -- and it can be quite obvious that some one 
of several hundred people is exploiting information, but not 
sufficiently obvious *which* one to justify scanning *any* of them.

Here are the rules under which I would consider allowing such a 
device:

(1) for criminal investigations only, and only after all "victimless 
crime" laws have been eliminated.

(2) only by consent of the person to be monitored, and only in the 
presence of an attorney.

(3) the questions will be strictly yes/no.

(4) the person to be monitored shall be provided a list of questions, 
and time to examine the list.  In the absence of this, the person 
cannot give meaningful consent.

(5) asking a question not on the list shall be considered a violation 
of privacy of such severity that the person thus invaded may be 
awarded a settlement without proof of actual damage -- and it shall 
be considered that the person asking the question *and* the 
enforcement body he/she represents are *each* liable in *full* for 
this violation.

(6) use of the monitoring device without the consent of the subject 
shall be, in addition to a civilly actionable violation of privacy as 
under (5), a felony.  In the case of an allegation of a violation of 
this clause, if the appropriate executive agency declines to 
prosecute, any citizen may prosecute.

To mangle another thread, does this mean that residence in Seattle makes

"Played around" is the operative phrase- it consists mostly of ideas
and a few tests in some of my animation software (RayDream 5,
Trispectives 2).
One version has morphing objects moving along a time axis, affecting
each other in various ways. A more ambitious version would have
physics-like
interactivity among the items (e.g. ideas bounce of each other, new tech
squeezes
out old). 
Some work has been done on connecting the objects
with colored lines and with transparent rods (etc.) having their own
attributes.
It is these connections, and how they grow and interweave over time, 
that is of most interest.

Some reasons for using animation software:
Being able to turn features such as detail levels, whole layers,
attributes, etc.
on and off is very appealing for a user interested in particular
aspects.
Picking camera angles and trajectories is also very heplful- immersive
VR would
be even better.

Two major problems with this idea:
Representing abstract concepts with 3D objects. Making them out of text
helps
a little, but screen resolution is a constraint.
Picking what the other two axes represent (I have a most unfortunate
disability:
visualizing multidimensional structures is nearly impossible.)
Picking multiple views helps a little, using an axis for more than one
aspect
helps sometimes, using layers gets confusing.

One project I would like to do is to represent the past history of
science and technology this way (I don't have the time for this,

So do I, but what I have in mind are the aesthetics of providing useful

It would still be a 2D gas model, with a limited market. The size and

number

of cells to produce a useful device is the question. Would the amount of

area

needed to implement a gate, for instance, be less than the area of a

dedicated

hardware gate. Could it run as fast?  Bear in mind this kind of gate is 

approaching the molecular scale- a couple papers on this at the 5th

Foresight 

conference.

    Hmmm, maybe a chemically-powered display for laptops, clothes, etc.

This might be much more efficient than electrically powered (battery). 

It would need transport provisions for reactants and products- the

distributor might resemble a circulatory system, and might have some

self-repairing capabilies.

Maybe refresh rates could be governed by reaction-diffusion chemical 

clocks (a temperature-dependence problem here).

Biolumenescent reactions would be neat for lighting or backlighting,

they are quite efficient, I understand.

What I refer to is the space transportation network ("Interworld Rapid

not counting science fiction (these are not backed up with any

OK, here it is, from chapter 2: "Some Animals Age, Some Don't" of
Leonard Hayflick's _How and Why We Age_.

	"But some animals do not seem to age at all, even when
	protected by humans. If they do age, it occurs at such a slow
	rate that their aging has not been demonstrated
	convincingly. These animals increase in size indefinitely;
	their growth may slow as the years go by but, apparently, it
	does not stop.

	Nonaging animals tend to be more primitive species. Typical
	examples are lobsters and many, but not all, fish (sturegons,
	sharks), amphibians (alligators) and reptiles (the Galapagos
	tortoise). Nonaging animals do experience a peak in their
	physiological functions at some point after their sexual
	maturation, but as they continue to grow those functions do
	not seem to decline. The classic example of indeterminate
	growth associated with lack of aging is the fish called
	flounder in the United States and plaice in England. The
	female grows indefinitely and does not show age changes, but
	the male reaches a fixed size and ages. The reason for this
	difference is a mystery."

The list I was referring to was unfortunately a list of records for
various species, and not a list of whether they age or not. Still, it
is clear that reptiles and amphibians at least have a maximum lifespan
of several decades, while there is a great variability among mammals
(humans are of course the longest-lived mammals). Fishes has great
variability, but ages such as 75 for beluga, 82 for syuregon and 60
for catfish clearly hint that they do not age. The same goes for
invertebrates, bivalves can get 116 years old (Margaritifera
margaritifera) or 220 (Arctica islandica), lobsters 50, Nautilus
pompilus 20 and ant queens 27 years. In general we need more data here. 

So it seems that immortality (or at least extreme life spans) is
physically possible in some groups of species. Unfortunately we do not
have any mammals that do not age, so we don't know if it is applicable
to us.

Yes, he does. The references to animal aging chapter are relatively
few (around 10), since he is more interested in human aging. I
recommend the book, even if I disagree with his (to me) conservative
outlook on human lifespan.

Reasonable. It seems that it is partially linked with evolutionary
path, but it can apparently be turned on and off depending on
selection among fishes.

Possible, but I doubt it. We usually get enough ascorbic acid from our
food, and excrete the surplus in our urine, so being able to produce
would not be a major advantage. I seem to recall that some mammals can
produce it, but I might be wrong.

I think aging is more complex than just having a lot of antioxidants
in the body. There seem to be very subtle genetic factors involved,
perhaps creating a body structure that in the long run will fail
(simply because evolutionarily, there is no advantage to the genes to
have very long-lived hosts among mammals).

That depends on what you fill it with. 

But your argument clearly shows why just uploading somebody into a
hyper-computer won't make them a transcendent superbeing by "quickly"
(from an outside perspective) upgrading themselves (as has been
previously argued on this list): most likely they will become bored or
distracted long before they can modify themselves not to become bored
and distracted.

See the work on the "flow expeprience" by Mihly Cskszentmihlyi. He
points out that the truly rewarding things are things are activities
that demand out full attention, but not harder than we can manage. Of
course, as we do them our experience and skill grows.

Very true. Just look at what we enjoy now that we as children would
have found utterly boring or incomprehensible. The more I learn about
the world, the more interesting it becomes.

I wonder if 1000-dimensional checkers isn't trivial; many problems
seem to become simpler the more dimensions we add. But that may be
because we cannot deal with or see the real problems that appear in
1000-dimensional spaces, so we just notice the simple ones.

That depends on what you fill it with. 

But your argument clearly shows why just uploading somebody into a
hyper-computer won't make them a transcendent superbeing by "quickly"
(from an outside perspective) upgrading themselves (as has been
previously argued on this list): most likely they will become bored or
distracted long before they can modify themselves not to become bored
and distracted.

See the work on the "flow expeprience" by Mihly Cskszentmihlyi. He
points out that the truly rewarding things are things are activities
that demand out full attention, but not harder than we can manage. Of
course, as we do them our experience and skill grows.

Very true. Just look at what we enjoy now that we as children would
have found utterly boring or incomprehensible. The more I learn about
the world, the more interesting it becomes.

I wonder if 1000-dimensional checkers isn't trivial; many problems
seem to become simpler the more dimensions we add. But that may be
because we cannot deal with or see the real problems that appear in
1000-dimensional spaces, so we just notice the simple ones.

But there could be a basic "party time rate" which everybody adopts
(at least when dealing with each other). See Greg Egan's _Permutation
City_, where the upload civilization in the second half has an
"official" time rate, and then individuals in their home virtualities
can run as fast or slow they want, given the available resources.

We need some kind of universal semantics, an artificial "language"
able to describe concepts well and in an consistent form which
everybody can translate their mind-states to and from. That might act
as a working buffer. But the demands on it will be great, since *very*
alien ways of thinking will meet.

Sounds like a good idea. Perhaps a better model would be a standard
for mental representations rather than definitions, since we might
pick up a few aliens on the way to the party ("May I present
Threefoil-5-horoball-54, an intelligent flux-tube tangle I met in a
neutron star just coreward of the Dumbell Nebula")

Can you give examples of justice that isn't revenge?

And if the law isn't enforced it doesn't relate to the original idea
of this message, which was to enforce law (I think.)

So I've heard, but I was thinking of that scrawny bush whose name escapes
me.  It's rumored to live for about 10,000 years under ideal conditions.

>It that just because of antioxidants?

I don't know.  I've only heard that long lived plants have higher amounts of
antioxidants.  I'm sure there are other factors, but make their antioxidants
levels more average and I bet they would not live as long.

Regardless, it would be nice to study such long lived organisms to see if
any of their strategies can be applied to humans.  My goal, after all, is not
to argue ad nauseam on this list about aging, but to actually eradicate it.

What about a general time axis (past to the right, future to the left,
but no real scale)?

Elasticity and tension could be used to make the linked objects to
cluster together. And if you want to find out what is related to
something, just drag it and watch what else moves.

You might be interested in NaviGraph by James Wen,
http://www.escape.com/~jimwen/naviGraph/naviGraph.html He has an
applet that shows his web in 3D, where the third dimension is used to
show a different kind of information than the other two. He has a
paper about it which might be interesting:

It has occured to me that I don't need to become a weak
superintelligence to accellerate the speed of my brain. The more I
learn, the faster I think. Both subjectively and objectively.

Problems that used to take me a long time I can now solve in a jiffy.

Well nothing new here probably. Just a reminder that we can probably
become a lot more >H without technology than most of us realise.

Pure old studying will go a long way.

It sounds nice, but those who expect equal justice have always been 
disappointed and always will be because nothing is free and some law is more 
expensive than others. If that's the sort of law you want then you're going 
to have to and bid against others who want something different. In the real 
world compromises must be made, nobody is powerful enough to have exactly the 
law they want and priorities must be set. Personally stopping any unfair
advantages I might have would be dead last on my list of priorities, I don't 
think I'm very strange in that regard but your mileage may vary. Nevertheless 
the question remains, just how much money would you really be willing to 
shell out to ensure that you were treated not one bit better than somebody 
who didn't spend a dime?

There are two separate problems here. One is to verify that the 
machine functions as it is supposed to. The thought experiment 
assumes that this is possible. Another problem is to make sure that 
the criminal code, compliance with which the subject is tested for, 
is a good criminal code. (As long as there is free entry and exit 
from a society, then libertarians would presumably not have anything 
against a "Stalin-spaceship" (using Hal's spaceship terminology), 
where people could sign in who wanted to live under a Stalinisque 
dictature with perfect mind-scanning techniques. This does not mean, 
of course, that the Stalin-spaceship would be a "good" society, one 
where the libertarians would want to live.)

Realistically, mind-scans will probably not be possible until we are 
digital, and then it would be even easier to forget at will. So one 
could only scan for evil intentions, not for memories of commited 
crimes.

One can imagine a sci-fi plot as follows. A wants to become The 
Leader, but every candidate for the leader role will have to undergo 
repeated psycho-scans. So A splits into B and C. B is designed to run 
for the presidency with pure methods and a good intentions. C  on 
the other hand will break into the opposition canditate office and 
plant false evidence of some scandalous event. In the end, B becomes 
president, and, having only socially accepted intentions, hunts C 
down and puts him in prison.

Hi all,

Since I want my brain to be frozen in the best state
as possible (...if we don't solve age-ing, before I die that is)
I'm intrested in all the things that can happen to it.

I came up with this, regarding a stroke.
As far as I know you get blood between the skull and
your brain. The presure will damage your brain !
(please correct me if I'm wrong)

Well, what if we make hole's in the skull upfront, with some 
"valve's" that act only when the presure inside is too high ?
Aside from the funny things sticking out of your head,
what do you think of it ?

any volunteers :-)

Greetings,

I think maybe Gray's Anatomy or your local equivalent could shed some
light on this.  It doesn't quite work the way you describe.

Well, you *could* scan for memories of completed crimes, and you'd 
occasionally catch an idiot.

Actually, there is a back door into B.  B is completely unaware of 
this, but C knows about it.  Once B becomes President, C uses this 
back door to re-integrate the two -- without any memory of C's 
heinous acts, or even of C's previous independent existence.

I think you are exposing your miscomprehensions of prejudices. Just
because you are accused does not make you guilty, and if in the event
such technology were approved for use, I sincerely hope that it were
only used AFTER a jury had convicted. This way, the person is legally
guilty at that point, and the scan would only be used to a) give a quick
way for the accused/convicted to clear themselves without a long appeals
process, or b) to affirm that the convicted is truly guilty, so that the
jury can then feel comfortable with imposing the death penalty, to know
that the convicted is truly guilty, that they actually guessed right.

If one is accused, one is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty to
whatever shade of doubt, therefore, if one is innocent, they they should
be accorded all extension of rights of privacy. If this is not done,
you'll get a mob mentality going where people think they can accuse
anybody and just go around scanning people at will. Now, if someone were
accused, and didn't want to go through a long and expensive court
process, it could be their right to waive privacy and agree to the scan,
but this should only be available for use with units that are totally
sheilded and isolated, and their entire systems designs and construction
are available for public scrutiny to verify no possibility of violation
of privacy beyond the query of guilt for the crime with which the person
is accused.

THe problem with quick and easy justice methods, is that they tend to
encourage the proliferation of laws into all aspects of one's life. This
has been seen when the guillotine was used during the French revolution.
Mere suspicion of something?? "off wit dere eds". THis method of quick
justice paved the way for wholesale slaughter of thousands on nothing
but grudges...

And how would you know that the act of observation did not interfere
with the state of that which was observed????

WHile victims families may feel like they have avenged the death of
their loved one when a muderer is put to death, but as far as I can
tell, the death penalty serves two functions: a) it is supposed to serve
as a deterrent, and b) it permanently removes from society in a manner
that is far less expensive than life in prison those individuals who
have proven their in ability or unwillingness to function in society
with respect for the right to live of others. You may call it revenge, I
call it evolution in action.

it works with the one in the middle, the one about not all laws being
just. It is recognised by the courts that it is the individuals civil
responsibility to disobey unjust laws. If a law enforcement officer
fails to enforce a law, they are legally to be considered accessories to
the one who disobeyed the law, so unenforced laws are examples of those
laws which the state disobeys, because they know they are unjust (or
merely are 'unjust' to someone who has paid off the state).

I don't think 7 is too late to turn a kid around. (And I don't believe anyone of any 
age is ever totally hopeless, do you?) OK, a few whacks on the butt alone is not 
likely to do turn the kid around, but obviously this kid needs some severe 
punishment and should be brought in to see a good therapist. Have you heard about 
the "tough love" concept? The idea is that you take away all privileges from a 
misbehaving child and gradually give them back when the kid starts behaving again. I 
understand this approach often works.

OK, however, there are some nut cases at Social Services who would like to take kids 
away from their parents because they got a spanking. As for the wholesale slaughter 
of politicians-well, you are justified in killing people in self defence if there is 
no other way to protect your liberties. However, you are a damn fool if you go on 
the Internet and advocate specific people be knocked off.

To digress a bit-take the Oklahoma City bombers- please. What cowardly morons! Do 
they try to take out anyone important? (I am not advocating this.) Nope, they 
indiscriminately kill innocent children and low level government officials. Also, 
they didn't have the sense to realize that in order to start a violent revolution, 
you need about a third of the population on your side to have any chance at all. 
George Washington, for example, had about a third of the colonists on his side and 
he knew damned well that there was a hangman's noose in store for him if he lost. He 
took full responsibility for what he was doing. You don't see many people of such 
high character these days. Yes, he had his major faults-he owned slaves( which, to 
his credit, he freed after his death) and he wasn't a pure libertarian, but the man 
had mostly good principles and a lot of courage. Contrast William Jefferson (I gag 
associating him with our 3rd President) Clinton. But back to the topic at hand...

Probably not, but it's not outside the realm of possibility. In any event, I think 
you would agree that there has to be some major intervention here.

I don't see the father as being a "child abuser" based on this one incident. Of 
course, none of us probably knows the real story here. News reports often leave out 
many important facts.

Absolutely. I don't approve of doing any real physical damage and a kid should only  
get a few whacks in extreme circumstances when everything else has failed. And, as I 
said, I have no problem with parents who don't believe in corporal punishment under 
any circumstances. However, I do believe there always should be serious consequences 
for serious bad actions. Parents who let their kids practically commit murder and 
then shrug it off drive me nuts.

I'm no expert, but I'm under the impression that many types of strokes
are caused when blood vessels break inside the brain, depriving some
areas of oxygen and nutrients.  I'm not sure of the relative frequencies
of this type of damage...  Sounds like a job for Anders???:)

>"valve's" that act only when the presure inside is too high ?

It sounds neat, but the image that appears in my head is of someone
so afraid of a stroke that she gets these release valves put in only to
find all her favorite activities -- scuba diving, skiing, kick boxing, 
soccer, rough sex -- precluded.  Or of her getting into a car accident
on a very hot day, bumping her head and bleeding to death before
the paremedics can arrive.  I would not want to give up all those
things that make life worth living, which I hope to continue into the
far distant future on the off chance of a stroke.

Now, those are just my horror images.  Before going further, one should
examine how often this type of stroke is likely, what parts of the brain it
happens at, what one's susceptibility rate is, and whether pressure relief
is the solution.  It the type of stroke is highly unlikely or one is of very low
susceptibility, then the cost might be too high -- the effort could be
invested in other life extension measures or just in enjoying life.  Etc.

Now, let's say this is a very serious matter, then we might look into
designing such valves which can allow one to lead an active life-
style, be esthetically appealing (i.e., invisible:), give off some kind of
warning (wouldn't want to bleed to death because the release valve
is so good at evacuating the brain case of excess fluids:), and be 
cheap.

Just MHO.:)

Steve, I'm just expressing my opinion. Surely, there is no issue of 
right or wrong in the mere expression of an opinion. As for it being 
necessary, it certainly isn't. Is this board "necessary?" No, but it's 
kinda fun.

Also, there is a big difference between me taking sides and the state 
taking sides. The state has the legal use of force at its disposal and I 
don't except in a few limited circumstances. The state can send people 
to jail and take their money and property and I can't. 

Actually, I am basing my opinion on a news story. It may be totally 
wrong. In such case, I may revise my opinion. However, we can only go on 
the information we have, and infomation is always imperfect.

Perhaps the boy's father is a violent person who also kicks animals 
everyday and is really vile. That could be true. Or maybe, like my 
father, he just gives his kids I few whacks when they are really bad. 
(However, I never did anything as bad as kick a cat's head!) Based on 
the information I had, I think the later is the case. But I may be 
wrong.

Your premise that "most violent people were treated violently as 
children" is probably true. However:
1. Research has shown that most children who were treated violently as 
children do NOT become violent as adults.
2. A higher percentage of those mistreated DO become more violent as 
adults than those who were not abused, but this higher percentage is 
STILL a minority.
3. So the so-called "cycle of violence" really does not happen in most 
cases. (I can provide evidence of this study, if you want, but I'll have 
to do a little digging.)
Although a higher percentage of abused children are predisposed to 
become more violent as adults, I am a firm believer in free will (except 
in very young children), and group statistics are not relevant to 
individuals. It's like saying most white males in the U.S. are 
Protestants, even though I am not a Protestant, or men commit most 
violent crimes, but that fact has no relevance to me personally. I 
choose not to engage in murder and mayhem. This does not mean abuse is 
OK, so the "abuse excuse" does not impress me when used by adult 
sociopaths. 

You may be correct that there are better alternatives to giving a kid a 
few whacks in most cases. However, I still think it is appropriate in 
cases of really bad behavior when all else has failed.

I think that once children reach seven or so, they are capable of making 
some choices and should generally be held accountable for what they do. 
How do you define "childhood" (the legal definition is generally anyone 
under 18) and how do you define "true choice?"
I am not familiar with Alice Miller.

Well, in a way the issue is complex, but in another way it isn't. People 
are violent because they see some personal advantage in it for them. As 
Von Mises points out, all human action is an attempt to end a state of 
unease, discomfort or dissatisfaction.

I have taken Statistics and I know that correlation does not prove 
causation, but it can suggest some relationship.

As an example, obviously it would be silly to say the Britain has a 
lower murder rate than we do because they have a Queen and we don't. 
There are other variables that account for the difference. However, it 
is not silly to say that there is a cause and effect relationship 
between democracy and peace. (Democratic states do not go to war against 
each other anymore, and no other variable other than democracy can 
account for this.)

Maybe della Mirandola's "Oration on the dignity of Man" should be included
in the reading list. It was written in 1486, and was startlingly extropian
in tone. Needless to say, it got him in a lot of trouble. Here is an
excerpt from God's speech to Adam:
 
``We have given you, O Adam, no visage proper to yourself, nor endowment
properly your own, in order that whatever place, whatever form,
whatever gifts you may, with premeditation, select, these same you may
have and possess through your own judgement and decision. The nature of
all other creatures is defined and restricted within laws which We have
laid down; you, by contrast, impeded by no such restrictions, may, by your
own free will, to whose custody We have assigned you, trace for yourself
the lineaments of your own nature. I have placed you at the very center of
the world, so that from that vantage point you may with greater ease
glance round about you on all that the world contains. We have made you a
creature neither of heaven nor of earth, neither mortal nor immortal, in
order that you may, as the free and proud shaper of your own being,
fashion yourself in the form you may prefer. It will be in your power to
descend to the lower, brutish forms of life; you will be able, through
your own decision, to rise again to the superior orders whose life is
divine.''

I disagree on the one-third-of-the-populace-behind-them argument.  I think you
need much less, but you also must be certain that the rest of the people are
less
united and don't care.  In other words, if 10% of the people support you and
have
the will and dough while the rest have neither and don't care, I think you'd
have a
good chance.  The problem is that today most people who contemplate revolution
are not the sort of people I'd like to see succeed.  In fact, they look a
little too much
like the current rulers!  (Recall Timothy McVeigh was a decorated veteran of the
Persian Gulf War.)
 
In real life, I'd rather see a revolution of the peaceful sort, especially
of changing
enough people over to our side.  And keep others neutral.  Someone once said,
no everyone needed to be enlightened during the Enlightenment, and look what
came from that.  (Can you tell me who said this?:)

But my original point was that there is a difference between morality and
legality --
or what is right and wrong and what should be up to the law -- whether enforced
by a government or what have you -- to decide.  Does anyone agree with me
on this?

My theory is that some species never aged (in a evolutionary scale)
while others started to show signs of aging and then "evolved" towards
non-aging species (they evolved because they were close to the top of
the food chain or had other kind of non-hazardous lifestyle where there
is evolutionary preassure against aging). We, in turn, become so complex
that errors in our more advanced functions are more likely to occur.
Aging is caused by this errors and the ones mentioned ahead.

The ascorbic acid is just an example, the fact is that a simple
metabolic process might be the cause of aging. A metabolic process that
occurs without errors in non-aging species (for example, tiny portions
of free-radicals might be the cause of aging, minimal differences in the
concentration of ascorbic acid might cause small cellular damages that
cause aging). Of course this is very optimistical, but I am more
convinced now than I was a few months ago that a few genes might be the
cause for aging.

This errors are different than the ones I mentioned above, these are
errors in processes that can be corrected (on a optimistical base).
Other cause of genetic errors might be our more advanced functions (like
I mentioned before), this errors are surely much harder to correct (if
they exist, and I think they do weather in the form of aging, or in the
form of inevitable lethal diseases that affect the elderly --
Alzheimer's disease, mad cow disease, some types of cancer, etc).

Chimps and guinea pigs can produce their own ascorbic acid, which screwed
up many early vitamin C studies on them.

I'm always disturbed when I'm using a piece of software that's flawed in
obvious ways and in ways that seriously limit the functionality of the
software or it's ease of use.  I always come up with good ideas for
fixing the problems and am frustrated by the fact that my ideas will not
be implemented.  But I have reason to believe this will not be a problem
in the future.

As the Internet expands, as bandwidth increases, as e-cash becomes
standard and as trusted systems become widely prevalent, I can foresee
much software being distributed through the Internet on a pay-as-you-use
basis.  The software will likely be component-based software, where each
component could be designed by different programmers, who are paid some
small amount each time their component is used (the cost of using the
software would be the sum of the cost of running the components which are
run).  This would allow someone who sees a flaw in some piece of software
or something they want to add on to improve the software, to make those
changes, and when people use the components that they have added, they
will be paid for it.

I'm sure a lot of companies will still copyright their software and not
allow it to be modified, but I know a lot of people would encourage
others to improve their software.  Of course, then we'd end up with
thousands of different versions of one piece of software, at varying
degrees of quality.  This naturally leads to some sort of selection
system; people want to use good software, but they don't have time to
evaluate thousands of different pieces of software.  So they pay people
to do it for them.  I can see Web sites which offer really good software,
for a small fee, of course.

Basically, this could allow software to evolve much more than it does
today.  There is a real financial motive for programmers to improve
software, even if they didn't design the original version.  The original
programmers benefit from this public modification of their software since
most of what they wrote (and will get paid for) is unlikely to be
modified much in the short term, at least, and any improvements to their
software will only serve to make it more competitive and used more often,
and thus they will get paid more.

The details of how to keep track of who wrote what and how to determine
pricing and how to make it difficult to get around paying for what you
use are somewhat tricky, but I have high confidence that it can, and
will, be done.  I look forward to that time.

All mammal species can make their own vitamin C, well OK, if you want to 
split hairs there are a few very minor exceptions, the gibbon, orangutan, 
chimpanzee, gorilla, and an odd bipedal animal with a big head. Apparently 
there was a mutation that destroyed the manufacturing metabolism for that 
chemical, but these organisms ate a lot of fruit and fruit has gobs of
ascorbic acid, so the mutation was not harmful and may even have been helpful, 
no point in wasting effort making something if you can find it for free.

Why would a software user want to load and run software with an unknown
number of modifications, all of which they must pay for individually, each
time they use the software (if I properly understand your idea)?  How
would a business budget for such an escalating, never ending expense.

I have enough trouble supporting the software I have now. How would I fix
and maintain software from a thousand different undocumented sources that
work together in unpredictable (by me) ways?

Why would a user (they pay for all software) want such software (even if
it was better at some things) when they could get "good enough" shareware
at a low fixed cost or "good enough" freeware (some of it excellent) for
free. It would seem to me that the evolution you crave would favor the
survival of these options at the expense of your component based "pay per
view" software. (unfortunately, the world does not exist for the benefit
of programmers like us, as you have no doubt noticed).

Thanks for the interesting posting. I wish something like your ideas would
occur as well.

Keep in mind that most users would use software which had already been
tested by companies which do that.  If a company gives its clients access
to software which is of poor quality, they will not get as much business
as those who offer higher quality software.  Companies will develop a
reputation for selecting good software and rating software accurately.

Also keep in mind that software packages are competing with other ones,
and the users know what it is likely to cost before they use any
software.  As people modify software components and add components, most
likely the cost to run any individual component in that package will drop
slightly in order to make the whole software package competitive with
other software.  Pricing on software will fluctuate automatically
according to the market.  

Howard goes on to ask:

"I have enough trouble supporting the software I have now. How would I
fix and maintain software from a thousand different undocumented sources
that work together in unpredictable (by me) ways?"

There is no reason you have to fix and maintain software from a thousand
different undocumented sources.  You can always keep a version that you
wrote and understand and keep updating it whenever you want.  You can
either forbid any one else from modifying it, let others modify it all
they want while you still take care of and market your own version, or
think of something else creative to do regarding your software.  

There will be many, many choices for software developers.  And for those
who write software to make money, it will be extremely competitive, and
people will come up with many devious and clever strategies to make their
money.  And some of those strategies will include allowing complete
strangers to modify their software at will, to let their software go,
with the hope that many others will find it worth their time to make the
software more valuable and eventually cash in on their added value.

The ways software will be produced in the future will be much more
diverse than they are now.  Human cleverness will produce many
unpredictable strategies for making software and money.  It's difficult
to predict because we don't know about all the revolutionary, brilliant
ideas the geniuses and other highly intelligent people have yet to come

Our premise was that causing physical pain was sometimes justified 
when the kid did something likely to cause physical damage -- to 
herself (since both our kids are female) or to others, but very 
rarely in any other case.

So when a kid pried a safety cap out of an electrical outlet and 
started probing with other devices -- we were determined that there 
*would* be real, unpleasant physical consequences to her, but also 
that the *natural* consequences were unacceptable in their 
unpredictability and potential severity.

(On the other hand, we never spanked our kids with anything other 
than the open hand.  We figure that with a belt, if you really *know* 
how hard you are hitting, you are getting too much practice.)

Well, I found a picture in a book about the brain, It was a scan.
You could see very clearly how the blood had build up between
the skull and the brain. I agree that this could be a bit missleading
since this doesn't tell you what happens if something breaks inside 
brain.

You are right of course; it should add a great deal of value
in saving you from possible brain-damage, to give up all this.
I don't have a clue what the chance is of getting a stoke.
They had an advertising campaign in Holland recently regarding
this, and they claimed something like the second place on the
"what can happen to you list....". But the actual numbers
slipped my mind.

No, that is a epi- or subdural hematoma, strokes occur when a blood
vessel bursts or is clogged in the brain. 

These hematomas is something we ought to be aware of, they are a real
danger to those of us who live active lives with a risk for bumping
our heads or getting hit. What happens is that one of the arteries
outside the dura (in epidural hematomas) bursts, and blood starts to
accumulate. Usually the victims doesn't notice anything at first, and
just think they got a minor concussion. But after a while (half an
hour, sometimes more) they get dizzy, feel weak, faint and gradually
descend into a coma. Death results if the pressure is not
lowered. Fortunately this is not that hard to do, to quote my teacher
in medical technology "Just use a drill. A Black & Decker will do in
an emergency" (yes, he was an intensive care surgeon :-).

The subdural hematomas are more treacherous. They occur mainly in old
people, and the blood accumulates beneath the dura. Since they usually
occur in very old people lying in geriatric wards, often with
Alzheimer's disease, and are fairly slow they are often not noticed
before it is too late.

I don't think it is necessary as long as you have somebody with
medical experience and a drill around. The main problem is that
inserting the valves is a noticeable risk in itself, and could lead to
meningitis (and that is bad news for us who want to keep our brains
nice and shiny) even if they do not cross the skin (any implants that
cross the skin become probable sites for infections). There is also
the problem of cells growing into the valve and blocking it.  Another
idea I have had to deal with the hematomas was to replace parts of the
arteries with more flexible silicon, but it seems to increase the risk
for trombosis. To be honest, the body is an awful mess when you try to
improve it.

Let's get back to strokes, since they are a real danger. It is the
third leading cause of death in the United States, and the number one
cause of adult disability. It occurs if a blood vessel is clogged by
an embolism or if it bursts, so it can be prevented by keeping the
cardiovascular system clean and supple. Risk factors include: age over
55, high blood pressure, heart disease (esp. atrial fibrillation),
diabetes, smoking, high cholesterol, family history of strokes,
obesity, excessive alcohol consumption and lack of
exercise. Fortunately, most of these can be fixed and could be
counteracted by a transhuman lifestyle.

If stroke occurs (common symptoms: one-sided weakness, numbness or
paralysis, sudden blurred or decreased vision on one or both sides,
difficulties speaking or understanding simple statements, dizziness
and loss of balance combined with other symptoms, sudden severe
unexplainable headache), one should immediatelly get in touch with a
hospital, every minute counts since the ischemic part of the brain
will die within minutes, and the chemicals released from this will
damage cells in surrounding areas. By quickly injecting
anti-coagulants or chemicals that will dissolve blood clots it may be
possible to deal with some strokes (on the other hand, if the stroke
is due to a burst artery this will make matters worse), and there is
appearing anti-ischemic drugs that lessen the effects of ischemia. But
the damage has been done.

Nice to see that somebody else has found him! His oration is very

:-) Depends on your perspective.  Medicine, and especially surgery, is
a rather brutal craft at present.  I read up on surgery before I had a
operation, and I found it empowering to know exactly what it would
involve. The doctors were somewhat annoyed by my questions until they
gave me narcosis. In general, I think it is better to be a power
patient who knows exactly what is going on and how to deal with it
than just a passive recipient of magical medicine.

Any form of justice (imprisonment, death penalty, lynching, shunning,
etc.) has two additional functions: 

A) They impose the idea that the "crime" is unjust which, although it
may act as mild deterrent, also leads people to believe that the crime
is "wrong" and "shouldn't happen" which hinders their want to defend
themselves.  We have been made to believe that criminal behaviour
isn't meant to happen, the problem is just because we say something
isn't meant to happen it doesn't go away.  Our legal system relies
solely on the blind faith of all people in the system - you have to
abide by these laws, and hope that everyone else does the same.

B) They cause more of the behaviour that has been deemed "criminal" in
the first place.  Enforcing law creates enough lawlessness to break
the system.

Justice is the need for revenge - when someone commits a crime against
you, what reason do you have to contact the police?  The crime has
been committed, and unless the assailant has taken something
irreplaceable you have little or no reason (other than revenge) to do
anything.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

Chemical life extension thusfar has show much promise though
it suffers from many pitfalls.  The promise is that animal and
human studies seem to prove that certain diet regimens and
supplementation increase lifespan.  Also, as the chemistry of 
aging and dying are better understood, means of avoiding them 
are becoming better.

There are several pitfalls, however.  These can be divided into
two major areas.  The first is understanding the mechanisms of
life extending chemicals.  Right now, there are several causal
models of aging.  These models are not necessarily alternative
models.  They do not always contradict one another.  Thus,
aging does seem to occur from the accumulation of damage
from free radicals and glycolisation (actually, two models) AND
ALSO from hormal changes, etc.  Sometimes a link between
a chemical - e.g., Vitamin E -- and a model -- here, free radical
damage -- is made.  In this example, Vitamin E is a powerful
antioxidant which prevents free radical damage among other
things.  Even so, for the most part, there is no general system
or systematic way of studying these processes.  (This is a bit
of an overgeneralization and the human body is an extremely
complex system, but it is for the most part true.)

One would hope for models of aging processes to be developed 
then for means of chemical interruption and reversal of these 
same processes to be invented.  This more proactive approach
would most likely spawn the creation of better antiaging
therapies.  Further, interventions could be timed better so that
such therapies would be engaged in when they would be the
most beneficial and do the least harm.

The second is developing other approaches.  Current delivery
systems are not very advanced.  The body can take of itself
mostly, so injecting or ingesting a chemical often does work at
extending lifespan.  However, when the oil filter in your car
gets old, you don't pour in some oil additives -- you change the
filter.  Following the analogy further, when you can't replace a
car part, often you can have it repaired.  Chemical life extension
is more like filling up with detergent gasoline then do major auto
repairs.  Of course, if nanotechnology arrives, this will be much
easier...

In the interim, we need strategies that are a bit more sophisticated
than ingesting some neat chemicals, yet are not so advanced as
to be only workable in computer simulations.  Where does this
interemediary between current life extension techniques and
nanotechnology lie?

Sounds like a great idea. In the books on calory restriction there are
some suggestions tests for biomarkers of aging, but a good testing
device would likely need to both measure the chemical composition of
the blood and macroscopic properties like lung capacity and overall
stamina - it would quickly turn into a rather big and baroque device
with lots of hoses, needles, scanners and levers :-)

The dream would be something like a flatbed scanner which
noninvasively scanned you and calculated all the necessary stuff from
the data. Unfortunately that seems to be rather hard to do at present,
even given the advances in NMR.

I think a blood-test device would be useful, if limited. Maybe also
some kind of tissue-mechanics test (collagene flexibility, skin
properties).

My own interest is of course cognition. I have for a long time planned
to write a cognitive test suite in java, so that one can objectively
test one's progress, effects of lifestyle, age, nootropics etc without
the hassle. Another fun idea I have been thinking of is some kind of
reverse neuropsychology test: you undertake a detailled mental test,
from which your neurotransmittor levels could be roughly estimated
(useful to tune nootropics). But right now these are pipe dreams.

Let's not forget the possibility that there are underlying systemic or
genetic causes for this (like a decreasing ability to produce
anti-radical scavenger enzymes or decreasing cell repair). I have the
feeling that there are several causal loops involved, not just some
nice primary cause.

Unfortunately replacing aged organs doesn't seem to help much,
especially since the organs we really would like to rejuvenate (immune
system, endocrine system and possibly the brain) are not easy to
transplant or replace.

Biotechnology? I'm quite interested in the work that is being done
with neural precursor cells, which could help repair the brain. Maybe
we could use cloning to create totiopotent cells to replace our old
(delivery is still a problem, of course). Another possibility is
geneticly engineered cells or tissues that produce necessary hormones
continually inside the body.

Yeah, it's called shareware. If you hadn't noticed, it is booming
on the net nowadays. There is even "push" from companies like
Marimba that lets you auto-update your code as needed.

Most shareware seems to be sticking to the "pay once, use forever"
strategy, but includes a year of updates or something. I'm not
sure at which point (if ever), the authors will move to a pay
per use model even though the technology already exists today
and could be included easily.

Except among a very small and select group, Extropian/transhuman ideas do not
usually receive serious attention.  Often they are scoffed at and their
purveyors
ridiculed -- if not outright ignored.  This does seem to be the case with
cryonics,
though other forms of life extension are slowly gaining ground.  MNT suffers
from
it too, though to a lesser degree, especially if the more outlandish claims
are kept
under raps.

Knowing that many others are already trying to do a good PR job, I would like to
suggest trying to recruit a big name actor or actress to the movement.  It
sounds
stupid, but it seems to work for a lot of other movements, causes and ideas.

Just a small suggestion.

If we can narrow the scope of what to check down enough, I think we can
avoid having some huge nightmarish machine.  I would suggest starting off
with measuring only a few parameters, then adding capabilities as science
advances.

My first concerns would be making it easy to use, reliable, and cheap.
Later we can add on comprehensiveness.

I would think also urine analysis, perhaps done spectrally or through a
gas chromatograph.  No, even that sounds a bit much.

How about finding out what basically goes wrong -- i.e., what chemical
changes happen in blood, urine, etc. -- and developing simple solution
tests for those?  In other words, mix 1cc of blood with the kit's blood test
solution A and depending on what color it changes, this tells you if blood
LDL levels are too high?

Something like this might prove marketable now.

I can imagine doing very simple tests, such as those of reaction time to
visual stimuli combined with a measurement of neurotransmitter levels...

This is not as glamorous as the other two you mention, but if we start
out with a simpler goal we might achieve it, market it, and move on to
some more complex/interesting.

Yes, although drawing blood is a problem for the market (can you draw
1 cc blood yourself without hurting you?). If you need a blood test,
it must be able to work on just a drop of blood to be
marketable. Urine tests are easier, but urine doesn't contain all the
stuff we would like to measure.

There are a lot of information in the blood. Kinase levels tell about
muscle damage (esp. infarcts), there are several marker molecules for
liver or kidney diseases, LDL and antibody levels are interesting and
so on. But to interpret these results well you need some expertise,
even 100% healthy people tend to have at least some odd values. 

Anyway, I think there really exists fairly simple tests for many of
these chemicals. What is needed now is packaging them together,
creating a simple user interface and marketing it.

> I can imagine doing very simple tests, such as those of reaction time to

Yes, and a glucose level test together with some memory tests (this is
something I actually plan to do later this spring).

OK, so is Axelrod's tit-for-tat revenge? And if so, does this mean that
cooperation as an ESS requires revenge? If not, what _does_ it mean? If so,
can we live with something with as nasty a sound as the word "revenge", or
shall we pretty it up?

Hmmm. Well, consider:
If the assailant has taken something that has taken me time to acquire,
then the assailant has in some way taken at least part of that time from
me. If the assailant has taken a year's pay from me, in some sense he has
stolen at least part of a year from me. Years are not easily replaceable
with available technology, yet dollars are. P(seudop)aradoxically, the
irreplaceable things are not so easily replaced as to easily permit fair
recovery.

In some ways, but complements and positive ways of putting things
make people more receptive and more likely to deal with you.  It might
be irrational but at present we're basically stuck with it.

Since it's so difficult to distinguish friend from foe and assistance
from covert interference, perhaps reacting more positively to those
with good things to say about you works out in the cost-benefit
analysis.  If so, politeness will get you ahead with a meta-rational
actor, and a Red Queen chase will lead to the common situation of
excessive politeness.

In some/many cases, there might be psychological benefits.  Naturally,
it'd be great to rejuvenate/replace the immune or endocrine systems.
However, some people tend to get very depressed over, say, their
looks.  Ergo, skin replacement might alleviate that problem AND allow
research on that organ (the skin) to carry over to others (the endocrine?).
The fit here is loose, but not so loose as to make it unlikely.

Cloning is definitely in need of further investigation.  I would only hope
someone starts doing the research quickly so that the general public
can see real benefits to weigh against imagined fears.  Controlling
totipotent cells is another area to investigate.  It is my understanding,
this is not hard, given some experiments with transplanting embryo
brain cells to Parkinson's sufferers (human or otherwise, I can't recall).

I was under the impression that gene therapy was already being done
with genetically engineered cells which provided products directly
inside/to the body.  I see no principled reason why this can't be done
for hormones or Vitamin C or what have you.

I highly doubt and dispute the idea that the only reason we see justice
for murder as a need for revenge. If it is not made a strong meme in
society that ending anothers life without cause is wrong, morally
ethically, and legally, then those with sociopathic and psychopathic
tendencies will feel free to act out in the open, and the mayhem
resulting will bring utter chaos. Not to mention that being permissive
on ending another's life puts our own at greater risk of being ended.

I have a bit more for you here. Civil law seeks to recompensation to
victims for damages incurred. THis is not revenge, merely compensation
for damages, reestablishing a semblance of the prior continuum.

Anton Sherwood responded:


Got news for ya: government is inherently adversarial - if it weren't, it
wouldn't need force.  If you're serious about "eliminating the `them vs. us'
syndrome", concentrate on voluntary action *outside* the domain where every
action is a defeat for somebody.

AMG questions:

Is it possible that the force that government occasionally uses is due to
the lack of participation by those effected by lack of fair and equitable
representation? Is it possible that the system is so non-representative --
and becoming increasingly so -- because of the constraints imposed on those
selected to be our representatives by monied special interests?

Is it possible that increased, and improved education with a stronger focus
on scientific method, critical reasoning,emphasizing independent and
skeptical thinking might result in a small first step towards eliminating
the "them vs. us" syndrome? Is it possible that increased involvement by
those many people who feel disenfranchised, frustrated and disgusted by the
the present system might, through their activism, help the present system
evolve?

Are there other more realistic, practical and viable alternatives that can
be effectively implimented over the short, intermediate and long term?

Interesting, because my suggestion was going to be to just get some
healthy ranges and warn users that the test kit is not foolproof.

It's my understanding that many of these species (the lobsters in 
particular) have since been shown to age, and the current theory 
holds that every animal ages if it lives long enough.  A long
while back people thought that growth cessation was a necessary
part of aging and hence animals that keep growing (fish, lobsters)
didn't age.

But *is* extropianism a movement?  And if so what is it a movement
*toward*?  If Demi Moore were to start talking about cryonics or molecular
nanotechnology on the talk show circuit it is possible that more people
would sign up for the one, or would invest in the development of the
other...  but just how this would be an advance for extropianism as a
movement is unclear to me, unless we regard every scientific and
technological development, as well as every cultural and political
development in the direction of greater freedom and diversity, as an
advance for extropianism as a movement.  Does extropianism just mean
civilization, then?  

I am not sure if it makes much sense to think of extropianism as a
movement, given the forms it seems to exhibit most characteristically over
the five years or so I've been looking it over.  More like a constellation
of spaces in which a group of people discuss certain idiosyncratic
preoccupations (most of which I share).  Usually stimulating, often
useful, sometimes deeply pleasurable, but a *movement*?

Is it the goal of extropianism as a movement to expedite the arrival of a
technological singularity, or a particular configuration of future
technologies, perhaps by way of the information exchange that happens
here?  Is it the goal of the movement to insure that religious or
ecological fundamentalism don't manage to stifle development of a better
future?  Is the goal to disseminate as widely as possible the diversity is
good meme, so as to give pause to the first Powers that emerge if it
should occur to them that mehums look more like ubergoo feedstock for
their transhuman engineering projects than potentially valuable
conversational partners?  All of these would look like the agenda of a
movement about the future properly so-called.  Maybe having Demi Moore
talk about these things on Rosie or whatever would have a positive effect
of the kind you are talking about.  None of them seem to have enough of a
consistent articulate consensus behind them (except maybe the one about
fearing the damage fundies could do) as the conversations on our various
fora unfold, though, to suggest that they define the coherent agenda of an
extropian movement.  Not that I think extropianism necessarily *wants* to
aspire to movementhood, given the rather grisly track record of movements
in general in this century.  It's just that the term gets bandied about
quite a bit and I'm never completely sure why everybody seems so
comfortable with it.

I think so. I haven't got my medicine book here, so I cannot check,
but there are some substances that are more concentrated in urine than
in blood (especially those linked with signs of kidney failure, of
course). But the blood is richer in information, urine is highly
filtrated and does not normally contain the proteins that provide the
really interesting clues.

It is just a matter of statistics. If the normal range contains 95% of
the population, then if you make 10 tests there is a 40% chance that
at least one of them will be out of the normal range even for a
healthy person. With a hundred tests it is a 99.4% chance that at
least one will be strange.

Well, you are right, but the psychological benefits will not help
extend life significantly as far as I know, and the dangers of
transplants should not be underestimated (the more medicine I learn,
the less eager I am for invasive surgery :-).

Human and animals. There have been a lot of work done in this field,
and the results are starting to appear. So far it looks like the
transplants help, but not much. But animal studies show that nerve
grafts can do some amazing things (turning and growing in the right
direction, finding the right targets etc), so I think there is reason
to be hopeful. I don't know if anybody has yet looked at what happens
if you implant totiopotent cells as regarding to aging.

That should work. The problem might be where to put them, but for
substances that are very bioactive not many cells are needed. One fun
possibility is otherwise to use engineered gut bacteria - they produce
vitamin K, so why not C?

Yes, a very easy one - decentralization. No matter how equitable and
fair a representational system may be, once it grows in terms of total
participating population, it will reach a point where more and more of
the populace will feel like their voice counts for less and less, and
they are right. One man's vote in China, with a population of 1.2
billion, counts for far less than one man's vote in Lichtenstein, or
England. And having constituent's representatives representing larger
and larger precincts also leads to this. THus, the interim solution
would be to move as much power OUT of the federal government, to the
states, and from there to the counties and municipalities, as well as to
increase the number of popular representatives. Time was when a US
Congressional Representative actually represented less than 50,000
people, no longer. I "know" my vote counts for far more, and my voice is
heard far easier at my city government level.

Another solution is to put more laws to vote by the people directly. I
expect that within 10 years, we will have public voting over the
internet on a wide variety of laws, and elections.

That's an idea endorsed by the Christian God with His invention of "hell", 
it's the conventional view, and a view that has caused more grief than any 
other in the history of the world. When an idea doesn't work it needs to be 
junked. This idea doesn't work.

To stop that person from committing new crimes against others and as a 
deterrent discouraging others from committing new crimes against me. That's 
justice, one bit more and it's vengeance. Making a person unhappy because you 
don't like him and think it's fun to see him suffer is something I want no 
part of.

If we regard extropians as people who agree with the extropian
principles (as opposed to the more diffuse transhumans), then the
principles seem to imply that in order to achieve more extropy it is a
good idea to spread the meme (spontaneous ordering requires more than
one actor, and so on). So extropianism will become a movement of some
kind, due to the implications of the principles. 

Maybe it is something like a quasispecies, a quasimovement. A
quasispecies is a fuzzy distribution of genotypes characteristic of
quickly mutating organisms and molecules. A quasimovement is a fuzzy
distribution of memes mutating into each other (of course, it is hard
to tell where our co-memes stop and the real extropian memes begin).

It would be nice if they were equivalent, wouldn't it?

On the topic of mind scans and uses of such machines for criminal justice
purposes, among others, I strongly recommend the novel The Truth Machine by
James L. Halperin. Jim is a member both of Extropy Institute and Alcor.
Following up on this fine first novel, his second is about to be released:
The First Immortal -- an extremely extropian view of life extension. I hope
many of you will buy a copy and help publicize the book. It can only help
further public support for life extension. But while you wait a few weeks
for The First Immortal, you can be reading The Truth Machine. He raises and
discusses many of the issues in this thread, in an entertaining work of
fiction.

Reilly Jones has an excellent quote from Mirandola in his essay on the
history of extropic thought. Reilly's essay is available in the EXTRO 2
Proceedings volume. Mirandola really does sound like a proto-transhumanist,
despite still having religious beliefs.

If any of you were watching the Discovery Channel program called "Shoot
NOT to Kill" last night, you'd notice a device I had developed back in
the late 80's is now being bandied about as a law enforcement tool. They
discussed the use of short range contact and focussed beam EMP weapons
to easily stop automobiles. I had built a device exactly like they
discussed and demonstrated back in '89 and used it successfully against
police trying to stop me for speeding. It shot a focussed EMP pulse in a
cone behind my vehicle to a range of about 150 feet that would toast the
engine control chips of a pursuing vehicle....

Of course, no mention was made of the origin of this device, and the
sort of application that ne'er-do-wells like myself could make of this
technology....

Yes, that seems to fit. His Oration can be found on the net at
http://www.physics.wisc.edu/~shalizi/Mirandola/ for those of you who
are interested in reading it in its entirety. It is an interesting mix
of theology, alchemy and proto-transhumanism.

John is right and I was wrong, most mammals can produce ascorbic acid.
Harvey is wrong, at least judging from my sources -- "Biochemistry" by
Lubert Stryer (1995) page 454 --, primates and guinea pigs cannot
synthesize ascorbic acid. Anyway, this was just an example, I can think
of many others biochemical differences between humans and non-aging
species.

That's why biogerontologists call them species that appear not to age.
As far as I know, no-one has ever proved that lobsters age. If you know
of anyone, please let me know.

Also, species that appear not to age do grow indefinitely. I don't know
if there is any species that grows indefinitely and does age, but I know
that all species that appear not to age grow indefinitely. Hayflick

In "Confronting the Boundaries of Human Longevity" by S. Jay Olshansky et
al. (_American Scientist_ 86(1) Jan/Feb 1998), the authors liken aging in
humans to the accumulation of errors too.  They use an analogy of an Indy
500 race car.  the car is designed to run continuously with minors pit stops,
etc. for 500 miles.  Now imagine if the car is kept going after 500 miles.  It
was not designed to fall apart 100 miles later, but things would start to
happen.

I agree that organ transplants is not a good solution (too dangerous and
impossible in many cases -- the brain). Puting some bacteria to work is
not a bad idea, but I don't think that to be enough. My best option is
gene therapy. If we could just make a few cells immortal, these cells
would spread in the body because they would be in advantage when
compared to the normal aging cells. All we have to do is find a way to
turn our cells immortal and improve our gene therapy techniques -- and
this might not be very far away.

Also on the subject, I recently wrote an article for a magazine called
"Longevity Report" about the applications of gene therapy on controlling
aging, it can be found at:

Interesting.  How is aging then detected in general?

Chances are the kit we are talking about, in its initial version would be
closer to the 10 test and not 100 test side of the spectrum.  I would
imagine that anything that is abnormal can be reported to an expert
or backed up with more tests.

Perhaps the kit could be a way of having physicians remotely
monitor patients.  That could be the initial market, with all the aging
babyboomers creeping toward senescence...

It would be very interesting work.  The test design would seem simple
enough.  Skin might be easiest to work with, since it is on the surface.
For instance, taking totipotent cells, grafting them to a skin site and
seeing how they differentiate under the influence of hormones...

Actually, a friend (Brett, are you out there?) and I discussed such with gut
bacteria a few years ago.  He thought it wouldn't happen because
bacteria share DNA too easily, making it hard to sell.  However, if we don't
care about that all that much, then why not?

I think there is a great deal of apprehension on this list toward the words
"movement", "ideology" and the like.  I don't think it does much good to
do all kinds of handwaving, denying, and neologizing to avoid such terms.

I think you are too close to it.  Step back and you will see the forest where
there were only trees.  You might also be able to see some of bad parts of
the movement, and help to make repairs.

I think you look at it too piecemeal.  What we need are people not to speak
out for a particular idea, but for "technology as good" for technotran-
scendence, and growth.  Having an actor or actress do this would make
the ideas reach even more people.

A format that might come to mind is...  A child is dying of some hormone
deficiency.  Clone sheep are producing the hormone through the wonders
of genetic engineering.  Show this stuff in action.  Show the child living
another day.  Have the well known person read the copy and cry and
cheer at the appropiate moments.

This might get a lot of the fence sitters on your side and the masses, who
then can be used to bully politicians into not outlawing cloning.  It seems
worth a try.

It would be convenient for human settlers on Mars to divide the Martian 
year into 24 months.  But how many days should each month have?  If the 
year is divided equally by time, obviously each month has 27 or 28 days 
(the year is 668.5994 Martian days).  An alternative is to define a month 
as 15 degrees of motion around the sun, so that the periods between 
equinox and solstice are each exactly six months.

Using Kepler's Second Law, I have computed the following lengths for 
such months.  Orbital eccentricity is 0.093 and my year begins at 
northern spring equinox, L_s=0 (110 degrees after perihelion).  
I've done no error analysis yet; I would like to know how sensitive
these months are to an error in the last digit of the eccentricity
or the phase angle.

22		27.28		27		27		28
23		28.64		29		28		28

I hope I haven't blundered somewhere!

In column A, I've rounded according to the rule of largest remainder:
those months with a fraction larger than .43 are rounded up, those with
a smaller fraction are rounded down, and month 11 is leap-month, with
an extra day in three years out of five.

In column B, to make the months slightly more equal in length, the 
longer months are rounded down, the shorter months rounded up.

In column C, I took B a step further: the shorter months get 27 days,
the longer months 28.

Comments?

I'd like to name each month for the brightest star (within the tropics)
to cross the midnight line in that month; that might be an interesting
exercise for someone with access to an appropriate stellar database.

Yes, *very* interesting! Where can you order one of those? ;-) 
I'm also interested in other sonic/EMP weapons, especially if they
fit into your pocket. Alledgedly there are such things as "bowel liquifiers"
and microwave devices that can cause everything from mild hallucinations
and nausea, to unconsciousness and cardiac arrest. Might be an interesting 
alternative to firearms, at least in some cases.

	While I don't pretend that God speaks to me much more or clearer than
to John or the average extropian, I don't believe that He ever
"endorsed" revenge or that He "invented hell" as an actual place filled
with sinners (this is an article of faith).  Rather, today these ideas
are only known to be endorsed by fundamentalist Christian denominations.
	Today, more often than not, Christian demoninations do not accept the
mostly Old Testament view that God is a God of revenge and punishment. 
Rather, He is a God of love and forgiveness (and always has been).
	Also, most believe that God (or his Prophets) used "hell" as a device
to scare immature, semi-civilized peasants living 2000 years ago into
behaving morally.  While the threat of "hell" may have worked for those
peasants (Lawrence Kohlberg defines this as the "Punishment Avoidance
stage of moral development," today it works mostly on toddlers.  
	Like any idea (or technology), I believe His words have been perverted
by people for (dare I say) evil or other ends having nothing to do with
Him or His Word.

This may be, tho' for me it is not so much that I am apprehensive about
movements or ideology, as that I think these words have meanings and I'm
simply not sure extropianism as I see it functioning in the world behaves
particularly *like* a movement.  If it wants to be a "movement", I'm
curious to see just what its agenda finally amounts to.

I don't know what you mean when you say I am too close to it.  Certainly I
agree with you that this is a discussion about seeing the forest as well
as the trees.  I don't see how I'm diagnosing "bad parts" of the
"movement," and I can't see how to recommend "repairs" when my question is
about what extropianism is functioning *as* in the first place.  As a
clearinghouse for ideas about technological development and life-extension
practices, extropian fora seem to function admirably well.

"Technology is good" is as good a transhuman slogan as WIRED's recent
"change is good" -- that is to say, it is no good at all.  Good technology
is good.  Foresight in the face of exponential technological development
is good.  Extropians seem to have a more robust sense than even most
conventional technophiles of just how sweeping technological
transformation may soon get (even if you are wary about the likelihood of
a singularity), and this puts us in a position to make a real difference
in preparing the world for these changes and ameliorating the worst of the
damage they might cause while embracing their benefits.  *This* insight is
worth building a movement around, imho.

This would likely be of benefit (although I have some issues about the
unquestioning instrumentalization of nonhuman animal species in scenarios
like this), but I fail in any case to see how it is more than incidentally
"extropian," if "extropian" denotes a movement with a discernible agenda
beyond broadly humanistic optimism with a background in sf.  How would
propaganda favorable to cloning connect up with right to die legislation,
competing security agencies, jupiter brains, and the like?  Cloning
doesn't need extropianism, except insofar as cloning is a stepping stone
toward something like a singularity.  This is why I agree with you that
this is a discussion about the forest *and* the trees where extropianism
as a movement properly so-called is concerned.

I can't for the life of me figure out what fence-sitting amounts to in
regard to what extropians want *as extropians*.  Who are the
fence-sitters?  Those who think the future won't happen? Those who don't
realize the changes are going to be big ones?  Or the ones who aren't
actively in the labs and boardrooms doing the research and drumming up the
capital to incubate these changes?  By all means, it's worth trying to
keep cloning legal in the face of unreasoning fear.  That would be a good
thing.  But is that enough on the face of it to make it an *extropian*
thing?

Whoops!  You are right that I am wrong.  I had it exactly backwards.
Primates and guinea pigs CANNOT synthesize ascorbic acid, while most other
mammals can.  This unique difference is what confused early researches
studying vitamin C intake on these creatures.  I forgot for a moment that
we humans are just primates and rats.

There are actually several kinds of stroke.  This is a serious 
problem for medical professionals because different kinds of stroke 
have different treatments.  The single most common kind of stroke, 
the preferred treatment is anticoagulants -- there are at least two 
other kinds of stroke where anticoagulants are *exactly* the *wrong* 
thing to do.

The most common sort of stroke is when a blood clot forms within a 
blood vessel in the brain (or moves to a narrow, perhaps 
already-constricted, location in the brain), cutting off blood to a 
portion of the brain.  Anticoagulants to help break up the clot are 
in order.

Another, somewhat less common sort of stroke is when a blood vessel 
breaks, causing blood to pool outside the circulatory system and put 
pressure on part of the brain.

A rather less common sort of stroke is when a blood vessel breaks, 
and the leakage is not enough to cause the sort of stroke mentioned 
in the previous paragraph -- but the blood is flowing through the 
break, *not* down the blood vessel, so a nearby part of the brain is 
deprived of blood.

And there are other sorts...

The Extropian Principles seem to function more like a fuzzy center of
gravity than a *foundation* for the widespread activities that are
undertaken broadly-speaking under the sign of extropianism.  My impression
from discussions in extropian fora is that most people take more
personally their investment in formative texts from the recommended
readings list than their commitment to the principles per se.  This is why
we so often find people arriving at one of our fora and exclaiming that
they have been "extropians" all their lives, even though they (still) 
haven't gotten around to taking in the principles themselves.  And given
the level of generality at which the principles are pitched and the
emphasis on individual critical assessment in the principles, this would
seem to be as it should be.  
	But this leads me to think that the extropianism that takes the
principles as its point of departure is not exactly the same thing as what
people seem to mean by an extropian "movement," with a coherent public
agenda.  Elsewhere, Max More describes PCR as a "metacontext for memetic
progress," and it seems one could describe the Principles as a
"metacontext for individual flourishing in the face of dynamic
technological change".  This does not seem to me to be the stuff from
which *social* movements are culled.  The principles as they stand seem to
me too complex, too suggestive, too open-ended to be reducible to a bumper
sticker, to cash out into a readily intelligible and coherent political
agenda.  I can't think what it would mean for extropianism to "sweep the
world" -- which is what most movements hope for themselves.  I wonder just
what you mean when you glibly offer up the spectacle of extropianism, "the
meme".  Just what would that be?  "Best do it so"?  With *all* that that
implies?  With all that that is open to?  As I said before, maybe all this
is just to say that extropians don't really properly aspire to be a
"movement" at all.  I just want a clearer sense of what they do mean when
they *say* it.

Best, Dale

I would describe it as a "memetic attractor" to use one of the neologisms I
have come across on the net which best describes my feelings on the
subject.

I would suggest that those who are prepared for the ideas summed up as
"extropianism" will become involved, and those who don't really shouldn't
be pushed or even guided. I think spreading the meme is a good idea, but
active proselytising would not be so good.

I tend to be slightly elitist in such cases because I honestly feel that
only a certain subset of the human race will "get it" and widespread
publicity will not help some people "get it" more or faster, it will merely
make the ideas -potentially available- to more people.

how often were you able to use this device?  did the police ever find out?
If so, what did they do?

While being fascinated by such devioces, I'm even more fascinated by their
active use, as most of the people I know just put up with the police like
good little citizens (including me, generally).

I've just received a review copy (from the USA - White Wolf Publishing,
1997, I assume just out) of SILICON KARMA, by Thomas A. Easton.  He's the
book reviewer for *Analog*, who in the early '90s wrote several books about
`gengineering'.  This one deals with uploading.  I've only just started it,
but it contains some interesting early posits - scanning is
non-destructive, and copies live sequestered in manipulable VR machine
space: `philosophers and ethicists and theologians insisted that the divide
be respected, that the dead have their afterlives to themselves.  Seeing
them is too painful for both the living and the dead' (p. 11).  This seems
to me unlikely, and probably just a convenient narrative device, but it's
an idea I'd never encountered before.

I remember reading some time ago that an insurance company
actuarial sat down and computed how long the average person would
live, if we didn't have an defined lifespan. As I recall, he
computed the average to be around 734 before one accident or
another did us in. If we intend to live longer, we will have to

I believe we are seeing this now as technology prolongs the period
human females remain fertile. Recent experiments in egg freezing
will increase this. We are also seeing an increase in latter
pregnancy by feminists who pursued careers first. I have two
friends who didn't have there first till 40. (both happy and
healthy by the way). So we are seeing this as a social phenomenon
as well.

Frozen baboons returned to life

by Lois Rogers
Medical Correspondent


SCIENTISTS have unlocked the secret of suspended animation by
successfully reviving baboons hours after their bodies were packed
into crates of ice.

The breakthrough, which holds huge implications for the battle
against disease and ageing, will allow humans to preserve their
ice-cold bodies in suspended animation and wake up years later in
the same physical condition.

It has aroused the interest of space scientists investigating the
possibility of interstellar travel, allowing human exploration of
galaxies many light years away.

Military clinicians are also attracted by the prospect of allowing
critically injured troops to be near-frozen on the battlefield and
preserved for later treatment.

The key to the technology is Hextend, a revolutionary plasma
replacement fluid which is poured into the body through a vein in
the upper thigh as blood is drained and the anaesthetised body is
cooled to 1C. As the clear fluid permeates the tissues, it prevents
the deterioration caused by extreme lowering of body temperature.

The results from the baboon studies, carried out at Biotime, a
California research company, were announced at the annual meeting
of the American Association of Anti-Ageing Medicine.

Hal Sternberg, Biotime's head of research, said work on the
mechanisms of animal hibernation had provided much of the basic
information on suspended animation.

One type of North American frog can partially freeze its body while
it shuts down during the winter months. Hamsters have been kept
alive at 1-2C with no heartbeat in Biotime laboratories for up to
seven hours before being successfully rewarmed.

The long-term objective is to add freeze-protectant chemicals to
the Hextend solution so human bodies can be stored at -196C, the
temperature of liquid nitrogen. The principal barrier, however, is
popular opinion.

"It is like the public attitude to early organ transplants," said
Sternberg. "Although everyone will love us when we announce we have
reversibly frozen a human being, at the moment this area is not
considered socially acceptable.

"There is a limit to how far people think you should go to save a
life: but we already have children being born from frozen embryos.
If you are extending the beginning of life, why shouldn't you also
extend it later on?"

Sternberg and his colleagues expect to use their new techniques to
put themselves into long-term hibernation while they await the
development of life-extending techniques to cure and prevent
cancer, heart failure and Alzheimer's disease.

Doctors believe the technique can immediately be used in complex
surgery, where best results can be obtained by cooling the body to
a level which would otherwise cause brain damage.

Clinical trials of Hextend led by Michael Mythen, a consultant
anaesthetist who worked on the project in America, are to begin at
University College hospital, London, this year.

It will be used in complex orthopaedic, gynaecological and stomach
operations where there is a danger of catastrophic blood loss and
where better results can be obtained at low temperatures.

Kelvin Brockbank, a British-born scientist in South Carolina who
has received funding from the American government for his research
work in the allied field of preserving transplant organs, said
deep-freezing of human tissue would be possible within a year.
"There will be a whole range of applications for the technology,"
he said. "It will be up to people to decide how to use them."

If it didn't, we'd have to correct it, wouldn't we?  After all, it
is not so much the details of the principles themselves but the
underlying theme of civilized achievement that lead to them which
is our goal.  Max's primary contribution was not so much defining
new goals, but in recognizing all the necessary conditions of the
goal of civilization, and disabusing us of popular ideas that turn
out to be contrary to that goal.

Who said anything about being "permissive"?  Self-defence isn't
permissive.

And then he wrote:

Have you ever been in a competition and lost?  Property is whatever
you can stop someone else from taking.  That's not my "property is
theft" opinion, that's fact (go ahead, put it to the test.)  Property
law is simply intervention by a third party.  If you loose a race and
then go and break the winners legs, that's revenge.  If you loose to
crime and then punish the criminal, that's revenge.

And trust John K Clark to write:

So you've got some clever scheme for non-vengeful justice?

They've committed the crime, you lost out, and any "justice" incurred
beyond that point is by definition, revenge.

The local pigs never figured it out. I got put out of business by a
bigger gun:

I was driving to work (I was stationed at Cannon AFB at the time) and
drove under the approach path to the runway when an F-111 came over.
There had to be some sort of automatic system that recognises signals
that resemble jamming signals or some such (which was what my device
looked like from several hundred yards away, radio wize) on the
Aardvark. I guess it tried to burn through the signal, which wound up
toasting my device. Good thing the capacitor was in the back of the
pickup's bed with stuff in between it and me with nobody behind my
vehicle. It blew up with what had to be the force of a grenade, messed
up the back of my pickup bad, and I was lucky it didn't get the gas
tank...

Fun fun fun.

I know, but I had really gotten sick of the jackboot attitude of these
New Mexico hicks, so I just decided to eliminate the threat
peacefully....

it took a capacitor the size of a large thermos to store a charge (don't
remember the value). Took about 5 minutes of charging time off the
alternator, which I had custom installed to provide an extra 15-20 amps.
It used a radar detector type horn with a souped up magnatron from a big
microwave, and a large voltage ladder/network (4 ladders in parallel,
each 20 steps, at around 10-15 kv per step) fed from a custom built
flyback and flip/flop operated SCR feeder from the capacitor.

I kept the ladders soaked in an oil bath, rather than the typical
RTV/silicone coating, as I frequently needed to replace diodes.

I think it might be nice to have an Extropian organization that
would perform functions similiar to the ACLU. i.e. fighting
things that we think need to be fought. It could double as
a lobbying organization.

I see posts on this list all the time about how various
governments pass stupid laws and otherwise trample on things
that we like or want- why not try and fund our own organization
for stopping these problems?

I would really like to see some kind of investment list started
up!

Hypermart is looking for investors now if anyone is interested
in talking to us. We were the first company to begin offering
free hosting services for businesses about 3 months ago, and
remain the leader in this area. We believe we are moving into
an exponentional growth period as the meme of free hosting
for businesses begins to spread- we are now seeing more than
100 businesses join our service each day (had 166 on Sunday).

We believe we are in an excellent position as search engines
and other online services (MSN) continue to add free services
to their sites; we think a buyout will be likely within 12-18
months.

At this time we are looking for additional investors to help
us maintain our level of service as it becomes necessary to
rapidly expand to keep up with our demand. You may contact me
at 404-347-9864 if you are interested!

Absolutely!  The best way to combat irrational emotional reactions
to accurate words is to "reclaim" them; to use them proudly and
without apology.

It is a shame that in our culture in general, "idealistic" has
become an insult and "practical" a compliment, rather than the 
reverse, as they deserve.

Even I must admit that there are times when surrendering to
pragmatism is appropriate, as when one hands one's wallet over
to a thief with a gun in your back, but it should always be seen
as a defeat.  Pragmatism is failure.  Somewhere in our culture,
it became not only acceptable, but desirable.

I am an ideologue, and proud of it.  I have no respect at all
for those who /start/ an argument from pragmatism instead of
settling for it when idealism fails.  Masking over our own
idealism for the sake of PR is exactly that--it is settling
for defeat before we have even tried sticking to principle.
A principled movement wants people to support its goals; if it
sacrifices those goals just to get people, what are those people
for?  Such a movement, where numbers of people are a goal in
itself, is no longer a principled movement, and is forever
doomed to success in its mediocrity.

I just read an interesting article called "Experimental Quantum Teleportation" 
in the latest issue of Science Week <http://www.scienceweek.com/sw980102.txt> 
in which they describe the quantum teleportation of the exitation state of 
rubidium atoms. Since this seems to involve a net energy transfer, it may, 
after all, be possible to teleport molecular bonds from one site to 
another.

Oh, sorry, the capacitor was on the magnetometer end. Every thing else
was just to charge it. I don't have any of my notes from that project,
and I was pretty much a party animal when I wasn't on duty, so my memory
is fuzzy. Essentially, I just scaled up and altered a design for a small
science class sized EMP generator I had seen the design for I think in
one of Information Unlimited's books on funky highpower projects. As I
recall, it put out a burst of around 70,000 watts for something like
1/100th of a second. Thats about twice the power of an F-14's radar on
max range. Needless to say, it was hazardous to people in the effect
zone if they were not in the Faraday protection of a vehicle. 

THis is the major problem I have with what the people on the Discovery
program were saying about it being "safe and harmless to vehicle
passengers" (except those who have metal in their teeth or a hearing aid
or pacemaker).The power densities needed to transmit a pulse fatal to
circuits in that zone would also have an effect like a couple dozen to a
few hundred chest xrays all at once to people not sitting inside a metal
car body. THere is a reason why we weren't allowed to work in front of a
fighter plane when its radar was being tested, as it could actually cook
your insides like you were in a mocrowave oven if you were out in the
open right in front of it. People inside plastic vehicles would have no
protection, however, these devices may be of lower power if the chips
used in cars these days operate at lower voltages.

Quite so.  I'm still not convinced it is exactly accurate to describe
extropianism as a "movement" in the way you do.  At least not yet. 
Certainly there is something like an extropian community and a broad set
of extropian ideas. The community is quite diverse, though, as are the
ideas.  In the five years I've been hanging out here I've seen lots of
strong personalities and strong agendas come and go, with the consequence
that the tenor of the ongoing extropian conversation has taken some fairly
extraordinary turns -- but the thing that has always remained consistent,
and consistently arresting, is that the participants in the conversation
always factor into their positions a sense of the possibilities, promises,
and dangers of the technological future that I have never found elsewhere.
These observations are also flavored by a gravitation toward a broadly
libertarian, critical optimism of a kind espoused in Max More's
principles, but rarely discussed in any detail or even really alluded to.
It's a great place to spend time and learn in, but it doesn't feel focused
enough to be properly described as a movement on its own terms.  Maybe
it's more like a lifestyle looking to mature into a movement?

I actually agree with you.  But are you talking about extropianism here? 
There is a libertarian movement, a cryonics movement, a drug legalization
movement, a feminist movement, a secular humanist movement, and a number
of other movements which many/most individual extropians seem to have a
stake in. But what is the goal of the extropian movement?  What is the
victory our idealism will secure?  The future?  It's coming whatever we
talk about here, and largely indifferent to what we talk about here.  What
is the defeat we are presumably guarding against as a movement?  An
unattractive future?  A future less free than we would like?  A future
that opts out of the technological promises we hope for out of fear or
fundamentalism?  A future that stamps out diversity in a quest for a
singular vision of purity or propriety?  If so, well, *now* you're
talking.  And of course the *reason* I keep talking about all this (I
realized this after I penned a couple of posts about it, wondering vaguely
all the while why I was getting so overheated about all this in the first
place) is because the future extropianism talks about might just need a
movement after all to articulate it, and even maybe the kind of passionate
idealism you're talking about...  But the agenda, the goals, the ideals
seem to me absolutely underspecified so far.  Best, Dale

This is an intriguing idea.  I wonder if the priorities of this
organization would be conspicuously different from others that already
exist.  Is there an as yet unoccupied niche for a specifically extropian
form of political activism?  I'd love to see what it would look like.

But were they really frozen?

All the details in the article seem to be about near-freezing temperatures
without actually freezing or going below 0 degrees C.  The plans for future
use of this technique are for nonfrozen surgeries.   Only the title
mentions "Frozen Baboons" and "Returned to Life".  Titles of articles are
often created later by editors at publication time.

[Berrie Staring suggests a cranial pressure valve]

Let's extrapolate from the narrow case a bit: what other
body mods would be useful in minimizing the kind of
catastrophic damage that we want to avoid most (i.e.,
loss of memory/cognitive function)?  Current protocols
for treatment of head injuries call for the use of an
intracranial pressure monitor, because treatment is not
just a matter of keeping excessive pressure down, but
balancing ICP with blood pressure and other factors to
ensure that there is adequate blood flow to the brain
to prevent ischemia.  And pressure is caused mostly not
by blood but by edema.

So having a builtin ICP monitor, blood pressure monitor,
heart monitor, respiration monitor and some other basic
stuff might be most helpful, especially if they were
tied to a warning system that, say, called 911 when the
heart stopped or brain pressure went over threshhold.
Perhaps we could build some standard sensors with skin-
mounted transducers that could be plugged into a cheap
Fluke meter at home to monitor as many signs as were
needed (diabetics would have glucose meters, etc.)  Is
there an existing technology for internal devices with
external electrical contacts that doesn't have too many
of its own problems?

I have come across a site that some of you may have already seen, but
from what I can see, is an excellent indication of the beginnings of a
completely virtual economy.

Check out http://www.experts-exchange.com/

What it is, is an independent technical support site for all sorts of
computer software/OS's/equipment/etc. that is operated by its members.
The way it works is you register as a user. Initial registration gives
you 300 'points' to spend on asking technical questions of people who
are registered as 'experts'. There are no qualification requirements to
be an expert, you just have to also register as an expert if you feel
you can contribute, and users acknowledge that they cannot hold the
exchange nor the 'experts' responsible for the advice given. Anyone who
is an expert can offer suggested solutions, and if one works, the user
can confirm the successful solution, evaluate the quality of the
solution given, and award the points they originally bid, plus any
quality points based on the grading by the user, to the account of the
expert who was correct.

Here is the financial thing I am getting at: Once you 'spend' all of
your 300 initial points, you can buy more points for $0.10 a piece. This
means that for experts, they can themselves earn points that they can
use for free support from experts in other areas. While this is
currently a closed system that obviously requires input from 'real
money', this could eventually build up enough of a 'point supply' to act
as a mini economy of its own, and this is a harbinger for being expanded
to a whole slew of internet products and services that would  eventually
independent of the real money system.

I registered as both user and expert. I then went to the directory of
questions on the NT operating system, hoping to find that someone else
had asked, and hopefully gotten a solution to, that case sensitivity bug
I had found in NT last week (as you can 'purchase' the solutions to
previously asked questions for a discount from the original solution
cost). I found a guy who was asking a quesiton about RAM vs. virtual
memory allocation, which I knew the answer to, so I replied with the
answer, as well as with another related tip for increasing performance.
THe original bid by the user for the solution was 50 points, but he said
my solution improved his performance so much that I got 200 points for
such a quality answer. So now I've got 500 points to spend on support
quesitons of my own. I earned $20 worth of support with just 5 minutes
of typing. How bout that???

last week I was again confronted with the problem of keeping the inside of
my little dome-tent to an agreeable temperature while there was a blizzard
going on outside (temperature someting like -25 C). I know, it's completely
illogical to want to camp at 12.000 feet at newyear but humans do things
because they _want_ to, not out of neccesity.

Non-isolated nylon tents do little more than keeping wind and percipitation
out. The difference between the out- and inside airtemperature is only a
few degrees without special action. I've tried with several methods that
vary in effectiveness (tips welcome):

- lite the burner.
  Not very good, costs a lot of fuel and generates nasty gas-
  byproducts inside the tent, also the H2O condensates and forms
  ice on the inside of the tent-shell during the night.

- Heat a stone with the burner and place in inside the tent.
  Better, still cost fuel but at least no nasty CO or H2O 
  vapours. Works long enhough to fall asleep.

- Lite candles.
  The candles in my Northern Lights lantirn burns about 8 hours, 
  and ups the temperature by a few degrees. It's more the 
  psychological effect of the warm yellow light I think, also: you
  run out of candles.

- Sex.
  I you can still do this after 10 hours of mountaineering with 
  a 55-pound backback in knee-deep snow you can be on my team any 
  day. Actually this doesn't warm the tent at all and causes a 
  _lot_ of condensation but, hey, who cares.

- Forget about the tent.
  And buy the thickest goose-down sleepingbag you can find (mummie). 
  1400 gramms of down and a pertex/nylon outershell should keep you
  happy 'till about 40 degrees below zero.

This last option seems to be the most energy-efficient, rather expensive
and also a bit boring considering some of the alternatives (It's _so_ much
more fun to cook a rock ;-)

In the not to distant future a nice gadget would be a portable (2 kilo's)
nuclear heating device, prefferebly something that doesn't cause cancer
after 1 hour of usage. Does anyone have an idea how much heat can be
generated by a few ounces of plutonium (in a controllable reaction)?

Even better would be a fusion-pile that uses snow/water/air as a
hydrogensource, this could also be used to generate electricity to charge
the battery's of my cell-phone (works very well now in the Alps) and GPS.
If you're away during the hollidays you'll want to call some people and
it's a real drag if you can't call the rescue-service because you drained
your battery wishing everybody a happy newyear. And it's always nice to
play with the GPS, see how late the sun goes down in Reykjavik on the april
1st 2019 (20:15:34 @ N64.08.758-W021.54.865).

Would it be (at least theoretically) possible to contain the radiation of a
fusion-reaction inside an object the size of a 2-liter bottle? What kind of
material would that take? No neutronium please, I don't like snowshoes as
large as aircraftcarriers.

Ideas anyone?

Just in case I lose my sleepingbag, run out of fuel, candles and other
things that_make_life_worth_living when climbing Olympus Mons on Mars
(someday).

Thanks in advance.
Greetings,
Arjen

Hi All,

First off, best wishes for eveyone in '98!
(I know, my spelling has a 2K-problem, I'm working on that).

Just got back from 2 weeks of climbing in the Alps and we have our first
new member! I know, just one but it's a beginning ;-)

The other great thing: The news-item about the
nearly-frozen-and-then-thawed-monkeys has been in all the papers in
Holland, no one knows what to make of it and this makes our site hotter
than hot. There also a lot of discussion about cloning technology and it's
posible medical applications. Our hits are up and some of our main memes
are becoming general knowledge. And we're just 5 days into the year! This
feels so incredibly good!

OK, I'll stop before I pop a vein (havent got a valve installed yet ;-).

Greeting,
Arjen

The former, yes.  The latter, absolutley not.  Unless some gerontocracy
weirdly starts freezing the eggs of very-late fertile women and has them
(1) fertilised with old men's screened sperm and (2) preferentially
implanted into young women.  A mass market version of Heinlein's Howard

Well, a pacemaker. Using induction or capacitance to send signals
through the skin would allow a fluke type interface to be usable.

An organization that is protechnology but not pro-monopolist, pro-space
but not anti-environment, pro-individual rights (ALL of them, not just
the ones groups like the ACLU and others pick and choose from) but not
pro-supremacist, probusiness, but not pro-mercantilist.

Over at Hypermart, we have considered implementing our own
internal economy. We offer free hosting for businesses, and
the way it currently works is that each and every business
gets the exact same set of features (10MB of space, their
own mycompany.hypermart.net domain, unlimited bandwidth, etc.).
We use regular NNTP-based newsgroups for most of our user
interaction, and have a couple of "help" newsgroups where we
find many of the users answer questions that get posted even
before we can get to them.

What we are considering is giving members a set amount of credits
when they join and they can decide what services they need
to have. So one person might really need some Real Audio
streams, but only need 5 megs of space, or someone might need
20 megs of space but don't need their own domain, etc. Then
they could earn additional credits by answering problems,
finding abusers on our system, and whatever else we can think
of.

At any rate, I think what we are considering expands on the
type of thing at experts-exchange by offering our hosting
services in a kind of internal market economy, where the "costs"
of our various services would fluctuate depending on how much
demand there is for each of them. I think this would allow us
to offer some services like Real Audio or NT hosting that cost
us $$$ without having to buy enough streams/servers for everyone.

So assume you could get together the fundage for something like
this- how would you structure it to allow the wide ranging
views of Extropians to be satisfied? Could you come up with
some kind of self-organizing and very effective structure, or
would you simply hold a vote of the ExI members and create
a Director and a heirarchy?

Such shrubs, grasses and redwood trees have one thing in common - the
living part of the plant is always young, with a growing edge which
leaves behind dead tissue. Redwoods and Bristlecone Pines work this way,
with the redwoods having a very high tannin content which retards decay.

This would also promote innovation, as the person who wrote the
ground-breaking software in any particular niche would make money from
continued improvements for a long time to come.  Tim Berners-Lee would
really get into this idea, I suppose. I suppose patent law would figure
strongly in such a system

I've heard that traditional Korean houses are heated by a wood-burning
stove under the house whose chimney is a meandering ceramic pipe buried
in the floor. A high-tech version of this might let you put the burner
outside the tent while still getting nearly all the heat into the tent.

As I recall, the problem is to keep the heat in while letting the
moisture out. There are many super-lighe and cheap insulators, but
most also trap moisture. What about using a super lighe insulator
such as bubble-wrap in conjunction with a counter-flow heat exchanger
to let the moisture out?

I can think of four three approaches, but they all pretty much require
nanotech.
  One approach starts with small amount of hydrogen held at an extremely
high
static pressure and then imploded using lasers or sound waves. The
pressure
is developed at the center of a set of concentric diamondoid shells,
each of which
can likely deliver a megabar of relative pressure differential. The
maximum
pressure that can be applied this way depends on the pressure at which
the
diamondoid loses its tensile strength.
  The other approaches are reduced versions of magnetic-confinement,
inertial confinement, and beam fusion, all of which may be feasible
using nanotech.

Well, I think that the number one goal should be working to maximize
individual human freedoms everywhere. Not just censorship here or womens
rights there. I mean, the ACLU, as much as I hate their damliberal
stance of avoiding protecting the 2nd amendment, I do respect greatly
for their willingness to at least fight for the 1st amendment rights of
those who even directly oppose what most ACLU members stand for. We
should take a similar stance, only with regard to ALL political rights.
In the US, I think this means we should publicize the 9th Amendment as
much as possible, as that is what gives the most and broadest power to
the people. I kinda look at the 9th as the Curley of the Bill of Rights.
It never gets the attention or respect it deserves, and its always
getting slapped around by the autocrat, Moe.

But in general, we should really emphasize that we don't look at rights
as something that can be treated with a buffet style attitude. Take them
all or take none. BY making this the issue, we paint both sides of the
current political spectrum as extremists, and us as the mainstream that
is for maximizing freedom for the most people.

I think with a general, but firm message like this, we can attract good
PR, support from flighty and often vacuous celebrities (so what its the
message that counts) who can even understand so basic a concept, and
appeal to the broadest range of people. The technological implications
are implicit and can be soft pedalled. We know that it will get here.
What we need to do is prepare the body politic to be receptive to
technology is a way that is not opressive, and to prevent forces from
using technology to yoke mankind firther into slavery.

Dale Carrico observes
: "Technology is good" is as good a transhuman slogan as WIRED's
: recent "change is good" -- that is to say, it is no good at all.

When the Democrats changed "Change!" in '92, I was reminded
of the Waitresses' song "Redland", with the line

	It won't be better, but I'll settle for different.

How about (I'm not even a beginner), take an inflatable mattress and use
it semi-inflated to line the inside of the tent wall?  If you've got more
time & money design a tent with inflated walls?

Mold a quick loose-packed igloo around the tent?

You're using private definitions, apparently for you the ASCII string 
"revenge" means "justice" and "justice" means "revenge", that's your right,  
one definition is not intrinsically better than another; however, for 
effective communication a common definition is useful and that's why I use 
the standard one.

Justice means finding whatever needs to be done to minimize most suffering in 
most people. I admit that the best solution is often far from obvious, but at 
least the problem is clear. 

Revenge means entertainment obtained by causing pain in somebody else. 

Example:

I take your banana. When I'm not looking you steal the banana back.
Justice.

I take your banana. When I'm not looking you steal the banana back, pour 
gasoline on me, set me on fire and laugh at my screams of agony as I burn 
alive and beg for death.
Revenge.

Some iconoclastic futurist (Esfandiary?) suggested that it is silly to
heat the air and other objects in our houses, when what we want to heat
is the people.  He suggested turning the house into a giant, low-power
microwave oven.  This will heat up the people inside without doing much
heating to other objects, saving energy.

Maybe your tent could use a similar idea, positioning a few microwave
radiators around the interior, aimed at your body, to keep you warm without
trying to heat air and keep a thermal gradient at the thing tent boundary.

Okay.  I have a few quibbles here and there, but the main question, the
question I keep returning to, is this:  What makes the organization you
are outlining here *extropian* rather than just fairly conventionally
American libertarian?  Your claim seems to be that the best preparation
for the technological future extropians anticipate is to spread as widely
as possible a respect for rights and liberty in their libertarian
formulations.  This is arguable, and I wouldn't mind seeing the arguments
so long as they didn't veer too much into Basics.  But the thing that is
most relevant to the topic at hand is that the organization you are
outlining would be pretty indistinguishable from a libertarian
organization and I can't see why it wouldn't represent an unecessary
duplication of services.  Is there a uniquely *extropian* agenda and space
of activism that remains to be filled, one that might actually deserve the
moniker "the extropian *movement*"?  Best, Dale

Are you aware of organizations related to the libertarian philosophy?
They are dedicated to this same principle.  As you described, libertarians
support all political rights, first amendment, second amendment, etc.

Are there any ways we would distinguish an Extropian activist movement
from a libertarian one?  Both favor individual freedom, laissez faire
economics, and absence of coercion.  That's about as far as libertarians
go; that is the core which they agree on.  Once people are free of coercion
libertarians are willing to accept whatever they decide to do.

Extropianism goes beyond simple freedom to act.  That is a fundamental
principle but there is more to it than that.  Extropian philosophy
advocates not just freedom, but using that freedom in certain ways,
for self improvement, for growth, for increasing your personal power
and capabilities.

That doesn't mean that Extropians want to force anyone to behave this way.
In effect, these are recommendations.  But Extropians don't want anyone
to prevent others from having the opportunity to work towards these goals.

I would see an Extropian activist movement then as working for the
libertarian goal of anti-coercion, but doing it in such a way that it
targets technologies which give people more power to control and alter
their lives.  In distributing its resources, it would work hardest to
eliminate laws which did the most to impede Extropian goals.  Rather than
working to eliminate bans on heroin, it would try to eliminate bans on
cloning research.  Rather than supporting the right of people to burn
the flag, it would support their right to choose cryonic suspension.

This does not mean that these other goals are wrong, or that no effort
should be expended on them.  But given that resources are limited, an
Extropian activist organization should try to find causes which resonate
with Extropian principles.  All forms of freedom are good, but those which
especially help people to achieve self transformation, self improvement,
self expansion, are the ones which an Extropian organization would be most
interested in.

      Popperians never waste time arguing about the meaning of words or 
      their 'essential' content, because words have no 'essential 
      content.'  Definitions work 'from right to left.'

      'Law' has always been confused as between 'law' (the 'horizontalist' 
      system of rules of interpersonal conduct); and 'legislation' (the 
      'verticalist' edicts of (state) power, wheby some people assert 
      control over some other people). Naturally, the powerful would like 
      you to accept their edicts as having the same moral force as mutual 
      interpersonal rules.

      Most verticalist systems stress 'punishment' or 'retribution' or 
      'retaliation' or 'correction.'  The general idea is "Do this or 
      we'll hurt you.' That is, they're _control systems_.

      Whereas horizontalist systems stress prevention and restitution. 

      Look at the Saxon model of indemnity in England: travellers outside 
      their own community carried certificates of indemnification from 
      their fellow-villagers, so that if they did harm, full compensation 
      could be promptly and reliably made.  This made them more 
      acceptable visitors to other communities.


      Whereas the (typical) Norman State system says: "This is the book of 
      edicts. Do what it tells you or you'll be punished with x, y or z."

                      ----------- * * * * * -----------
     
      Here's a proposed alternative paradigm:

      A key Agorist insight is that we should focus on the nature of acts 
      themselves, rather than on the status or funding of individuals.  
      When rights are not infringed, there is no crime.

      So:

      Let everyone carry full public-liability insurance, issued by 
      comopeting private insurers and reinsured for complete reliability.  

      Let there be a 'pooled' arrangement whereby there are funds 
      available where the harmful person cannot be found.  Then full and 
      fair compensation can be provided for any harm done.

      Let each person carry a personalized radio emergency alarm, to 
      summon the protectiion service of their choice immediately to their 
      exact location.  This vastly reduces the incidence of -- and the 
      costs of -- crime.

      Then, all 'law' becomes event-driven and customer-driven,  Full and 
      prompt compensation is _always_ paid to victims of personal harm or 
      property loss.  Restrictions may be endorsed on the policies of 
      policy-holders, by their insurers, to limit future pay-outs for harm 
      done.   People get the message from their earliest days, that 
      harming people is a no-no.  in all but a few examples of extreme 
      violence, the ultimate sanction is house arrest or confinement to a 
      suitable 'outlaw area."


      The system doesn't even need a State.  Owners/controllers of public 
      and private places can make carrying such insurances a condition of 
      entry.  The system can be substantially self-organizing.

      Cosmos rather than Taxis, in Hayek's terminology.

When I was in the Army, we devised a pretty good heating system on a
particularly cold night, though not as cold as where you are. 

The US Army issues these cheap chemical heaters (just add water) for the
MRE's they issue in the field.  The heaters are nothing more than a piece
of cardboard with chemical crystals in it, about 15cm x 8cm, weighing next
to nothing.  We would find a 2-liter jar or bottle, rip up a bunch of MRE
heaters, and loosely pack the jar about halfway full with crystals and
cardboard.  We would then add water until the jar was about 3/4 full.

This would generate a terrific amount of heat for a couple hours, getting
cooler with time.  For about the first hour or so it would be too hot to
touch, but cool enough that it didn't melt the plastic (~140 deg. F?).  In
a relatively sealed environment, it was actually quite effective at warming
up a tent.

One word of warning though: it creates a small quantity of somewhat noxious
gas (acetic acid?).  We solved this problem by duct taping a hose to the
mouth of the jar and feeding the end out a small crack in the door.  

Using this kind of heater takes practice and finesse to maximize the useful
output for the longest possible time, but it is reasonably effective once
mastered and the chemical MRE heaters are cheap, light, and flameless.

(You can create mildly amusing explosions by mixing heater crystals and
water in a sealed container.)

Enjoy...

This would only really work well if the occupant did not use any metal
objects, which of course, would absorb the mirowave energy much more
efficiently, and heat up to higher temperatures as a result.

Just some further, rather abstract, thoughts about the memes we share.

I recently read the paper "Cultural r/k Selection" by Agner Fog in
Journal of Memetics
(http://www.cpm.mmu.ac.uk/jom-emit/1997/vol1/fog_a.html).

Fog suggests a memetic analogy to the r/K strategies in biology. An r
strategy occurs when there are good opportunities for expansion but
also considerable dangers (such as predators or natural hazards). Then
it will be advantageous for a species to breed as fast as possible and
spend little resources on each offspring. If the population is limited
under scarce resources rather than predation, then a K strategy
emerges where there are few offspring, but much resources are invested
in them. Mice and insects follow r strategies, humans and other large
mammals tend to follow K strategies.

Fog then applies this to memetics, suggesting that the same strategies
apply to memes. Memes that can quickly spread but also are in constant
danger due to predation from other memes, unreliable vectors or
attacks from opposing memes would follow a r strategy, something Fog
calls a regal strategy. Regal memes tend to emphasize the importance
of proselytization, defence of the memetic in-group and homogenity of
belief - it is more important to spread the meme than liking it. K
strategies among memes (called kalyptic by Fog) appear when the meme
cannot easily expand into other meme-pools and there are little danger
for it. In this case it becomes more important to keep the hosts of
the meme interested in it, so selection for positive effects of being
infected will occur, there is little need for keeping the variants of
the meme similar etc. Fog then goes on analysing cultures with this
framework.

Note the similarity between "movements" and regal strategies, and
traditions/idea currents and kalyptic strategies. A movement seeks to
expand its base, becoming more able to influence more people. They
often seek to retain something of an ideological purity (which often
results in them splintering into mutually competing sub-movements). An
idea current has no real drive to expand, it spreads to hosts that can
accept the meme and have little need for orthodoxy. If Fog's model is
correct, then we should expect movements to appear in memetic niches
where it is possible to gain many converts, but there is also plenty
of opposition, and idea currents in memetic niches where it is not
easy to gain new converts, but little opposition.

By now I think it is fairly clear that extropianism is more of a
kalyptic strategy than a regal strategy. Our memes are directed
towards making our lives happier, more efficient and futuristic, often
being based on cooperation with other, related memes. While there are
plenty of people to persuade about extropianism, only a relatively
small subset are likely to become extropians which suggests the need
to invest more energy in creating convincing and useful
meme-offspring. 

If extropianism could somehow find a form that is easily transmitted,
this meme would likely evolve towards a more regal strategy with less
allowances for unorthodox thinking, becoming a typical movement.

Note that neither of these strategies is any "better" than the other
in some moral sense. Kalyptic strategies tend to allow more freedom,
but they are not evolutionarily stable against invading regal
strategies. Regal strategies are able to spread quickly to a large
population and in the lack of any outer enemy gradually becoming
kalyptic (and hence vulnerable to unexpected new regal competitors). A
regal form of extropianism might not be entirely in accordance to the
current ideals, but would be able to amass the strength to get a lot
of practical transhuman work done (if it was lucky), the current
kalyptic form is pleasant but often not very practical.

Sorry for continuing an old thread, but I've been in Canada for a couple

In fact, I think you'll find that some years British football hooligans
have killed more people at football matches than all the firearms
murders in the country. Yet there are no massive media campaigns to ban
football.

I haven't seen any local news coverage yet, but according to the
Canadian papers a prisoner was shot dead in the Maze in Ireland a few
days ago. The Maze is probably the most secure prison in the United
Kingdom, as it's where Irish terrorists are locked up. If prisoners
can still acquire guns despite that security, what hope is there for
disarming criminals in the general population?

Wayne Hayes pointed to a Web site of murder rates, claiming that
they were for the entire US. If he'd looked closely, he'd have
noticed that they're actually for Florida alone, and completely

Scientists build living breasts

 By Lois Rogers
  Medical Correspondent


 SCIENTISTS have pioneered a revolutionary technique to
 grow breast tissue using cells from a woman's own body.
 The treatment is to be offered to breast cancer victims as a
 natural and safe alternative to silicone implants.

 The development will revolutionise the treatment for
 women who suffer disfiguring tumour surgery or
 mastectomies and transform the cosmetic surgery industry.

 Scientists in Boston, Massachusetts, have already grown
 nipples and associated tissue from human cartilage cells;
 the first clinical trials in which nipples will be transplanted
 onto human patients are to begin later this year. Further
 trials involving larger replacement sections of breast tissue
 are planned to follow within 12 months. The researchers
 predict whole breast transplants within five years.

 The tissue engineers working on the project also expect to
 be able to recreate the complex function of lactation and
 produce a later version of the breast which will be capable
 of making milk.

 The regrown nipples, which have a natural firmness and
 projection, take several weeks to grow. They are
 produced from a small sample of fat and blood vessel cells
 taken from the buttock or thigh. The cells are seeded onto
 an artificial pre-shaped scaffolding of polymer plastic.
 Growth factors are added to promote cell division, and
 each cell reproduces itself once every 24 hours.

 Once the scaffolding is full, cell division slows. The
 polymer, which is similar to the material used for dissolving
 stitches in the body, then begins to disappear, leaving a
 completely natural section of tissue with its own blood
 supply, replacing cells only as needed. Because it is
 created from a woman's own body there is no problem of
 the implant being rejected.

 The project is being run by Reprogenesis, an American
 company based in Boston, with university research teams
 at the forefront of tissue engineering in Ann Arbor,
 Michigan, and Charlotte, North Carolina.

 The company intends the replacement breasts, which will
 also be offered for the cosmetic breast market, to be
 available within five years. "Our initial intention is to
 provide an option for breast cancer patients, but the
 method could be used for cosmetic reconstructions and it
 has generated a lot of interest," said Shawn Stovall, the
 company's spokesman.

 David Mooney, assistant professor of chemical engineering
 at the University of Michigan, said the innovation was the
 first of its kind.

 "We are growing a soft tissue that can replace a soft tissue.
 The key element of this technology is that it uses a
 woman's own cells and a biodegradable scaffolding or
 matrix," he said.

 Britain has one of the highest breast cancer rates in the
 world. Every year 26,000 new cases are diagnosed and
 about 10,000 of them require removal of a whole breast or
 a large section of tissue. At present many patients resist
 having replacements because they fear surgery or the
 potential side effects from silicone implants, the principal
 synthetic material used for breast reconstruction.

 Ian Fentiman, professor of surgical oncology at Guy's
 hospital in London, warned that the American researchers
 would have to ensure they did not "re-seed" the cancer
 cells by growing breasts from a woman's own tissue.
 However, he added: "Anything which increases the options
 has to be a good idea. The first question women ask is
 about the dangers of silicone."

 Continuing anxiety over silicone led the government to
 commission a panel of scientists to review the evidence of
 damage for a third time. Silicone implants can harden or
 leak; they have also been linked to cancer, multiple
 sclerosis and arthritis.

 The British market for breast surgery is worth at least =A32m
 a year. Many believe demand will soar if cancer patients
 and those seeking an enhanced profile are offered a safe
 and natural alternative to silicone.

 Margo Cameron, who runs Silicone Support UK for
 women with implants, said: "I get calls every week from
 women who have been disfigured by cancer surgery or
 who suffer torment from being flat-chested. They are all
 desperate to know if there is anything that doesn't contain
 silicone."

UMMC Tissue Engineering Efforts Expands

BIOTECH DEAL PAVES WAY FOR DEVELOPMENT OF "TISSUE PAINT"

Technology could create alternative to breast implants

WORCESTER, Mass. (Nov. 12, 1996) - The University of Massachusetts
Medical Center has entered a biomedical research partnership with
a Massachusetts tissue engineering company to further develop
cutting-edge technology for growing human tissue in the laboratory
-- and to explore its potential uses in surgical procedures ranging
from breast reconstruction to orthopedic surgery.

Officials today announced the signing of licensing and research
agreements between the University of Massachusetts and
Reprogenesis, Inc. A Boston-based firm, Reprogenesis is at the
forefront of the biotechnology industry in researching the use of
laboratory-grown cartilage -- as well as other kinds of tissue --
in the treatment of injury and disease.

Under the agreements, UMMC will receive a $100,000 upfront license
fee; up to $2.3 million in milestone payments that will be made
as clinical trials are initiated and as tissue engineered products
reach the commercial market; $850,000 over three years in sponsored
research support; and royalties on product sales.

The research, to be conducted in UMMC's Tissue Engineering
Laboratory, will be led by Charles A. Vacanti, MD, professor and
chair of the Department of Anesthesiology at UMMC and one of the
nation's top tissue engineering scientists. Vacanti's success in
growing an ear from human cartilage cells -- considered an
important advancement in tissue engineering -- has drawn widespread
national and international media coverage during the past year.

"This agreement represents yet another important milestone
in UMass Medical Center's continuing development as a world-class
academic health center," said Aaron Lazare, MD, chancellor/dean at
UMMC. "Dr. Vacanti is a pioneer in the field of tissue
engineering, and the partnership we've forged with Reprogenesis
is a sterling example of how we use the intellectual resources
and research expertise of UMMC to advance biomedical science,
improve clinical care and bolster the state's economy."


The agreements with Reprogenesis give the company the exclusive
rights to develop, manufacture and sell a technology known as
tissue paint -- a tissue engineering process developed by Vacanti
in which autologous cells are harvested, grown in the laboratory,
and then "painted" on various body cavities and organ
surfaces. Vacanti's initial research with this technology has
produced encouraging results.

The potential clinical applications of Vacanti's tissue engineering
technology will be examined in seven specific areas -- breast
surgery; orthopedic surgery; cosmetic surgery; urology; skin and
wound care; cardiovascular disease; and abdominal medicine.

"Reprogenesis is poised to emerge as a leader among biotechnology
companies in the development of tissue engineering technology
and products,: Vacanti said. "I'm honored to have the opportunity
to work with a Massachusetts company in a research and development
endeavor that may produce a variety of new clinical applications
for this technology, most notably in orthopedic and reconstructive
surgery."

Reprogenesis has been focusing on creating a substitute for breast
implants from a patient's own cells and on using tissue-engineered
cartilage in the treatment of urological disorders.

The UMass-Reprogenesis agreement is the third public-private
biotechnology partnership in recent months built upon the research
expertise of the University of Massachusetts Medical Center.
University officials previously announced:

a multi-million-dollar agreement with Smith &amp; Nephew Endoscopy
of Andover -- one of the world's foremost producers of minimally
invasive surgical devices -- to jointly develop a center for
research in endoscopic surgery at UMass-Worcester.

a $42 million licensing agreement with Pasteur Meriuex-Connaught
-- one of the world's largest manufacturers of vaccines -- for
the development of a new technology for producing vaccines.

All three licensing agreements were negotiated by the University
of Massachusetts' Office of Commercial Ventures and Intellectual
Property, which is responsible for licensing and marketing
technologies developed by researchers working at UMMC and at the
four other UMass campuses.

Tissue engineering is a relatively new field in which autologous
human cells are harvested and grown in the laboratory -- with
the ultimate intent of implanting those &quot;engineered&quot;
cells elsewhere in the body and having them grow to form new
functional tissue. Using the tissue engineering process, scientists
have been able to grow human skin, cartilage, ligament, bone and
other tissue.

In addition to the much-publicized cartilage ear, Vacanti has
grown tracheas, ligaments, tendons and bone. He is co-editor and
a member of the executive editorial board of Tissue Engineering,
and the founding president of the international Tissue Engineering
Society (TES). Vacanti will present his tissue engineering work
at the first TES meeting December 13-15 in Orlando, Florida.

Vacanti is also a reviewer for the New England Journal of Medicine,
the Journal of Clinical Anesthesiology and Biomaterials.
He has lectured to medical audiences throughout the country, and
has authored articles on tissue engineering for numerous
publications, including Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery and Bone
Repair and Regeneration. 

One of the University's five campuses, UMass Medical Center is
a dynamic, multifaceted academic health center that includes the
state's only public medical school as well as graduate schools
in biomedical sciences and nursing. UMMC receives more than $60
million annually in federal and private grants, and ranks second
among the 10 public medical schools in the Northeast in research
funding.


The good/bad news is that Reprogenesis is currently privately held,
I talked with their General Manager, and he's added me to a mailing
list for company info.

First, Insulation is the key, having a top quality sleeping bag is
a must, in case of emergency we don't want you going prematurely
cryonic on us.... ;) A good insulation choice would be to carry a
second dome tent slightly larger than the one you intend to stay
in, (1-2" is best) you erect your tent inside the other, you'd be
amazed at how well this works. 

Is there snow available? Build a Quinzee, which is the loose snow
version of an igloo. Just make a big pile of snow with whatever is
available: shovel, snowshow, hubcab, cardboard (were talking
general survival now) be sure to dig a couple of feet down, the
trick to a quinzee is that snow forms layers at different
temps/water content, when you mix it all up in a big pile it will
freeze solid, and can be easily hollowed out. I've built these at
the military cold weather facility at Bridgeport Nev at -60 at
14,000 feet. If your down in the woods, you can stick a couple of
dozen twigs a foot or so long in the snow to act as 1' guides when
you hollow it out. These babies can be kept well above freezing
inside. We forget what a great insulator snow is, it's only fault
is that its an insulator that starts to melt at 0 degrees C.

Second is to eat properly, no dieting here, calories like crazy...

Third is to drink enough water, cold fools the body into
dehydration, a liter per 20 kilos body weight per day is needed
(like the metric bit?) just to stay even, more to stay comfortable.
The best thing to do if you feel chilled? Drink water. (no alcohol)

Okay, Fourth, you mentioned lighting the stove, not bad, but be
sure to be heating something, melting water is best of course since
its one of your most essential needs, even if you have enough
water, heat some more. Check to see if the maker of your stove has
a separate catalytic heating attachment, you'll burn much less
fuel, much lower emissions and get lots more heat.

When I was a boy-scout, they used to have these really neat pocket
catalytic heaters, the big model was the size of a small paper back
book, you'd state the element, and close the lid (they looked like
big zippo lighters) then drop it into a red flannel pouch and pop
it into your pocket. I don't know if there still made, I've got a
friend who's a scoutmaster checking on it.

Now, electricity! There are a number of manufacturers making
ruggedizeds (sp?) solar panels, you could put it on the outside of
the backback, and charge while climbing! The beauty of it is that
it would get more efficient the higher you go!

        Actually, for what it's worth, the person in question (his name
escapes me at the moment) was shot from outside the prison.  Apparently he
was walking in the chain-linked outdoor portion of the prison yard when he
was killed.  However, the fact that a long-time assassination target such
as he was given *any* exposure to the outside world defies easy
explanation.  Perhaps the Irish government wanted him to be killed.

Aha, the story I read seemed to imply that he was shot by someone

This seems right to me.  An organization or public agenda devoted
specifically to these tasks would look pretty extropian to me.  Although
the conspicuous future-orientation of extropianism remains pretty implicit
in this agenda as it stands.  Isn't a movement to clear a space for
self-transformation only half the extropian battle though?  We also want
to safeguard against potential *dangers* that almost nobody else is in a
real position to perceive.  Foresight's BioArchive project may be an
example of this sort of activism.  I'd be interested to hear ideas for
others as well.  Is it useless to anticipate and work to protect ourselves
against some of the worst threats implicit in a technological singularity,
for example?   Best, Dale

This seems exactly right.  And I agree that kalyptic extropianism (say,
"lifestyle extropianism") is indeed pleasant and useful for its
participants.  But one gets the impression from more strident postings to
the list here and there, that a number of people feel that there is
already a "regal extropianism" they are a part of.  This has always
confused me, and I have been curious to hear about what it consists of
exactly.  
	The details have been slow to emerge.  However, I am beginning
to think that there *is* a place for a regal mode of extropianism (say,
"movement extropianism").  This is not because I think any of us are
looking to "belong" to an orthodoxy -- that's something surely most of us
would resist.  But I think that the preoccupations of "lifestyle
extropianism" produce certain perceptions and sensitivities that put
extropians in a position to see the world and especially the onrushing
future with unique insights.  We see promises and dangers that few people
are thinking about (isn't that what draws us here in the first place?)... 
and this means we are in a position to strategize in the face of that
future in completely unique ways.  
	The agenda emerging from this strategizing could very well yield
the regal extropianism you speak of. Of course, kalyptic and regal
extropianism would comfortably coexist, and there would be no necessity to
choose the one over the other, or to demand that the one evolve or devolve
into the other.  If kalyptic strategies are indeed as vulnerable as you
suggest, perhaps one of the functions of regal extropianism would be
precisely to protect kalyptic extropianism as a free lifestyle from
memetic competitors in the first place, despite its necessary and
delightful resistence to the hierarchization and hardening of the
orthodoxies that works to preserve other meta-memetic regimes (e.g.,
religions, justice discourses, etc).  

Best, Dale

What I read in the funny papers ( I wont claim to their veracity), was
that some INLA prisoners in another wing had gotten out of their wing,
come across the roof, and shot the tory prisoner as he was being driven
to the visitors center.

People are not actually putting both addresses in.  Their software is
doing it for them.  Basically, this occurs when people are replying to
previous posts that were sent to "extropy.org" instead of "extropy.com".
The List software takes those posts under the former name, but sends
them out from the latter name.  Thus, there are two addresses in the
article.  A default Reply-to-All will reply to both unless the person
manually edits out the CC: header after the reply message is generated.

Geneticly and neotenically correct. I did not phrase this well I
mean't to suggest that women having children at progressively later
times in life would become the norm. Some would be able to have
their own (longer lived gene) babies, others could take advantage
of previously frozen eggs (insurance).  Either way people might
start having children when they are better prepared, emotionally as
well as financially. This could have unintended genetic advantages
besides perhaps more children developing better. A memetic effect
having a genetic effect.

It might be odd but it would still work, it's not what I meant
though.

One thing that I would like is some reserve circulation for the
brain. Not sure how to implement it without hypotech, but its goal
would be to sustain cranial circulation and avoid ischemia as long as
possible. 

An ICP/blood pressure/oxygenation monitor would ge a great start. A
fairly simple (well, none of these devices are simple by today's
standards :-( ) possibility would be an autoinjector linked to the
monitor system, so if you went into a unhealthy state it could release
anti-ischemic drugs, antidotes to detected poisons or other useful
chemicals.

That would be extremely useful. Pressure monitors can likely be made
fairly easily, what we really would like is an oxygenation monitor. I
saw a pacemaker last year that had a prototype for this, a small
optical device that measured oxygen inside the heart, but according to
its developer it wasn't that good. More work is needed.

I haven't looked into this field much, but it seems to be fairly
standard to supply power and some information to implants using
transducers (cf. the anti-epilepsy "vagus pacemaker" mentioned here
earlier; I really wonder how *that* stimulation feels!). This would
likely be enough to signal to a device worn in the breast pocket or on
the wrist.

A neater solution might use infrared light through the skin.

Whatever you could do by erasing bits at low temperature you could do by 
erasing bits at high temperature, and using a heat engine to move free 
energy from the low temp source to the high temp source.  (Free energy is 
defined as F = E - TS, and so how much you have depends on the temp.)

I wasn't saying "Justice is Revenge" because I think revenge is a good
form of justice, but because I think what many people call justice is
simply revenge.

I find nothing wrong with people cooperating to rid themselves of a
common threat (in which ever way they see fit.)  But the justice
system goes beyond that, and creates a fixed set of threats which are
apparently (whether you like it or not) for your own good.  And I
would argue that all "punishments" are revenge.

Unless there's plenty of other banana's around, in which case taking
my banana is vengeful.  Otherwise I agree that you should satisfy your
banana needs.  But I don't see why we need to call that justice.

I'd go further and say that this is the dominant way we get better
minds, both now and in the future.  Compare two creatures a century
from now: one has today's brian hardware and tommorow's knowledge, and 
the other has tommorow's brain hardware, but only has access to 
the knowledge of today.  My bet is that the first creature would be 
"smarter" for most purposes.

During the early 80's some friends and I used a slogan from "The
Six Million Dollar Man" 

"We have the Technology."

or how about the classic:

"Entropy isn't what it used to be."

Of course. However, the feature of extropianism/transhumanism that
interests young people a lot is the idea of getting smart without all of
the tiring, boring, pain in the butt studying. Getting intelligence
amplification and instant access to databases, even small databases,
makes a person much quicker on the draw than a Renaissance period genius
in the Vatican Library. Most people don't want or need, or can conceive
of a need for, at this point, access to ALL knowledge. THey want to be
able to process that small subset they do care about and need in a much
faster, less tiring manner. People don't want to be wise, they want to
be 'smart'. Therein lies the difference.

Ok, I see what you mean, and I agree. I would guess that it might be more
convenient to move information around instead of energy, but you're right
that the same thermodynamic effect can be achieved either way.

Earlier you mentioned that most normal forms of matter has maximum entropy
that is proportional to mass, but a black hole has entropy that is
proportional to the square of its mass. Of course this is what allows
black holes to have such low temperatures and be used as heat sinks. But
what I'm wondering is if there is some non-black-hole arrangement of
matter that has maximum entropy that is proportional to the square of its
mass (and has a reasonable volume). If such a thing exists then we can
perhaps use it as a memory store and never have to erase anything.

My first evidence is that our ancestrals did not age (bacteria don't age
and most of the non-aging species are quite primitive in an evolutionary
scale). If aging "evolved", it can be caused by two types of errors: (1)
old processes that started to fail; or (2) new processes that are not
perfect yet.
About the evolution of aging species towards non-aging species, the
question might be asked of weather these species suppressed aging or
their evolutionary "relatives" in more hazardous positions evolved
aging? I think it can go either way, the best evidence I have supporting
the first option is that there is some evolutionary pressure against
aging in species who live non-hazardous lives. For example, in mammals,
the species with the longest life span (ours), is the one with the
longest maturation time, something that can only be achieved by being on
top of the food chain.

Anyway, the best is to read my article about the evolution of aging.
It's a long and boring (yes, very boring, I intend to change that soon
by making it smaller) article, the URL (after saying it is boring you
probably won't be interested but...) is:

How about a small chemical heater of some sort that cleanly and
efficiently metabolizes some substance and generates heat as a
byproduct? Like an ideal fuel cell? Humans maintain an average body
temp of 98.6F from metabolizing a variety of molecules broken
down from food substances; couldn't something much much simpler
than a life form perform something similar for the specific purpose
of generating varying levels of heat efficiently? Is breaking down
water from melting snow, slowly burning the H and exhausting the O2
possible in a tiny device with today's tech? This would seem a
practical level of tech for camping in cold environments with
moisture in some form present.

One problem I see with the "mister fusion" idea is what are the
consequences of pitching the product in the garbage? Would even
nanotech be able to break down all of the elements in the device?
At the very least, you would have to have nanotech for the assembly
and breakdown of such devices; even if the devices themselves were
relatively safe, mass-producing and disposing of them using today's
technology would probably be extremely hazardous.

Not to mention the PR issues revolving around the safety factor of
little Johnny cranking up the heat and slamming the thing with a
hammer. Even if the device itself were 100% safe, along with the
production and disposal (assuming nanotech), any of the words
associated with "nuclear" or "fusion" would probably keep it off
the market long after it first technologically viable to safetly
make and sell. People heavily protested a little battery being
lobbed into the void of space (the Cassini Saturn probe).

Although it might be hard to make money off of (legally), there's
probably nothing to prevent hobbyist from downloading the specs
for the device and nano-assembling it themselves, assuming the
proper element(s) could be obtained (that's probably the sticky
issue that opens a really really big can of worms: if it were
easy, then why not a 100mton explosive device?...). Laws may not
be as strict outside Earth's biosphere, but then who would want
to manufacture personal heater devices "out there" unless they
could sell them "here" or other places for use in uncontrolled
temperature environments (like the surfaces of planets)?...

Technology-wise, Mr. Fusion is a great idea.  ;)

That's sounds like a good innovation that could be applied for
today's camping gear. You might even invert this: have the (tiny)
heater sit inside the tent, and have small, flexible, insolated
pipes (hoses?) vent in air and out exhaust. Or would this be
an unworkable contraption on the small-scale? Maybe an arctic
survival heater similar to this already exists? Or would this be
an unworkable contraption on the small-scale?

I'll see your "eek", and raise you: This thread dovetails nicely with,
among other things, de Bono's observation that the primary purpose of
thinking is to abolish thinking. Crank the mill faster, get out of that
uncomfortable state faster, more subjective *and* objective time to loaf
on autopilot.

Yes, this is IMHO a big problem that will grow even larger. I call it
"miracle pill transhumanism" - the idea seems to be that one day Santa
will arrive with a nanotech pill that will make us transhuman
superbeings. No need to worry, just wait for the Singularity. I have
even seen some people become disaffected with transhumanism because
"nothing happens"; they don't see their pill on the horizon, and miss
the true meaning of Dolly, Polly, supramolecular chemistry and agent
technology, so they conclude that transhumanism is bunk.

Becoming transhuman requires a lot of hard work, careful planning and
serious interest. One can certainly improve oneself in one's spare
time, but to truly grow one have to make it a central part of one's
life and not just a hobby.

So, how to convince people that Wisdom Amplification is as important
as Intelligence Amplification?

OK.  I'd have to agree given what I know.  Of course, bacteria do age in a
sense, but their generations are so quick that the issue is one of semantics.
I.e., they do not age as we do.

The second implies a telos, which is okay by me, but should be pointed out
nonetheless.

Good way of framing it.  It's the polar bear question all over.  (Are polar
bears descended from a white bearlike ancestor or a nonwhite one?
Most would assume the latter, though without any evidence, either might
be the case.  The case comes from _Phylogeny, Ecology, and Behavior_
by Daniel R. Brooks and Deborah A McLennan (1991).)

In some cases, you might be right.  I'm not sure about the human one
having to do with ecological niche.  Even so, there does seem to be
some evidence that developmental times are sensitive to environ-
mental (boundary) conditions.  I read a few years ago of a comparative
studies of possums in the Carolinas.  They found that the ones that
live on the coastal islands developed more slowly than the ones that
lived on the mainland.  The reason seemed to be that they were less
likely to be run over by a car on the islands.:)  (The differences were
in years -- I believe a one versus a three year developmental cycle.)

Two ideas:

Promote something like de Bono's CoRT (make thinking something people
_do_, rather than just something that happens, and take the fear and
frustration about it down a notch).

Promote the notion that thinking (in the broadest sense, as promoted by de
Bono) is more fun than winning arguments via cheap thinking.

I call it "waiting for the bus". It's fine, unless you're the bus driver.

So far, you're spot on. There used to be little naphtha-fired catalytic
heaters the size of a thin bar of soap that you could buy at sporting
goods stores, for pocket handwarmers. I don't know if they're still sold,
or if not, why not; maybe one too many sauced ice fishermen with
frostbite damage compounded by third-degree burns?. Getting complete
combustion seems a bit tricky, but I see no reason why you couldn't put a
platinum post-stage combustor on one. Cost would go up, of course.

A microprocessor-mediated warmer of this type seems possible, as does
combustion regulation using bimetals or shape memory alloys.

Problem is, you've got it backwards. The H is already burned. That's what
oxidation _is_ (*doh!*). So you have to pump energy into the water to
electrolyze it, at least according to conventional models. Danny may think
differently. :)

Personal heaters, water heaters and the like made by using relatively
"hot" radioisotopes are, in the narrowest technical sense, a terrifically
appropriate use of energy that would otherwise go to waste. The heat is
going to be generated whether those ceramic pellets are at the bottom of a
mineshaft or embedded in your self-heating floor. The environmentally 
tricky part is picking isotopes with nuclear decay paths that don't result
in unmanageable neutron-activation of surrounding materials, or gamma
radiation, or radon emission. This could be a tall order; I'm no expert.

However, given how flipped-out people are about something as unthreatening
as asbestos-based building materials, which are mostly only dangerous
while you're creating them or (trying to) destroy them, I don't see
passive heat pellets (which share that threat profile) making any
commercial headway in the current culture.

The Romans used to do this; they might have gotten the idea from the
Etruscans. Transfer efficiency can be high; cleaning the chimney can be
easy or a bitch, all depending on your design details.

Having been doing a little study in the area of thermal transfer in the
shirtsleeve-to-burning-paper regime lately, permit me to take a BOE shot:

Seems to me what you want is a pair of heat exchangers, one to preheat the
incoming air, the other to draw heat from the exhaust and put it into
circulating ("house") air and the preheater. Duct them (both?) from
outside, get good circulation inside the tent, don't let the firebox leak,
and you're in there. If you only duct the exhaust, there are tradeoffs:
slightly simpler system, but possibly some drafts. No matter what,
there's also always going to be some chance that a poorly-set-up system or
changing winds could interfere with proper operation due to pressure
heads. Such interference could be, in worst case, fatal (fire, CO).

I am sure there is a weight and size penalty for those
heat exchangers. How much? Depends on your tech, I'd guess.

Extropians,

	The LDS (Mormons) are constantly preaching about their "Plan
of Salvation" which to me is nothing more than an evil, hateful, and
despairing plan of damnation when compared to extropian beliefs.  I'm
constructing a response to these LDS teachings and have included a
draft of this response here.

	It seems to me that religions, or memes dealing with God have
power because lay people think that such is the more optimistic thing
to hope for.  But to me this is an evil mistaken and wholy unjustified
belief.  To me atheistic and extropian beliefs are much more valuable
and much more worthy of our faiths, hopes, and efforts.  I'm
attempting to point such out with responses like this.

	I plan on using such a response whenever some LDS person
starts talking to me about their "plan of salvation". It is my desire
that such a response will be contrasting and positive exposure to
extropian ideas.  If you have a chance, let me know if I have
misrepresented extropianism in any way or have any other problems with
this.

		Thanks

			Brent Allsop

======================================================================
Issue:
	What do you think of the LDS (Mormon) "Plan of Salvation"?

Response:

	There is much said and written about "God's Plan" in LDS
scripture, literature, missionary discussions...  There is a fairly
concise and brief description of the LDS doctrine of the "Plan of
Salvation" or "Plan of Redemption" in the Encyclopedia of Mormonism,
Vol. 3 by Gerald N. Lund and information can be found on the web such
as

  <URL: http://www.cyberhighway.net/~vchopine/ldsdoc.htm#doc plan>

But To me, such a "plan" seems to be much more like a hideous plan of
damnation to be feared and avoided rather than any kind of "Salvation"
or "Redemption" to be sought after and hoped for.

	It is not my intent to be hostile towards any church or it's
doctrines with critical articles such as this.  Rather, in my attempt
to know about, understand, and have sympathy for what the LDS church
and its missionaries constantly preach, I simply point these feelings
and issues I have out as questions or as a response to this constant
preaching.  If I have misunderstood LDS teachings in any way I simply
want to communicate my current understandings in a hope that I may
someday find these misunderstandings and achieve a better knowledge.
Please don't take what is said here as hostile, but merely as sincere
and possibly constructive questions and concerns I currently have
about some common LDS teachings.

	Within this "plan", for the few that are good enough to make
it to the highest degree of the "Celestial Kingdom" and are
consequently able to become like God, it is evidently their purpose to
eternally continue what has been done in this world by our already all
powerful and all good God, with their own creations, worlds, and
offspring.  Evidently the goal being to eternally create yet more
worlds like this one.  It seems to me that the more damnable,
suffering, and unjust the world, according to this plan, the better.
Apparently, if some spirit children are subjected to anything less
than the maximum possible suffering, unjustice, separation... it will
result in something less than the best possible God or fail to
adequately prove only the best souls.

	The story of Alma and Amulek in the Book of Mormon (Alma
chapter 14) is a typical example that illustrates some of the
attempted justification of some of the evil and suffering contained
within this plan.  In this story evil people (as characterized by
their lack of a belief in God) are torturing "whosoever believed or
had ben taught to believe in the word of God" by doing things like
throwing them into burning furnaces while Alma and Amulek watch in
horror.  Amulek pleads with Alma to "use the power of God" to stop the
"awful scene" and "save them from the flames."  But Alma responds:
"The Spirit constraineth me... [the Lord] doth suffer that they may do
this thing, or that the people may do this thing unto them... that the
judgments which he shall exercise upon them in his wrath may be just;
and the blood of the innocent shall stand as a witness against them,
yea and cry mightily against them at the last day."

	To me such indicates that some of God's Children are
necessarily (i.e. God can't bear any better group of children)
hideously evil and that it is part of God's "plan" to find out which
ones are this way by subjecting God's Good children to their hideous
actions while he is not around so that his (hateful?) "wrath" against
them will be just.

	Finally, in that "last day", despite the oft-touted LDS claim
that "Families Are Forever" many of Gods family or children will be
judged and eternally segregated into various "lessor" kingdoms and
eternally separated from God and the few good members which will
evidently be exclusive members of "The Church of the Firstborn" who's
families continue throughout the eternities, forever subjecting yet
more children to such hideous suffering on mortal worlds such as ours,
to discover which are the bad children and to produce yet more Gods to
be members of this "heavenly" Church of the Firstborn to eternally do
yet more of the same subjection to suffering and death
forever-more... necessarily without a hope that anything better will
ever be possible.  Should it make us happy to know that the purpose of
this life is so we can find out which of our loved ones do not deserve
to be together with the best for the rest of eternity?

	It seems to me that within such a belief system one must
either have a violent hate towards these evil children which are the
cause of so much eternal suffering of the innocent and good or (as
indicated by such violence as forceful "consignment" to lessor
desirable kingdoms and forced separation from the best...), if one
doesn't hate them then it is the ultimate in faithless despair.
Evidently LDS believe there are some people that clearly know the
difference between good and evil and have perfect ability to choose
either, yet they still choose evil or bad for some ununderstandable
reason.  How terrible, it seems to me, to be forced to give up all
hope, to realize that some of your beloved family members would turn
out to be so terrible.  It seems to me that there is no other logical
possibility between these two very despairing choices - either hate or
despair - within such belief systems or sets of plans.

	To me, extropianism <URL: http://www.extropy.org/> gives one
much more to believe in than such eternally despairing damnation.
Rather than accepting and attempting to justify evil and suffering, as
must be done if one believes in the existence of powerful and good God
one can hope that all evil can be overcome and completely eliminated.
An extropian optimistically recognizes and acknowledges the progress
their ancestors have made to date in all areas including life, love,
science, morals... and in everything.  to me, an extropian sees death,
separation from loved ones, injustice, and most all of the worst evil
that we now suffer from as simply the product of mortal foibles and
lack of progress - i.e. something that can be overcome.  Our ancestors
have endured and overcome many problems.  Thanks to this with a bit
more of such continued progress we are about to overcome the most
serious and painful ones such as death.

	If one believes that there is an all powerful God, then one
must abandon such hope of completely overcoming evil.  They must
recognize that no matter how much man progresses they will likely
never (at least not soon) achieve the ability to eliminate evils such
as death since evidently the already good and powerful God can't (or
shouldn't) eliminate it.  If a good omnipotent God can't even (or
shouldn't) eliminate evil and death, how can we ever have a hope for
or have a reason to strive to be able to do such?  Instead we are left
with irrational theodicies or fruitless attempts to justify and accept
evil.  The fruits of such beliefs are clear in the lack of support of
fundamentalists in such efforts as the curing of cancer, aging...  and
so on.  They simply give up and accept the despairing assumption that
such will never be possible.

	It seems to me that extropians, rather than attempting to to
justify evil in these many kinds of (to me evil) theodicies, have a
real hope that with a bit more progress and work (added to the near
infinite and omnipotent work which has already gone before us), evils
such as death can be overcome and will be once and for all eliminated,
even possibly for all. (See Tippler's "The Physics of Immortality" for
some examples of possible theories of universal salvation and
resurrection.)

	To me as long as there is ANYTHING that causes anyone to
choose bad, or to choose that which they don't really want, they are
not really free.  To me, agency is not something bad, or the cause of
evil, or something to be made out as a scapegoat.  To me such
despairing or hateful beliefs are at least as bad as believing in a
malevolent God.  To me true free agency is something good and glorious
and will only finally be achieved when everyone can finally overcome
all of the many mortal foibles which cause sin.  We will only be
really free when we all finally can make the right choices and get
what we really want or by definition that which is good.  Only when
everyone can choose what they really want, eliminating all causes
preventing them from getting such, will everyone finally be free.

	Rather than justify evil, Extropians, because of the evidence
of the success of the works and accomplishments of all that have gone
before, have faith in the possibility of, continue to strive for, and
look forward to a day when they will be able to bear children into
worlds where they can very rapidly grow to become very powerful and
good Gods without all this lengthy injustice, death, evil, separation,
judging, elimination, suffering...  An extropian doesn't die or suffer
for those they love, they want to live for, enjoy, and be with all
they love.  I have a hope that all will be able to be free and choose
good or that which they really want and that eventually everyone will
never be forced to do something like die and/or be separated or
segregated from any loved ones the way we are now forced to do.

	Many fundamental religions make similar attempts to theodicies
or justify evil in the face of the belief in an all powerful and all
good God and present similar "plans of salvation" or use of free will
and such as scapegoats.  It seems to me that all of these problems and
issues apply equally well to them.  Since I was raised in the LDS
church their particular variation on these themes is the one I am most
familiar with and the reason I have focussed on them in particulate
here.

	It is my feeling that such universal perfection and salvation
might be possible and what I will forever strive for.  I will never
give up striving for, having faith in, or hoping for such, no matter
how much the various fundamentalist religions insist that I give up
and accept their bad news.  At least not until it or something better
is perfectly achieved some way or another.

Whoa up, there!

I'm not promoting this, just reporting it. 

You also may be taking de Bono's provocative utterance the wrong
way. 

It's not prescriptive, it's _de_scriptive, of the mass of people. 

I have fun thinking, too. But we're atypical. 

de Bono's point is that (both from watching how uncomfortable people
get when asked to think, and from what would today be found to fit nicely
with evolutionary psychology) thinking evolved (culturally and/or
biologically) as an OH MY GOD NOW WHAT operation, and the organism qua
organism is perfectly content and frequently most comfortable not using
its brain to do any more than what it habitually does--burble gently
through rivulets that become rivers. de Bono doesn't call that thinking.

I agreed with your "eek" for the right reason, honest. :)

Well, I think that there will also be big leaps in training technologies
for problem solving/decision making in the near future, especially once
the teacher's unions go under. Eliminate the teacher memetic
monopoly!!!!

He is right. I have always said that "while necessity may be the mother
of invention, laziness is its drunk ass dad" (you can put that in your
quote file as well!). The point of any innovation is to reduce the
amount of work it takes to produce a set amount of goods or services.

Pure laziness.

Being efficient is not being wise, and working smartly does not require
that one be a philosophical tower.

Maybe, or maybe its merely a matter of what is most cost effective at a
given point in time. Most people have their long term internal discount
rates set too high.

I tire of it as well, but more toward the incredulity that these areas
would need to be debated. I think that this is a strong indication of
how much many of the most progressive people are still, at their deepest
levels, under the influence of anti-individualist, anti-progress memes,
and a warning that if such memes remain in such individuals, how
pervasive and dominating they must be amongst the masses.

Here's a solution that is already here.

J.D. Krystall, Inc, in Issaquah, WA, has been working for several years,
in a project with WSU and the Energy Dept in developing furnaces that
burn propane or natural gas, and use GaAs/An composite solar cells to
generate electricity. The original application was for a hubrid car, but
the company is developing all sorts of products that are in testing,
including a combination camp stove/heater/generator, a furnace/generator
for the home that recesses into the wall, and others. The solar cells
are 35% efficient when exposed to the high intensity visible and IR
radiation of the burning fuels, and the hot exhaust gasses can then be
used for heating purposes, which can be force driven by electric fans
powered by the solar cells.

Yes, I really don't look forward to another Civil War. And, with the exception 
of the American Revolution, almost all wars lead to a massive decrease in 
freedom.

I can't tell you the source of your quote. :-(

The government, if it exists, should only enforce laws to protect people's 
liberty and property and make sure contracts are enforced. However, under our 
current legal system, acts which are not immoral, like taking drugs are 
criminalized, while theft by the government (taxation), certainly immoral, is 
quite legal. Ideally, everything immoral should be illegal, and everything moral 
should be legal. I am however, speaking of rational morality, not the often 
idiotic kind advanced by religion. 

For an example of immorality posing as morality, see the truly vile piece by Dr. 
Sally Satel (an evil psychiatrist) in today's Wall Street Journal advocating 
using coercion against drug users "for their own good." It's a shame this Nazi 
bitch is given space in one of our leading newspapers, but the WSJ is run by a 
bunch of superstitious religious conservatives who have no idea of the real 
meaning of freedom.

Any judgement that does not a) provide proportionate compensation to the
victims, and b) rehabilitate those that are capable of being
rehabilitated, while eradicating those who are not from the gene pool,
is not justice.

it is reestablishing the stasis in existence prior to the use of
unjustified force.
A justified force in equal opposition reestablishes the prior state.
Justice.

At the same time, if you peacefully ask me for part of my banana, and I
refuse, that is acting justly within ones rights. If I refused, told you
to "go get a job you lousy slacker, you aren't worth a pot of piss, etc
etc etc" and called a cop on you for being a vagrant panhandler,
loitering and harassing pedestrians, that would be another thing
entirely..

U.S. scientist poised to clone humans, radio says

A Chicago-area scientist is poised to start experiments on
cloning human beings to create babies for infertile couples,
National Public Radio (NPR) reported Tuesday. It said Richard
Seed, a physicist who has done fertility research in the past,
was proposing setting up a clinic that would clone babies for
would-be parents. NPR said Seed had been negotiating with a
Chicago area clinic, which it declined to name, that had all the
equipment needed to try the procedure. Seed could not be
immediately reached for comment.

Well, if we are to first assume that to prevent aging means to encourage
constant cell growth, then we run into a bit of an engineering problem.
At our current size and growth rates, the average human, if it kept
growing would eventually reach heights and girths that would push the
structural limitations of the human skeleton, as well as push the
hydrodynamic tolerances of the cardiovascular and lymphic systems, i.e.
we'd develop bone disorders (as many giants do) as well as increased
risk of heart failure. To counter this, we can either a) move out of a 1
g gravity field, to the moon or Mars, etc. or b) genetically engineer
ourselves to grow slower from the get go, and/or improve the structural
and hydrodynamic capabilities of the human body.

I think that the real question to ask is why simple organisms can keep
on dividing and reproducing without any serious genetic drift or loss of
chromosomal integrity, as we experience with our shortening telomeres,
and what can we do to maintain youthful or at least positive sum cell
division rates for as long as possible. Budding, anybody? Perhaps for
real immortality, we will need to genetically engineer ourselves to bud
off clones of ourselves as a natural process, with some sort of organ
that uses indictive or capacitive signals to pass data through the skin
for a sort of mind meld capability.

Ah, Biotime. The hype here is a bit on the over optimistic side, IMHO.

I saw a demo of Hextend in freezing a hamster at the first Alcor
Cryonics Festival about 2 years ago. It worked. Catch is, the amount of
freezing is quite small, about -2 to -5 degrees C. I'm glad they've been
able to do this with a bonobo, but it's a long, long way to -196 C.

In 1966, Biotime started at about $2.00 and went up to around $30.00. I
bought some at $5.00... Biotime offered some warrants at $20 - one share
for every 10 that I owned. I excercised these when Biotime was around
$30.00.

Then it began to sag, and I put in a stop order at $25. Biotime promptly
went to $ 24.50 and then rose and rose, now trading at about the
equivalent of $54.00 (It split 3 to 1, so the list price is $17 at my
last look). Oh well, I only made a 5 to 1 win here...

What pushed Biotime into the 60s for while was that the FDA has
basically approved (I am a little hazy on the details here) Hextend for
further human clinical trials.

Though I feel Hextend is an excellent product, I feel that its prospects
are less rosy than the Biotime people say for these reasons:

	1. The best so far blood extenders cost about
	 $40 per liter. Biotime wants to sell Hextend
	at $100 per liter.

	2. The entire blood extender market is at present
	 about $ 30 million per year. Biotime's book value
	 is around $200 million, for a company with around
	 a dozen employees. These numbers don't quite make
	 sense, unless the blood extension market grows a
	 lot.

	3. There's a LOT of work going on for blood substitutes
	 by the competition. Note that blood substitution is the
	 really big market, much more than blood extension.

I'll put it this way: If I hadn't sold at $25, I'd certainly sell now
and wait about a year...

It was a fellow in Colorado Springs who had a newsletter on energy which
was in favor of nuke power plants. To do this well, the microwaves
needed to be in the millimeter range to only heat the skin surface. A
concern of mine is that some tissue might be sensitive to such
radiation, for example the cornea.

Two problems here: 

1. Compact electrical power source & storage with low mass. Perhaps a
fuel cell.

2. Where you lie down on the ground won't get heated. It would take a
thick air mattress, say 10" or more to fix this.

Also, if you have a source of electrical power, just wire a heating
blanket into the sleeping bag... forget the microwaves.

If you want ova from the long-lived to supplant those from the young, you'd
need to persuade lots of the young to forego using their own youthful ova
and host spare gametes from the Darwinnowed old.  Plus the advantage, of
course, that youthful wombs are better able to carry healthy babies to term.

Mark conflates morality and law.  I believe the two are distinct.  There are
acts
which are immoral which should not be illegal, such as smoking.  Smoking is
self-destructive -- yet it should not be outlawed.  Under a rational morality,
smoking would be wrong, but no police officer would come knocking at your
door if you smoked.  Ditto for overeating, lack of exercise, most drug use.

Rational morality cannot be forced.  It must be spread by persuasion.  The
only time force can be used is when someone initiates or threatens to
initiate force.  Then it is just a matter of defense or just retaliation.

Someone mentioned Richard Seed being on the radio for his desire to set up
a human cloning clinic.  While I'm all for human cloning, from hearing Seed
speak on the radio, he sounds just like the kind of kook the media wants to

I guess we'll hear more soon.

Considering how heavily most religious people weigh in against the idea,
he was probably just dropping some meme grenades to help nullify the
righteousness of the opposition.

Considering that he was the guy who developed the procedure for woman to
woman embryo transfers, and several other fertility breakthroughs (which
were in their time, considered unethical and radical), I think that
while he may be a bit daring to take on the establishment, he's exactly
what we need right now to oppose the reactionary luddites.

Correct. Law should only be applicable to cases where one individual
hurts another in some way without consent. Every person should have the
right to do whatever one wants with oneself, no matter how immoral, and
only with others with their consent. THis is what I find so ironic about
religious people trying to legislate morality. If a person has no legal
choice but to be moral, where is the virtue??? Virtue comes from making
the concious choice for being good, which can only occur if the
individual is totally free to choose either way.

Since the Supreme court has effectively taken the federal government out
of the abortion issue, based on the 9th and 10th amendments, any
reproductive issue should really be fought at the state level. If a
state's citizens decide to pass a state constitutional amendment
outlawing cloning, it is their right to do so, as passing such an
amendment transfers their indiviual rights under the 9th amendment to
the state under the 10th amendment.

Yep, it's all over the press/papers here in Chicago today, I was a
little surprised, I thought Klinton and the congressional luddites
passed a law against human cloning research...

If not look for one.....

The Milwaukee Journal picked up on Richard Seed about 4 weeks ago, he
made almost identical comments at a cloning conference in Chicago then.

Does anyone out there have his email or address? If so, please send it
to me privately.

Thanks

I think you are kidding yourself when you are comparing internalized
knowledge with an external database. Even a mental index of a treekiller
library is much better than a hardcopy of it.  With an external database,
you have the knowledge absorption bottleneck.

This bottleneck is also my chief objection against the often claimed
limitlessness of the human/machine synergy -- imo there are limits to how
far even an optimal GUI can take us. Without gradual/incremental uploading
there obviously cannot be a continuous, traversable trajectory to godhead.

Bottlenecks can also cause a division into Us and Them (internal and
external systems), which is at least deletorious, and can even provoke
strife if the external systems grow too autonomous. Since we cannot claim
to have their protean qualities, we would probably lose.

Less tiring is certainly true. I know not how other people are feeling,
but I choose firing up a search engine over a (often frustrating) session
in the library, even if the scope is less broad, and the quality of
obtained material dubitable. I've done some evangelizing about the virtues
of the Internet and online publishing at the local faculty (Moscow State
University, Polymer Science Dept.), but I have a strong feeling that the
majority has still not grasped its full implications. Reluctancy to do
some experimenting goes in hand with unreasonable expectations to find
free high-quality online resources, imo a strange attitude for an
ex-socialist culture.

Very well, thank you.

Sorry, couldn't resist.

I am very pleased to report that your question induced me to do a Web
search that led me directly to the below URL, which I hadn't
heretofore known.

Check it out.

I probably heard the same quote by Richard Seed
(aired on NPR), and I think what Seed said was pretty
unusual in ways... If his intent was to throw out a
few comforting words to religious people to minimize
the flack from them, he failed, as what he said will
enrage the Christian fundamentalists.

Sure, he starts out pretty conventionally
(religion-wise):

(from my memory) "God created man in his image..."

but then he goes off on an unusual tangent:

(I paraphrase from memory) "and it is inevitable that
we will eventually achieve god-like powers and become
practically like gods. So, these scientific advances
are in line with God's will..."

Be aware that you can confirm the accuracy (or lack
therof) of my paraphrase by hearing his exact words
in RealAudio format at NPR's Web site at

http://www.npr.org/news/health/980106cloning.html

No, Christian Fundamentalist will not be soothed by
this statement. It is very much against their way of
thinking, which stresses the flawed nature of
humanity and the need for God to redeem it. Seed's
statement is almost extropian, except for the implied
existance of God.

(Can a person believe in God and still be effectively
extropian? I would say, "Yes, provided that he/she
accepted that their belief was unproven and
unfalsifiable, and therefore outside the realm of
science and rationality." Such a person might act in
an extropian manner in all ways that matter to
extropians. Perhaps, in light of studies (which may
have been poorly conducted) that belief in God is
good for a person's health and longevity, the person
merely chose to carry the God meme for his/her own
extropian benefit, although some might consider this
quite a mental juggling act. How is it spelled,
"Deism"?)

THis is what I mean by a meme grenade.

THis implies that our own striving for godly powers is obviously part of
gods plan, else why would we be able to do it in gods universe if it
weren't? Kind of the 'if man were meant to fly' routine. Since we can do
it, then He must want us to, obviously.

I suggest that there are some variants on a belief in God which are
consistent with Extropian thought.  In fact, some thinkers who are quite
Extropian in many ways would suggest that it is almost certain that God
(or someone like him) exists.  I am referring to the belief that the
universe we live in is engineered or constructed, and possibly maintained,
by intelligent beings.

Hans Moravec and Frank Tipler have both proposed that in the future we
will be able to create computer simulations of this and other universes,
and that it will be quite natural to do so.  In particular we may choose
to simulate past times of our own universe in different variations.
If this is done enough times (and Tipler believes that it will be done
an infinite number of times) then you could argue that the odds are
overwhelming that "this instance" of our lives (if that phrase means
anything!) is actually part of one of these simulations rather than the
original real-space run-through.

In addition there is the prospect of creating basement universes,
entirely new Big Bangs where we might even have control over some of
the laws of nature, and where we could eventually design those laws to
favor the formation of new living and intelligent beings.  Conceivably we
could even encode our own minds into those laws so that we can guide or
control events in certain ways.

The existence of these kinds of gods may not be completely untestable,
although without knowing their motivations it is hard to know what we
might do to discover their existence.  Moravec describes a scenario where
a sufficiently advanced life form in a simulation is able to deduce the
facts about its situation, but the prospect seemed a bit far-fetched.
Tipler proposes that the gods will extract people from the simulation at
the moment of their death, at least some of the time.  Presumably there
would be nothing to stop someone running a simulation from intervening
to produce miracles or even answer prayers, if they chose.  But evidently
this behavior is not common in our universe.

In the context of Extropian philosophy, there are two aspects to believing
in this kind of God.  On the negative side, it could induce passivity, as
people hope with Tipler that a merciful God will resurrect them into a
marvelous new world upon their death.  On the positive side, it holds out
the prospect that we could become Gods of our own universes.

People often complain about God's management of the universe, with the
existence of evil and suffering often being suggested as signs of God's
nonexistence or even his evil nature.  But it may be that in as little
as a few decades we will have the ability to create conscious simulated
entities within computers, which we can rule absolutely.  This will be
an awesome power, with heavy responsibilities.  Will we do better than
the universe we see around us?  Should we insure that our creatures live
lifes of ease and comfort, with never an unpleasant moment?  Or may it
turn out that we must subject them to difficulties and give them freedom
to behave badly in order to produce the most fulfilling lives?  In a few
years we may not find it so easy to criticize God for his mismanagement.

Trivial; but also not supported.  The primary distinction of lifespan 
arises from reproductive costs, population growth rates, and the probability 
of adult survival.  (Futuyma, "Evolutionary Biology" p. 273-273)  Predation,
which is hard to evolve for, generates the same results as disease and
parasitism, which are generally easier to evolve for.

Where the hazards of reproduction and the growth rates
are low and the probability of adult survival high (e.g. trees) populations
reproduce continuously over their adult lifespan.  Such populations evolve
to live as long as possible - there is virtually no selectable variation 
for lifespan.  (M.R. Rose "Laboratory Evolution of Postponed Aging" Evolution
38: 1004-1010)  What selectable lifespan variation remains is strongly tied
to negative things, primarily late reproduction.

Where the hazards of reproduction and the growth rates
are high and the probability of adult survival low (e.g. salmon) individuals
reproduce only once.  Here evolution does indeed tune lifespans for optimal
reproduction (sorry, no references in the house).  Such individuals, however
don't age; they die in the prime of life, usually from hormonal death clocks.
If this premature death is prevented, the creatures usually live greatly
extended spans, displaying typical aging features.

All those centuries of studying God's supposed attributes may come in
handy as well as human beings ever more closely approximate gods
ourselves, to wit: The fact that theology was never able to reconcile the
omni-predicates shows us that Powers will always have politics as well as
their share of problems.  Best, Dale

Definite time/space coordinates have been agreed upon
for the a first meeting of Midwest Extropians!

Time: 4:00 PM to ?

Date: Saturday, 10 January 1998

Place: We will meet in front of the IMAX theater at
Navy Pier, Chicago. Navy Pier has an excellent Web
site at www.navypier.com which has plenty of
information and maps. I will be there by 4 PM, and
will be wearing a badge with the word "EXTROPY" on
it. After we have gathered, we will discuss options
as to where to go from there to eat.

At various times during the last five weeks, nine
people have indicated interest in this gathering.
More recently, about five people continue to confirm
their intention to be there. Any people who think
they will be there should let me know (again); this
information will be helpful on Saturday when we will
be trying to decide if everyone has arrived. In any
case, we will probably wait at the rendevous place at
least until around 4:15 PM.

Two things:  Proportionate compensation doesn't have to involve the
criminal.  If I need to defend myself from someone then rehabilitation
is an option (although a difficult one.)

Revenge.  You're using force against someone who you consider to be
unjust.  You can call it just or unjust all you want but the reason
you want to reestablish prior state is because you thought it was
unfair and you want revenge.  When in fact it is neither fair nor
unfair, it just is!  Besides, reestablishing the prior state isn't at
all extropian!

A law against Federal money being spent on human cloning research, yeah.
I don't know about an outright ban.  Same with fetal cell research: it's
not banned, you just can't use Fed. money.  As much research depends on
Fed. money, it often seems like a ban.  Even more so if strings are tied
to any organization receiving Fed. money -- again, most universities.

I don't agree with you that smoking is immoral. I view it as a choice 
that people make which is stupid. The same with overeating, etc. As an 
extropian, I am obviously interested in extending my lifespan. However, 
I do not take things to extremes. I am not on a 10 per cent fat, 1200 
calorie a day diet even though that might give me a few more years. I 
like having a chocolate chip cookie once in a while. Does that make my 
actions immoral? One problem with your definition of morality is that I 
am unsure where you draw the line. Is any action which does not serve to 
extend your life immoral?

In my view morality , like good manners, only comes into play when you 
are relating to other people. A person on a desert island can be stupid 
and self-destructive, but he can neither be rude nor immoral. 
Immorality, in my view, involves the use of force or fraud against 
others. This, I think, is a rather simple and easy to understand 
definition. 

I really don't like being called immoral because, say, I eat a box of 
chocolate chip cookies. (By the way, I am slim.) I think that really 
trivializes the word. I think immoral should be equated with evil, such 
as murder, rape, theft and mayhem.

Daniel, we disagree on the definition of morality. I agree that bad 
personal habits should be no concern of the law and attempts to change 
others should only be accomplished by persuasion UNLESS they violate the 
rights of others.

Reading cnn's news article:
     Clinton issued an executive order blocking the use of federal funds        
     on human cloning research and proposed a law banning such research         
     for five years,

     Several measures to ban cloning are awaiting action in Congress. In        
     the meantime, the Food and Drug Administration says it has the             
     authority to regulate human cloning research.

There you go.  Benefits of our wonderful democracy; we can't even pass
cloning ban quickly.  Britain would be (has been?) much faster.

CNN is also taking an Internet poll.  Utterly unscientific of course, but 
it's registering 32% yes, 65% no, 1% only in cases of infertility.  I
list in the order options are presented, which may shape the results.

I disagree that "vices" such as smoking, drinking, whoring around, etc. 
are immoral. To me a virtuous persion is someone who doesn't coerce, 
harm or cheat others. 

Who's the moral person in this example?

1. Mr. A. He never drinks, smokes, overeats or has sex but has just 
embezzled $50,000 from his company. 

2. Mr. B. He  smokes, drinks, overeats and goes to hookers every night, 
but has not embezzled $50,000 from his company.

Religious people are not really trying to legislate morality. They are 
really acting immorally in trying to force their personal preferences on 
others.

Packing volume can also be an issue. Besides: "mister fusion" could provide
so much heat that even at _extreme_ low temperatures (near the top of
Olympus Mons) it would provide sufficient heating whereas insulation has to
get thicker and thicker as temperature goes down.

But how to operate is then? Remote control? You really don't want to leave
the tent if it's forty below and a force 10 wind is blowing. Also the
size/wheight and complexity of the burner goes way up. And burning fuel is
not a longterm option (2 persons can last a week on 1 liter if it is just
used for melting snow and cooking, when fuel is used for warming the
amounts required are two or three times as much).

Yes, one of the biggest problems is perpiration condensing/freezing on the
outside of your sleeping bag or, even worse, inside the outershell clogging
the down and reducing it's insulating effectiveness. The best solution so
far seems to be a nylon liner inside the sleepingbag, as long as your wear
thermal underwear (the Startrek stuff) it's not too sticky and it ups the
range of the bag by 5 degrees.

Good point, hadn't thought of that.

I've used insulated tents in the Arctic, they're great as long as you don't
have to carry them. We had sledges that allow 200 or more pound of gear (as
opposed to 55 in a backpack when your climbing up a hill)

 >Mold a quick loose-packed igloo around the tent?

This can (and has) worked if there is loose snow, not too much wind and if
you want to spend time shoveling snow after putting up your tent at the end
of day. This combination is rare if you're in a high&cold environment.

Down is one of the last natural materials that has not been replaced yet by
polymers in outdoor gear (As cotton, wool and manilarope has). I had a
sleebingbag made-to-order by my supplier and have never been cold since
(even at -35C inside the tent). Regrettably it's very vulnerable to dirt
and moist.
The way hollowfibers are going I would expect it to completely replace down
in 10 years.

Ouch! that's another 8 pounds! Not to mention a small heap of cash ;-)
Nice in a base camp that does not have to be moved, but they're generally
not that cold to begin with (well, cold's relative ;-).
If wheight is not so much of an issue an insulated tent that was mentioned
in another post is great (expensive though).

I've built ice-iglo's but never a Quinzee. Sounds cool, I mean great ;-)
I'll give it a try when I have a chance (next month maybe).

True, when the tent get's half-buried in a snowstorm it's actually warmer.

Yes! Go 4000m+. Eat 4.5 million calories a day and still lose wheight! ;-)

Tea or soup is even better, water from snow is almost pure H2O and you lose
a lot of minerals sweating all day. People in the himalayas often put salt
in their tea instead of sugar (also because it's cheaper).

Also a good idea! I haven't looked into this for my MSR whisperlite, having

I've tried them but I'm pretty sure the energy density is considarebly
lower than high-octane fuel I burn in my stove. My supplier has very small
plastic chemical heaters that are handy as a part of a first-aid kit but
I'm not sure they would be practical for several weeks.

Yes, when traveling in a sunny climate solarcells are a great way to charge
a battery. I does take a nice clear sky to really get some power though. I
used a laptop in the Andes last year for logistical calculations and
analysis of GPS-data. Six solarcells about the size of CD's powered it in
basecamp and charged the batteries (Also of the GPS and VideoCam). Lotsa
power in good wheather but difficult to store (remember the story of the
electric car?).


So: there seem to be at least some outdoor types here, who's coming on a
climbing expedition to Mars? I believe Olympus Mons is more than tree times
Everest in height! Or maybe we can do something on this planet a bit sooner
;-) Anyone interested in an Extropian/Transhuman hike in the Rockies maybe?

Brian, you offer very sensible alternatives that are becoming the norm even
today.  Clearly, the longer we live, the longer we will want to extend
reproductive options.  This need not negate chronically young people to
continue to have children.  (Emotional intelligence is relative and some
people are well-equipped to raise children responsibly at a young age.)

Very-late fertility in women is not a handicap.  Some young fertile women
carry unhealthy genes and are incapable of taking a pregnancy to term.
Statistics obviously show that very-late fertile women are more inclined to
not develop a follicle  that can release an egg, fertile or not.  What is
the handicap is not having adequate facilities and technologies to freeze ova.

Perhaps when Richard Seed develops ways to take an unfertilized egg and
remove the genetic information from the nucleus and replace it into another
nucleus ... 

Today and yesterday, an advantage is a healthy womb or as Damien says, a
"youthful" womb.  Tomorrow there will be replacement wombs such as synthetic
wombs that are far more hospitable than today's biological womb.  When this
happens, (and it is just around the corner), the entire act of procreation
from fertilization to delivery will occur outside the transhuman body.

It sure is, if the new state is a socialistic totalatarian
antitechnological fundamental islamic one.

The big difference between justice and revenge is the role of passion,
emotion. I can very dispassionately state, beleive and practice a policy
of seeking redress and compensation for unjust confiscation and
violation, without being as blinded by emotions as many people get.
People who are vitimized, and are demanding the death penalty before the
trial begins are seeking revenge. Those who are impartial judges,
assuming innocence until judged guilty by a jury of peers, and then just
as swiftly have the convict shot are seeking justice. Big difference.
Those who seek revenge are righteous, and are thus prejudiced. THose who
seek justice are impartial until proven otherwise by an examination of
all of the relevant facts.

Do I detect a hint there of a faith that *further* narrowing the

Not so long as the system is built on coercion in the name of a majority.

Where there is true agreement, there's no need of force (or the threat
of force).  But because people are different, you'll never get everyone
to agree on everything, unless it's to leave each other to enjoy (or
suffer) their respective choices in peace.

It's tempting to imagine that if people were smarter, more rational,
more honest, more conscious of the general good and more able (and
willing) to put their narrow interests aside, then there need never 
be another disagreement, because Truth would necessarily be recognized 
by all.  The last century's developments in mathematics (not to mention
physics) suggest otherwise, but suppose it's true; FIRST you have to 
choose a way to reform the schools, and lotsa luck getting agreement
on that!

Why pour good wine into a sewer?  (You don't get a better grade of sewage.)  
Where coercion is legitimized, there is and will always be 
a magnet for corruption.  
Apply your ingenuity instead to build a new kind of institution.

I disagree. There are two major perceived dangers of nuclear energy:
waste isotopes and massive energy release. If nanotech can permit us to
build tiny reactors, the massive energy release goes away: your "mister
fusion" is more like your gas tank than like a supertanker or an oil
refinery in this regard.
 If, as you say, nanotech can permit complete recovery of
the dangerous isotopes generated
by neutron activation, then all that remains is deactivation of those
same isotopes. This is also perfectly feasible, because these isotopes
can be exposed to still more fast neutrons by recycling them back into
the fusion reactor. Most of atoms will eventually transform to stable
isotopes under additional exposure to fast neutrons. The tiny percentage
that do not can be separated (again by nanotech) and deactivated in a
tiny
particle accellerator. These processes are on balence highly exothermic,
so
the entire process of deactivation should yield a substantial net gain
in useable thermal energy. All of this hold true even if your reactor
must use D-D or D-T, both of which produce a lot of primary fast
neutrons
and therefore a relatively large amount of isotopic transformation.
Remember
that nanotech is likely to permit the use of diamondiod structural
components
instead of steel, so the reactor will be activating carbon instead of
iron:
that is, most of the resulting isotopes will be fairly benign. Now, if
nanotech
permits us to use the H-H reaction instead of D-D, we won't have much
of a problem to solve, because there are no fast neutrons generated in
the primary reaction.

Here is my tentative philosophy of personal identity: anyone who remembers
being me is me. By "remebers being me" I mean he/she/it has a memory of my
current thoughts and perceptions from my current perspective.

Some examples: I am the person typing at this keyboard a second ago, but
he is not me. If I become unconscious and wake up with total amnesia, the
person who wakes up is not me. If he recovers his (my) memory, then he is
me again. A copy of me is me, an upload of me is me, even a simulacrum of
me made from scratch by a Power is me, as long as it has sufficiently
authentic memories of being me. 

With this definition, there is no conflict between growth and identity.
Any transformation, as long as it does not erase my memories, perserves my
identity. To me this philosophy is simply and intuitive, and seems to be
free from inconsistencies and paradoxes. What do you think?

Looks even better now, at 7:12pm pst: 60% yes, 37% no, and 2% only in
instances of infertility, based on 20209 votes.

Cool.

To me, the most interesting consequence of the possibility that the universe
was constructed by some being (let's call him Frank) is the new spin it puts
on age-old spiritual questions: WHY did Frank create us? Did Frank make us
mortal or immortal? Can Frank make a rock so heavy even he can't lift it?

At least with Jehovah, you knew what to expect. He'd send all us sinners to
hell, and the saints would live blissfully ever after. But what's the deal
with Frank? Is he just running us, like a game (or a screensaver), during
the few cosmological minutes he must pass while waiting for the bus? If so,
is he going to shut us off when the bus arrives? Are there other reasons why
he might need to shut us off? What would it mean? Has he backed up his disk?
Do we need to fear death or not?

If you ask me, Frank can't be trusted. (As the saying goes, "Absolute power
corrupts Frank.") It's in our interest to break out of this damn simulation,
and get ourselves more durable bodies in the "real" universe. How do we do
that?  I can't give all the details yet, of course, but I'm pretty sure we
need to start with getting a whole lot smarter and more powerful (presumably
so we can figure out how to access and manipulate the controls of the
simulation).

So you see, to me, the possibility of god doesn't induce passivity at all.
Quite the opposite, it adds a whole 'nother motivation for rapid
self-transformation. If we don't evolve, we'll never be able to usurp god.

Let's have a tally of the benefits of human cloning.  We should think
hard about this since we want to persuade others not to ban it.  I
think human cloning will, in the short run, prove beneficial to life
extension.

Anyway, I've not heard anyone on the news, despite the high profile of
the Richard Seed story, touting the benefits side.  The best was the
local NPR station's Leonard Lope (?).  He has a show in the NYC area
in that time slot.  He weighed in against getting hysterical over the issue.
This is better than the rest, who all seemed to have great contempt for
the idea.

Anyone know the validity of the story that drinking seawater makes you crazy?
Do people survive on a raft by drinking seawater, or do they have to catch
rainwater?  Maybe not drinking enough (sea)water makes them crazy?

   Of course, "God"(omnipotent,omnipresent) is philosophically impossible.
Any use of language to try to "explain" this myth will wind up in an orgy

Hi,
I am new to the list.  Been reading all posts for a weeks or so...
Found this article on AOL today.
.c The Associated Press

CHICAGO (AP) - An independent scientist said today he plans to begin
work on cloning a human being despite widespread opposition to using
newly developed techniques on people.

Richard Seed said he is still in the planning stages, but hopes to get
started in a few months.

Seed's plans were criticized by the White House as being reckless.

``The scientific community ought to make it clear to Dr. Seed - and I
think the president will make it clear to Dr. Seed - that he has elected
to become irresponsible, unethical and unprofessional should he pursue
the course that he outlined today,'' President Clinton's spokesman Mike
McCurry said.

Seed acknowledged he is unsure if he can accomplish his goal, and
genetics researchers questioned whether human cloning is yet
technologically possible.

He said his project would cost about $2 million but take far less to get
started.

Seed, who says he has a doctorate in physics from Harvard but is not
affiliated with any institution, told reporters outside his suburban
Riverside home that wants to use cloning to help infertile couples, and
that he has four couples willing to participate.

Seed said he planned to use the same techniques that Scottish scientists
used in 1996 to clone the adult sheep Dolly, the first cloned mammal.

DNA would be removed from a woman's egg and replaced with DNA from the
person to be cloned. Once the fertilized egg grows to 50 to 100 cells,
the embryo would be transferred to a woman.

Seed said earlier he hoped that within 1 1/2 years he would produce a
pregnancy capable of lasting at least two months.

A national panel recommended last year after Dolly's cloning that
Congress ban human cloning, saying it poses unacceptable risks of
mutations and raises troubling ethical questions.

Several measures to ban cloning await congressional action.

Seed today called himself a good Methodist who believes humans were
created in God's image and said God intends them to become like him.
This, he said, includes learning to live forever.

``God made man in his own image. Therefore He intended that man should
become one with God. Man should have an indefinite life and have
indefinite knowledge. And we're going to do it, and this is one step,''
Seed said.

When a reporter told Seed some people would say he is ``nuts,'' he
replied: ``That word has been used before. I prefer eccentric or
brilliant or near genius.''

A genetics researcher said today he thinks it is unlikely - but not
impossible - that Seed can accomplish the task within his time frame.

``We're still in a relative state of ignorance'' about how to make this
work, said Dr. Robert H. Foote, a reproductive physiologist at Cornell
University. ``We don't know it can even be done in humans.''

Foote pointed out that researchers worked with 277 sheep before
successfully cloning Dolly.

``Maybe Seed will get enough money'' for the human-cloning experiment,
Foote said, ``but all of my scientific friends are against this type of
thing, not so much because it's technically impossible, but because they
don't see any need to do this kind of thing.''

Dr. Yury Verlinsky, director of the reproductive genetics institute at
Illinois Masonic Medical Center in Chicago, called Seed's comments ``an
irresponsible'' attempt to make news.

Verlinsky said that while human cloning is theoretically possible, he
doesn't think it can be done now because of ethical, technological and
financial limits.

Seed said he would like to locate his clinic in the Chicago area but is
also considering opening it in another country.

Oh, "we people" are doing fine without you. Why don't you toss your Zon

OK, here's the dope:

Straight seawater is too salty. Drink too much and the following things
happen:

Your body tries to piss more, because of the salt content--Seawater first
acts as a diuretic.

So you drink more, which drives your blood pressure up as your kidneys try
frantically to get rid of the salt.

At the same time, you are knocking off your intestinal flora. You get
diarrhea==even more fluid loss.

Eventually dehydration, renal-hepatic crisis and elevated BP (plus
heatstroke in the tropics) drives you crazy, shortly before you die.

People who run out of drinking water should have had a ROGA desalinization
pump onboard. Unfortunately, the cheapest one I've found sells for $500 at
West Marine, so it's not within the budget of a boat-person or refugee.

That could be applied to all social interaction.  If you attack me, you do so
under the threat that I may defend myself; even if you only insult me, you do so
under the threat that I may react violently.  Government is no worse inherently
than people.  I don't disagree with your view of government, but it is a very
cynical view, and loses validity if you don't apply as rigorous a cynicism to
your own dealings with others.

Excuse me.  Campaign finance reform in many countries outside the US has
resulted in a broader field of candidates and increased voter participation.  It
is done by the state financing or mandating free party political broadcasts and
advertising, and by severely restricting both donations and the uses to which
donations can be put.

(But these are only small points in your discussion, Anton.)

There is a limit to the concentration of salt in drinking water that the body
can handle. At the levels in sea water, if you drink enough of it to satisfy
your need for water, the salt will be more than you can handle (I'm not 
certain what the various symptoms are, but delirium wouldn't be too surprising
from the effects on membrane ion potentials). Too much salt will definitely 
induce nausea, which is not a good thing when you are thirsting.
Sea water is only somewhat more salty than the body can handle, so in a 
survival situation, you can double your available water by diluting sea water 
50-50 with pure drinking water.
I would guess that it wouldn't give you quite the good of an actual doubling
of the amount of pure water, as the body has to fight to deal with the extra 
salt, even if it's within the tolerance level.

Abraham Moses Genen wrote that we need an educational system "focused on
an understanding that society functions best when placed ahead of the
self."

Actually, we need an educational system that teaches, among the other
things he listed, that the self benefits greatly by helping other people.
 Helping society IS helping oneself.  Helping other people is in one's
own self-interest.  There really isn't much difference between
intelligent selfishness and intelligent selflessness, as far as the
results go.  Society is a symbiosis of humans; we all benefit from our
intelligent cooperation with each other.  It's when people isolate
themselves from others and refuse to help others that they are left to
fend for themselves.  It's when people are only willing to participate in
"official" transactions of service that they miss out on many benificial
exchanges.  Working towards the "common good" is working towards one's
own good as well.  There isn't really a division between individuals and
society; a distinction, yes, but we're all in the same system.  There
isn't really a division between individuals, either; in the center there
is a distinct individual, but at the "edges", it all blurs together
because so much of what we incorporate into the systems that we are have
come from the systems that others are.

A good educational system will teach humans how the world works and how
to accomplish their goals within their world.  Learning how the world
works involves observation and other forms of knowledge construction,
such as critical thinking and reading or experiencing audio/visual
materials.  Learning how to accomplish one's own goals involves the
development of sufficient problem solving skills, which requires practice
at solving a wide variety of type and complexity of problems.

Someone who has developed within a good educational system should be
strongly aware of their symbiotic relationship with other humans and with
other organisms.  To accomplish their own goals, they will recognize the
practicality of helping others accomplish their goals as well.  

Developing a good edcuational system is one of the most extropian goals I
can think of.

If all the information (including memories) in your brain and body could be
read off into a computer (uploaded), would that computer memory be you?  What
if the original brain and body were destroyed in the uploading?  What if they
were left intact?

What if the uploaded memories were fed into a fresh body?  What if identical
copies were fed into several fresh bodies?  What if the original brain and
body were not still around?  What if they were?  Would you be the original (if
it existed), the program, or one or more of the copies?

The program would not change, but the original (if it existed) and the copies
would diverge away from it and from each other.  Which would be you?

Brent Allsop has obviously not delved very deeply into the Mormon
religion, or he would realize that its most basic doctrines are as
Extropian as you can get.  I was raised LDS, but have great difficulty
believing many of the religion's claims without sufficient evidence. 
However, being a natural extropian, I was most affected by the extropian
aspects of the religion.

One of the most basic doctrines of the Mormon religion is that the one we
call "God" was once a being like ourselves who, through billions of years
of widely varied learning experiences and through the guidance and
training of those more advanced, learned the skills and developed the
intelligence and knowledge necessary to create living universes and
create intelligent beings who had the capability to mature into gods
themselves.  "God" is not omnipotent or omnicient or omnipresent in any
absolute sense, but definitely is, relative to us.  God is still learning
and improving himself, and always will.

In the Mormon religion, humans are God's offspring, created with the
potential to mature into beings with the capacity to create living
universes and countless intelligent offspring.  The whole point of our
existence is to learn, forever; to keep advancing and maturing and
becoming more intelligent and powerful.  This experience on Earth is only
one of countless learning experiences we've had.  And we will continue
having more advanced learning experiences, forever.

There are other aspects to the Mormon religion, such as temple
ceremonies, the crucifixion and ressurection of Jesus Christ, but these
are all incedental in the grand scheme of things.  The central doctrine
of Mormonism is Eternal Progress.  Unfortunately, most of the members
don't realize that and don't focus on that.  The Church leaders are
always imploring the members to improve themselves in all ways, and they
often have meetings which focus on various aspests of oneself that can be
improved.  They stress education and learning throughout one's life.

Unfortunately, most members of the Mormon Church are sheep and have a
difficult time thinking for themselves, although their scriptures say it
is wrong not to think for oneself.  They are often very judgemental of
others and very hypocritical. They are also very conservative and don't
like change much, even though their religion promotes the incredible
change of developing into a god.

The central core of Mormonism and Extropianism is the same -- Progress is
the highest priority. Joseph Smith (the founder of Mormonism) wrote, "The
glory of God is intelligence."  Sounds pretty extropian to me.

I doubt that efficient tiny reactors can be built. There are two
possibilities, one being cold fusion (which seems to be doubtful at the
moment) and the other is based on sonoluminescence (SL). SL is still a
macroscopic process but I could imagine a SL reactor in the kilogram
size range.

OTOH, using nanotech for waste disposal, including body waste, for full
oxidation would provide quite a bit of energy and keep the campsite
clean too. The tent could be made of a kind of diamondoid foam with
vacuum within the foam (like a super aerogel) giving the tent a
reasonable R value (15 or so) so staying warm in the tent would be easy.
The nano could also collect the evaporated water (and its heat of
condensation stays in the tent). Going nuclear seems a bit excessive for
this app which has many non nuke solutions.

Well, at least the early verions of nano will only be able to
distinguish elements, not isotopes. Also, any nano working with
radioactive elements is subject to considerable damage. As for neutrons,
well, they are oblivious to nanotech, and will happily wander through
all kinds of matter. I surely wouldn't want a neutron emitting fusion
reactor in my tent!

Even nano accelerators will not be very efficient.

This is not valid.  You posit that if I attack you, I do so under the
"threat" that you will defend yourself.  If I decided that you defending
yourself was a significant threat to my attack, then the proper term would
be "deterrent" (assuming basically rational players).  A deterrent is
simply a "defensive threat" that is of significance to the attacker.
Obviously when applied to government, individuals do not possess a
deterrent capability since, at best, they represent a non-significant
defensive threat to the government.  

When the government is involved, individuals may represent a "threat", but
never a "deterrent".  In a social interaction, there is *always* someone
who can kick the aggressor's ass.

Seawater is about 3% salt, and the kidneys have a limit of about 1% salt
excreted into the urine. Drinking seawater results in dehydration, and
if you are already dehydrated, the result is kidney failure and the
accumulated waste in the blood causes a lot of problems, including
delirium.

We may become gods in a few decades, but we won't become Gods at least
until the end of the universe. The moral responsibilities of a God with
unlimited resources must be qualitatively different from those of a god
who is merely unimaginably powerful.

A God with unlimited resources has a responsbility to create a globally
optimal universe for his creatures. It is conceivable that our universe is
actually the best of all possible worlds, but it doesn't seem likely.
If we can figure out how far away from optimum this universe is, it may
allow us to get an estimate of the computational power of the god that
created it.

That's with *today*'s tech. Reasonable extrapolation leads to the
conclusion that you won't be able to keep 'em down on the collective farm
after they've seen _Baywatch_. SO expect a crackdown in certain places on
mere possession of personal desalination gear as prima facie evidence of

Unless Tipler is right and that the reason for the non-optimality (the
extropian word for evil?) is that it is logically necessary: this
universe is needed together with all the other universes in superspace
(he uses the MWI) to satisfy the Omega Point boundary condition he
postulates. So there might be better or worse universes, but
Omega/God/Frank couldn't just create the nice ones, it had to create
all the others to retain mathematical consistency.

But I find the idea of evaluating God by checking the optimality of
the physical laws intriguing. The problem is of course: optimal for what?

I miss your point about what the new spin is. These are all the old
questions.

Shouldn't that be "Absolute power corrupts Frankly"?

This is also an age-old idea.  The Church has been battling against this
enemy (being, meme, whatever) for a long time.

hey folks,

a little bit ago, some of my messages to the list and elsewhere went

those messages attached. I'll paste the header info below, if anyone can
tell me if possibly my email is being tapped, or for some other

I support human cloning, but these quotes by Seed bother me:

eyehi quoting AOL article quoting The Associated Press quoting Seed:
> Seed acknowledged he is unsure if he can accomplish his goal, and
> genetics researchers questioned whether human cloning is yet
> technologically possible.
[....]

Seed is not sure this will work.  Seed's area of expertise is not
medicine or biology.  He has not previously been involved in any cloning
research.  And what does that last statement mean?  Does it mean that
his clones can't even last through a complete pregnancy to a live birth?
That doesn't sound like a very viable clone to me.

Worse still, what if all your identity data were printed out in a book?

I respectfully disagree with both of you.  No matter how much I may
agree with your views, they are political.  You are trying to instill
religious (even if Extropian) *values*.  Education should teach
knowledge and skills that can be used by the individual.  Training an
individual how they should behave in society is not education.  It is
programming and brainwashing.

This is the old semantic problem that always comes up in this argument. 
They are all "me", but not *this* me.  If another me survives, do I care
that the current me dies?

Talk about your semantic implications!  You have to assume that the
government should control cloning.  Then you vote as to whether they
should choose to allow us to clone, or choose to disallow us to clone.
There is no choice for "it's not their decision."

This is the exact conflict between the german and the anglosaxican(?)
pedagogical ways of thinking.

It's the difference between the North european / Scandinavian and the
English / US American way of thinking. So you stating that, is in itself
a political statement. :-)

Europe tends to support the idea that the educational system should take
part in bringing up educated/cultured individuals based on understanding
and discussion. The anglosaxican POW is that the educational system
should  create knowledgeable individuals based on factual information.

It can be argued which POW produces the best results. The Japanese for
instance seems to have an extreme anglosaxican POW and this seems to
cause them trouble in the area of creativity.

In a future with multiple versions of the same personality we will
probably have to think differently. If a person x splits into two
personalities x1 & x2, xn might not care that the other one dies but x
knows that after a split he will have a greater chance of surviving.

If it furthermore was possible to merge the different personalities into
one after some time. Then their combined memories would become x1+2 wich
could then be split again. into new copies. the chances for survival of
a single personality would thus become greater.

Imagine if a million personalities are roaming the universe, sharing
their memories this way. Would the loss of a single personality mean
much then? What if it was the old meat persona that got lost, would that
be a big loss to "me"?

I know *I* would care...The other "me's" would be more like twin brothers than 
a real part of me. The very fact that they can be identified as separate beings,
proves that they can't be you. Whether they're exactly similar or not is pretty
irrelevant. If *you* die, *you're* dead, no matter how many exact copies are
out there. The surviving copies are merely a kind of "living memorial", about as 
useful to you as a perpetual personal website, or a nice tombstone, for you're
no longer aware of anything.

'Mr. Fusion' as in 'Back to the Future'? Not with hot fusion (while the
cold one being still mythical). Reactor volume way too small (even JET is
too small).  Perfect diamondoids (which are as susceptible to rad ageing
as everything else) are no Unobtainium.

Yes. But massive energy release and waste isotope release are combined in
a catastrophic failure. To prevent catastrophic failure you must operate a
a sensor-permeated system way out the critical regime, scrapping, and
rebuilding it when it grows brittle enough.  Continous autorepair is
impossible due to high fluxes (thermal, rad) in a small volume. At these
hellish conditions your nanoagents will drop as flies, faster than you
could remake them. (As a side note, design of radresistant nanosystems is
an absolute prerequisite for the really fast interstellar probes, both
because of the relativistic interstellar medium rad load and due to the
nuclear propulsion and/or energy source emissions.  (Then there is laser
propulsion, and Forrester's nanoprobe catapults)). 

As I already said, you can quantitatively reclaim nuclear ashes. Question
is, can you safely exclude catastrophic failure of the reactor device? Not
convinced.

The smaller the reactor, the more critical the operation regime. The
enrichened uranium high-flux research reactor currently being erected in
Munich, Garching has a core the size of a wastebasket. Its energy density,
and large surface of the cooling vents at a record neutron flux do not
seem to make for a passively safe system.

This is a feature I also do not like about planned fusion tritium
breeders. Though power density of a hypothetical production tokamak will
be relatively low, the wall radiation load will be quite demanding. We
have already miles and miles of tritium-contaminated liquid lithium pipes,
now we must also intertwine them with hot waste ducts. I do not see how
this will limit the total waste curie output.

Not by nanotech. It just makes conventional isotope separation cheaper,
and increases the yield. It is difficult to see how dirt cheap but precise
macroscopic structures could make such a big difference.

Why tiny? I do not see how nanotech can decrease the accelerator size
significantly. Novel acceleration principles do not rely on nanotech for

I don't see how a chemical-energy-level technology could significantly

enhanced supervision and waste recycling yield.

The "Axolotl Tanks" of the Theilaxu in Frank Herberts "Dune"
series. Actually this whole cloning debate resembles the book
series. The Theilaxu (masters of genetic engineering) were always
refered to as "The dirty Theilaxu" by everyone else, even as they
used their products and services.

The Theilaxu refered to their genetic knowledge as "The Language of
God."

At least they were lucky enough to have their own planet,
geographical distance seems essential.....

All this discussion of "Frank" ("Let's kill Frank and
take his stuff", etc.") reminds me of a poem which I
read once, in a Lucius Shepard novel, I believe:

I wish I had an army of a thousand guys like me.
We'd storm the gates of heaven and seize the Trinity.
We'd throw the angels off a cliff to see if they
could fly,
And find God was just an old gray man who can't
remember why.

Irreverant, but funny.

Education *always* instills values, *always* is a kind of indoctrination. 
There is no such thing as "knowledge and skills" without valuation
attached.  Determining which among the indefinitely many skills and
knowledges on offer will be the ones taught, let alone determining what
will *count* as "useful" in the first place will inevitably be practices
that resonate with beliefs about what society should look like and how
people should behave in it.  Given this, the values that I would emphasise
in an properly extropian pedagogy would be responsibility, criticism, and
respect for diversity.  Best, Dale

Did ya hear the immortal words of the impressive Doctor Seed?
He's the one proposing to start a cloning clinic (because he can
thereby help more people have the children they want) and make a
ton of money (he hopes.)  NPR played a sound bite in which he
justified his plans by using biblical sounding languague to say
something on the order of

    God made us in his image.  We're becoming more like him all
    the time.  This [developing the ability to clone] is one of
    the important steps we need to take in becoming more like
    God.  God intended for us to be like him, and for us to
    become more like him.

What wonderful rhetoric!  Can anyone find the exact words that
Dr. Seed (no, I'm not making up the name!) used?  I encourage
extropians to find ways to use rhetoric like that when
appropriate (when talking to the religious or the deluded.)  We're
just doing what God wants; God made us in his image; we're trying
to become more like him in as many ways as possible.

Yes it is, and it's quite an acute problem if, as you say earlier on,
"non-optimality" might be what extropians mean by the term "evil."

Well, it is a bit trickier than that.  True, government compels assent by
means of a monopoly on the "legitimate" use of force, *however* it is far
better pleased to cultivate assent through the proper working of
institutions that cacoon the coercive state -- schools, churches, unions,
media, professional organizations, etc.  It's not always the easiest thing
in the world to determine where the coercion ends and the cultivation
begins.

I agree with these sentiments, but think this is a helluva complicated
matter.  If you break the State monopoly through Friedmanesque competition
among services you retain a governmental archipelago of institutions that
will still either be in the business of compelling and cultivating assent
or they won't be in business for long.  A better sewer, but a sewer still.
It might not get much better than this.  Best, Dale

	This sounds exactly like me!  If It's not to prying, I'd like
to know who you are?  Where you live?  Are you "active"?...  I wish
there were more LDS extropians. I'm happy to know you.  We should
probably take this off line since all extropians aren't necessarily
interested in LDS stuff the way you and I probably are.

	It bothers me to hear you say this because, having been an
active, seriously investigating, LDS member my entire life (so far at
least).  You must have an absurdly stringent definition of what you
mean by having "delved very deeply".  I think it is simply more that
Mormonism is a lot of different things to a lot of different people.
For example, you said that according to Mormonism:

> The whole point of our existence is to learn, forever; to keep
> advancing and maturing and becoming more intelligent and powerful.
> This experience on Earth is only one of countless learning
> experiences we've had.  And we will continue having more advanced
> learning experiences, forever.

	But Bruce R. McConkie's response to such would be:

] 	Heresy one: There are those who say that God is progressing in
] knowledge and is learning new truths.
] 	This is false--utterly, totally, and completely.  There is not
] one sliver of truth in it.  It grows out of a wholly twisted and
] incorrect view of the King Follet Sermon and of what is meant by
] eternal progression....

	Which is a quote from his (in?)famous 1980 "Seven Deadly
Heresies" talk at BYU.  Now, I know everything BRM says isn't
necessarily true LDS doctrine, but he was one of the 12 and there are
many LDS that think very much like him right?

> The central core of Mormonism and Extropianism is the same --

	Yes exactly!  I, too, get very excited about all the extropian
concepts in Mormonism.  I also think it is possible to, if interpreted
very very losely and liberally, to believe that Mormonism can be taken
as the same as extropianism.  Just like BRM has a different view of
Mormonism than others, I always ask if we can interpret Mormonism to
be Extropianism.

> The central core of Mormonism and Extropianism is the same --
> Progress is the highest priority.

	To me it's a bit different.  I would say, "achieving the best
possible" is the central core.  The growth curve could turn out to be
asymptotic, meaning we do indeed become omni-everything, before some
given time; which would render more growth after crossing this
asymptote in time meaningless.  I don't know if such would be better
than "eternal progress", but I like to leave open such possibilities
when expressing my "core" beliefs.  In fact, I like Tipplers idea of
the "Omega Point" were we finally reach this omni-everything asymptote
within some finite "real time", yet we are progressing eternally
according to an accelerating "experiential time".  You get to have
your cake and eat it too in that plan! ;)

	One of the main problems I have with fundamental LDS beliefs,
and other fundamentalist beliefs, is the way they seek to justify and
accept evil wrather than hopping, and more importantly striving as if,
it can be overcome.  Many LDS think that universal salvation is
hopeless and they believe things like souls must experience death in
order to become God and so on.  From this most LDS are anti cryonic
and anti search for a cure for aging and so on.  It is simply such
beliefs as these that I am working against. And many LDS seem to, as
you say, focus on these kinds of things, wrather than the more
extropian beliefs.  So much so that it seems impossible to me to
really unite Extropianism with Mormonism in any kind of productive
way.

	Anyway, thanks for your reply, and I'm glad to know that I'm
not the only Extropian LDS.

I see a couple of problems.  The first is a trivial matter of language.
It is very confusing to write that A is B but B is not A.  Normally we
use the term "is" in a symmetrical way.  It's not even clear which
way to interpret a question like "are you the same person you were a
second ago?".  So you might want to use a different phrasing.

The larger problem is that this seems to over-emphasize the importance of
memory.  Our memories are important, but it seems to me that identity
requires more than just remembering.  If my mind were invaded tomorrow and
rearranged so that my motivations, beliefs, and desires were completely
different, then I would view the result as a different person even if it
kept all my memories.

I also wonder about the gray areas.  I don't remember most days of my
life, so probably on most days I can expect that in the future I won't
remember those days.  This would seem to imply that after a few years
I will no longer exist.  Supposing I am offered the opportunity for an
immortal lifespan, should I refuse it since I won't remember the present
day after some years?  That doesn't seem right.

Maybe you should extend it so that you write A < B to indicate that B
"is" A (e.g. remembers being A), and add as an axiom that A < B and B < C
implies A < C.  This way I stay alive as long as each day I remember the
day before, even if after a while I have completely forgotten today.

Justice is not revenge.  So let me rephrase my original statement -
"Maybe justice isn't the best solution, maybe there's something
better."  Now, the problem with our perception of justice is that we
see it as the enforcement of good.  So just to make life more complex,
I'm disputing the idea of what is good and what is evil (and what is
anything inbetween.)  I would especially dispute the idea of a
"greater good" and although some things may be good for society (which
I understand to mean "all of us") justice is a purely subjective
concept based on individual preferences.  But we seem to treat it as
something greater, our current justice system is there to enforce the
law of the state, when it is and should be, an individuals choice as
to what he/she considers right or wrong.

And in a similar tone  Entropy is getting old.

Or for a more aggressive (but truthful) approach  Join us or die!

Or how about  Immortality  live with it!

Or the corny Extropy  it just keeps getting better.

And finally  Extropians do it exponentially.

I would say that encouraging, and even enforcing respect for contracts
and the concept of mutual consent to be a greater good for both society
AND the individual. I define people who violate either concept to have
done a 'bad' thing, that requires redress.

It's my understanding that you can drink some sea water in an emergency 
situation provided it is diluted with some fresh water. However, I don't 
know what the ratio of seawater to freshwater has to be to avoid death 
or serious illness. Does anyone know the answer to this one?

To say these Internet polls are unscientific is an understatement. 
Anyone who has any understanding of Statistics can tell you that. Also, 
the results can be idiotic beyond belief. In one poll I saw, the movie 
"The Shawshank Redemption" was voted the best movie of all time!

I agree that it's a bad thing to violate a person or a contract (uh, duh),
but even someone who doesn't agree with that would surely have to agree
that to undertake such a violation is to do *something*, and that this
something can be recognized as such.  If civil society is the sum of
ongoing voluntaristic associations (for simplicity's sake, I'll let it go
at that), then to violate a person or a contract is to "communicate" one's
separation from that civil society.  Civil society properly responds to
this "communication" by listening to it -- either literally separating the
criminal from the society she or he has separated from by means of the
violation (exile, imprisonment), or specifying the terms under which the
criminal can return (restitution, rehabilitation).  I'll add that since a
*robust* civil society would recognize the extent to which it thrives on
diversity -- even such diversity as is represented by those who in moments
of weakness or confusion or whatever temporarily fail to live up to its
stipulations -- the terms for re-entry into civil society should be pretty
generous.  I don't see why revenge should enter into these transactions at
all particularly.  Best, Dale

Richard L. Rossi asks,

"To any extropian: What would be the legal argument for making the
cloning of humans illegal in the United States?"

I don't believe there can be any legal argument against cloning humans
that is based on current U.S. law.  Many, many women clone their children
every year when they produce identical twins.  This is not illegal as far
as I know.  Nor do these clones have any adverse effect on other people
because they share the same sequence of DNA base pairs.

When people oppose human cloning, they are not thinking rationally; it is
an emotional response.  If you have no objection to a single person
having the particular DNA they have, then why should you oppose another
person having the same DNA, or twenty people?  It's just none of anyone
else's business whether two or more humans have the same genes.

programming and brainwashing."


Teaching children that cooperating with others can help all cooperating
parties is not brainwashing.  It is practical education.  Such examples
of this cooperation would include working in a business with other people
and dividing chores in one's residence.  This view is not political, any
more than a scientific fact is political; it's just the way the world is.
 You will almost certainly be more successful in achieving your own goals
if you cooperate with others than if you refuse to cooperate.  Teaching
children that cooperation is usually beneficial is not teaching them how
to behave in society; it is simply presenting them with the options they
have and the likely consequences of choosing those options.  This is
practical knowledge, which education should teach.  Being able to
interact well with other humans requires many practical social skills,
which education should also teach; those without these skills are
severely handicapped, compared to those with good social skills.  Social
skills are a crucial part of any good education.  Teaching them is not
brainwashing; it is good, solid education in the world of action and
consequence.  Society is a major part of the real world; children need to
be taught good skills for using this network of humans to accomplish
their own goals.

Your aphoristic trailer raises an interesting question.  

I agee completely,  "continual improvement is the highest good."

Question:  Is replication of sameness a higher good?  If so,  Who decides that
this or that particular version is a better good than any other?

Just Curious

Jake Hart was wondering about my signature line, "continual improvement
is the highest good."

The reason I consider continual improvement to be the highest good is
that if a system improves itself continuously, it will keep getting
better and better and better (I consider this higher and higher forms of
good).  I believe the process of continual improvement to be the most
valuable process possible.  Without the process of improvement, a system
is stuck and limited.  I consider an open-ended and unlimited system to
be more valuable than a closed, limited one.  But that is only my
subjective value system.  Others may prefer a cozy, limited system.

My affirmation of, "continual improvement is the highest good" is a
statement of one of my most cherished beliefs.  For me, progress is the
highest priority.

Any more questions?

The `Axolotl Tanks', as we learn in the final volume of the sequence

I don't think using "is" in an asymmetric way is necessarily confusing. We
handle sentences like "a penguin is a bird, but a bird is not necessarily
a penguin" without too much trouble. The reason I use "is" is that we
often hear questions like "is an upload of me really me?" from people who
have no clear idea of what "is" means in that context. I am suggesting
such a meaning.

What if you read a book that is so persuasive that you change all of your
motivations, beliefs, and desires? Would you say the person who finishes
reading the book is no longer you? Is it really possible to completely
change someone's motivations, beliefs, and desires without touching his
memory?

I haven't decided whether this more liberal notion of identity is more
attractive. But as a practical matter, if you're offered immortality
today, you'd probably remember the day longer if you accepted than if you
refused.

I would say yes. If you answer differently, try this question instead: is
a cryogenically frozen head of yours you? What if the only way to revive
it is to completely take it apart molecule by molecule and put it back
together again? I see no essential difference between this situation and
the book.

So essentially, these 'stumps' are less than a clone, but more than just
a grown organ. Kind of a human worm, in that all it can do is eat,
excrete, and reproduce (how is that different from now???). Put a mouth
on top, strapped into a permanent outhouse, sterile but capable of
supporting a pregnancy. Also, engineer some sort of cloaca in the belly
for birthing the child without that passage through tight hips, or
engineer the hips to be much bigger.

nanotech is not magic. As 'gene says, it may not even be feasible. My
guessitmate is that is feasible. The requirement for fusion is that
atoms must slam into each other fast enough. The requirement for
useful fusion is "engineering breakeven": The process must emit
more useful energy with no external input. In the particular
application we're discussing, the useful energy is low-intensity
heat, which is the easiest goal to reach.

It's not proven that SL is blackbody rediation and therefore
indicative of near-fusion conditions, and the phenomenon is
not well enough understood to find a useful set of conditions
whereby you can extract useful energy: currently, SL is observed
only at temperatured near the freezing point of water. Don't count
on SL for micro-fusion. 

I envision an D-D fusion reactor based on a form of inertial-confinement
fusion, using a truly tiny holraum and starting in an environment with
very high static pressure. The environment is the center of a set of
diamondoid spheres, each of which contributes a megapascal or so of
pressure differential. The D-D reaction emits no primary neutrons.
The innermost sphere brings the interior static pressure up to the
highest level that remains consistent with diamondiod nanotech and
diamondoid compressive and tensile strength. The nanotech machinery
contained within the inner shell then delivers a transient implosive
pulse to the holraum (mechanically, or with lasers, or with explosives)
to cause fusion. This geherates a lot of heat, raising the temperature
of th interior. The reactor uses the thermal gradient from inside to
outside to capture the energy neeeded to drive the next pulse.

Agreed. Given nano, you can get very efficient in every way. In
particular,
forget the tent. Just reconfigure your body's resident clothing nanos to
provide
an insulating skin of the type you describe.

This is valid, but only to a point. If you had resident body and
clothing
nanos, and you had a "mister fusion", then you would be totally
self-contained.
your nanos could recycle your body's wastes, including your exhaled air,
to
generate food, water and air. Your only requirement would be a place to
dispose of excess heat.

Some elements capture neutrons very efficiently, but I want to
start with a reaction that doesn't emit neutrons at all. If we can do
that
the neutron flux will be very small, due only to incidental fusion when
fast
particles bash into the container walls.  I'm not sure, but I
think you can pick structural elements so that the wastes that need to
be separated
are different elements: You don't have to recognize the isotope of
nitrogen,
you just have to remember that no nitrogen should be here.

That's not a percentage of neutrons, that's a percentage of waste atoms.
you catch the atoms by recognizing that they are atoms of elements
(heavy metals) that don't belong here.

It doesn't have to be efficient. It doesn't even have to
break even. It just has to be able to bust up these ugly big
radioactive isotopes that are not amenable to destruction by other
means.
The problem is that for esthetic and political reasons we want this
tiny accelerator to be contained within the "mister fusion" housing.
What I'm banking on here is a major deux ex machina, even worse than
the inertial confinement system above: There are ways to use lasers
to pump energy into a particle beam with extreme efficiency, yielding
a very high change in Mev per meter of acelerator. I further assume that
an accelerator built via nanotech to atomic precision can achieve the
nearly the theoretical efficiency limit. This should permit each nasty
heavy radioneucleotide atom to be bashed with extreme precision into
little pieces that are more tractable, all (I hope) in an accelerator
that's less than a meter long.

That a fission system. While I feel that traditional fission systems are
safer for the environment than any current alternative, I'm not willing
to argue the point. It's irrelevant to "mister fusion."

I concur. So do most nuclear engineers, but they don't talk about it
much. the public still believes fusion is clean, and the engineers
know that fusion (and fission) are a whole lot cleaner than fossil
fuels, so the engineers try to avoid tainting fusion with the
irrationality
associated with radioactivity.

But "cheaper" and "yield" are the two main points. "Cheaper" makes a
concept econimically feasible. "high yield" means you can eliminate

No, but nanotech should permit extreme precision. This generally permits
extreme efficiency, which may permit significant size reduction.

"ANMO40" seems to lead the FAA's Northwest Mountain Region web sites.
There is a Civil Aviation Security Division associated with this region.
FAA investigators may be monitoring this list because of all those
flight 800 posts back in November.

You're right, damage and radioactive isotopes caused by neutrons is a serious
problem for a fusion reactor, that's why the reaction I like best is between 
non radioactive deuterium (Hydrogen 2) and non radioactive Helium 3, this 
produces non radioactive Helium 4, an easily controlled proton, 18.3 mev of 
energy, and most important of all, no neutron. Unfortunately you need a 
higher temperature to achieve it than the deuterium tritium reaction most are 
talking about.

Novel acceleration principles would be a nice thing to have and I'm sure we'll
find them, but just engineering things better would work wonders. Make a
series of thin aligned rings of copper or some other conductor and put them a
nanometer from each other. The first ring has a modest positive charge of
5 volts on it to pull an electron toward it. When the electron reaches the
center drop the charge on the ring to zero, as soon as the electron passes
put a negative charge of 5 volts on the ring to push the particle on to the
next ring. After one meter the electron would have 10 billion electron volts
on energy.

We know it would be tricky to get the timing right, to make sure the voltage
on the rings rise and fell exactly when they should, but we also know it's
possible to do so because the original Stanford linear accelerator operates on
exactly this principle, it's just bigger, 2 miles long. The nanotech version
with the arbitrary values given in my example would only need to be about
12 feet long to equal the energy.

    This is the nineteenth update of my fly experiments. There was a delay
 in starting the 7'th run, since my breeding stock unexpectedly almost
 died out. I restarted some more breeding bottles and the flies seem to be
 doing well now.
    Onion 4X did a good job of "squaring the survival curve" in run #6. No
 onion 4X flies outlived the longest lived control flies, so no antiaging
 effect could be detected. I suspect that high doses of onion powder may
 be acting as a non-toxic bactericide, something I have been searching for
 a long time. This stimulated me to test combinations of onion 4X and some
 other supplements in the 7'th run.
    The trouble with my experiments up till now, is that early mortality
 is so high, that no antiaging supplement can be expected to significantly
 increase life span, unless it also acts against early mortality as well.
 Since I am assuming that early deaths are due partly to pathogens, then
 antiaging supplements, which do not also act as a bactericides, may not
 increase life span significantly. It is this dual action (bactericidal &
 antiaging) that may account for the good results with paprika, sage and
 sumac in the 6'th run.
    For the sixth run I used cool water that had been boiled. In the
 seventh run, except for a few control bottles, I am adding water that is
 still boiling, so as to help sterilize the fly food/supplement powder
 mixtures. We'll see if this makes a difference.

There are 2 ways deuterium can react with itself:

1) Produces tritium possessing 1.01 million electron volts of kinetic   
   energy and a proton with 3.02 mev.

2) Produces helium 3 with .82 mev and a NEUTRON with 2.57 mev.

The 2 reactions occur with equal probability.

19. REGENERATION OF AXONS IN CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM WHITE MATTER
When examining the gross anatomy of the mammalian brain and
spinal cord, a striking feature is the presence of large regions
with an opalescent ivory color. The color is due to myelin, the
substance that sheaths many nerve fibers in the central nervous
system. In the vertebrate central nervous system, the axons of
nerve cells involved in physiological functions that require
rapid signaling (for example, the neural control of voluntary
muscle) are wrapped in myelin with a special consequence. The
myelin sheath consists of concentric layers of electrically
insulating lipid material, but the sheath is periodically
interrupted, and at the points where the sheath is interrupted so
is the electrical insulation interrupted. The result, predictable
from the classical physics of electrical transmission lines and
the electrical parameters of nerve fibers, is that the propagat-
ion of an electrical pulse along such nerve fibers occurs at a
velocity much higher than that found in unmyelinated fibers.
Glial cells are cells of the central and peripheral nervous
system that metabolically support neurons and produce the
multiple membrane layers called myelin and enfold nerve cell
axons with it. The glial cells are found everywhere in the brain
and spinal cord, and one result of a localized injury to the
central nervous system is a local proliferation of glial cells to
form a scar matrix. Concerning brain and spinal cord injury, it
has always been a canon of neurobiology that adult central
nervous system neurons cannot regenerate after injury to re-
establish the connections to other cells necessary for proper
functioning. Davies et al (6 authors at 2 installations, US UK),
using microtransplantation techniques, now report that adult
central nervous system white matter can support long-distance
regeneration of adult axons provided the reactive glial
extracellular matrix at the site of the lesion can be bypassed.
The authors suggest this is the first time this glial barrier to
axon regeneration has been noted.

The message in question went from your Netscape 3.04 Gold on Windows NT,

I disagree.  I do not think scientists should claim that their research
is "the Will of God" to try to gain the support of the religious.  Do
you really expect religious leaders to reverse their condemnation of
cloning because Seed says it is God's will?

"Sure the Constitution has its problems, but it's better than what we
have now!"  I don't know where this quote comes from.

Unfortunately, modern U.S. law does not seem to respect the doctorine
that all freedoms are granted except those specifically prohibited. 
Rather, in this case it will probably be deemed that cloning is a
medical procedure.  All medical procedures are generally prohibited by
the FDA until they are proven to be safe and effective.

As to whether this position is actually legal in the United States is an
exercise left to the reader.

I would say no, the book is not me.  It may be a blueprint or set of
instructions for rebuilding me.  If someone follows the instructions in
the book and somehow brings me back, then I would be back as me.  But I
don't think the information about me or about rebuilding me equals me.

I am signed up at Alcor for suspension.  I would feel cheated if instead
of freezing my body they published a book entitled "All About Harvey
Newstrom."

This is a new idea to me.  Good work!  Most of the arguments against
copying have been based on the obvious divergence of the individuals. 
Attacking the problem be resolving the divergence seems to be a logical
approach.

If they were later to merge, they would then be the same person.  But
couldn't any seperate individuals on this list eventually merge and
become one person in some distant future?  Aren't we seperate
individuals until/unless that happens?

FYI, most pieces you hear on NPR's "Morning Edition"

Just to clarify, I also would care.  I already have a twin brother that
some people claim is indistinguishable from me.  I therefore have
trouble with accepting that an indistinguishable copy makes it
acceptable for me to die.  I don't want to die.

Oops.  I'm sending more duplicate postings.  In addition to extropioans
at extropy.org and extropy.com, I am now seeing extropians at
maxwell.kumo.com and some gnu.org site.

Are poeple setting up mirrors for the extropians list?  Or, are people
using different addresses to send to the extropians list?  These
multiple addresses are confusing various software.  Normally, a list has
one name, and everybody sends to the one name.  A reply to the list
should send a single reply to the single list.  When all these different
names are used, it makes it difficult for the software to figure out
which one to reply to.  In some cases, the multiple names for the list
each get their own reply.

Is there some way to get MajorDomo to use "To: extropians@extropy.com"
instead of using whatever the poster decided to use?  Setting the "To:"
and "Reply-To:" fields to two different addresses that actually go to
the same list, is just asking for duplicates.

It sets the "Reply-to" field to extropians@extropy.com. It has no
control over the "To" field.

This brings to mind Hofstadter's essay "A Conversation with Einstein's
Brain", in The Mind's Eye, by Hofstadter and Dennett.  In the essay is
a book which is all about Einstein, having a complete model of his brain.
Here is a brief description I found on the web:

> A typical conversation might go something like the following: A person
> writes down the statement,"How are you feeling?" onto the first page. The
> person then reads and carries out the indicated rules for transforming
> the written statement into simulated auditory stimuli and then into

(Actually I don't think the book would say that, since it would not
be initially aware that it was a book, and it would in fact at least
simulate feeling things.  Rather, it would say something like, "I can't
see and my body feels strange, but I hear you OK and my thinking seems
normal enough.")

If Alcor restored you as a book, it would not be fundamentally different
from restoring you as an upload who was not currently being run, or
as a person who was still in suspension.  The flaw is not in the fact
that you are a book vs software vs meat, but that there may not be any
provision to actually run the program and allow you to experience life.

If Alcor did provide such a means, some person or robot who would
go through the process of updating the book and allowing you to have
conversations and experiences, you might complain about your slow speed
compared to the rest of the world, or possibly the limited quality of
your I/O (depending on how much was incorporated in the book) but you
would not have the right to complain that your resurrection had failed.

Agreed.  This is a better explanation of what I feel.  The book might be
me, but I could not experience life in my new incarnation, or grow and
change.  The definition of "me" has to be more than my current state, it
must include continuing experience and future potential.

I expected that the List software was set up as appropriately as
possible.  I will try to remember to use Netscape's "Re: Mail" to reply
to the List and "Re: All" when replying to private e-mail.

Actually, its evidence of the multiversal divergence of timelines. You

A preliminary study should look at how the human brain changes its
personality/etc when the individual either marries or gets a dog. Is it
a chicken or egg thing that many married folk tend to seem like
twins????

I'm not completely sure how you apply the term "violate" to a person. 
If you mean "violate their rights" then I have to presume you're
refering their rights as seen by you, as it is a purely subjective
term.  A contract should be enforce by all who would benefit from it,
and again I see no reason to think that all contracts *must* be
fufilled.  I certainly wouldn't call it "bad" - even when I blieved in
the concept.

Both.  Marriages tend to be between temperamentally and culturally
similar people, but long marriage also makes people resemble each
other more.

Thanks.  I'm glad you like it.  Are you an extropian?  Return to Sender

 Until later, -Bill.

 (c) 01/05/98 Ian Williams Goddard

 How predictable the press. On November 19, 1997 I reported that 
 the FBI allowed reporters to view the reconstruction of TWA 800, 
 from which the nose section has been removed and remains hidden. 
 However, as freelance reporter Robert Davey -- one of the many
 reporters to be allowed access -- told me, the FBI prohibited 
 access to the left side of the reconstruction. I predicted that 
 this blatant effort to suppress information even after the FBI 
 ended its criminal investigation would not be reported by the 
 press, even as dozens of reporters witnessed this act of evi-
 dence suppression before their eyes. As I said on Nov. 19:

>

>

 Just too predictable, mark my word indeed: the only media account 
 I've found of the "access" fails to mention that only half of the 
 nose-section-removed and wingless reconstruction was allowed to be 
 viewed -- which means about 2/3rds of the aircraft are NOT allowed 
 to be viewed. This is that account from the L.A. Times (11/20/97): 


	FBI ALLOWS PRESS TO VIEW TWA WREAKAGE

	One day after the FBI pulled out of the 
	probe into the cause of the July 1996 
	explosion of TWA Flight 800, investigators 
	allowed reporters to view the reassembled 
	wreckage for the first time. The wreckage, 
	most of it resurrected from the ocean floor 
	by divers, rises from the floor of a hanger 
	in Calverton, N.Y., its more than 1 million 
	parts crudely attached to metal scaffolding. 
	"You can't look at the plane without seeing 
	the souls of those who were lost," said James 
	K. Kallstrom, who headed the FBI's investiga-
	tion into the explosion, "and at the same 
	time think of the strength and courage of 
	the families of these victims." The National 
	Transportation Safety Board has hearings 
	scheduled next month in its efforts to find 
	a cause. The hearings may continue well 
	into next year.  [ END OF REPORT ]


 The Times was sure to quote Kallstrom saying "You can't look 
 at the plane without seeing the souls of those who were lost,"
 yet conveniently declined to inform us that the FBI also said
 that you  CAN'T LOOK AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PLANE, not to 
 mention you  can't look at the entire nose section or wings. 
 I guess these parts of the plane, which were recovered, are 
 just not important, even as reports said the nose section, 
 far removed from the fuel tanks and the first major part 
 of the plane to fall away, took one hell of a hit.

 Not only is it outrageous that the media, as I predicted, 
 fails to report that access to the left side was prohibited,
 but to also lead us to believe that the FBI has allowed free
 inspection of the physical evidence when in fact the nose sec-
 tion is removed and hidden is as outrageous as the press report-
 ing (assuming this happened) that the FBI allowed the press to 
 inspect President Kennedy's corpse and yet the press fails to 
 mention his head was missing. The FBI's investigation of TWA
 800 and the major media's coverage is a hoax by definition.

 The major media in the U.S. is uniformly nothing more than a 
 propaganda arm of the Federal Government and no amount of murder
 or mayhem on the part of the  Federal Government  will break the
 media's commitment to serve the Federal Government in an effort 
 to prevent knowledge of truth. The major media and the Federal
 Government are  allied against  the interests of the American
 people and seem committed instead to a course of progressive 
 Federal Government expansion and the integration of the 
 U.S. Government into a New World Government.

Here we can see a photo of the right side of the reconstruction
at an angle allowing us to see that the nose section is missing:
http://cnn.com/US/9705/12/twa/ See the second image. Notice that
CNN calls  the reconstructed aircraft  without a nose section a
"complete" reconstruction. That's like calling a house without
a roof a "complete" house. How stupid do they think we are? 

There have been a few photos in the press of the left side of
the aircraft that the  FBI prohibited access to in the case
cited above. The best image of the left side is at my web
page here: http://www.erols.com/igoddard/crash.htm From
this angle you can see the nose section missing. Why
the FBI now disallowed the viewing we have here is
not clear,  except that they may not have wanted
people to inspect the hole I noticed. If there
was nothing to hide, they would not hide it,
and yet they are now hiding it along with
the wings and the entire nose section.

Excerpts from USA Today (01/09/98, A3):


	RETIRED OFFICERS FIRE MISSILE 

	THEORY BACK INTO TWA CASE


	by John Hanchette and Billy House: 
	Gannett News service contributing: Scott Bowles

	WASHINGTON - Retired admiral Thomasd Moorer, a 
	former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
	called Thursday for new congressional hearings
	into TWA Flight 800.

	Moorer and other retired Navy brass, at a news 
	conference, expressed suspicion over the FBI's 
	18-month investigation of the disaster.

	"All the evidence would point to a missile," 
	Moorer said.

	The retired officers speculated a missile could 
	have come from either a submarine or a buoy device 
	developed by the Navy years ago. "One vital quest-
	ion we haven't attacked is the origin of that 
	streak of light," Moorer said.

Great!  Since my other copies are posting the exact same thing I posted, it

thought....;-)

Hmmm...  What would be a transhuman or Extropian smiley?

There is a  difference. If I say "Fido is a dog" that is a  of the 
logical form Dog (Fido). The "is a" is a way to indicate predicate 
instantiation and is really superfluous. That is very different from 
"3+2=5" or "The morning star is the evening star." which are of the 
form a=b, or equivalently, Identity(a,b); here the "is" is a 
predicate itself. Here we are using the identity predicate 
which is per definition symmetric. And that is presumably what Hal 
thinks it looks as if you are doing when you say about two 
person-segments that they are the same person, that the person 
to which the former person-segment belongs is the same person as 
that to which the latter person-segment belongs. This looks like a=b. 

Not that we might not need a new grammar for personal identity. Our 
present notion seems to be hopelessly vague and confused. But it 
might be best to use new terms to signify the new usage you propose. 
Stop talking about personal identity and start talking about personal 
containment, for example?

I wanted to avoid mathematical notation and stick with natural language,
but you've convinced me that it is probably more confusing than helpful.
Anyway, my idea is really simple. I'll just repeat it one more time using
Anders Sandberg's proposed notation (see
http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Cultural/Philosophy/identity.html).

Anders defines the function dist(X,Y) to be the identity distance between
mind states X and Y as evaluated by X. For example H(X) = {Y : dist(X,Y) <
Dmax(X)} is X's maximal hull of identity, i.e., the set of states X
considers to be himself.

So what I'm saying is that dist(X,Y) equals the authenticity of Y's memory
of being X, where X is me or anyone who shares my (still tentative)
philosophy of personal identity.

Rick Rossi asked:

"What would be the legal argument for making the cloning of humans illegal
in the United States"?


Dear Rick and other fellow Extropians:

There is no valid legal argument for banning cloning in the United States.

The issue is entirely political and primarily influenced by the quasi-moral
fantasies of the so-called "religious right", and promoted by the mass
media.

As usual the popular media has latched on to this as a headline grabber
designed to attract a scientifically ignorant mass audience. Regrettably,
most of the editors in the mass media seem to be as scientifically ignorant
as their readers and viewers. As to the general morality of most of the
editors of the media, I somehow doubt that many of them even know the
meaning of the word.

Ok, but how much future potential do you need? A day of subject time? An
hour? A second? Does it mean that sometime before your actual
(irreversible) death, you're no longer you?

That's not a meaningful criticism of the press; you and I personally
have just about opposite definitions of "moral", yet we happen to
agree (contrary to the minority) that the act of cloning yourself
is OK.  The relevant question to me seems to be "What are the real
memetic influences that make the majority believe what they do, and
what can we do about it?"  I think blaming religion here falls
short of the whole story.  Even many avowed atheists are uncomfortable
with the idea.  Some who are all in favor of "technology" when it's
made of plastic are less enthusiastic when it comes to cells.

What is it that they fear?  What can we do to assuage that fear or

Many extropians and other generally rational people label themselves
"atheist", meaning that they don't believe in God.  Some go even further
and believe that there is no God.  Many atheists seem to be against the
concept of God in any form.  I've noticed many times on this list that
when the subject of God comes up, many atheists, in typical knee-jerk
fashion, renounce the whole idea, even though the God concept is
significantly different than standard God concepts.  I doubt this
rejection of all possible God concepts is rational.

My belief is that unless a theory is logically inconsistent or disagrees
with experiential evidence, then it cannot be rejected entirely.  Of
course, theories with much supporting evidence should be considered more
applicable to reality than those with little or none.  But there is no
rational basis for *rejecting* a theory without sufficient evidence
against it.

There is a huge variety of God concepts.  Probably the most familiar to
those on this list are the Judeao-Christian God concepts.  Many people,
including atheists, have a hard time thinking about God without using
these limited concepts.  But there are countless other ways to invent God
concepts.

The idea that our universe was created by an intelligent being is very
attractive to most people.  Of course, that intelligent being could have
many possible characteristics and motivations.  Many atheists continue to
use the tired argument, "if there is a God, why all the suffering?",
without realizing that there is no connection between creating a universe
and ensuring that no suffering occurs within that system.  They have
placed the unnecessary restriction that God must care about suffering and
is able to do anything about it.  That's also true for their arguments
regarding omnipotence or omniscience.  *Some* people's Gods have those
qualities, but not every God concept includes God being omnipotent and
omniscient.  

When atheists state there is no God, they are making a very bold,
unsupported claim, since there are so many possible variations on the God
concept.  I don't consider it rational to make such claims without any
supporting evidence or logical proofs.

Now, I'm not saying there is a God; I have no idea.  But possibilities
are possibilities until proven otherwise.  I prefer not to close my mind
prematurely on any subject.  That way, I don't limit myself with my own
mental fixations.

Seawater is significantly saltier than the water in human bodies.  
Human urine is essentially as salty as the water in human bodies.  
This means that if you drink seawater either you accumulate salt in 
your body, or you expel more water than you take in.

And, in general, humans DON'T accumulate salt in their bodies when 
drinking seawater.

So, drinking seawater, rather than quenching your thirst, causes you 
to become dehydrated.

Also, salt water is a low-grade emetic (causes you to throw 
up).  This is an additional means by which drinking seawater can 
dehydrate you.

Severely dehydrated individuals do show signs of dementia, including 
but not limited to hallucinations..

 There are many substances that are known to affect

What about slightly more complex personality
features, such as curiosity, sociability, assertiveness,
willpower?   Are there any supplements that can safely
and selectively affect these features?

Respecting the statement on the Extropy Web site's
FAQ that religion is "a touchy subject", I have
resisted until now expressing this, but I would like
to briefly support what David Musick said about some
people's knee-jerk reaction to the God meme in all
its forms.

It really annoys me when people automatically react
with vitriol when the concept of God comes up, even
when it comes up with a heavy dose of irreverance and
scepticism. How utterly boring their reaction is!
They keep re-hashing issues and fighting old battles
from centuries ago. The fact that the existence of
"God" is unproven, probably unprovable, and may be
rationally doubted has long been a consensus of
Western philosophy. That's old news.

Face it, since the God meme is as flexible as it is,
meaning to some "the indescribable absolute
underlying all reality", it will always have a place
in the meme pool. Why then do some people still react
so emotionally when the mere subject comes up? What
about it bothers you so much? Like it or not,
religious thought will survive into posthumanity. Get
over it.

I have a dejavu feeling with this one. I wanted to say something
like this a few months ago. IMHO it all has to do with freezing time.

Since you "are" a dynamic information entity in a atomic critical
mass, you can only copy it "perfect" when it stands still.
If this is recorded in a book or in a actual freezer doesn't mater.
The fact that the process is on hold is (i think) very important.
If you start it up again, you or your copy becomes dynamic again.
I think this happens in a split second. Therefor If you die and are
put in a database it will record a frozen part of memory-time.

Asume they make copys of this, put them in a new body and
start them up. For less then a second they will all " feel"
exactly like the orginal, but after that they realize they are
their own copy and therefor a new original. None of them
will be the old you anymore. They are one happy family with
exactly the same background (wich is in a sense what you are)
I think in the begining they all feel that they are the original, but
due to the time factor and the chaotic-thinking-part, they will
all end up as identical twins.They are childs with fixed and ready
to go minds.

I think therefor that merging them again after some time is
very hard (if not impossible), since you are talking about
differn't persons.

IMHO, the copy-paradox has to do with time.

People on life rafts have to collect rainwater, and also can derive 
significant fluids from eating fish (if they can catch any).  Also, 
life rafts often carry an inflatable "solar still" which looks like a 
beach ball floating in the ocean and distills fresh water from sea.  
More recently, life rafts have taken to carrying reverse osmosis 
filters which rely on hand pumping to provide pressure (this is what 
we had when I worked on the Shell Venture).

Drinking sea water causes the body to excrete more fluids, making 
things worse than not drinking at all.  I don't know about "crazy", 
but I have seen people who have accidentally become severely 
dehydrated and they definately start losing touch with reality.  
Also, I can well imagine going crazy trying *not* to drink the sea 
water after a day or two without fluids.

If by "rejecting" you mean not bothering to think about it any more, and I 
can't imagine of what else you could mean, then I disagree, contradictory  
evidence is only one reason to send an idea to the junk heap. Given the fact  
that there are an infinite number of potential theories and only a finite 
amount of time, any theory that complicates things, predicts nothing new, and 
can never be proven wrong, does not deserve further consideration. Time spent 
on a barren theory means time not spent looking for something better. 

At any rate, the theists can't say their idea was not given a fair hearing, 
it has obsessed billions of people for thousands of years and produced 
nothing. There must have a hardware bug in many human minds that makes them 
go into an endless loop when exposed to the "God" meme.

It sounds to me like you have a stronger commitment to the word "God" than 
the idea of God. If you make the God concept fuzzy enough then I would be 
unable to disagree with it, and be even more unable to find a use for it.

Apparently, and the intelligent being would doubtless find the idea 
attractive to explain His own existence too.
	    

	>I prefer not to close my mind prematurely on any subject.  
	    

The important word is "prematurely". A totally open mind is no better than a 
totally closed one, both are equally sterile. There are no guaranties, all I 
can say is that a creative mind uses judgment to sort those ideas that might 
produce something interesting from those ideas unlikely to do so.

SInce people view their genes as 'theirs', and that they as individuals
don't want anybody out there being produced from their genes without
their knowledge or say so. This is an entirely rational privacy issue.
Where people go wrong is that since they cannot ever conceive of a
personal need for the technology (unless they happen to be an unluck
sterile individual), then the only real use for it would be by
governments or corporations to do their own experimentation on a persons
genes without their knowledge (would you feel good if your offspring
were being tortured and enslaved??), or even being able to replace
people in a 'body snatcher' kind of way. The other meme out there is the
religious one that views anything but completely natural conception and
birth as unnatural, against gods will, etc. The old "if man were meant
to fly, god would've given him wings" routine, despite the high
percentage of the existing population who survived childbirth only due
to drastic technological intervention.

I also think that the word "cloning" has a negative semantic value.
Pro-cloning people should publicly redefine their position with a much
more acceptable catch phrase, like 'artificial twinning', 'assisted
twinning', much in the way pro-abortion activists redefined themselves
as "Pro-Choice", while the anti-'choice' activists redefined themselves
as "Pro-Life". Both phrases seem to be representing positive things that
all people would like to be for.

I would be interested to hear from Kathryn what the Pro-Choice
establishment feels about Assisted Twinning....

Depends. If I and others refuse to obey any new law against cloning, and
get cloned, what can they do??? Kill the kid??? Since WE don't have to
exert force, we can be protected by our civil disobedience rights. We
just have to be willing to practice them, be willing to take the
persecution, untill the public sees that we are willing to fight for our
rights, and that it is they who are being the immoral ones, much as was
done during the civil rights struggle here in the US. People respect you
and your position once you prove you are willing to fight for it. Look
at the PLO, its pretty well respected now, after having worn down the
Isreali lobby after several decades of struggle.

The point of any civil struggle is to demonstrate to the populace the
brutality they must exert to enforce their prejudices. SInce most people
don't like to see suffering, they will give up on their prejudices
rather than continue the repression. At least thats how it can work with
a relatively free press.

You mean besides this list?

The former attributes (energy level, mental acuity, mood, empathy, etc.)
are normal functions of the physical brain.  Generally increasing health of
the brain allows one to more efficiently perform these functions.  The
latter attributes (curiosity, sociability, assertiveness, willpower) are
not pre-existing functions.  They are learned behavior and conscious
choices.  Although a physically healthy brain will help you pursue these
behaviors, I think they have to be learned and enhanced through experience,
decision-making, and belief systems.  You grow to choose your behaviors,
and if you experience positive results while pursuing these you gain more
confidence that they will be rewarding in the future.  I do not think these
latter choices can be enhanced in the brain, short of artificially
implanting memories and beliefs that reinforce this behavior.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

When Dolly arrived, the trouble started. Ongoing and noisy debates in all
major mass media on a very low level -- especially, as always, in the yellow
press -- have indeed shown that most opposers of a free policy of cloning
argue on an irrational basis, oftenly caused by religous belief. With Mr.
Seed's recent statements, the debate got heated up once again.

I've written up an article about the Dangers of Cloning last year
(http://www.excelsior.org/~erik/Problems_of_Cloning_and_Possible_Solutions/clone.htm).
Now it seems like what I stated there might indeed become reality.

Mr. Seed said that he will reduce the "cost of a clone". Note: He didn't say
that he will reduce the cost of cloning. This is a further advance which makes
a human a product which you can either afford or not, depending on your
position in the capitalist society. Of course this is perfectly in the line of
thinking of a free market capitalist. In his view, humans have always been
products, and this is also true even today. We prostitute ourselves when we
offer our services for money, making us loan-slaves. If we don't agree with a
society of loan-slavery, we must either depend on charity (provided by the
state or local organizations in an always decreasing level) or starve. 

OK, that's reality today. The human clone is just an expansion of this idea.
And in the discussion on this list, the expression "to have the child you
want" was already formed. Of course Extropians are always a little faster than
the rest of the capitalist society, but I guess finally it will go this way.

To have the child you want. Note: Not "to have a child if you want it". That's
a right and desire I perfectly understand. But "having the child you want" - a
phrase used by Chris Hibbert without deeper consideration of its meaning - is
impossible with cloning. 

The reason is apparent: The clone will only biologically meet with the buyer's
ideas. And here's where the problems start.

First, as we've already determined that humans and clones are just products
available on the free market, let's consider the consequences. The products we
buy when our most urgent needs are satisfied (which is a luxuary not everyone
on our small planet can afford, thanks to this incredibe free market) depend
on the information we have consumed. As this information is mainly created and
spread by TV nowadays, most humans are quite uneducated. Trends and fashions
are created through marketing. What's cool today is a bunch of shit tomorrow.

And a human is just a product.

Which means, of course, that the clone we've bought might be a nice toy today,
especially if it's made of DNA of a famous personality. But it might get
boring tomorrow and be disposed. You'd buy a clone not because you want a
child, but because you want a toy. And who keeps his modern teddy bear
forever? Who cares for it when you don't want it anymore? Would you send your
teddy bear to a school? No? So what does the clone do when he has grown up and
nobody wants him anymore?

Also, history has shown what humans can do to other humans when they're given
the right to do whatever they want to do to them. For example, at times war.
In WW II, a brothel was created for female Jews who were later (after being
used, as the products they had become) disposed in the gas chambers. Ah, I
guess we'll find some fellows who doubt this on this funny little mailing
list, too. After all, you seriously discuss "child rearing" and the right for
the possession of guns here. 

Back to the present. The main problem with free cloning is what I've described
as "Funcloning" in my article. Clones as products/toys for a privileged (for
biological cloning will always be expensive) minority seem much more likely
than clones as a good means of reproduction for infertile humans or homosexual
pairs. In addition, even clones used in deadly gameshows are imaginable. Or in
a human zoo.

Already today, humans are enslaved in American prisons to provide services.
These prisons are getting a major competitor on the free market. And what do
you do when you need more workers? You recruit them, by spreading a little
crack or selling a few weapons and having the police already at hand when it
gets interesting. A prison state is not just a dark fantasy anymore, some
already *call* America a prison state.

Eugene Leitl, you have described what I call Funcloning as "neoluddism".
Another fancy keyword. But who's the one who has fun here? Progess is fine.
Cloning is OK if it is used by those who need it. But humans must not be made
more product-like than they already are. 
Otherwise your beloved singularity will remain a wet dream for your lifetime.

Personally, I want guaranteed unlimited time.  Since that is not likely to
happen, I will settle for indeterminate time.  As long as I am aware and
continuing to experience, I am happy.  If I see that my time is about to
end and that I will cease to function at some future time, I will do
everything in my power to avoid that specific event.

The book cannot experience life.  It cannot try to avoid a future event.
It has no sensory input.  It doesn't move, change, reproduce, respond, make
decisions, possess intelligence, process input, or have any attribute that
I would consider alive.

Answered my own question, at least partly
 
This is ansi#0167, which you can type by Alt+0167

So: :-) is a galaxy brain
and: :-) is merely a jupiter brain, or saturn brain
and if you win an argument: :- is "I told you so"

FOrrest Bishop,

I just read your paper on open Air Habitats, in which you cited my posts
to this list in 97 in the following paragraph:

> A magnetic field can be added to this world without much further effort by
> wrapping superconducting wire or film around the circumference to form a
> current loop [10, Lorrey, M., (1997), transhuman/extropian mailing lists (March)]. > The resulting magnetic dipole field would deflect the solar

Another effect of this ion flow will be that since each pole will
attract oppositely charged particles, in the center where the flows
interact, you will get a large amount of dischaging which could
interfere with communications across the hub. I'd suggest the addition
of a membrane or grid of some sort that would generate power from this
potential difference. Having two grids, one across the north edge of the
hoop, and another across the south edge of the hoop, with a circuit in
between would pull a large amount of energy from the solar ion stream,
and sheild communications within the hub from interference.

Your line of argument sounds reasonable and is frequently cited by
believers
of various types (UFO people, religious people, etc.) It has a big
problem,
however: There are an infinite number of non-refuted theories to explain
any phenomenon. (Proof: if there is a valid theory to explain something,
then
you can add any non-refutable hypothesis to it to derive another
non-refutable
theory.) I don't have time to deal with an infinite number of
non-refuted
theories. It there are two theories, one with hypothesis set "A" and one
with hypothesis set "A" + "B", where "B" is non-refutable, then I am
free
to ignore the second theory. "B" adds nothing to the theory, and the
predictive power of the theory "A"+"B" is identical to the predictive
power of "A". Therefore, the predictive power of the theory provides
no support for "B".

>From a practical standpoint, this means that you will have to show me
some evidence if you want me to evaluate a new theory. This habit of
thought is often referred to as "Occam's razor."

I read just this in a Nicholas Negroponte's recent Wired article about
the upcoming Junior Summit:

<quote>
One topic on the table will be a proposal by five alumni of the first
Junior Summit to start Nation.1 - a virtual nation for children, with
its own voice, flag, and currency, but without borders or centralized
government. This nation would apply for membership to the UN and make
every effort to include children from developing nations. Here is an
excerpt from Nation.1's first proclamation:

As a kid growing up with computers, you have ideas, you see
possibilities, but they don't count, you're just a kid. Adults need
kids, they just don't realize it. They can't relate to what kids have
to offer, because they don't understand technology the way kids do.
Kids have valuable perspectives, but the world offers no mechanism to
voice their opinions. They have no representation in world politics
and they have no influence in the decisions that govern their future.

So with the help of the second Junior Summit, a group of young, very
wired individuals is going to bend, twist, and distort some barriers
with the hope those barriers will come undone. We are going to create
a country in cyberspace, not defined by geography or race, but by
technology and age: Nation.1 - a country populated and run by kids.

Nation.1 is just beginning, and we are considering how to create
digital political systems, how to deal with language barriers, how the
technology behind the country will work. We passionately believe it's
worth it, because uniting kids changes their perspective, widens their
understanding, and leads to a better world.

Proposals like Nation.1 may seem outrageous, even unthinkable,
compared with what we adults would have suggested. That's the way it
should be: ultimately, the world must go past what adults believe will
succeed. The global information society is ours only to dream - it
will be up to these children to live it out.
</quote>

What I want to know is - why only kids?  I want to have my very own
virtual nation.  NOW! :-(

So here's an idea - make an extropic virtual nation and get ourselves
represented in the UN, how about TransNation?  or something similar. 
Anyone have any idea if this is possible?

That's amazing - I haven't been keeping up with Wired or any other
magazines recently due to extended work on my book and thesis - but as a
child,  is there anything that I can do to help the Extropian cause in
dealing with this Junior Summit or Nation.1?

Nation.1 definitely sounds like something I'll have to look into.

Erik,

	I think you will find that most, or all individuals on this list share
your concerns of state interference with personal choice matters (drugs,
etc); and that most, or all are also appalled at the depths to which
GOVERNMENTS have sunk. 
	Your nightmare scenario of funcloning is close to what I would envision if
elitists (governments) are left in control of technologies such as cloning
(FDA). Except in the case of the elitists I see the technology being used
to create and control soldiers who are never exposed to any social
interaction beyond their highly trained tightly knit units. I wonder if,
without any interaction with average individuals, these clones would have a
normal resistance to initiating violence. Sadly, the past points to many
examples of people who were raised in semi civil societies turning out
extremely violent due to destructive memes ( fascism, socialism, statism,
luddism). Just imagine what the Marine of the future could be like!
	Due to the above argument, I propose that the future will be much safer
with cloning available on the free market rather than controlled by the
elite. It is kinda like computers; the more widespread and available they
are, the less likely it is that they will be used to oppress us.
	You seem to speak out of both sides of your mouth when you rail against a
prison state and attack the freemarket in the same letter. If not a
freemarket what? A prison market?
	Here's the applicable quote for the day: 
"It's a far easier thing to have a firm anchor in ignorance than to set out
on the troubled seas of thought."
	I have no clue who I am quoting, just felt it fit in with any response to
your letter.

Dana Lee Kissick

I recently discovered Pathfinder (http://www.pathfinder.com/) an online 
forum where all varieties of current events are discussed. I haven't had 
so much fun discussing extropian ideas before.  I'm surprised how many 
people are hip to the idea when it is presented in a rational manner.

I recentlly started a thread on indefinite life extension, asking people 
if they are ready to live indefinitly:

[DBETZ] - 07:18am Jan 10, 1998 EST (#1 of 2) 

I can see the reality in this concept and I do think it is possible. My 
question is do you think this planet will be able to substain life 
another 250 years if we continue to distroy it at the rate we are 
progressing ?

------------------------------------------------------------------------
[phughes] - 07:45pm Jan 10, 1998 EST (#2 of 2) 

Dbetz: Yes, if we continue to use the same technologies and processes 
that we now have for another 250 years, the entire ecosystem could 
destabilize and humanity along with many other species could be wiped 
off the planet like a bad case of the flu. That's why it is essential 
that along with increased lifespan, comes increased responsibility to 
improve ourselves. Obviously anyone with increased intelligence can see 
that our current inefficient and polluting ways are a dead end. 
Long-term survival implies that wedevelop a sustainable society both on 
earth and off.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

ON CLONING:

[elizowen] - 03:23pm Jan 10, 1998 EST (#8 of 9) 

Are you against President Clinton's proposed five-year ban on human 
cloning then? Does he have a point that "scientific advancement does not 
occur in a moral vacuum" or is this just hot air from a politician who 
doesn't want to rock the boat? Is it worth taking a timeout before we 
run the risk , according to one fertility expert,of producing babies 
whose chromosomes match those of the donor -- i.e., by the time they 
reach 20, they could have the blood pressure problems of their 
middle-aged parents?

------------------------------------------------------------------------
phughes] - 07:38pm Jan 10, 1998 EST (#9 of 9) 

In principle, I am not against a kind of moratorium to allow time to 
develope a wise and beniificial plan on how it can be used productively. 
However, Clinton is merely pandering to popular (i.e ignorant and 
fearful) opinion in order to protect his butt and that of his party. His 
rhetoric was full of moral and religious overtones that are irrelevelant 
to conducting safe and sound science. Most people when asked why they 
are against cloning, resort to such stupid answers as "its wrong, 
immoral and dangerous" w/o giving a single reason why, other than "it 
just is!". 

We don't need a ban, we need an informed and educated debate and how 
best to DEVELOPE this technology, not how to stop it.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
On the hysteria about asteroid imacts and why space migration is good 
thing:

[phughes] - 04:04am Jan 10, 1998 EST (#35 of 37) 

 I have two points to make about asteroid impacts. 

1) The chance of an asteroid hitting earth with enough force to 
seriously destabilize human civiliation within the next 100 years is 
about 1 in 50,000. I take those odds every time I get in my car. I'm not 
worried. 

2) If you are worried, which you should be if you care about the 
long-term survival of the human race, then you should also be a strong 
advocate for space migration. It is utterly silly that we should 
contemplate a long and sustainable future, without incorporating space 
migration as THE FUTURE for humankind. We have an amazing, beautiful and 
infinite universe awaiting us, if we can just muster the courage and the 
will to go. We must - otherwise all life's 3.875 billion year struggle 
from primeavel hot baths to now would have been in vane. The universe is 
calling us. It is our birthright and our future. 

Ad Astra!

Most atheists base their atheism on the standard Judeo-Christian concept of God, which 
is a logical impossibility.

But let's suppose you want to define "god" as some sort of intelligent being who created 
the Universe. Yes, that is possible. However, there is not a shred of evidence for that 
theory. I really don't have time to think about everything which might be possible. It 
is possible that there may be a planet in the Universe made of green cheese. My mind is 
not "closed" on any subject, but the burden of proof always lies with the person who 
claims something is true.

Also, if there is some sort of "god", I'm really not interested in this entity unless 
you can show me that he can do something useful for me at the present time.

What "God concept" are you talking about?  I do not believe that there
is a pink invisible hippo dressed in a tutu dancing on my keyboard, which
I will refer to as PIHDT.  Just because there are many different PIHDT
concepts, are you stating that I am not rational for rejecting the
entire set of PIHDT concepts?  I suggest that you take your original
message and do a global replace of "God" with "a pink invisible hippo
dressed in a tutu dancing on my keyboard" and then read it again.

If you are claiming that I should give some special consideration to some
concept, exactly what type of consideration are you talking about and why
I should give different consideration to "God concepts" than to PIHDT
concepts.  Mickey Mouse, PIHDT, and God are all fictional concepts,
sometimes I consider these concepts but I consider these concepts as fictional
concepts.  If you think there is a relevant difference between Mickey Mouse,
PIHDT and God, please state it in detail.

It is the believers in God who came up with the all knowing, all loving,
and all powerful stuff.  The persons who have criticized these silly ideas
should not be condemned, rather praised for calling attention to the errors
in these ideas.

I am not going to comment on the rest of the post, I don't have the time
or patience.  My strong suggestion is that before people go arguing religion
and theology, they do some basic study in the field.  The best place to 
start is the following book:

 TITLE:     The Retreat to Commitment
 AUTHOR:    W.W. Bartley, III
 PUBLISHER: Open Court

I hope this does not seem overly harsh, however this is the Extropian email
list and my expectation of a high level of discourse.

   The case against "God" has nothing to do with suffering. Any attempt to
formulate a "God" concept presents the thinker with the problem of an
infinite regress. You have no right to the words "rational" or "logical"
if you try to evade this issue.

Alexander Chislenko asks:

"There are many substances that are known to affect one's energy level,
mental acuity, mood, empathy, etc.  What about slightly more complex
personality features, such as curiosity, sociability, assertiveness,
willpower?   Are there any supplements that can safely and selectively
affect these features?"

I don't know if there are any supplements right now that affect the
personality features mentioned.  However, since I am someone with Bipoar
Disorder (manic-depression), I occasionally go into a hypomanic state of
mind.  In a hypomanic state of mind, I feel much more curious, sociable,
assertive, have much more confidence and willpower and have a quicker,
more intelligent and creative mind.  The hypomanic state is common for
people with Bipolar Disorder, and it is believed to be chemically induced
and has a profound effect on the personality. 

Perhaps more research will reveal what chemicals in the brain are
responsible for inducing the hypomanic state of mind.  Then perhaps a
drug can be produced which induces the hypomanic state of mind in people.
 I can see a lot of benefits here.

Yep, but lose that nasty `artificial' instantly!  We all know how hateful
`artificial' things are - like dental fillings and cars and clothings...
Actually, I suspect most people here are closing their eyes to the real
complexity of this kind of reaction.  Rather than simply rail against the
evil Luddites, it might help to understand what mental templates or gadgets
are being activated against cloning.  The so-called `Yuck factor' is not to
be despised but understood.  It helps save our lives or at least our
comfort quite a lot of the time.  Hence it's largely out of our control,
once the switches have been set in infancy.  Consider the fact that you
happily swallow pints of your own saliva every week, and even scoff down a
juicy mouthful from your kissy friend (if you're in luck), but would you
drink a warm cup of your own spit?  I didn't think so.  Yuck!

And the rhetorial move I outlined at the start - mocking the fear of
artifice when everything in life is imbricated with it - is pretty suspect
in turn.  It's based, I suspect, on the false premise that most people *do*
relish these innovations.  On one level, yes, you'd be mad to wish to stand
out in the snow if you could come inside and sit in front of the glowing
heater.  But most of these benefits have endlessly irritating side-effects
- the dread and discomfort if not pain of the dentist, the annoyance of
washing the car and paying for the damned thing and keeping it fed and
putting up with the cretins on the road and where the hell will I park...
Behind that is the deep yearning, perhaps, for the signifiers of our ESS -
the savanna landscape, the pulse of a slow hunting/gathering cycle, the
familiarity of a genetically bonded band where our inborn device for
scoping out what's on everyone else's mind works best.

On top of that, there really *are* plenty of reasonable objections to
people producing `assisted twins' that are not of the same age, but of
different generations and clearly meant to be subject to all manner of
unprecedented psychological pressures from their 40 or 50 year-older
brother or sister slash `parent'.  Bad enough to be T. H. Huxley's son
(although okay to be his grandchild), which almost ruined Leonard Huxley as
I recall - imagine the horrors of being his *cloned child*.

There's more involved in these apparently stupid reaction than can easily
be dismissed, I'd submit.

This is the hazard I see as the most dangerous - the slow degradation of
individual worth, the continuing pressure to see people as `products'.  It
used to irritate me greatly when dumbed-down science fiction and horror
movies/TV represented `clones' as mindless swarms of identical ant-critters
that were frightening exactly because of this doppelganger quality, and
deserved to be exterminated en masse without a moral qualm.  Now I'm
starting to wonder if this tendency in the human mind might not indeed be
activated by certain uses of human cloning.  

It's now amusing and slightly uncanny to see identical twins, triplets and
n-tuples.  But what happens when some polity really does deliberately and
malignly manufacture hundreds or thousands of people who look almost
indistinguishable.  Instant `racism'.  "Can't tell one of those
chinks/coons/foreign devils from another," complacent colonials told each
other... and indeed often they couldn't, because their feature detectors
hadn't been wired to do so (quite the reverse).  There are many reasons why
nobody would wish to create batches of xeroxed humans - they'd be
vulnerable to the same diseases, all that - but by golly what a gift to
anyone who wished to instantly dehumanise their labor force/army/fuckfarm etc.

There has been some criticism to my original God post.  Most of it was
directed towards the idea of not rejecting any theory that is not
logically inconsistent and does not conflict with experiential evidence. 
The main objection to that was that there can be a huge number of
theories to explain any phenomenon, and none of us have the time to
consider all of them, so we must pick the sorts of theories which we
prefer, usually the simplest ones.  This is perfectly true and rational. 
We must pick and choose which theories we will pay attention to.  But
just because we choose one theory, that doesn't mean we should reject or
deny the other ones.  Ignoring them is rational, but rejecting them is
not.  Rejecting a theory is asserting that it is not true, and unless the
theory is logically inconsistent or has evidence against it, then the
assertion of its falsity is unsupported.

I have no problem with people ignoring theories involving God, but I view
*rejecting* those theories as flawed thinking.  Denying something without
evidence or reason is just as bad as asserting something without evidence
or reason.

This sort of thinking error is very common and generally involves other
issues besides God.  People often settle on one explanation for something
and reject all other explanations.  This makes it very difficult for them
to revise their thinking later when their understanding proves
inadequate.  An explanation which they have rejected may be more
appropriate in consideration of information they receive later.  It's
more difficult to "un reject" a possible explanation than to simply not
have eliminated it in the first place.

This sort of cognitive error also happens at the perceptual level.  We
usually refer to it as only being able to see things from a single
perspective.  People get stuck interpreting their sensory information in
a certain way and they have a difficult time seeing the world
differently.  For example, many caucasian people perceive black people in
a very negative way. That is only one out of many, many ways to see them,
but deeply prejudiced people have rejected all the other ways of seeing
them and are fixated on their ways of looking at them. 

Cognitive fixation slows down learning.  In my opinion, all beliefs and
thoughts must be left subject to change.  The mind and belief systems
must be in constant flux.  This way, ideas and beliefs can be in constant
mutation and competition and in continual improvement.

Estacado asserts:

"Because until the concept of "God" is eradicated from this planet
entropy will continue to be a problem. To make it simple: belief in
"God"=pain,suffering, and death. That's why *I* get emotional about the

I don't understand why "God" equals pain, suffering and death.  Please
explain.

Keep in mind that just because millions of people have used "God" as an
excuse to torture and kill other humans, it doesn't prohibit other people
from using "God" as an excuse to create goodness and peace, to improve
themselves, to invent wonderful inventions and do all manner of extropic
things.

Damn!  I know it and I apologize.  It's really frustrating that I can't use
my a regular reply to the Extropians List, like I can to other mailing
lists.  Can't anybody figure out how to fix the List so we Jupiter brains
don't have to edit the headers on messages from the List before we reply to
them?

It is not the original poster's software that is adding the duplicating
addresses.  In this case they sent the message only to
"extropians@maxwell.kumo.com".  It is not the replyer's software which is
adding the duplicate addresses.  In this case, I simply hit "Reply", and it
replied to the two addresses that are already listed in the headers.  It is
the List software which is adding the extra "Reply To:
extropians@extropy.com" to the message which already had "To:
extropians@extropy.com".  This makes it appear that there are two addresses
that can be replied to, but really they go to the same place.

If you look closely at the "duplicates", you will see that they are
addressed to different addresses.  No software in the world can know that
these two differently-seeming addresses are really the same destination.
In my opinion, the List software should not add duplicate reply addresses
in this manner.  The List software should choose to remove the original
address, refrain from adding the second address, or coordinate the two
addresses so that they are the same.  Failing to do so causes duplicate
messages unless every person who replies to the message manually edits
their send-to lines.  Normal Reply functions will tend to reply to both
addresses.

To test this theory, simply press "Reply All" (At least in Netscape and
Eudora) to this message and see what addresses you send to.  You would
expect to reply to me personally as I sent the message.  You would expect
to reply once to the List which received the message, you might even see a
copy sent to yourself depending on how your software is configured.  I
think you will also see an extra address which also goes to the List which
the List software inserted into the headers when it broadcast the message.
If you do not manually edit out this extra address, you will end up sending
duplicate messages to the List.  This is what is causing duplicate messages
to occur.

(Note that you do not actually have to send these duplicates!  After you
have tested this theory, you can cancel the message without flooding the
List with duplicate test messages!)

I was under the impression that most modern Luddites were so for Religious

Your geometry won't work. Each shell must be larger than the previous

I rather suspect that nanotech becomes quite limited at high pressures.
At extremely high pressures the forces of chemical bonds are of the same
magnitude and you just can't build nanotech.

High pressure and temperature only reinforce my point.

Ok. You have: Neutrons, skip those. Ok, energetic alphas - still capable
of considerable nano mayhem. (and you gotta have alphas, ok?). Then
there's betas, which have a range of inches, at least. OH, and I forgot

Using precious high quality energy here. I can see it now. 100 KW, of
which
we budget 10 KW to run the Mr Fusion, and 10 KW to run the accelerator,
with
80 KW of waste heat!

Gotcha on this one! The nucleus is 10^5 times smaller than the atom. No

Etacado informs:

"Any attempt to formulate a "God" concept presents the thinker with the
problem of an
infinite regress. You have no right to the words "rational" or "logical"
if you try to evade this issue."

Well, I certainly wouldn't want to lose my right to use those words, so I
will see what I can do to address the issue.

Basically, the issue is how to form the theory for the beginning of the
Universe without having the problem of an infinite regress.  Someone
might say an intelligent being created our universe.  Well, how did
*that* universe start?  Another intelligent being created it.  And so on.
 Infinite regress.  Another theory is the Big Bang theory.  Some say that
nothing existed and then suddenly the Big Bang was in progress.  That
seems to evade the infinite regress problem.  But if nothing existed,
then how did the Big Bang occur unless there existed a way for it to
occur? Can something truly come from nothing?  Of course, nothing isn't
anything, so it doesn't exist.  So there is no reason to even consider
it.  The only thing worth considering is the something that does exist,
because that is all there is to consider.  So asking how this Universe
began is really asking how it came from nothing.  But "nothing" doesn't
exist; it is pure fantasy.  So, does that mean the Universe has no real
beginning, since it's impossible for it to not exist, since the state of
nothingness doesn't exist?  If the Universe has no real beginning, then
how do we explain its existence?

The real question is:  Why is there something, instead of nothing?

I don't think that question has been answered satisfactorily yet.  My
answer is that "nothing" doesn't exist, so "something" is the only other
option.  But that is just playing with words and doesn't really answer
the question.  Why does anything exist?  

Well, I'm still evading the infinite regress issue, but hopefully I've
distracted you long enough to reclaim my rights to use the words
"rational" and "logical".

I don't know about curiosity, it may be an inherent trait, but the
other three are considered learned traits, and referenced as 'life
skills' by psychologists.  As such, they stem from the first set of
factors you listed that can to some degree be enhanced through
supplementation.  I would assume that if you maintained good health 
and mental acuity through nutrition and supplementation, you would 
develop more control over these more complex personality features.

People die, everything dies, usually in agony. All life is built on pain,  
life only exists because of Darwinian evolution, that is, random mutation and 
natural selection, and a more horrible mechanism for achieving progress can 
not be imagined. A God worthy of the name could have figured out a way that 
was less brutal, like making all creatures by magic fully developed in a
single flash, or at least evolution by the inheritance of acquired 
characteristics.  The fact that He did not do this can only be because He 
did not want to.

If you could prove to me that God exists I would love him for only one reason, 
He can read my mind and will torture me for eternity if I do not. It would be 
a difficult struggle and I doubt if I could pull it off because there is 
absolutely nothing lovable about Him.

Interesting.  Insofar as I (dogmatic agnostic that I am -- see
http://members.home.net/kwatson1/worldview.html) attempt to 
formulate a God concept, it boils down to "God is everything".
I don't see where the infinite regress is in that.

      Bryan Magee, in his fine little book 'Popper', summarizes the 
      philosophical status of the 'God' issue very succinctly:


     "The statement 'God exists' has meaning, and may even be true.  
     However, since no conceivable evidence could _falsify_ the 
     statement, it cannot be scientific in character."

     
     Popper (a humanist agnostic) suggests that there are two forms of 
     religious thinking:
     
     [1] "Dominate or prostrate yourself" -- (unacceptable): or:
     
     [2] "Always remember that -- while men are not gods -- each has a 
     divine spark."
     
     I may have said this before hereabouts, but it bears repeating.

I read once that a prior Queen of England (Victoria, I believe) went 
to a performance of a play, and afterward, declared the play to be 
"aweful and artificial".

And the playwright was thrilled to hear this praise of his work.

See, "aweful" meant that it filled the observer with awe, and 
"artificial" meant that great skill (artifice) went into the crafting 
of it.

Funny how the language changes.

You may be thinking of the 18th century edifice (St Paul's?) which was
praised as "gaudy, pompous and artificial."

No, Erik Moeller ;). What is 'fun'? Everything what we do is fun. Orelse
we wouldn't be doing it. Maybe your idea of fun is different from the next
guy's, so what. Whatever happened to laissez faire?

A mentally intact clone has the same rights as a standard person in the
belief system I currently subscribe to. Period. 
 
Tinkering with human DNA to make Ubermenschen, or microcephalic clones for
transplants is not viable with the shotgun genetic engineering approach we
are now limited to. Tomorrow, who knows? The body is not sacred, the DNA
is not sacred. The mind is, at least now. (Your mileage may vary).

Personally, I find cloning pointless. Microcephalic self clones for
transplantation purposes, maybe. I say the money would be far best spent
in a better neurosuspension protocol.
 
I would find cloning far less pointless, if there was a durable
(semibiological) artificial womb (obviously, I'm no Ixian purist), for it
would open several new vistas, which would be exist otherwise. I would
find it indeed very interesting, if there was a means to xerox adult
individuals (something like the Visible Human, but a nanolitho hardcopy
with _somewhat_ better resolution, and from better material than an
executed defector). But if we can do that, we can dispense with the flesh
altogether. Cloning _is_ pointless. Debates about cloning are doubly so.
Yawn. 

> Another fancy keyword. But who's the one who has fun here? Progress is
> fine. 

About as fancy as 'funcloning', I guess. What's wrong with the term? 
Neoludd is more succinct then Shelley's 'peasants with torches' or
'Webermob', while creating the appropriate associations.

And progress is _always_ fine. Even it will mean the end of humankind as
we know it. I never said I was not a technofashist, if you're so attached
to them fancy keywords. So sue me.

> Cloning is OK if it is used by those who need it. But humans must not be

Who should decide what constitutes need, and what is 'just for the heck of
it'? Me? You? Newt Gingrich? The Pope?

I tend to think that the Teutonic built-in-scissors-in-the-head attitude
is fundamentally flawed. It ruins far more than it claims to accomplish.
Tanstaafl. Wo gehobelt wird, da fallen auch Spaene. And sometimes even a
trickle of blood. Obviously, it is a power lobby problem. Us or Them.
Their numbers, and the kind of resources the other side is wielding
considered, I find it more than ok to fight a bit dirty. (Which does not
mean I join the extropian militia tomorrow. Maybe next week). 

> made more product-like than they already are.  Otherwise your beloved

If you feel like a product, that's your problem. I tend to find current
reality oppressive -- a sufficient reason to work for a better tomorrow. 
As in: a chicken in every pot, a free upload for everyone. Nothing new? 
True. We are no evangelists here.

Objects in this mirror may be larger than they appear. 

I never said Singularity will happen, or I indeed will live to see it. 
There will be saturation (almost certainly). There will be Butler's Jihad,
probably.  I may die, and be not suspended. Maybe suspension does not
work.  Maybe drextech does not work. Maybe the Singularity will kill us.
Maybe, maybe, maybe. We'll live, and see. Then maybe we don't.

The important point is: that we are alive. That these are the most
exciting times so far in human history, which is not lessened by the fact
that many generations could have claimed that. This is what matters.

People could use simple games theory as an excuse for doing good things
for each other. No god is nessecary for that. It can be scientifically
proven that helping out pays of in the long run.

The claim that a god exists has as much scientific proof as the claims
that there exists Dragons, unicorns, witches, magicians, sireens etc.
That a lot of people believes something, and has been believing it for a
long time, doesn't make it the truth.

Why do those of us that doesn't believe in a gods existence, have to
prove that he doesn't exsist? The evidence is such that a case held in
any western court would rule that god doesn't exist.

People who makes a claim holds the burden of proof.  Why doesn't this
work for religion, only for everything else?

It's interesting what you read in my post. The word "government" doesn't even
appear there. 

I am NOT appalled by what governements do, because governments in most states
are just a tool
of big enterprises and investment banks which helps them to extract money from
the population. I am not
appalled by what a gun does but by what its owner does with it.

Who sells the weapons? The government? Who earns money when a war has started?
The government? Who profits
from a tax policy which burdens the majority and favours the minority? The
minority, of course. Which is 
not the government.

In Germany, a politician from the Social Democratic Party recently suggested
to raise a minimum tax for
millionaires. Of course this half-hearted proposal will never be realized. But
it showed that millionaires and
the big industry which bores them do not have to pay a single D-Mark if their
tax advisors are good enough. 
Even the thousands of students who protest against the low funds flowing into
education now use the 
slogan "Tax millionaires". Futile, of course.

John Clark, one of the more intelligent free market advisors, would answer:
"If you remove governments, all this 
corruption will disappear and the free market will bring up only efficient
companies." The problem is that by
removing government, you only remove a cover under which the true power elite
hides. The power structures remain -
and before you can say "Jebediah", your country will be ruled directly by big
enterprises. The reason why governments
are needed today is that they make major repressions unnecessary. The larger
the privatization and direct influence of big
enterprises is, the more repression is needed to justify it.

Luddism is a perfectly understandable reaction in capitalism. Because in a
capitalist society, progress in production efficiency
will often hurt the population. The more efficient you are, the less workers
you need. More unemployment. 4,5 million registered 
in Germany today, and rising. America circumvents this by having the whole
family at work day & night and counting the jobs, not 
the people. I do not justify luddism and I am not a Luddite, but as I said,
it's understandable.

About military: Why do you think we have it? Because some bums in the
government think we need it to defend our country? 

Most extropians despise governments, but at the same time, they are the
perfect democrats. Because they really believe that
democracy works the way it is intended to work - they just think that this way
is not right.

Ever heard about the NSA? That's not a product of the free market, but it's a
structure needed in all governments (and the
free market is just a new form of dictatorship).

The prison state is a prison market. I was talking about privatized prisons. 

The perfect solution would be a truly anarcho-socialist society, but we won't
get it. So we have to take care that what governments
and especially the people behind them do doesn't hurt us.

The Nation.1 website is at www.nation1.net, they have several mailing
lists for discussing what should go into this new country.  I've
signed up to see just what kind of ideas these kids will come up with.
 I would love to see a virtual nation represented in the UN, perhaps
it would make it easier for other countries to deal with the Internet
if they can look at it like another nation.  But as i've said before,
I think the whole internet community could benefit from this kind of
representation, not just kids.

It's not a question of belief. It might soon be reality.

I generally think debates on God or religion can go nowhere -- at least when
they are between atheists and theists.  However, despite my gut feeling not
to add to this debate, here goes...:)

I disagree.  I think to have a belief in something, one must have a reason
for that belief. Absent a reason, then the belief is unjustified or unverified.
So, if there is no data -- a claim a disagree with; the universe is here, that
is data enough for atheists to claim "This is what is." -- there is no reason
for a belief in God.  Thus, theists must offer some other argument or come
up with data.

Nor do I. The concept of God a) in the christian meme primarily represents
eternal, unconditional love, except in those sub-sects that focus on the fire
and brimstone, which just shows that they don't get it, and b) can mean
whatever the individual wants it to mean, whether its a head of lettuce, the
laws of nature, or a being so grand that it cannot even exist in or influence
this universe, and c) in the eastern meme represents acceptance of being.
There are memes out there that play on the primary God meme, but are only
into dominance games. I would suggest that Mr. Estacado has some issues with
a control freak meme,

Beleive what? That  a person should have to demonstrate a minimum fiscal
capacity before being allowed to reproduce? While one could say this is an
unreasonable imposition on the individuals rights to procreate, I say that
my being forced by government, society, and my own concience, to support the
abandoned products of irresponsible reproduction is an unreasonable
impostion on my privacy, my personal productivity, and my rights to enjoy
the fruits of that productivity. My being forced to pay for not only the
irresponsible reproduction, but to pay an incompetent government bureaucracy
to raise these children in such a negligent manner is also being forced to
be an accessory to child neglect and abuse, while my own ability to properly
support and demonstrate a fiscal ability to properly raise my own offspring
is infringed upon. Pick someone elses pocket, buddy!!

But then you have your leftist tree hugging ecofreaks who a) look at technological
progress as the death of the environment, and b) look with distain on an increased
ability of people to reproduce, since they all are still owned by the malthusian
meme, and c) look at the idea of cloning as being a threat to individual rights.

Or rather, our perceptions of it. I think that the common perceptions about the
meaning of these two words, which were once positive, now have a negative
semantic value precisely because of luddite memes in our culture. I just read
Wired 6.01. Great photo section.

"Change is good"

"Optimism is a strategy for making a better future. Because unless you beleive
that the future can be better, it's unlikely you will step up and take
responsibility for making it so."

"If you assume that there is no hope, you guarrantee that there will be no
hope."

"If you assume that there is an instinct for freedom, there are opportunites to
change things, there's a chance you may contribute to making a better world."

"The choice is yours"     - Noam Chomsky

How do we start spreading memes? The easiest way is thus: wear t-shirts &
baseball caps, and put bumperstickers on your car, as well as posters on your
walls at home and in your office/cubicle at work that all have pictures and
simple phrases that are catchy. I am always wearing my PETA baseball hat, (PETA
in my case stands for :"People Eating Tasty Animals") and I get lots of
feedback from people. Take out ads in WIRED and other mags with our messages on
them (yeah that can get pricey).

When are Exi t-shirts with "CHANGE IS GOOD" on them going to be available?

Little things like this can go a long way in the social engineering department.

One reason for believing in the existence of God is the fact that the
universe appears to be narrowly tailored for the existence of our kind
of life.  Take a look at figure 5 on http://www.sns.ias.edu/~max/toe.html
and you see what a tiny fraction of the possible values for physical
constants would allow life as we know it to exist.  One way to explain
this seeming coincidence is to say that our universe was intentionally
created to have parameters in this region.

Note that this does not explain where the universe creator came from.
It is possible that the universe in which he lives is fundamentally
different from our own in ways we can't currently imagine, and is such
that life can exist automatically.  He then created our universe to
explore the possibility of how our kind of life would work, which is
only possible within this narrow and special range (an advanced version
of the way we play with different rules for cellular automata, and find
that only a limited set of rules lead to interesting behavior).

Of course there are alternate explanations for this coincidence.  It
may be that all possible universes exist, and only those for which the
constants are such as to allow the formation of life do have life form.
But that is not a much simpler theory than the one which says that
we were formed out of another universe; both require the existence of
universes that we otherwise have no evidence for.

Will T-shirts and baseball caps really change society?  I'm not sure these
are as useful as you think.

I don't understand this message.  It sounds like a humorous T-shirt, but

Yes, but how many Christians love gays, Moslems, atheists, cloners,
abortionists, contraceptive users, prostitutes, punk rockers, polygamists,
etc?  Ninety-nine percent of those who preach love actually practice hate.
In reality, I know of no major Christian denomination that really practices
unconditional love.

Whoops, I stand corrected!  I don't know how I missed this, but yes there
is a major movement on the Left, through Environmentalism et. al., to fight
against technology.  Now I see why "Religious Right" and "Luddite Left" fit
together so well.  As with most things, the Truth(TM) is somewhere
inbetween.

I agree.  My prediction for clones is that Dolly and other current clones
will succumb to rapid aging and die of old age at roughly the same time as
their parent.  DNA has telomeres on the end of them that act as null-genes.
The ends of the DNA get lost through copying.   More and more of the
telomeres are lost through repeated copying, until finally real genetic
information gets lost.  I think this is the cause of old age and cancer.  A
clone's DNA copy that comes from an adult animal starts off with a reduced
telomere set.  It is already advanced toward the genetic loss that I think
causes old age.  Thus, a cloned cell has the same number of replications
left as did the original cell.  No increase of lifespan is imparted to the
clone with current technology.

Yes.  Accept the God hypothesis and random, senseless suffering is
a problem. Accept the Darwinian hypothesis and random, senseless
suffering is exactly what you would expect from a Darwinian world, as
Richard Dawkins said somewhere.

A lack of tolerance is different from hate. They do have this saying "love the
sinner but hate the sin". I disagree that the denominations/memes themselves
practices hate, but that such memes are vulnerable to infection from xenophobic
instincts and memes.

Really? Think about all of the really resonant messages out there, like "Visualize
World Peace" (and was satirized by "Visualize Whirled Peas").  Bumper stickers are
actually very good meme spreaders, since people's memory is reinforced when the
person has a high adrenaline level, and when the average person is driving, they
have elevated adrenaline levels, especially in traffic jams, you have a high
adrenaline, capitve audience with nothing to do but look at the message on the
bumper of your car.

Or when you are at the beach, and some sexy girl/woman has a t-shirt on with a
message, you are gonna be reading that message, even subliminally, while in a
turned on state of mind. Its all a matter of advertizing psychology.

The message is that by satirizing the PETA name (WHich stands for, if you are
living in a hole, "People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals") in such a contrary
manner, I am a) showing total contempt for the real PETA group's message, and b) in
entertaining people with this satire, I am planting a counter-PETA meme that
celebrates the carnivorous lifestyle, and humanity's position as the top predator
on this planet.

Think about beer commercials, for example. Just because they put these things on TV
that place lots of sexy women in close and enjoyable proximity to Brand X, you get
millions of guys out there going to bars to drink really bad beer, and thinking
that they are a) enjoying themselves, and b) going to get laid.

Most of us think we are above such crap, but we are fooling ourselves. Unless we
are living the lifestyle of Ted Kazynski, we are all the prey of advertizing every
day. We all buy brand names at least a few times more often than we would have
without that subliminal implanting. We need to recognize this, and use it to our
advantage.

Eradicate? How? (Sieg Hiel!)

Attempts to eradicate the God meme would only help it
spread and proliferate. Even if you could eradicate
it, children would re-invent it. Are you proposing
mind-control?

We will just have to learn to coexist with it.
Lighten up.

I'm sorry if you have been personally injured by
people inspired by some form of the God meme. I feel
your pain. Does that help?

Its also a matter of saturation. If only a few ordinary people are wearing such
advertising, then little is affected. BUt if we, say, get a major celebrity or two
to be seen on mass media wearing such a message, then a)people will start getting
extropically infected, and b) will want to wear similar messages on their clothing,
which will spread the meme even further.

   I think you will find that if you rigorously define "God" and "everything"
then "God is everything" is a huge contradiction--you might as well have

   Exactly. And if you adhere to this "meme"(in quotes because it is a highly
speculative theory) than you are ripe for another destructive authority
called government. They will take an average in total taxes of 70% of
your earnings(70% of your life energy), their regulations will hold back
health technology, and, if you are over the age of 40 you will probably
die because of this. Pretty "unExtropic" if you ask me.

If you read _Mein Kampf_ you'll see that Hitler's entire philosophy as

Correct, but that's why we want to use nanotech. You need "a lot"
of high-quality energy because today's Fusion techologies are
large. With nanotech, we may we able to get tne required energy
density in a smaller space, meaning that we'll need less high-quality
energy.

I personally believe that the weight of evidence favors high temperature
as the source of the SL glow, and that the phenomenon we see on the 
lab bench, using equipment you can build at home, is in fact within
a factor ot 4 of the (temp x density) needed for D-T fusion. However,
The SBSL bubble must be maintained in the middle of a flask of water,
and
if the water temperature is much above freezing the phenomenon
disappears. So, even if you can get fusion in the bubble, how do you
propose to extract useful energy?

The strength of the bulk material should suffice. The point of the
shells
is to permit us to build a machine inside the resulting big diamond and
to build machinery throughout the whole structure to perform the power

John Clark pointed out that I had made a mistake: D-D fusion also emits
neutrons. I should have checked references instead of relying on a
clearly faulty memory. I'm certain that I recall a higher-temp
neutronless
fusion reaction: H-H perhaps?

Not sure on this. At extreme pressure, various phase changes occur,
yielding crystals witb different properties. Why not build the innermost
portions of the device from these? I can think of several serious
objections, the most obvious being that a machine whose structures
are only stable at extreme pressure must operate in a liquid or a gas,
and nanotech is usually envisioned as working in a vacuum. In any event
I'm not sure where diamondoid becomes unusable on the temp/pressure
plane. Does someone have a reference? Remember: the diamondiod is
used to bring the static environmental pressure up, the actual
fusion pressure is generated dynamically as an increment on the
static pressure, so the diamondoid doesn't need to maintain
the full fusion pressure.

I realize I'm doing major hand-waving here, but so are you. I haven't a
clue as to the amount of waste generated per KW of fusion energy, or of
how much of the waste will need accelerator treatment.

Even worse is the efficieny of the waste recapture system, which will
require continuous rebuilding of the entire structure by our busy little
nanites.

Accelerators work today. Macro-scale machinery is capable of bashing
atoms.
What I'm going for here is the ability to increase the efficieny of
macro-scale machinery by taking advantage of nanotech's atomic-scale
precision. There is no requirement for nuclear-scale precision. If
I could get nuclear-scale precision, I'd simply build a perfect
proton-proton fuser and dispense with the rest of this.

No, I expect a large amount of messy garbage which will have to be
recycled thru the fast-nuetron deactivatin section, but the net
effect will be a reduction in heavy radioisotopes on each pass,
bringing the remaining load to effectively zero.

It's exactly reactions like this one I expected. That happens when a free

do it.
Those so-called poor people just don't try hard enough.

Well, you should be careful about eight-bit character codes. They do
not transmit well on the net, and can be displayed in the most amazing
ways on different computers. The above smiley seems to be a smiling
face with '10' written on the forehead (an upload smiley?).

One might hope for Unicode to solve the problems, but I doubt it.

This was fairly good, the character becomes a thick stroke, like a big

I think there is a more important memetic niche to be filled: personal
comfort. Here in Sweden most people do not believe in the Christian
God - but they believe in what they usually call "something". This
"something" seems to have the role of personal comfort, giving life a
meaning, somebody to pray to and hope will provide some kind of
afterlife. Most people (unfortunately IMHO) do not care about the
indescribable absolute underlying all reality (IAUAL) - it is so remote and
transcendent, and they want something to comfort them when life turns
rotten.

Personally I prefer the IAUAL, even if I doubt the 'I' part. But I
doubt it would be an intelligent being, consciousness or even some
platonic abstraction like Truth - it is likely something utterly
non-comforting, like a Hilbert space.

> Why then do some people still react
> so emotionally when the mere subject comes up? 

Good question. I have noted it myself that I get a bit irritated by
religion, and I don't like to have reactions I cannot trace (I want a
source-level debugger for my mind! :-). I think it is because it deals
with the major questions, those questions which every human *has to*
face (even if to hide from them) like what to consider the meaning of
life, how to deal with the world, how to find meaning. They provide
the motivational core of one's worldview, and questioning them sends
distress signals directly to the autonomous levels. Most of us have
not yet learned to become sufficiently relaxed and self-efficaous to
be able to disconnect this defense system and deal with it on a
rational level (it is hard, and has to be done with every core
belief. How many of us can really react rationally to critics?).

Note that this doesn't mean there is anything inherently wrong about
getting revved up about attacks on your belief system - sometimes that
anger is a great asset in defending it (I often notice I have a far
too rational and relaxed attitude in many questions where I ought to
get passionate instead in order to bring about the changes I
seek). The problem is that if we just have knee-jerk reactions, we
will never get anywhere. We need to refine our emotions and bring our
belief systems under control.

The theory that telomeres are the clock that tells a cell when to age and die 
may have some truth in it, but the idea has not aged very well in the last few 
months. However it doesn't really matter because whatever the aging clock is 
cloning must have reset it, at least to some degree. Dolly came from an adult 
cell and in the normal course of events this cell would only be able to 
reproduce a few more times, but Dolly must have exceeded this limit many 
times over, and done it when she and was still growing in the womb with her 
cells reproducing at a frantic rate. 

She looks perfectly healthy but we won't know for sure if the clock was fully 
reset until we watch her for several more years and see how she ages. It will 
also be interesting to observe her offspring. My bet is that she is normal 
in every way, time will tell.

Too bad for Tipler (although all hope may not be lost for him, there
might be ways to close off parts of the universe and the results might
be wrong). Maybe it is time to start dusting off Dyson's model and
bring it up to date? Reversible computing will likely be very
important.

Once or twice was fine, but these endless "neo-tech" plugs are getting
*very old*.

Most of the people on this list have the intellectual savvy necessary to
evaluate neo-tech for themselves, without your mindless advertisng (i.e. if
it is as great as you think it is, then we will find out for ourselves,
thank you very much).

Enough is enough.

When people talk about things like "the indescribable absolute 
underlying all reality" they are talking nonsense. (If I'm wrong, please 
explain a statement like that to me.) That's why some of us get a bit 
hot under the collar whenever the "god meme" comes up as this is 
supposed to be a board for intelligent discussion.

	YES!

	They all claim it's "God's plan of salvation" but it's not
salvation at all!  It's damnation.  Let's stop justifying and
accepting "pain,suffering, and death" and starting hopping, and
striving as if, it can all be completely overcome.

David A Musick <davidmusick@juno.com>  continued:

> I don't understand why "God" equals pain, suffering and death.
> Please explain.

	Because, to me, if there was really a good God, he should help
us in our effort to irradicate "pain, suffering, and death".  Since
there is apparently no being doing much about this, to me, God must
then equal pain,suffering, death..."  If you believe in God, then you
are forced to theodicize and justify such evil.  It is much more
moral, to me, to try to overcome than to try to justify.

Rick Rossi <RickR@net-effect.com> commented:

	I, an atheist, admit that I don't know for sure.  It is only a
hypothesis that there is no God.  But, I do have a hope that there is
no God.  Many theists also think that they merely have a hope that
there is a God and similarly admit that they don't know for sure.  The
mistake is in the fact that God=pain, suffering, death..., therefore
it cannot, by definition, be a hope that there is a God, but can only
be giving up in despair that the more damnable hypothesis is the one
that is really true.

Michael Lorrey <retroman@together.net> continued:

	To me this is a lie, since we experience pain, suffering,
death...  Unless you try do something like theodicize by defining
"unconditional love" to be when someone causes or allows "pain,
suffering, death..." to those they unconditionally love.  To me the
fruits are obvious since I know of no real christian sect that
preaches of any kind of "unconditional love".  I prefer to hope that
"unconditional love" is something much better than this.

I agree. It would also be interesting to clone Dolly herself, and then
clone the clone of Dolly, and so on. I'm curious how many times the
cloning cycle can be repeated before some form of degeneration sets in (if
at all).

Since the Universe, by definition, includes everything there is, there 
cannot logically be any "thing" else to explain it. The Universe is the

Justification is relative; unverified depends on whether the method of

I guess.

There is no data for any discussion on the existence of god.  At least not
now and as far as I know.  Data that would or could be verified using the
scientific method, that is.

  Why don't they prohibit alcohol and promote GHB then...  The still better
effects of GHB, IMO, are that next morning you feel more energetic
(due to extra GH secretion) and more optimistic (dopamin release) - the
"positive ideation" together with energy allows you to do more and better.
The effect may last for a day, though, so you'd have to take GHB regularly
to sustain it (not such a bad idea[?]).  Fortunately, the *memory* of the effect
lasts much longer.  If you have various experiences of what your personality
features might be, you start liking some of them, and even identifying with
them - and that's a long-term effect.

Don't know what Ritalin does...

  There seem to be many other chemicals that enhance various personality
traits.  Steroids make one more aggressive; psychedelics give appreciation
of sensory perception and artistic skills; Ecstasy dwarfs GHB's empathic
effects, heightens one's feeling of touch, and the next day inhibits your
respect to both internal and social restrictions - good acting-out aid to
a beginning libertarian ;-)  And so on.
Many of these things are risky for health though, or have other side-effects
(such as decreasing cognitive functions).
  Risks have always accompanied exploration.  In this case though, most
of the population tries to attain effects I personally don't value - like building
gigantic muscles or getting stoned at any cost to health and brain function;
the information about use of any combinations of substances for personal
growth is scarce and unreliable.    I assume that mild doses of steroids
may increase one's strength of character and be worth the side effects for
at least some people;  you can find suggestions to supplement mescalin
with DMAE to get the perceptual effects without the loss of cognitive function,
etc.  Some of these things may have only positive effects; others are worth
the mild side-effects, at least for some people; most substances and their
combinations should be avoided by everybody.
  I do not really want to conduct experiments on myself - but I thought
somebody on the list could know something...

    What theory are atheists rejecting?  The statement "God exists" is a 
null theory. What does it tell us? What can it predict? How can it even 
be inconsistent or compared to experimental evidence, when it tells us 
nothing? At least Christianity goes past "God exists" to describe further 
implications, as inconsistent and disagreeable as those implications might 
be. There's no use in entertaining a theory unless it has some describable 
effect. You are right, atheists cannot prove there are no gods, but the 
**burden of proof is not theirs**. I doubt you would complain anywhere near 
as much when I say that there is no small band playing in my radio. It is 
certainly *possible*, within the laws of physics, that hitherto-unknown small 
people of Earth occupy my radio, and are now playing a stunning variety of 
modern music, but it is so unlikely that I feel entirely rational when I say 
that it is not occurring... but that's just a closed-minded atheist talking.

    Do a websearch for "James Randi" or "Occam's Razor" sometime.

It already happened.  You sell bits and pieces of yourself on the market
all the time, in exchange for money which you can use to buy bits and
pieces of other people.

Every human being has finite value.  I don't see how cloning would change
this at all.  Every free agent (cloned or otherwise) is fully capable of
modifying their net worth as a human being.

Example:
	
	Stephen Hawking is arguably worth more as a human being than Billy Bob
Redneck.

However, if Billy Bob Redneck left his trailer, went to college, and became
an expert on protein design, then I would have to re-evaluate the above
statement, since Billy Bob would have significantly increased his net value
as a human being.  Additionally, Billy Bob would likely enjoy the benefits
of his investment in his human worth, since human worth is often, but not
always, tangibly reflected.  That is to say, if Billy Bob inherited 10
million dollars, traded in his trailer for a mansion, but still sat in
front of the TV drinking beer all day, his human market value wouldn't have
changed a bit.

Which hypothesis is simpler, that the parameters of this universe are
random, or that they was chosen by an intelligent being? I think this
question can be formalized as "what is the shortest program that outputs
the parameters of this universe?"

Of course there are many such programs, but let's just consider two
categories corresponding to the two hypotheses. A program of the first
kind consists of the parameters stored as constants and a single Print
statement that outputs them. A program of the second kind involves the
evolution of an intelligent being which then does various computation to
figure out the optimal parameters for a universe to have our kind of life. 

If the shortest program is of the first kind, it would mean that the
parameters of this universe are essentially random and have no simpler
explanation. If the shortest program is of the second kind, then the
simplest explanation for the parameters being what they are is that they
were chosen by an intelligent being.

This discussion is quite amusing; akin to the sometimes-used creationist
argument for God that because the earth is at the very nice distance
from the sun which allows our type of life form, this was obviously by
design. The reason the argument is meaningless is because life is only
going to develop under conditions which enable this development. Now our
type of life, naturally, has evolved to be best suited to our proximity
to the sun. This reasoning can be extended to the universal constants:
of course they appear to us to be finely tuned - because we evolved
under their influence. Just because we find it hard to comprehend forms
of life which might exist under alternate conditions does not mean that
this is not so. But of course, this is moot, because even if our
conditions _are_ the only ones that allow life, of course the life which
does develop is going to do so under these conditions. If they were not
- we would not be here to ponder the question. Am I making sense? Is
this reasoning valid?

This is a very promising approach but I would look at it a bit differently.

First, it seems that there are really two questions here.  The first is
why the parameters of the universe are what we observe.  Theoretically
we can measure the actual values of the parameters to extremely high
(arbitrary?) precision as technology advances.  Hence the information
content in these parameters may turn out to be very high.

The second question is why these parameters happened to fall into the
range that would allow the formation of life.  This is a narrow range
but still it will have less information content then the actual parameters
which are somewhere within that range.

These two questions seem to be largely independent, and the second is
what I was trying to address.

I think what you need to do is to come up with different theories that
predict the creation of the universe in a form which can allow life.
Then you can compare the information content of the theories to see which
is simplest.  But "the parameters of the single universe are chosen
randomly" is not a valid contending theory because it does not predict
the existence of life with any significant probability.

I'm not sure how to take into account the fact that different models
may allow for the creation of life only with some probability.  My
preference would be to consider models in which the creation of life
is a certainty.  Then you are comparing apples to apples when you count
the size of the theory.

Two possible theories, as I mentioned, are first that you create all
possible universes with all different variations on the parameters
we observe.  This is probably a pretty simple theory.  The other is
that you create some kind of primordial universe, maybe very different
in nature from our own, possibly mathematical in form, but such that
intelligent life can evolve.  Then that intelligent life will naturally
create simulations or baby universes which explore all different kinds
of physics, including structured ones like ours with matter, space,
distance, time, dimensions, etc., concepts which may be absent from their
own universe.  Conceivably this could also be an extremely simple theory.
We really don't know nearly enough at this point to know what theory is
going to be the simplest.

There is a terminology problem here.  Sometimes we use the term
"universe" to refer not to everything there is, but rather to the full
four-dimensional space-time structure we see around us.  Using this
terminology there could be other universes, and in fact we read about
"baby universes", "basement universes", etc.  Sometimes people then use
terms like "multiverse" or "omniverse" or other coinages to refer to
the collection of all the universes.

If you want to reserve "universe" to mean all that there is, then you
need to suggest a word for the four-dimensional space-time where we live.

perhaps, but who's to say that life cant exist within other parameters?

David notes:
< since I am someone with Bipoar Disorder
(manic-depression), I occasionally go into a
hypomanic state of mind.  In a hypomanic state of
mind, I feel much more curious, sociable, assertive,
have much more confidence and willpower and have a
quicker, more intelligent and creative mind.  The
hypomanic state is common for people with Bipolar

I recall when you disappeared from the list after
suddenly falling into a condition of despair.  I
hope, with your expertise in mental disciplines, you
now have this under control.

The most common, if illegal, nootropic of choice
seems capable of inducing mild (in most cases)
versions of this condition.  For some people, I think
the resulting imbalance can manifest as anxiety or
even aggressiveness instead of depression.

Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibition (SSRI)
definitely is involved here.  SSRI substances are
normally recommended only for people suffering from
clinical depression; however, there seems to be some
evidence that they may be helpful, as well, for the
other conditions mentioned above.

Some data suggest that for someone used to regular,
though not excessive, consumption of alcohol and/or
other common psycho-active stimulants, SSRIs can
significantly reduce the craving for these and assist
in creating a stable condition of mild 'hypomania' (a
sense of curiosity, calm and enhanced awareness of
patterns).

The most well-known SSRI is Prozac, which has some
nasty side effects.  However, I have found that the
herbal extract of Hypericum (St. John's Wort -
available wherever they sell a variety of herbal
extracts) IS absolutely amazing in this context -
much more reliable than, say, piracetam.

BTW, http://dog.net.uk/claude/ghb-1.html provides
some interesting history on GHB and why U.S.
pharmaceutical companies supposedly had no interest
in seeing it promoted in the U.S.  A Net search on
GHB will turn up the story of how it was 'outlawed'
in the U.S. back in the 80s by some biased FDA
reports (if I remember correctly).

Um, and?  I agree with you, but what has this to do with
whether humans are seen as products to be bought and

I would recommend carnitine (levocarnitine/ l-carnitine) for a safe 
and effective increase in assertiveness/agression. As a bonus it makes 
your muscles firm without any exercise. Good to gain some (muscle) 
weight too. Also, to those who can safely obtain it, I would recommend
the use of cannabis. It can be a very effective anti-depressant, and it
enhances all your senses, often for days and probably even permanently,
to some extend. When you're properly high, you also tend to get very
creative, and it is a great aphrodisiac. It can even help to stop an
upcoming case of the flu (by somehow boosting the immune system).
All in all a very transhuman substance, methinks!

Human cloning bans gather steam in U.S. states

CHICAGO (Reuters) - A plan to clone humans has boosted moves
in several states to outlaw the procedure, including in
Illinois, home of the scientist who made the proposal earlier
this week.

A spokesman for Robert Churchill, a Republican state
representative from Antioch, Illinois, said Friday proposed
legislation to make human cloning a felony was gaining support
and Churchill would seek to make it a priority when the state's
General Assembly meets later this year.

If the proposal became law convicted violators could face six
years in prison.

Similar efforts or proposals have surfaced in Ohio, Wisconsin and
Connecticut. In addition President Clinton has called for a
five-year federal moratorium on human cloning and Congress may
also take up the issue.

Richard Seed, a physicist who lives in the Chicago area, stirred
up renewed debate on the question this week by saying he was
ready to clone a human and could do so within 18 months if he
raised enough money.

Seed has said that he would move his operation to Mexico or
the Caribbean if anti-cloning laws are passed.

But it's looking like another miis-placed rendevous
what are the Luddite left ? and what can it do to help
Dr. Seed in any way ?

Perhaps if one wanted to advance cloning technologies in the US
one could start with some other animal like primates ...

This 'God' meme will survive , will it thrive and prosper
given enough time or even become a 'pillar' if one gives in
to a 'God is Love' extention ....
If one were to keep the progress of transhumanism / Posthumanism
advancing on the straight and narrow and not have it terminated
tragically or unnecessarily , one has to have non-destructive
elements and relationship re-generation memes , imho

That's reality.  Welcome to the real world, Erik! :)
Seriously, there are only three ways to live.  Either one produces,
is on charity, or steals.  There are no other ways, but I have
absolutely no problem with the first two (and what's more, I
really don't think Michael does either).

Actually, most 'poor people' are poor *because* of government
interference.  Some may not care enough to work for a living,
but I think they're in the minority (or would be if institutionalized
theft didn't support them), and it is their right to choose to not
produce anything.  It is *not* their right to force me, Michael, and
you to support them.

One of my favorite mystics, Anthony de Mello, SJ, once wrote:

	"Is there a God?" asked the Marxist.

	"Certainly not the kind people are thinking of," said the Master.

	"Whom are you referring to when you speak of people?"

	"Everyone."

Was he talking about extropians?  All this talk about God is certainly
interesting.  Unfortunately, I will probably have to wait until:
	a. Death
	b. When Elvis returns
	c. The rapture
	d. The second coming
	e. That newly created AI in the year 2030.
	f. The singularity in the year 2075

to find out if I am delusional or not. In the meantime..

Why not add new telomeres?  People already make artificial chromosomes
(YACs) with
telomeres.

Considering the explosion of mitotic activiy during embryonic
developement, I'd think the lifespan would decrese (unless new telomeres
were inserted as I sugested), if telomeres were the only factor.  How's
Dolly's health?

Maybe I just don't pay enough attention to other people's messages.  You

I recognized PETA, and understood your contempt for that group.  I don't
see how this helps bring about the future by spreading Extropian memes.  It
may be my interpretation.  I don't subscribe to the logic that says
ridiculing your opponent will make them look bad, or if they look bad you
must look good.  This probably works for much of the population, but since
the logic is faulty, I would hate to try to spread reasonable memes with
such unreasonable logic.

Thanks for giving me much to think about.  A lot of my posts lately have
been in response to yours.

A better method for advertising a web page is to put it in your signature.
That way, every time you post, people will see the suggestedion to "see
<webpage...>", but they won't feel that your post was made as an
advertisement.  Just a suggested compromise...

No, actually the anthropic principle is false.  Certain physical parameters
just are.  We exist because of them, not vice versa.  And if the universe
had been different, perhaps some other conscious life forms would
exist and argue the same arguments. But to argue this principle is like
saying the God exists because I deal a certain hand of cards and not
another.:)

  If I got one red cent from your investigation of Neo-Tech I suppose
you could call it a plug. However, I don't. When I mention Neo-Tech
it is usually because it is very pertinent to the debate at hand.
Neo-Tech is a very large body of thought completely different to
what most of you have been exposed to in the past. Therefore it is
easier for me to reference it than to explain it.
   As I see it, Neo-Tech could be the plutonium in the engine of
Extropian goals(nanotechnology, biological immortality, etc.) but
if it bothers you that much I suppose that I will keep it to myself.

I used Prozac for 2 years and stopped mostly due to its negative effects
on my sexual performance. Recently I discovered a herbal tincture called
Phyto-Proz (has sj wort and other things), works great, I use about 1/3
the dose suggested on the bottle.

   IAN: Tag-team tyranny. 

   With a
   Luddite Left Wing & a
   Religious Right Wing
   The Vulture of Doom
   Castes its shadow 
   Of darkness upon 
   The future of 
   All People.

   Down it swoops 
   To feast upon the 
   Rotting carcass of 
   Fear of the unknown, 
   Fear of the new, fear 
   Of change and also upon 
   The slowly dying dreams 
   Of all those bold yet 
   Poor souls who fall 
   Under its shadow 
   Of darkness.

   Resist this beast 
   Lest you become 
   Its next feast.

The catch is that with very minor variations in these physical 
constants it wouldn't be "life" that is impossible, but some more 
basic phenomena.

Such as the periodic table.

Increase the nuclear forces a bit in relation to the electromagnetic 
force, and relatively small stars rapidly convert from hydrogen 
clouds to neutronium.  Neutronium stars tend not to go nova and 
distribute heavy elements.

Decrease them a bit, and stars don't light -- so fusion doesn't 
happen -- so heavy elements don't get distributed.

A "periodic table" that consists of hydrogen, or hydrogen and 
neutronium, doesn't deserve to be called a periodic table.  And life 
would be pretty difficult to achieve in such a universe.

The balance between the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear 
force is pretty critical too.

Just take a look at Jeremy Rifkin's work for a fine example of left 
Luddism that would soon see us surpassed in technology by the Amish.

(And probably in population as well.) 

I remember, when cold fusion was hot news, reading a long article in 
the local paper explaining why Mr. Rifkin thought it would be 
horrible.

A major reason (as represented in that article): it would allow us to 
strip-mine so much more land for coal.

Think about that for a while.  See how many different ways the 
argument is simply ludicrous.

Quite possible.  I made no claims regarding rigor; I plead innocent
only to infinite regress.

In this case, the atheists -- as distinct from the agnostics -- are 
at least as unjustified as the theists.

(A theist might -- as I have -- experience an extremely real but 
entirely personal manifestation of a deity which would make 
non-belief irrational for THAT PERSON, without providing any 
externally verifiable evidence they could reasonably expect anyone 
else to accept.   I cannot imagine a similarly compelling personal 
manifestation of the non-existence of any deity.  Thus, some specific 
theists might be more justified than any atheist.  However, I also am 
reasonably sure that the large majority of theists have had no such 
personal experience.)

That must be the greatest understatement of all time because I don't think 
the human mind is able to conceive of a more difficult question.  
I have about as much chance of correctly answering that as pigs have of 
flying, so I will focus on a much simpler, though still very difficult  
question. What general form would the answer have to be in for it to be 
satisfactory?  Clearly "the universe exists because it should" is not  
satisfactory because it implies the existence of ethical laws and existence  
is what we are trying to prove in the first place. The anthropomorphic answer  
that the universe must exist or we wouldn't be here to ask the question, 
is true but just begs the question, why are we here? Any answer in the form   
"the universe  exists because of X " will never satisfy us because it  
immediately suggests another very obvious unanswered question.

The only halfway adequate way to explain it is if it could be shown that  
"nothing" was somehow self contradictory so there must be "something".  
Needless to say I have no idea how to do this. Even in this case however it  
assumes the existence of logical laws, such as the law forbidding  
contradictions. Being logically self consistent doesn't prove a thing's  
existence (or does it?), so why does being self inconsistent prove it doesn't 
exist?  

I love logic, I think it's useful in solving all problems, except this one.  
I don't know if the question even makes sense. The first word of this question  
is "why" which means " what is the reason". Reason implies logic and logic is  
something. So we are asked to find a logical reason for reality, but clearly  
we can't use logic to find it, after all, that would  be illogical. This sort  
of thing could give circular reasoning a bad name because it's totally 
without meaning.  

Or is it? All the definitions in a dictionary are made of words, and those  
words also have definitions made of other words also in the dictionary, 
and round and round we go. Is a dictionary totally without meaning? 
I suppose that all depends on what meaning means, and what the meaning of
meaning means, and what the meaning of the meaning of meaning means, and...

Ok, now that I've made everything clear as a bell we can move on.

Um, minor objection: there is absolute proof that witches exist.

Of course, the witches don't claim that the common 
Christian-propaganda-against-nonChristian image of witches bears any 
relation to real witches; for that matter, not even many Christians 
make such a ridiculous claim.

(Although a lot of witches *do* have fun with that parody.)

Sorry, but you are quite mistaken on the latter claim.  

First, quite a few western courts are obligated by law to acknowledge 
the existence of some specific God; and quite a few others are 
legally bound against taking a position on the subject.

Second, I can't think of a sort of court case where a blanket 
judgement against the existence of any god would be appropriate.

> People who makes a claim holds the burden of proof.

Isn't "there is no god" a claim?

"I am not aware of any evidence of a god and I don't see any 
particular need for one" -- the agnostic position -- is merely an 
observation.  But it does NOT assert that there is no god.

>  Why doesn't this
> work for religion, only for everything else?

My opinion is that THOSE WHO WISH OTHERS TO ACCEPT A CLAIM bear a 
burden of proof.  That would include the evangelical theists, the 
evangelical atheists, and the evangelical agnostic (I have never 
encountered one of the latter - it seems a truly odd position to me). 
 But it would not include the non-evangelical theist or the 
non-evangelical atheist.

No, I wasn't thinking of that, because I have never before

My Goddess hasn't offered, or even mentioned, any "plan of salvation" 
in my hearing.  Or, for that matter, any need for salvation.

No.  Theists WHO WISH TO LOGICALLY CONVERT OTHERS must do this.

My reasons for believing in my Goddess are as real as my reasons for 
believing in the rock I stub my toe on.  However, they are 
*entirely* subjective and *mostly* internal, and I neither expect or 
desire anyone else to believe in any deity in response to *my* 
reasons.

Or, even neater, you follow Lee Smolin's reasoning: baby universes are a
side-consequence of black holes, the most numerous source of these parents
is a cosmos in which stellar black holes are freshly created during many,
many billions of years, a further incidental side consequence of which is
the creation of carbon in life-affirming quantities :) which is freely
scattered into the surrounding medium even as a new universe is pumped up.
The only problem I have with this, as I've said before, is that I don't
really see why the babies need to closely resemble the parents (although
Mitch once made some comments on this that I couldn't follow).

No, it's not.  You haven't addressed the max.toe diagram (or other similar
scholia) which certainly seem(s) to show that Hal's summary statement is
correct: *life as we know it* can't exist in most plausible universes.  God
is a blind alley in this discussion, or at least just one kind of (sheaf
of) possible explanation(s) for the life-cosy character of the universe.
Either we live in one of an indefinite number of variant universes, or this
one has been built with life in mind, or life is an unsurprising side
consequence of cosmogenesis.  Whatever is the case, it's a genuine puzzle.

I've made the following point in the past, but I'll say it again because it
seems to self-evident to me and so opaque to everyone else.  

What is the basis for this alleged contrary `something'/`nothing'?
Contraries, in syllogistic logic, are statements such as `All X are
green'/`All X are other-than-green'.  I know what `something' is - it's a
convenient empty lexical slot that we can use to park... well, *anything
particular* in.  Everything we see about us, everything we can conceive of,
is something.  To imagine a given something removed is actually to imagine
only its transformation into something else, or its physical or temporal
dislocation.  
There *is* *no* *`nothing'*.  

Vacuum fluctuations do not arise in `nothing', but in a quantum field.  The
paradox or deep problem of cosmogeny (given 20th century understanding of
physics) isn't the universe's appearance as `something' from `nothing', but
its failure to have reached `heat death' if it has existed in anything like
the current form since eternity (and while Eric Lerner makes a brave shot
at dealing with this I don't think he succeeds).  That's why some version
of the Big Bang is so neat, especially if it takes the form of repeated
buddings into new closed spacetimes.  In my HO.

Huh? Is there any evidence at all that Hypericum acts as a SSRI?
Remember, the SSRI family is very specific, and AFAIK not something
you are likely to find in nature.

Yes, but life (in some generalized meaning) could possibly exist in an
universe where there were no elements but instead (say) topological
defects in several weakly interacting fields with nonlinear properties
or something equally alien.

What is really relevant here is the question: what parameter-settings
allow complexity to grow to the level of living systems and possibly
beyond? A very hard and interesting question. Current work in
complexity *might* shed a little light upon if it arrives at some
general rules for the appearance of complex systems.

I remeber that Darwin did not explicitly consider the selftransformations
that inteligent individuals (not whole species) are able to perform... This
way, even (mainly) an immortal individual ( human... or better,
transhuman...!) may supply
selfmodificatons in such a way much quicker than permit the simple
Darwinian evolution parameters... I repeat >> artificial is a subset of the
natural, not a disjoint set...

There was a really good program on the Discovery Channel about this
whole subject. Some physicists are try to show that the reason life
exists is because the conditions which are conducive to life, are also
conducive to whatever cosmological processes create new universes. Since
it is though right now that new universes are created by the creation of
black holes in ours, and that ours must have sprung from a similar
singularity in another universe, whatever the cosmological parameters we
have now are in the range which are most likely to be produced by a
singularity in another universe, and are most likely to create as many
other similar universes from singularities in ours, as a sort of
darwinian probablistic natural selection on a multiversal scale. We are
a side effect.

There are now not only scientists trying to prove this theory, but also
some that are trying to disprove it.

I noticed this while driving a lot in Seattle. I'd get so ticked off at
the numbskull drivers that any bumperstickers or big advertizing I saw
just seemed to STICK in my mind, as did whatever songs I was listening
to on the radio. It has been found in medical studies that elevated
adrenaline levels increase memory retention.

Well, it wasn't meant as an example of spreading extropian memes, but an
example of meme spreading in general. Because it is unique, and funny to
the extreme for many people in this area who live a gun toting/hunting
lifestyle, I have gotten a LOT of feedback. People wanting to know where
to get one, etc.

You don't necessarily need to make an opposing view look BAD, per se,
which you would do with mud slinging type statements, which are rather
passe these days for most people, but to plant an impression in people
heads from the humor reinforcement so that every time they see a PETA
emblem now, instead of thinking about animal testing, or fur wearing,
they will think "People Eating Tasty ANimals". Every remembrance
reinforces the meme, and minimizes the influence of the animal rights
meme.

THis isn't politics, its advertizing as a means of innoculating people
against anti extropian memes.

I was reading an article last week that said that  Hypericum has SSRI
properties, but also does one or two other things that allow for a more
stable treatment, minimizing side effects. Most things in nature that
work typically aren't promoted by the medical establishment because they
can't patent them, and therefore make multi-millions off of them. FOr
example, ginger root is typically 2-3 times more effective as a
treatment for motion sickness than dramamine, but you never hear about
this from the drug companies, or from your conventional doctors. Ginger
is so ubiquitous that no one in the medical field can hope of making
apenny on recommending it for treatment of motion sickness.

Anthropic principle. From a (semi)infinite population of universes only
very few create (mostly, puzzled) observers. Homogenous, degenerate states
obviously do not make very good observers.

Let's assume that planck quantum foam-spawned universes are
mutation-catastrophe-subthreshold, and that generation of stable ones is
rare. Let's assume we can both boost (by many orders of magnitude) their
generation rate/shift their basic parameters by a) shifting the spectrum
of femtoscopic events into a high-energy scale (lots DIY deity particles
colliding)  b)  make them very special kind of events (special particles,
special energies, special everything). 

Let's say our universe is open (bummer), and that fabrication of new ones
connected with traversable wormholes are impossible here (what a botched
design!). Soon the cosmos is full with superaltruistic supercivs, which
can maximize the generation of optimal, or nearly-optimal universes. At
the cost of their reduced lifetime: Good Gardening is incompatible with a
long life. If the supercivs are not homogenous, this would seem to make
for lots of dilemmas. (Why, the idiot altruist next door senselessly
wastes his resources! [lots of incomprehensible activities] That one has
teached him.)

Would you do such a thing, making the metacosmos a (much) better place to
live, at _your_ costs? 

Gods'R'Us? Or Devils'R'Us?

I think such questions are meaningless in a fluctuating multiverse, for
they are rooted in beliefs of monkeys with an euclidian spacetime habitat. 
A pseudoproblem, like hen & egg precedence, or looking for edges in a
hypertoroidal spacetime.

As Moravec has argued, usurping God would require quite a collaboration on
his part. This may be different if our metalevel is sufficient high, and
not isolated as e.g. Ray's networked Tierra is. One hypothetical path to
Singularity is (spontaneous, or induced) complexity explosion of agents in
future network matrix. Maybe we _should_ be looking for a bug in the
metalevel (notice that many systems, as cellular automata, can be
implemented to be provably uncrashable). What's the particle physicist's
equivalent of crashme, and would it be a wise thing to try?

LeTourneau's freedom restricted 
===============================

mailto:nbar-new@seatimes.com  -- Nancy Bartley and Cheryl Harris

Seattle Times staff reporters


     She's traded the red jail coveralls worn by felons for street clothes 
     and her former cell at the Regional Justice Center for a residence on 
     a street of trim older homes near Seward Park.

     With her 180-day jail sentence over, Mary Kay LeTourneau is free, 
     but not without restrictions. She now begins  a court-ordered, 
     three-year treatment program and must live with the label "sex 
     offender."

     Yesterday, Seattle police assessed LeTourneau's "risk level," 
     according to state guidelines, and placed the former Highline 
     School District elementary-school teacher at Level 2, which means 
     she is considered  a moderate risk to reoffend.

     Level 3 offenders are determined to be the most dangerous and 
     require police to hold community meetings to alert the public. 
     Level 1 offenders don't require any neighborhood notification.

     Level 2 means police will distribute fliers with LeTourneau's 
     photo, crime information and her approximate address.

     "This is a sensational neighborhood," said resident David Myre, 
     73, who wasn't worried about his new neighbor.
     
     "I don't see any problem," Myre said of LeTourneau. "I hope she's 
     rehabilitated."  But, he said, it's also important that she 
     especially be kept away from children for now.


     But in a community with mom-and-pop stores and family 
     restaurants, where yellow school buses are as familiar sights as 
     the playgrounds that surround nearby neighborhoods, 38-year-old 
     Clay Borella understands why parents would worry about 
     LeTourneau's arrival.

     "If I had kids, I would feel pretty strong about it one way or 
     the other," he said. ". . . I feel she made a pretty big 
     mistake."

     That mistake swayed police to place her as a Level 2 offender.

     "What put her over the top (to a Level 2 status) was that she was 
     in a position of trust," said Detective Bob Shilling.


     Last August, LeTourneau pleaded guilty to raping a 13-year-old 
     former student, whom she had known since he was in her second-grade 
     class. King County Superior Court Judge Linda Lau sentenced her to 180 
     days in jail and gave her a 7 1/2-year suspended sentence.
     
     The sentence provisions included having no contact with the boy - 
     whose baby she gave birth to last May - and enrolling in 
     sex-offender treatment under the state Special Sex Offender 
     Sentencing Alternative (SSOSA) program.

     "SSOSA is an excellent program," said Dr. Gordon Arthur, director 
     of the sex-offenders treatment program at Twin Rivers 
     Correctional Center. "It serves the public very well. . . .  It 
     takes low-risk offenders and holds them responsible for their 
     behavior, while still ensuring they can still suport their families."

     There are 130 sex-offender treatment providers listed under 
     SSOSA, and LeTourneau will begin therapy with a psychologist.

     But, according to the provisions of the court order, LeTourneau's 
     therapy will be highly structured and every part of her life - 
     from her sex life to her work life, will be up for review by the 
     psychologist.

     [NOTE: Mary Kay had to agree to be quizzed with a polygraph on 
     every sexual experience she'd ever had, to 'qualify' for SSOSA. 
     She  also had to write a hundred-page essay on her childhood and 
     all her early experiences for the state-licenced 'private-sector' 
     treatment provider. -- TH].

     
     Under Lau's guidelines, LeTourneau is required to:

     --  Not date or have a relationship with anyone who has minor 
     children.

     --  Disclose her "sexual deviancy" to potential sex partners and 
     inform the psychologist of any plans for sexual activity.

     --  Bring her significant other to the treatment program's 
     therapy sessions.

     --  Not become pregnant again.

     --  Have no contact with the victim, or unsupervised contact with 
    her own four children by her estranged husband. She may have contact 
    with her baby.

     --  Bring in her "support system" to meet her therapist.

     --  Maintain employment or volunteer work and inform the 
     supervisor of her sexual-deviancy status.

     --  _Pay for the treatment herself_ and any related counseling.


     She also is required to take medication [Valproic Acid, which 
     directly attacks the frontal-lobe neural cascades which mediate 
     religious experience] and undergo therapy for a bipolar disorder, 
     which is a chemical condition of the brain that subjects its 
     sufferers to wild mood swings and erratic behavior.

     At the end of her three-year program, LeTourneau is to report 
     back to the court for a hearing. Then, for the rest of her life, 
     she'll have to report her address to police, Shilling said.
     
     
     She's not alone. While female sex offenders are less common than 
     men, of the 1,065 registered sex offenders in Seattle, 17 are 
     female.

Dragons exist -- and before you sneer, think of the amazement that greeted 
the discovery of the great dinosaur fossils, just a hundred or so years 
ago.  Flying reptiles exist -- though not firebreathing ones, except 
insofar as burning is one form of oxidation.  And see Carl Sagan, 'the 
Dragons of Eden.'  Dragons are  nearer than you think...

Unicorns exist -- if you doubt it, go rent  Ridley Scott's movie 'Legend' 
and see them right there, for yourself.  >:-}  Why, we have two damn great 
golden Unicorns atop our Local Governmnet offices right here in Bristol -- 
the Unicorn is a symbol of the City.  >:-}  Does anyone think that 
geneteically engineering 'new' Unicorns is any big deal, anyway?

Witches exist -- on almost any definition.

Magicians exist -- white ones and black ones.  And Classical Greek ones...  >:-} (See Murry Hope, 'Practical Greek Magic' -- see for yourself!).

Maxwell Knight, wartime chief of British Intelligence, recruited every 
white and black magician in the country into the WWII war effort.  Apart 
from 'advanced technology being indistinguishable from magic' (Arthur C. 
Clarke, a friend of my friend Stanley Kubrick -- they commune via fax) 
there is _overwhelming_ evidence that magic works. 'How' is another -- 
interesting -- matter.  I  will my finger to lift:  it lifts. A mystery.

                      ----------- * * * * * -----------

Here's a little example:

I have a 'Light Doodler' gadget from Chatsworth, California, a beautiful 
spinning YAGI aerial with microprocessor-controlled multicoloured LEDs set 
around a 4" dia. circular polycarbonate ring.  You can set the controls to 
configure beautiful shifting patterns on the surface of a described 4" 
sphere. It has a built-in microphone to enable it to give you a light-show 
in time with music.  Natasha, you'd love it!

I had this gadget set up atop my TV.  Behind the TV were the covers of 
Enya's first three -- magical -- albums -- 'Watermark'; 'Shepherd Moons'; 
and 'The Celts.'

The YAGI aerial was gently 'hunting' to and fro. I looked intently at the 
first album cover.  The YAGI instantly locked onto the first album cover, 
"Watermark.'  I thought: 'Interesting...' and then thought 'Let's see what 
happens if I direct my gaze to to the second album.'

I flicked my gaze  over, and the YAGI loop instantly pointed and locked 
directly onto Shepherd Moons.  "Hey, Ho", I thought, and flicked my gaze to 
'The Celts.' Instantly, the loop pointed and locked.  I carried on 
like this for ten minutes or so, until it got boring doing it.

This kinda thing happens all the time in my life.  When I was an atheist 
skeptic, it used to drive me damn near crazy.  >:-}  I actually preferred 
trying to think I _was_ crazy instead of simply accepting overwhelming 
empirical tested and corroborated evidence.  >:-}

                      ----------- * * * * * -----------

Another little example. Three times out of three tries I've done this.

Each time, I asked a kid (around 8 or 9) if they  knew about 'the Force' 
in 'STAR WARS.'

"Yes!" they said.

"OK", said I, "Let's see if the Force is strong in you. Pick up this pair 
of dice, close your eyes, and picture a pair of sixes."

"Yes" they said.

"OK: now throw a pair of sixes" sez I.

Each and every time, they threw a pair of sixes...

Easy-peasy...  >:-}



"Sireens" I'm not too sure about...  Isn't that what police cars have?

 [FX: "Wow! Will you just listen to that!" ]

_Sirens_ are women...  They often inhabit mountainous places, I understand.

I got interested, and did a medline search. Some abstracts included
below. It does not seem to be an SSRI, although it appears to be a a SRI.

True, although you shouldn't make too much of this. Volz article
(below) says that hypericum extracts are among the most widely
prescribed antidepressants in Germany, and the Nordenfors article was
published in the journal of the swedish medical association. It seems
to me that this is more of an american problem than an international
problem.

Even unpatentable drugs can be sold for profit, just look at the
health food stores and nutrient industry - certainly smaller than the
pharmaceutical industry, but earning good money anyway. 


Pharmacopsychiatry 1997 Sep;30 Suppl 2:72-76 

Controlled clinical trials of hypericum extracts in depressed
patients--an overview.

Volz HP

In Germany, hypericum extracts are among the most widely prescribed
antidepressants.  Additionally, many preparations of St. John's wort
are sold on the free market and one extract is even the best selling
antidepressant in the country. In contrast to synthetic
antidepressants, the approval procedures are not so strict, which
implies that the pharmaceutical industry is not forced to conduct
clinical trials suitable for licensing. Nevertheless, numerous studies
on hypericum extracts including depressed patients have been published
in the last 20 years. The purpose of this paper is to review these
investigations in respect of methodological considerations and to draw
conclusions pertaining to the proof of antidepressant efficacy. To
this effect, a computer-assisted literature research was performed and
manufacturers were asked to supply the author with study results. A
total of 12 placebo-controlled trials with hypericum extracts were
performed, mostly with positive results. Also in comparison with
synthetic antidepressants (3 studies published), a similar reduction
of depressive symptomatology was seen, although the comparators were
not adequately dosed. No trials in severely depressed patients have
been published yet. Since most studies on hypericum have
methodological flaws, further studies are warranted.

Abstract 
      OBJECTIVE--To investigate if extracts of Hypericum perforatum (St
      John's wort) are more effective than placebo in the treatment of
      depression, are as effective as standard antidepressive treatment, and
      have fewer side effects than standard antidepressant drugs.
      DESIGN--Systematic review and meta-analysis of trials revealed by
      searches. TRIALS--23 randomised trials including a total of 1757
      outpatients with mainly mild or moderately severe depressive disorders:
      15 (14 testing single preparations and one a combination with other
      plant extracts) were placebo controlled, and eight (six testing single
      preparations and two combinations) compared hypericum with another
      drug treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--A pooled estimate of
      the responder rate ratio (responder rate in treatment group/responder
      rate in control group), and numbers of patients reporting and dropping
      out for side effects. RESULTS--Hypericum extracts were significantly
      superior to placebo (ratio = 2.67; 95% confidence interval 1.78 to 4.01)
      and similarly effective as standard antidepressants (single preparations
      1.10; 0.93 to 1.31, combinations 1.52; 0.78 to 2.94). There were two
      (0.8%) drop outs for side effects with hypericum and seven (3.0%) with
      standard antidepressant drugs. Side effects occurred in 50 (19.8%)
      patients on hypericum and 84 (52.8%) patients on standard
      antidepressants. CONCLUSION--There is evidence that extracts of
      hypericum are more effective than placebo for the treatment of mild to
      moderately severe depressive disorders. Further studies comparing
      extracts with standard antidepressants in well defined groups of patients
      and comparing different extracts and doses are needed.

Abstract 
      Extracts of Hypericum perforatum St. John's wort, have been used since
      antiquity for the treatment of depressive symptoms. In 25 controlled
      clinical trials where hypericum extract was compared with placebo and
      established antidepressants, improvement was obtained in 61 percent of
      patients on low-dose treatment (< 1.2 mg hypericum extract), and in 75
      percent of patients treated with a higher dose (2.7 mg). The side effects
      were mild and occurred at lower frequency than did those of other
      antidepressants. The constituent of hypericum extract that is responsible
      for the antidepressant effect has not been identified. Nor is the
      mechanism of action known, but a combination of low-grade monoamine
      oxidase inhibition and noradrenaline and serotonin reuptake blockade
      seems the most likely alternative, though other interesting mechanisms
      have also been proposed. Owing to their beneficial effect and low
      toxicity, preparations containing extracts from H perforatum might furnish
      an alternative to established therapy, especially among patients
      concerned about stigmatization or less apprehensive of herbal
      medication than of synthetic drugs.

Effects of the total extract and fractions of Hypericum
perforatum in animal assays for antidepressant activity.

Butterweck V, Wall A, Lieflander-Wulf U, Winterhoff H, Nahrstedt A

A commercially available extract of the aerial parts of Hypericum
perforatum, LI 160, showed pronounced activity in selected animal
bioassays. These include the forced swimming test (FST) and the tail
suspension test, used to determine antidepressant activity, and tests
indicating activity on the central nervous system, such as body
temperature and ketamine induced sleeping time. The counteracting
effects of drugs known to interfere with the central dopaminergic
system strongly suggested that dopamine mediated activity is important
for the activity of the extract.  Dose-response experiments of the
total extract and of fractions rich in flavonoids and
napthodianthrones produced inverted U-shaped dose response curves.

Effects of long-term administration of hypericum extracts on
the affinity and density of the central serotonergic 5-HT1 A and
5-HT2 A receptors.

Teufel-Mayer R, Gleitz J

Extracts of St. John's wort, Hypericum perforatum L. (Hypericaceae),
are used as a phytotherapeutic antidepressant. A number of clinical
studies demonstrate that their antidepressive potency is comparable to
tricyclic antidepressants (TCA). Although the therapeutic effect of
hypericum extracts is well documented, very little is known about the
molecular mode of action. As the improvement of the depressive
symptoms with both TCA and hypericum extracts only occurs
significantly after a lag phase of 10 to 14 days, it is assumed that
the medication causes long-term adaptations within the central nervous
system. In this context, serotonergic (5-HT) receptors are of special
interest. Therefore, we investigated possible alterations in affinity
and density of 5-HT1 A and 5-HT2 A receptors caused by long-term
treatment of rats with St.  John's wort. The brain without cerebellum
and brain stem of rats, treated daily for 26 weeks with a commercially
available hypericum extract (2700 mg/kg LI 160) were used for membrane
preparations. Affinity (KD) and amount (Bmax) of serotonergic
receptors were determined by employing receptor binding assays using 3
H-8-OH-DPAT and 3H-Ketanserin as selective radioligands for the 5-HT1
A and the 5-HT2 A receptors, respectively. We found that in
hypericum-treated rats the number of both 5-HT1 A and 5-HT2 A
receptors were significantly increased by 50% compared to controls,
whereas the affinity of both serotonergic receptors remained
unaltered. The data suggest an upregulation of 5-HT1 A and 5-HT2 A
receptors due to prolonged administration of hypericum extracts. These
results are consistent with a modification of the expression levels of
serotonergic receptors caused by synthetic antidepressants.

Placebo-controlled double-blind study examining the
effectiveness of an hypericum preparation in 105 mildly
depressed patients.

Sommer H, Harrer G

One hundred and five outpatients with mild depressions of short
duration were treated in a double-blind study with either 3 x 300 mg
hypericum extract or placebo. The therapy phase was 4 weeks. The
effectiveness was judged according to the Hamilton Depression Scale
after 2 and 4 weeks. The values of the mean basic score in these
periods fell from 15.8 to 9.6 or 7.2 in the active group, and in the
placebo group, from 15.8 to 12.3 and 11.3. The differences between
active and placebo groups were statistically significant with P < .05
and P < .01 achieved after 2 and 4 weeks, respectively. In the active
group, 28 of 42 patients (67%) and, in the placebo group, 13 of 47
patients (28%) responded to treatment. Notable side effects were not
found.

the street is not very pretty. Mostly, it's a result of explosive
decompression of long-shielded society. Sudden power vacuum has made
energetic individuals grab for economical and political resources. The
resulting power structure is a mafiocracy, worsened by monopolism. 

There is a perfect example of failed govermental pension system right
under your own nose. Several decades ago in Germany, with lots of smoke
and mirrors a high-ranked criminal cheated several generations out of
their pension -- yours included. Strong state artefacts as creaking
conservationalism (amplified by some teutonic specifics), technological
neophobia and a totally failed tax policy running rampant _plus_ random
factors as a skewed population age histogram do not seem to make Krautland
a good place to live for the next decades. (Nor Russia, btw, but for
different reasons).
 
There is a spectrum of economic systems in real life: diverse brands of
socialism/communism (deceased), the Scandinavian model (failed), Germany
(failing)  and the U.S. (doing tolerably well) at the other side of the
spectrum. Radical free market capitalism is a new thing, never tried
before. Like many radical systems, it may fail. However, we would be fools
not to try.

Estacado: No sarcasm; I'm truly sorry for sacrificing
clarity for brevity and writing something that could
be construed as calling you a Nazi.

What I meant by the phrase "Eradicate? How? (Sieg
Hiel!)" was that the only way the God meme could be
"eradicated from the planet" as you suggested was
through totalitarianism. For example, since the God
meme is carried in books, those books would have to
be destroyed. It would have been better if I had
replaced the string "(Sieg Heil!)" with "(Book
burning?)". Again, I'm sorry.

I guess what I've been trying to say is that (IMHO)
it would be impossible to eradicate the God meme from
all minds, so maybe your life will improve if you
choose your battles more carefully. For example,
fight the fundamentalist Christians who are against
teaching evolutionary theory to children, not the
extropians who sometimes joke about God.

I suspect that when memetics advances, someone will
discover that this is rigorously true: all
sufficiently complex memetic systems will give rise
to a God meme. Thus, to me, it's like you're getting
upset that viruses exist or that 7 is a prime number.
Sometimes happiness depends on accepting what you
cannot change. (At the risk of upsetting you again, I
joke: Maybe you should make peace with the God meme.)

As for giving you a break, okay, I will. I won't post
anything else to this list on this subject during 1998.

Peace.

?????  I looked this up in a few books to be sure--l-carnitine plays
a significant role in weight reduction as an anticatabolic
substance, but it sure won't add any muscle mass.  Nor are there any
claims that it will alter your personality in any way, although it
will increase your energy levels, and energy levels do provide a 
basis for exhibiting a higher level of assertiveness.

You are probabably thinking of negentropy, the negative of the entropy.

Like most of the substances discussed here the placebo effect plays a
huge role. I suppose that if you eat something that gives you more
energy, think it will have beneficial effects you will become more
assertive.

Still, it has some interesting effects in the nervous system. It seems
to provide a bit of protection against damage (the neurons have enough
extra energy to cope), and in rats it promotes the formation of more
(but smaller) synapses:

SOME students. Talking of Munich, those students belong to a political
group called "Linksruck" who are the worst communists I have ever
encountered. Unfortunately, those people are a lot better organized than
individuals like me, which has the effect that their voice is heard
louder than those of many other students who don't particularly agree
with what those people say ("Tax millionaires" is just the "top of the
iceberg"...)

I thought those "protests" were an interesting example of Spontanuous
Order and Intelligent Technology (at least if you look at them from the
right perspective):
Spontanuous Order: there were a lot of different things that had to be
done - organization (great challenge), public relations (the press was
really really bad at the beginning, it got better after 2 weeks), events
and so on. For these tasks, groups from different institutes gathered
and some did a really good job (we even had a daily "newspaper")
Intelligent Technology: well, unfortunately, people just are not really
connected to the internet. Still, we managed to pull some of the
coordination and information onto the internet, providing mailing-lists
and a website (updated hourly). This did have quite a positive effect
(many interested people managed to get in contact with others, many
unclear points could be discussed etc). Another thing that helped a lot
were cellular phones (in that situation, you hardly ever are reachable
via phone if you don't have that) - again, the problem was that too few
people have that.

Oh, I almost forgot Dynamic Optimism: without it, you wouldn't even care
to start anything like that ;-)

However much it may have changed the world - I took great personal
profit by the learning experience (which leads us to Self
Transformation, right?)

Have fun!

later,
Holger

Honestly, this page seems to be mostly bullshit. It is written by
somebody who at least seems to understand the physics, but the biology
and neuroscience was downright silly. Neurons are *not*
superconducting (experimental fact). And when he started to explain
this non-existent effect by invoking wormholes, exotic atoms and
citing colf fusion papers, it gradually moved from silly to
hillarious.

As one researcher said at the workshop on hippocampal modelling I
visited this weekend: "I have great respect for Penrose. But he is in
bad company".

The problem with these multiple universe theories is that I know of no way they 
could be proven. And something that cannot be proven is totally irrelevant. 
Therefore, I assume that the "universe" and the four dimensional space-time we live 
in are one and the same. However, whether everything there is includes other 
universes or just the one we can observe, the fact remains that the universe or 
universes are/is the result of (a) quantum fluctuation(s).

I thik most of these effects can be attributed to set and setting,
plus indirect psychological effects. Psychedelics induce
hallucinations and odd ways of thinking; this makes you more aware of
the aspects of perception you normally take for granted. Steroids
might increase aggression simply because they cause autonomous nervous
system arousal that normally becomes associated with anger. And so on.

So while I certainly believe the drugs may have these beneficial
effects, they are not inherent in the drug itself.

What I want is drugs that really affect just a single cell-field. Then
we could mix the right cocktails, including pleasure without strong
addiction (stimulating the "liking" but not "wanting" systems). Not to
mention the boon to us neuroscientists... :-)

The first meeting of Midwest Extropians occurred as
planned on Saturday, 10 January. In attendance were
(alphabetically)

Michael Bowling
Michael Smith (myself)
Edward Sona
Steve Van Sickle
Brian Williams

(Thom Quinn RSVP'd; he was unable to make this time,
but wants to be kept notified of any future events.)

Good food and good conversation were had by all. We
had a good time discussing various Extropic issues
and getting to know one another. As I recall, we
spent a lot of time discussing subjects such as
cryonics, investing, science fiction, ExI, the
Internet, various technologies we are looking forward
to, the history and financial status of Alcor (Steve
assured us that they're in good shape), ways to
increase longevity, current events, to what extent
Dr. Seed was or wasn't on the up-and-up, and a lot
besides.

We agreed that the meeting should not be a unique
occurance. Next time, we hope to meet with a specific
event to go to (for example, Brian pointed out that
Douglas Hofstadter had recently given a talk in
Chicago that was open to the public; the rest of us
were sorry we'd missed it.).

One moment I'll always remember is when Steve took
out his Alcor dog tag (I forget what it's really
called, it's the tag Steve wears around his neck to
indicate to non-Alcor medical personnel the
procedures they should follow should, Frank-forbid,
Steve unexpectedly die.). Actually holding such an
item in my hand made the possibilities of cryonics a
little more real for me.

We all agreed that the event was a great success.

I don't think there would be any problem factoring in the 
consideration that some models just probabilistically imply the 
creation of life. That's a fairly simple technical move. What is 
philosophically more tricky, however, is to decide what to do about 
the fact that different models would have different numbers different 
types of living things. Would my existence be more probable given the 
universe contains many observers than given it contains few 
observers? The assumtion that it would be more probable if the 
universe contains many observers is the Self-indication axiom. In my 
paper on the Carter-Leslie Doomsday argument, I give some arguments 
in favour of the negation of the Self-indication axiom. The bad thing 
about holding the negation true, though, is that it makes it hard to 
see how to escape the conclusion of the Doomsday argument.

The problem with this theory is that our univers is not what we 
should expect it to be if this theory were true. If all locally 
possible worlds are instantiated eqully numerously, then we should 
not expect to find ourselves in one that is so highly ordered as 
ours. For every possible world like this one, there are countless 
ones where pink elephants sometimes materialize out of nowhere or 
random  blue blobs form over houses whose street addresses are prime 
numbers. If all these possible worlds were actual, then why are we 
not in one of these irregular ones?

Well, if we could derive the existence of the universe from the laws 
of logic, then I think we could be reasonably satisfied. A logical 
proof is surely good enough.

Philosopher Nozick mentions the following argument in one of his 
books (Philosophical Explanations 1981): There are infinitely many 
ways for there to be something, but only one way for there to be 
nothing. Therefore, assuming each way is equally probable, the 
probability that there is something equals 1.

I wholeheartedly concur and wish the list would move on to more
practical matters, like actually achieving posthumanism.

I didn't mean that all logically possible universes would exist, but
rather that a full spectrum of universes rather like our own would be
created, with all possible variations on fundamental physical parameters,
like the dimensionality of space and the strengths of the various forces.
So this would not include universes where pink elephants materialize out
of nowhere.

However in the light of Nick's interpretation, maybe my idea is not
so attractive.  I thought Wei's suggestion (as I understood it) was
improbable that maybe just one universe exists which just happens to
have physical properties that allow the formation of life.  It seemed
too arbitrary.  I tried to suggest a simpler model in which all possible
variations would exist.  But I was still constraining the variations to
be those which are not so terribly different from our own.  Fundamentally
maybe that is really just as limited, compared with the alternative that
Nick is suggesting.

To an Extropian, this news is scary stuff. Note what Chirac says: he's not
just working on an international ban on human cloning, but on any genetic
alterations to human beings. Goodbye one path to posthumanity!

If the British are the only country to resist, maybe I'll have to move
back. [Natasha--want to live in London?]

European countries say no to human cloning 


Copyright  1998 Nando.net
Copyright  1998 The Associated Press 

Nando's special report: 1997 Year in Review 


PARIS (January 12, 1998 4:08 p.m. EST http://www.nando.net) -- Hours after
French President Jacques Chirac called for a world ban on human cloning, 19
European nations signed an agreement Monday to prohibit genetic replication
of humans.

The actions came two days after President Clinton blasted a Chicago
physicist's intention to clone humans as "untested and unsafe and morally
unacceptable" and urged Congress to outlaw human cloning.

"It is on the international level that one must ban cloning and the genetic
manipulation susceptible to altering the character of the human species,"
Chirac told the European national ethics committee.

The July 1997 presentation of Dolly the sheep, the world's first cloned
mammal, set off an international outcry over the implications for human
biology.

Many world leaders renewed their condemnation after Chicago scientist
Richard Seed said Jan. 7 that he planned to begin working on human cloning
using a new technique.

"We would resolve nothing in banning certain practices in one country if
the doctors and researchers can develop them elsewhere," said Chirac,
citing the "worrying trend" in the United States.

Representatives from 19 members of the Council of Europe later today signed
a protocol that would commit their countries to prohibiting by law "any
intervention seeking to create human beings genetically identical to
another human being, whether living or dead."

The 40-member group was founded in 1949 to promote democracy, human rights
and the rule of law.

The cloning protocol will not include two of Europe's biggest countries.

Germany claims the measure is weaker than a current German law that forbids
all research on human embryos -- a legacy of Nazis attempts to conduct
genetic engineering of humans.

Britain, with a strong tradition of defending the freedoms of scientific
research, also balked.

Countries signing today are: Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece,
Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Moldova, Norway, Portugal, Romania, San
Marino, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Macedonia and Turkey.

        I think that the ban can be directly linked to the large amount of
media attention that has been brought to the breakthroughs in cloning.
Imagine, for instance, if Richard Seed and the ones who effectively cloned
Dolly (their names escape me right now) had kept their developments and
intentions away from the media; I think it is safe to say that there would
be no bans...because it would not have been propagated.  It is because of
Seed's (and his predecessors') desire for media coverage that the potential
uses of cloning have been deemed "illegal" by the aforementioned countries.
 Hopefully the creators of effective nanotechnology and other progressive
breakthroughs will have a little bit more discretion when announcing their
creations.

A theory can be disproved but no theory can be proven because you can always 
add a wheel within a wheel to produce an alternate theory that also explains 
the facts, it's just that we pick the simplest one for connivance. Obviously 
a good theory must make good predictions, but it must do more, it must help 
us form mental models that allow more to be learned about the universe. 
A good theory might not even be true, Newton's ideas were enormously 
productive and served us well for 300 years before running out of gas. 
Classical physics last gift to us was its successor, a theory that worked 
better.

It's possible to explain the operation of a Quantum Computer without 
resorting to the Many Worlds theory, but doing so is convoluted and difficult, 
if you were to program such a machine I believe it would be more productive 
to think not of one device but of trillions running in parallel. Of course 
nobody has made a Quantum Computer, but I predict that if somebody ever does
then Many Worlds will become the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics 
because it will be the easiest way to think  about certain problems.

Sorry, hit too many n's, meant `conative' - it's this damned swelting high
summer heat that does it.  

Conation is a psych/lit/phil term for the faculty of choosing between
courses of action - volition, will, like that, or the desire to perform
such a voluntary act.  Can `will' be segregated from `cognition'?  In some
measure, surely.

Thats right. Tell me, where is the net economic benefit to sinking
hundreds of thousands, if not millions of tons of perfectly good ships
to the bottom of the ocean, to expending 50% or more of a nation's GNP
with no capital gain, to destroying a large fraction, if not all of a
nations infrastructure, to killing the brightest and most productive
members of society???

You may claim that 'stockholders' are the ones that benefit, yet why is
it that 90% of weapons producers go bankrupt at the end of a major war,
or are bought up by other companies at a discount??? Why is it that they
take huge losses in the last year of any war, as governments fail to
make payments, or cancel orders in mid production, or see their plants
destroyed by enemy action?

Yes, government leaders get their names in the history books for the
wars they lead, not for the peaces they oversee. How many business
leaders are as famous for their wartime contributions as people like
Stalin, FDR, Churchill, Hitler, Mussolini, or even generals like
MacArthur, or Eisenhower, Patton, Rommel, Montgomery, Hap Arnold, or
even minor heroes like Sgt. York, The Red Baron, Lt. Jack Kennedy, Jimmy
Doolittle, etc.????

Power structures exist because of the favors of government officials.
The old Quid Pro Quo is a mercantilists biggest gun. If all business had
an equal footing, and if corporations were not legally considered
virtual citizens, the average person would not have as much trouble.
They'd have more responsibilities, for sure, but such is always the way
with greater freedom.

Increases in productivity have ALWAYS led to greater employment at
higher wages. But they have ALWAYS required a greater level of
education/skill to acheive those positions. The idea of a high school
grad overseeing a hundred robots doing nothing but pushing buttons and
eating donuts is pure fiction. Because people are too lazy to think, and
resistant to learning new things, they resist productivity increases,
while claiming otherwise.

Becuase some countries still make it too easy, or even welcome, leaders
whos idea of leadership is to rape and pillage, make enemies, and
oppress the people. The only type of diplomacy such people understand is
force. An emminent example: Iraq.

People get the government they deserve. Also, egalatarians can live in
an aristocratic society just fine, thank you, so long as they get to be
the aristocrats.

And anti-business, anti-free market, anti-technologists make ignorance

ABOUT THE SYMPOSIUM

The "Journal of Memetics - Evolutionary Models of Information
Transmission"
(JOM-EMIT), in collaboration with the Principia Cybernetica Project, is
organizing a first symposium on memetics. The aim of the journal is to
integrate the different approaches inspired by memetics, and thus try to
establish memetics as a recognized scientific field. The symposium
similarly wishes to bring together all researchers working on memetics,
in
order to allow them to meet face to face, thus stimulating discussions
and
possible collaborations. The symposium is chaired by two members of the
Journal's editorial board, Francis Heylighen and Mario Vaneechoutte. The
emphasis will be on discussion, rather than on formal presentation.


SYMPOSIUM THEME

In 1976, Dawkins invented the word 'meme,' in analogy with the word
'gene',
defining it as 'a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of
imitation'.
Thus, he defined the field of memetics, which studies the development
and
spread of culture and information, on the basis of the Darwinian
principles
of variation, reproduction and natural selection. Further information on
memetics is available through the journal's web server:
http://www.cpm.mmu.ac.uk/jom-emit/

The initial description of 'meme' by Dawkins is rather vague, which
is a possible reason for current diverging views on what a meme
really is, and how the memetic model can be used. We are confronted
with an avalanche of books, essays, and publications scattered over
different journals and disciplines, with dialogue flashing up here
and there in an unstructured manner. This chaos exists because a
general framework is lacking.

The journal of memetics, and the symposium it organizes, aims to tackle
this problem. We seek to discuss issues concerning memetics such as:

* Mechanisms involved in evolutionary processes. Comparisons of
different models of evolution are especially welcome.
* Philosophical or theoretical issues concerning epistemology and
evolution
* Boundaries of the evolutionary approach
* Empirical research
* Fundamental approaches aiming at structuring the field of memetics as
a science


SUBMISSION OF PAPERS

Prospective contributors are invited to submit a 1-page (about 2K)
abstract (preferably including references), along with the author's
name, postal and email address and affiliations. The submission should
be sent by email to the symposium chair, Mario Vaneechoutte
<Mario.Vaneechoutte@rug.ac.be>. The deadline for receiving submissions
is March 10, 1998.

The proposals will be refereed by the journal's review board. You
will be notified about the acceptance (or rejection) of your proposal
as soon as possible, but not later than March 31, 1998. If accepted,
the full text of the paper, which must not exceed 6 typed,
single-spaced pages, is to be sent by postal mail to the congress
secretariat before May 31, 1998.

All papers that are personally presented by the author at the
congress will be published in the congress Proceedings. The authors of
the best papers will be invited to publish an extended version in the
Journal of Memetics. Authors who already published a paper in the
Journal are encouraged to submit a shorter, updated version of their
paper for the Symposium. Researchers who cannot participate in the
symposium are still invited to directly submit a full paper for
publication in the Journal to the managing editor (see the information
for authors at

http://www.cpm.mmu.ac.uk/jom-emit/ifa.html).

If you wish you can submit a maximum of two papers in different
symposia of the congress. Submissions for other symposia should be
sent directly to the congress secretariat before January 31, 1998.

ABOUT THE CONGRESS

The 15th International Congress on Cybernetics will be held from
August 24 to 28, 1998, in Namur (Belgium) at the Institute for
Computer Sciences of the University of Namur. The International
Congresses on Cybernetics are organized triannually (since 1956) by
the International Association for Cybernetics (IAC). The
interdisciplinary domain of cybernetics, which is closely related to
memetics, addresses subjects such as information, communication,
organization, intelligence, complex systems, and feedback loops.

Namur is a quiet little city on the confluence of the Meuse and
Sambre rivers, at the foot of a hill supporting impressive medieval
fortifications. Its charming old streets offer plenty of restaurants
and cafes. It is situated at an hour's drive by car or train from
Brussels, the capital of Belgium and of the European Union, at the
border of the beautiful forested region of the Ardennes.

The congress atmosphere is relaxed and informal, with several
symposia going on in parallel in adjacent rooms. Lunches can be taken
at the university restaurant, in the restored mediaeval Arsenal. The
congress normally includes a congress dinner, an excursion, and a
meeting room for coffee breaks. Participants are responsible for
making their own hotel reservations, but good quality and inexpensive
accomodation in students' rooms will be available. A list of hotels
will be forwarded on request.

The official languages of the Congress are English and French (the
memetics symposium will be exclusively in English).

Virtual particle pairs (Dirac's sea) determine the properties of the
vacuum (i.e. dielectricity constant), which are easily measurable. I'm
pretty sure that a similiar (perhaps indirect) verification is possible
with Planck quantum foam, for a TOE (superstring++ is a candidate for one)
must explain it.

Now I don't know much about superstring theory, except that it involves
something like 10 dimensions. In this context, how does Heinlein's ol
proposition of dimension swapping/rotating/translating (The Number of
the Beast) look as a possibility for multiverses under a ten dimensional
superstructure? Or am I just out to lunch?

This is interesting, but what are the odds in the game? I can imagine life
will/have/has/had usurped multiverse by iterations of altruistic
supercivilisations eventually producing lots of life-suitable universes
(the best of all possible worlds?), but we, parasites of chance?

Intuitively, it doesn't make sense. What are the arguments?

	A possible experimental test of the Many-Worlds interpretation of
Quantum theory would be to use quantum-computers to simulate the process
of collapsing the Psi-function, since any quantum system is
(theoretically) subject to simulation by a quantum-computer. 

	Of course the proposed experiment is a few years off yet, but the
current work on quantum-computers is very suggestive.

I don't know, but one should be careful about calling any of the
superstring or M-brane theories "accepted". They tend to change all
the time, to the delight of the theoreticians, but so far none has
really worked out to the extent that they have got popular outside
this select group. The number of dimensions seems to vary quite a bit,
up to 26 (I think).

I just read an article in 'The New York Times' (on-line edition) that
said there is a serious shortage of computer programmers in the world,
that not enough people are going into computer science to keep up with
the escalating demand for computer programmers.  This is good for the
computer programmers, since their salaries tend to keep rising, but it is
not so good for the development of information technologies since the
less people there are advancing those technologies, the more slowly they
will advance.

What I was thinking would be a high priority for software development
companies is a form of semi-automated programming software.  Basically,
this would be a very high-level programming language which could help the
programmer do in little time what previously took hours of coding.  Since
it isn't likely that we'll see a significantly higher percentage of
people becoming computer programmers, what we need are tools to help
those programmers be much more productive with their time.  Also, tools
like these will likely get rid of much of the more boring aspects of
computer programming, which are boring because they require very little
thought and could be better done by a computer.

I know a lot of you on this list are computer programmers; do any of you
know about developments in very high level programming languages?

This is already happening now. There are a lot of programming tools
available now for different jobs and at different levels. The problem is
that nobody knows yet how the ideal tools should be. We are nowhere near
the end of the development.

The easiest way to see it, is in the increasingly larger percentage of
programmers doing _scripting_ instead of _programming_ to get the work
done.

Some stuff like this already exists, though probably not on the scale
you're thinking of. Rapid Application Development (RAD) systems
like Microsoft Visual C++, Visual Basic, and Borland C++Builder, as
well as Delphi, automate the tiresome task of writing user interface 
code for GUIs, allowing the programmer to concentrate on "event 
handlers", little chunks of code that get called when user interface
elements (buttons, etc) get pushed.

I don't know if these sorts of things have been extended beyond UI
programming tho.

The Visual programming kits do help, but dynamic(?) changes require a 
smaller, interpreted widget (eg. JAVA). Agent programming is getting very 
close to adapt it's processing to the user by interface. As a S/W 
developer, I still look at the "Jordi LaForge" type of programming - Rapid 
development, able to interface w/any type of machine or system, small (and 
cool looking).

Sender: postmaster@extropy.com

Hi.

I found a couple bits of computer news that may be of interest, especially
the free Unix crowd.

1) DEC will start shipping an Alpha that forces (in firmware) users to use NT.

     "The expanded alliance (with Microsoft) coincides with Digital's plans
to ship by month's
     end an Alpha processor with firmware that restricts it to running only NT
     software, sources close to the company said. The chip is expected to
     run NT applications faster than existing Alphas that support multiple
     operating systems."

If all the low cost Alpha systems become exclusively available for NT, this
will seriously impede continued development of Linux for Alpha, and close
the door on a cheap, high-performance, non-Microsoft platform.  This was
part of a much larger article on Wired, so I don't know if the normal cheap
Alphas will be phased out or not (I would hope not, but it may affect
availability).
-------------------------------------------------------------

2) Sun has a new line of PC-priced workstations that use Ultrasparc-IIi
technology.

To help stop the migration of the low-end workstation market from Unix to
NT, Sun is now offering a new line of cheap Ultrasparc-II workstations
running Solaris 2.6.  

For example the new entry-level Ultra 5 workstation (Price: US$3895) includes:

270 MHz Ultrasparc-IIi
64Mb ECC RAM
4Gb Hard Drive
17" Monitor
10/100Base-T Ethernet
66MHz PCI bus (sorry, no crossbar switch at this price)
etc. (even comes in a pizza box case)

There is limited BTO options when purchasing these systems.

At these prices Sun may actually find a new audience for their hardware.
Personally, I will most likely purchase on of these new machines.  Means I
don't have to run Oracle Server on NT (until now the only low-cost Oracle
server platform).  And I'll bet Linux for Sparc runs just fine on these new
machines...

It looks like telomerase may be the fountain of youth after all!

     Scientists Extend The Life Span Of Human Cells 

DALLAS -- Jan. 13, 1998 -- Researchers at UT Southwestern Medical Center
at Dallas and their colleagues at Geron Corp., Menlo Park, Calif., say
they have figured out how to overcome the mechanisms that control cellular 
aging and extend the life span of human cells. 

In the Jan. 16 issue of Science, Drs. Woodring Wright and Jerry Shay, UT
Southwestern professors of cell biology and neuroscience, and their
collaborators report finding that the enzyme telomerase -- which UT
Southwestern scientists call a "cellular fountain of youth" -- causes
human cells grown in the laboratory to retain their "youth" and continue
to divide long past the time when they normally stop dividing.

Normal human cells have a limited capacity to proliferate. After a certain
finite number of cell divisions, time on the biological clock runs out;
the cells "age" and stop dividing. Time remaining in a cell's life
correlates with the length of the telomeres -- repeated sequences of DNA
on the ends of chromosomes that protect the tips from degradation. In
normal cells, telomeres shorten with each cell division. Although some
have thought that this telomere shortening might be the biological clocks
control mechanism, the hypothesis was controversial. The research now 
proves that human cells grow older each time they divide because their
telomeres shorten. 

Specialized reproductive cells and most cancer cells appear to divide 
indefinitely. They contain the enzyme telomerase, which adds back
telomeric DNA to the ends of chromosomes. Most normal cells do not have
this enzyme. 

"We have found that cellular aging can be bypassed by the introduction of
the catalytic component of the immortalizing enzyme telomerase," Shay
said. "The expression of telomerase LIFE SPAN -- 2in normal human cells
should extend their lifespan indefinitely. From a basic research point of
view, we could begin to replace the abnormal tumor-cell lines now being
used to study biochemical and physiological aspects of growth and
differentiation with normal, yet immortal cell lines." 

The scientists introduced telomerase into normal human cells to see if the
cells' life spans could be prolonged. The cells with telomerase extended
the length of their telomeres, divided for 20 additional generations past
the time they normally would stop dividing and are continuing to divide.
The cells also grew and divided in a normal manner, giving rise to normal
cells with the normal number of chromosomes. By all accounts these cells
had found their fountain of youth. 

"The extension of normal cell lifespan in a youthful state by telomerase
is a dramatic confirmation of the telomere hypothesis and one that
presents numerous opportunities for biotechnology and medicine," said Dr.
Calvin Harley, Geron vice president and chief scientific officer. 

One immediate use of finding that telomere shortening controls cellular
aging may be in the area of producing engineered products in human cells.
Instead of using uncharacterized primary human-cell cultures to produce 
vaccines or other biological products, one should now be able to produce
products in a re-engineered normal human cell-type that does not change,
Wright said. 

"This research raises the possibility that we could take a patient's own
cells, rejuvenate them, then modify the cells as needed and give them back
to the patient to treat a variety of genetic and other diseases," Wright
said. "The potential long-term applications are simply staggering." 

Other investigators on the project included Drs. Andrea Bodnar, Maria 
Frolkis, Choy-Pik Chiu, Gregg B. Morin, Calvin Harley and Serge
Lichtsteiner of Geron Corp.; and Drs. Michel Ouellette and Shawn Holt,
research fellows in UT Southwestern's Department of Cell Biology and
Neuroscience. The research was funded in part by the National Institutes
of Health.

  hey folks,

I'm developing a plan here at the lazy D to bring our www/mail/ftp needs in
house, and am looking at bringing in a 256-512k line in to a server. I've
downloaded WinGate and MDaemon to test, as well as an FTP server. I'm
expecting that at least a good handfull of the people here are pretty
experienced with setting this sort of thing up.

This is just a smidgen beyond my present knowledge, and would appreciate even
something as simple as a checklist/watchout list, but I'd be willing to pay a
little bit for further help/ baby sitting me through this process. Please
contact me via private email... thanks.

The old adage is true, I've risen to my own level of incompetence.... ;-)

Yeah, everyone should start coding in Perl :-) It rocks!
Seriously, it would seem to require some kind of AI to get
any farther than what we have now ?

That's exactly what people have been saying for the last 18 years
I've been programming, and bits and pieces of it have been accomplished:
first it was Fortran, then "structured" programming languages like
Algol, then "Object-oriented" programming; next will probably be Agoric
programming.

All of these things helped, and more will help, but don't delude
yourself into imagining that programming will ever be an easy job.
No matter how high-level and automated the tools get, the products
produced by those tools plus human hard work  and ingenuity will
always be superior to those produced by tools and simple operators.
And users will demand the superior products.

Programming is, at the root, the art of accurately and completely
communicating a problem to machine that can solve the problem
faster than you can.  It cannot, then, ever be simpler in concept
than the problem itself, and the more computer power you have,
the more complex problems you can solve, and the more difficult
it will be to communicate them accurately and completely, trendy
tools and languages notwithstanding.

Chirac has a big mouth but has made a great mess of his country and has
lost the support of many French people, strikes, demonstrations and a
capital that looks like an city under martial law (so much police). France
is on a downhill slide both economicallly and politically. And Chirac is

There is hope ;-)

Yes well, that was not a very smart move PR-wise. I didn't hear much in the
media about the _applications_ of cloning. Just a lot of boys-from-brazil BS.

So research will continue in England, the Netherlands and other countries.
No problem. Chirac slowed things down a bit, nothing more (don't get me
wrong that;s bad enough but a solvable problem).

 >Representatives from 19 members of the Council of Europe later today signed

Once cloning becomes a usefull technology in medicine and bio-industry this
law will be softened, same as abortion and IVF (In Vitro Fertilization).

 >The 40-member group was founded in 1949 to promote democracy, human rights
 >and the rule of law.

So they make laws that cannot possibly be enforced. Again, all this reminds
me of all the failing druglaws. A law forbidding this kind of technology
cannot possibly be enforced for a long time. I cannot think of any
technology with clear applications that were economically feasible and/or
socially desirable that were succesfully suppressed for long (if someone
does, please speak-up ;-)

In light of other technical/ethical debates held this century I'm not to
worried about some French fossil trying to enforce his medieval view of
ehtics on the global scientific and medical community.

Abortion is legal, drugs are almost legal, IVF is legal, bio-tech on
mice/sheep/cow's is legal. When it becomes a useful tool cloning will also
be legal. Call me an optimist if you like ;-)

The state spends a lot of money during wartime, money extracted from its
population through taxes. It spends this money in buying weapons, paying
transports etc. So the state does not get more powerful, those who are paid by
the state do. And in effect, those who *own* these companies are the ones who
earn from war. That's the big investment banks. Example: First National Bank
during the Vietnam War. Right after this bank had allowed Textron to buy the
Bell Helicopter Company, the extensive use of helicopters in the war started.
[Prouty, L. Fletcher: "JFK - The CIA, Vietnam and the Plot to Assassinate John
F. Kennedy", NY 1996]. First National Bank also participated in Boeing, which
had dramatic increases of sales (1965: $ 2 billion, 68: $ 3.3 billion, 70: $
3.7 billion).

I don't ignore it, it's true. But the really big enterprises, of course
especially arms industry, usually profit from war -- and the big banks behind
them do as well.

For the power structures, there's lots of evidence. US history is full of it.
Start with JFK, go over to Vietnam, look at Watergate, look at how Reagan was
put up as a strawman for Bush and how Bush (former CIA-boss, coming from a
rich family, good connections to investment banks, big in the oil industry
with Zapata Oil), how Bush started the Gulf War etc. 

For what happens after you remove the cover: The fact that nothing you call a
free market has ever existed. And the above facts.

Your rhetoric doesn't help here. Major parts of the population are controlled
through mass media, unless anyone shows them a "beast" on TV, they won't
believe in it. People in the Middle Ages (another fine Free Market) followed
the church. This is an example of direct influence through a true power elite
and of what people do in this case.

Short-term development because of cheaper and better goods and still high
demands (sometimes the market laws indeed apply). Working conditions, however,
worsened dramatically. That's why the Luddite movement was started - not
because people were just technophobic, but because they suddenly had to do
more work for less money and/or work under extreme conditions. The Luddites
never attacked humans in the beginning. Still, the industrial Horsfell ordered
to shoot a group of Luddites. Horsfell was murdered, and maybe it was not the
Luddites who did it but the industry who now had a justification for a true
witchhunt. First, the destruction of machines was punished with death, later
with deportation. 
What's better, getting roasted by a gov for killing a kid or getting hanged
for destroying a machine?

Right. German industry complained about the oh-so-high loan costs from
1995-1996 and promised to create jobs when they would not have to pay so much.
Further cuts in the social system were made. Now German industry complains
about the oh-so-high loan costs again. Further cuts in the social system are
made. Then ... Get the idea? And all the time, unemployment has not decreased
a bit, instead it has risen. And neither in 1995 nor in 1999 the German
industry was in a bad situation. Fact is, each year they make record profits.

No, how many believe, that elections are not manipulated, that people choose
politicians freely and that the politics are just wrong?

The evil communists again. You should really try to convince your fellow
students to ask for the privatization of universities so that only those who
can afford it are allowed to get a higher level of education. This would
dramatically reduce costs and be much more efficient, don't you think?

I conclude, basically the following about this:


1. The propagation would never be the problem if people were more
intelligent and instructed... In other words , "plebes" still has to be
trated with "bread, circus" and... no serious information, so they do not
give their idiot opinion!! ( and, worse,  votes in a democracy...or better:
"demagoguerycracy") Even Jesus said: "Do not give your pearls to pigs !!
They will pass over them and hurt you after that..." (obs: I'm not
religious anyway... just an aprovement of a philosophical local idea...)

2. I include the midia in such lack of intelligence since they do not
divulge the good aspects of clonning... just 
the neurotical possible uses of some crazy fegs, which (the uses) sell more
newspapers or tv audience level points to the laic people (majority).


Although we try to do what is possible >>> mankind is not yet prepaired to
such evolution >>> they first have to clean out the spider-weds and
*clonned phantoms*  from their minds...

Yes... Sometimes I think on how better to Germany would it have been if
Hitler, with his strong
personallity,  would have provided  the correspondent development to German
pacific industries, instead 
of having stimulated such industries to produce megatons of destructive
artefacts... 
He was a multiple idiot !!!!!

From: http://www.massquantities.com/alc.html 

"In lab studies ALC (Acetyl L-Carnitine) dramatically 
improved testosterone levels in rats that were exposed 
to physical stress.Typically, after a workout, your testosterone 
levels plummet and you experience a spike in cortisol
production. New research shows that in addition to
eliminating the stress induced drop in testosterone,
ALC actually reduces cortisol levels as well.

Even if ALC can't make you balloon up to 375 lb,
there's undeniable evidence that it does positively
affects testosterone levels--a condition which may lead
to improved muscle growth.

On page 156 of Febuary 1997 issue of MM2K you
can read all about ALC's bodybuilding applications in
Michael Mooney's "Medibolics" column. Mooney
recommends 2000 mg a day as an effective dose for a
bodybuilder."

Ok, this is a commercial site, so the effects might be
exaggerated a bit, but it seems to match my personal
experiences. The increase in testosterone would explain
the "agressive (pumped-up) feeling" and the increased mucle 
firmness you get when taking larger amounts (4-8 300 mg pills 
dayly in my case) of carnitine. It "brings out the male in you",
so to speak. Also, fat seems to melt away and turn into muscle
(I gained approx 3 kilos since I began using the carnitine). As soon
as I stop using it the muscles loose their firmness, and the fat
comes back. Surely, this is more than just placebo effect. 
Note: I have been prescribed carnitine on an experimental basis to
reduce (chronical) fatigue, memory- and concentration problems
and unexplained (dramatic) weight loss. It has indeed helped to
reduce these problems, but as a sort of bonus it also increased
muscle firmness/mass and general assertiveness (although the
results may vary day by day). Nobody told me I could expect these
last two effects, so it can't be a case of "expectation foils perception".
Anyway, I have been using the stuff for three months or so without 
any *negative* side-effects. I warmly recommend it to anyone who
wants to improve his general condition. Of course results may vary,
but it won't hurt to try. 

The indications for Carnitene TM, from Sigma Tau (R) - Italy 
--fast deterioration of muscle function
--problems with the central nervous system
--the build-up of fat in muscle tissues or other tissues

I did not understand why so many doubts !!!  Just remember the *simple
math* definition of universe :

           "the complete set of all". 

 So:


1. Doesn't matter if an object, even if abstract,  is "something(t)" (time
variant) ... ( do not tell me there is anyone here who only conceive sets
of static  concrete objects... )

2. If you can imagine anything *out of*  such universe, defined in the
above way, you have not understood the definition...>> it is impossible "by
definition" !!! ( or so remember: which is  the complementary set of the
universe? >> { } ,  the empty set...) 

3. Any  set is always  a part of the universe (including { } and the
universe itself)...

I would like to comment the following about Mr. Nozick's affirmation:


First: an infinite set of  *discrete* events, can never be equiprobable,
since sum(p)=1. So any individual p=1/n >>> when n=oo...p=0...and
sum(p)=0... (obvious contradiction...)

Second:  If we consider (continuous) probability distribuction function
(p.d.f.'s) modelling,
any individual point  has correspondent probability zero... non-zero prob's
arises just for intervals... So, Mr. Nozick's, maybe  involuntarily, also
affirmed :

The ways for there to be something are not just infinite but also
CONTINUOUS... (or it denies quantum theory...or a quantum universe would be
just a subset of the whole complete universe ??? >>> it is better not
taking philosophical wanders very seriously... :-)  ) 

Last:  Since the probability that there is _nothing_ is zero, a question
arises>> nothing: exists or not ???  ( I always laugh a lot with certain
philosophical questions... just based on NOZICK's affirmative, such
question has no sense... )

Fortunately enough, the mundanes understand effects of
only few technologies that directly relate to their
world (I do not expect any government to pass a ban
on certain classes of QM theories, for example).
Also, they ban the work when it mostly done, and
is just about to produce a "scary" effect.
  Even with these restrictions, they still work on
biotech, crypto, etc., because they produce things
the mundanes and their governments actually need now;
this both creates a foundation for transformations
of extropian interest, and raises the level of public
acceptance (I find the levels of synthetic supplements
consumption among regular athletes and New Age folk
just amazing).
  And then, at some point, there will be more ways to
hide interesting research from the government, and
people may have increased interest in it - if now
millions of people risk severe punishment for using
chemicals to build muscles or get high, just imagine
what they'd do for dramatic health improvement and
life extent ion.

Meanwhile - could somebody build a cloning facility
outside the "civilized" countries?

Interesting.  Naked wrists are the exception out here;
at Extro3 more people had Alcor bracelets than had
wrist watches.

That beings up an interesting idea though: perhaps
Alcor's desire to protect its patients' privacy has
unwittingly influenced us to be less vocal about it
than we might otherwise?  Here's a suggestion: let us
all update the pictures on our Web pages to include
the decorated wrist--which is a much more effective
symbol and clear statement than a mere paragraph and
a link, as the original author here makes clear.
It would be especially effective if the pseudo-
celebrities among us did it: Max, Eric, Minski, etc.

Anybody in exi-bay get a new digital camera for Nmas?

It's not true, and it's a dangerous meme that should set off propaganda
alarms whenever you hear it.  European patent law is /stronger/ than
US law, so if this "problem" of effective but non-patentable drugs
really existed, it would exist more there than here.  The fact that it
is in fact less shows how that assertion fails.

Drug companies willingly spend millions of dollars investigating any
natural substance that might have any remotely possible effect, and
even if the effect occurs in the natural substance without refinement,
they can still make the money back by selling refined versions that
act faster or taste better or are more controllable.  If a well-known
substance is not being sold and touted by drug companies, it's not
because they can't patent it--it's because they've tested it and it
doesn't work (or doesn't work as well as something else they make).
Anyone who claims otherwise is just a charlatan trying to sell you
snake oil.

That said, there /is/ a problem in the US with drug companies not
being able to rely upon perfectly valid studies not done by FDA rules
(most of which have nothing at all to do with scientific validity).
But even in that case, if a natural substance was better at something
than the current drug of choice, drug companies would be falling all
over themselves to test it and sell an extract.  The patent issue is
nothing but a red herring.

Perfect democracy I find morally repugnant.  The very idea that my life,
liberty, or property exist at the whim of my neighbors, or that I have
any say at all in theirs, is contrary to my most cherished beliefs.  I
do not consider anyone a serious Extropian unless ey is fighting against
both death /and/ taxes (ironically, Mark Twain is an ancestor of mine).
Democracy and freedom are contradictory.  Extropians want freedom,
diversity, and expansion.  Democracy encourages conformism, unity, and
stagnation.  Democracy is deathist paradise.

Reluctantly, I vote--an act of violence I am forced to commit in self-
defense against the present government.  But don't think for one moment
that I don't live for the day when there will be nothing to vote for.
Rand may have gotten some of the details wrong, but she did leave us
with the most beautiful words I've ever seen in the English languauge:
"I swear by my life and my love for it that I will never live for the
sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine."

Our last meeting of the Extropian Investment Group was really helpful during
this time of ups and downs.  Rather than go over details of the meeting,
I'll pitch to Extropy Online to cover the meetings so that everyone can gain
some wisdom form how some experts are dealing with it as well as those of us
who are learning the ropes (or should I say bulls and bears -:)

I had a funny thought yesterday after hearing about the market's morning
lows and afternoon highs (relevant): I can see the traders rising at the
crack of dawn running in their p'jamas to computer terminals, phone lines
and tv programs to check out the Asian market. Then, after the usual bad
news and selling off what they can, in mobs they head for the corner bar for
several hours, until they, after a few martinis, build up enough courage to
rush back and buy what they can by the close of the day.

There is hope, but I find this argument unsatisfying.  Even if Chirac is about
to fall from grace, are the contenders for his office/power likely to be any
more sympathetic to our cause?

Also, whatever happens, we can do the research underground.  I'd rather
not, but if forced, we should go underground or war on our enemies.

Know what I say??? HACK CHIRAC!!!!

I think he needs to discover what life would be like with a few more of him
around, and if biology won't cooperate, I'm sure there are a few neighborhood
hackers who would love to impersonate his clones for as long as they can get
away with it.

True enough, though I think that regular folk can be

I would much rather have begun human cloning on

I think this involves making the process as simple

it gets down to any old doctor having the skills to
do it, it'll be like abortions were earlier this century
-- dangerous, illegal, yet ubiquitous.

Adds quotes, reaction)
   By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Correspondent
   WASHINGTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - U.S. scientists said on Tuesday they had
been able to make human cells live longer by tinkering with their genetic
material, providing a "fountain of youth" for aging cells.
   The findings, published in the journal Science, offered hope of new ways
to treat diseases such as cancer.
   "This research raises the possibility that we could take a patient's own
cells, rejuvenate them, then modify the cells as needed and give them back
to the patient to treat a variety of genetic and other diseases," Dr.
Woodring Wright, a professor of cell biology at the University of Texas in
Dallas, said in a statement.
   "This is a monumental advance in the understanding of the molecular
genetics of aging," Leonard Hayflick,  professor of anatomy at the
University of California San Francisco and the discoverer of human cellular
aging, said in a statement. "The telomerase gene will likely have many
important applications in the future of medicine and cell engineering."
   News of the technology sent shares in California-based biotechnology
group Geron Corp. <GERN.O> up four points on the NASDAQ stock exchange.
   "We believe that the extension and perhaps immortalization of human cells
will have many important applications for the treatment of age-related
diseases," said Calvin Harley, chief scientific officer at Geron.
   Wright and colleagues at the university's Southwestern Medical Center,
who worked with Geron, used an enzyme known as telomerase. Produced by germ
cells such as eggs and sperm, it affects the ends, or telomeres, of the
chromosomes which carry the genes.
   Normal cells do not produce telomerase. Every time a cell divides it
loses a little bit of the telomere on either end of the chromosome. Wright's
team found a way to make the telomeres grow back using the enzyme.
   "Each time a cell divides its telomeres get shorter and shorter and
shorter," Wright said in a telephone interview. His team proved last year
this loss was associated with aging.
   Now, they said, they proved you can stop the aging process, at least on a
cellular level.
   "Unequivocally I would say this would not allow you to live forever,"
Wright said. "This is not going to be a pill that allows you to live longer
any time soon."
   He said the the natural process that kills off cells was just one
component of aging. "It's possible that just like when you have a car and at
80,000 miles you replace the engine -- you haven't made that car immortal.
On average the car is going to run longer but then the transmission is going
to go out or the brakes or something else."
   But the finding could help individual cells live much longer. "Over time
we hope this will have significant effects on the health span and eventually
on lifespan," Wright said.
   Wright's team used skin cells, cells from the retina in the eye and skins
from inside arteries. All were able to grow back their telomeres and did
not, as normal cells do, eventually stop dividing and die.
   "They are still dividing," Wright said. They were also normal, showing no
sign of becoming cancerous.
   "I think the medical implications of this work are really profound," said
Dr. Jerry Shay, who worked with Wright. "It will allow us now to take a
person's own cells, manipulate and rejuvenate them without using up their
own lifespan, and then re-inject them."
   In other words, it could be the break that gene therapists have been
looking for.
   Gene therapy involves taking the cells of a person with a genetic disease
such as cystic fibrosis, inserting the healthy gene and then putting the
cells back in the patient in the hope that the manipulated cells will take over.
   But the engineered cells are old by the time the scientists are through
with them and often die off before they can do much good. Wright hopes the
telomerase process can make the cells immortal and make them work better.

We could call it a secondary effect, and that represents one of the 
problems in discussing supplements--they are usually advertised by 
their secondary effects rather than the actual process they have an 
affect on.  To take a supplement on the basis of its secondary 
effects can lead to poor or damaging choices in relation 
to life extension programs.  

To use Sasha's original question as an example (hope he doesn't
mind), I saw a red flag on the mention of l-carnitine, because I knew
that it is used in thermogenic formulas, and Sasha doesn't own an
ounce of extra fat on him!  Now, whether Sasha's svelt figure is the
result of diligent diet, exercise, or simply a good supply of his own
l-carnitine, I don't know.  But for him to ingest l-carnitine on the
basis of its energy---->agressiveness enhancing effect might result
in a situation where he had to begin ingesting a higher level of
calories, thereby increasing his glucolic metabolism and reducing his
own supply of DHEA, which he may or may not be keeping track of
through medical testing, and require him to increase his DHEA
supplementation to maintain longivity levels. Now, given the data
Anders provided on the neural effects of l-carnitine, Sasha might
decide that it is worth the juggling act to take a quantity of it,
but he would have to understand its primary effects in order to make
that choice in the first place.  

Sin,

Universe to endure and expand forever - astronomers
by Deborah Zabarenko

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Five teams of astronomers training
their sights on the very nature of the universe reported on
Thursday that it is ``lightweight'' -- not terribly dense -- and
is likely to expand and endure forever.
``With 95 percent confidence, we can say the universe is
going to expand forever,'' researcher Ruth Daly of Princeton
University said at a news briefing where all the teams presented
their findings. The denser the universe, the more likely it is to
reach a limit to expansion and to collapse in on itself. But the
researchers found that the universe has only one-fifth the mass
needed to generate the gravity to cause such an end.
What will happen as the lightweight universe infinitely expands?
``Anything that is gravitationally bound will remain
gravitationally bound,'' Daly said.
But because no new structures will form, ``the stars will
just age and die and everything will turn into a burned and
dirty ember. Finally there will be just a bunch of rocks left
... It will be a rather uninteresting and cold place.''
For now, though, there was a bit of rejoicing among the
astronomers that such cosmological questions could be addressed
based on empirical data rather than on theory.
``For the first time ever, we're going to actually have
data, that you will go to an experimentalist to find out what
the cosmology of the universe is, not to a philosopher,'' said
Saul Perlmutter of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
Perlmutter's team collected data on the light from exploded
stars, known as supernovae, to calculate how fast the universe
is expanding.
By knowing the speed of light and the relative dimness or
brightness of each supernova, they could determine how old and
how far away the supernovae were, and hence could estimate the
expansion rate of the universe.
Much of the data on supernovae were collected from
Earth-based telescopes. But the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope
also observed a specific type of supernova that is considered a
reliable indicator of distance because there is a direct link
between their intrinsic brightness and how fast they fade after
they explode.
Other teams used different methods for dealing with the data
from supernovae, and still others tracked the development and
decay of galactic clusters -- the largest known formations in
the universe -- and the energy from radio galaxies, which emit
huge plumes of radio waves that can be picked up by instruments
on Earth.
The five teams also agreed that the universe is probably
about 15 billion years old, a difference from earlier reports
that put the age at as little as 11 billion years. The higher
age estimate would also retire a modern astronomical conundrum
in which the oldest stars were believed to be older than the
universe itself.

This interesting article over infobeat imho seems to give the
Tipler scenario of life expanding to the omega point a boost
( life continuing indefinitely into the whole! universe ? )

I've got some extensions to put in ...
I don't know how the scientist came up with the 1/5 mass thing
can anyone out there enlighten us on the link between supernovae
and the possible open/expanding forever universe .... seems
pretty thin ....
I would think it's going to be an accurate mass census of the
universe .... all the dark stuff etc etc ...
Anyhow, if the universe seems to be forever running away ....
one could envisaged 'creating' more mass to slow down the expansion
so that 'we'(posthumans) and our tech can 'catch' up with the
expansion and ultimately populate the entire universe and resulting
in a stable and hyper-intelligent universe ....
Anyone care to comment

Enzyme provides ``fountain of youth'' for cells
By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Correspondent

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. scientists said Tuesday they had been

their telomeres and did not, as normal cells do, eventually stop
dividing and die.
``They are still dividing,'' Wright said.
This meant there could be very quick treatments for macular
degeneration, a very common cause of blindness, for skin damage
caused by burns and for atherosclerosis, the furring up of the
arteries that causes heart disease.
'`I think the medical implications of this work are really
profound,'' agreed Dr. Jerry Shay, who worked with Wright. ``It
will allow us now to take a person's own cells, manipulate and
rejuvenate them without using up their own lifespan, and then
re-inject them.''
In other words, it could be the break that gene therapists
have been looking for.
``In terms of the use of human cells, it will totally
transform genetic engineering,'' Wright said.
Gene therapy involves taking the cells of a person with a
genetic disease such as cystic fibrosis, inserting the healthy
gene and then putting the cells back in the patient in the hope
that the manipulated cells will take over.
But the engineered cells are old by the time the scientists
are through with them and often die off before they can do much
good. Wright hopes the telomerase process can make the cells
immortal and make them work better.
There are also implications for cancer. Several mutations
are needed for a cell to become cancerous, and one of them is
turning back on the telomerase gene. Perhaps turning it off
could help cure cancer patients without harming their healthy
body cells, Wright said.

Another piece of 'great' news
if they are going to ban cloning , well live long enough so
that the prevailing wisdom changes .... hee hee .
Seriously, if the telomerase process can be somehow implanted
back or incorporated genetically from the start of conception of
a new living organism ... hey hey hey
At least , aging has been show to be overcomed on a cellular
level , how much more work , do you guys see needs to be done ?

Not to mention the rather old lex and yacc, to write parsers.  Kernighan
and Pike wrote that yacc is one of the few survivors from a time when
lots of people were trying to write higher level things.  You specify a
grammar and it writes a parser, reportedly somewhat better than most
programmers could write.  I'm surprised you didn't mention it Lee, since
the Lojban project used it. :)  (Which weirded me out when I first heard
it.)

At any rate, why shouldn't there be more and more programmers?
Especially if the programmers are teaching computers how to replace many
of the non-programmers.

Programmers, bio-programmers, and janitors, that's the future...

Still awaiting an existence proof, myself.  I like a formulation of
liberalism, ironically drawn from socialists: conservatives believe power
should be in the hands of a trusted elite.  Democrats believe it should be in
the hands of the people.  Some 'radicals' believe it should be abolished.
Liberals don't trust anyone -- elite, people, themselves -- and don't believe
power can go away, so they favor spreading it around, even if that increases
it.  Diverse powers in Newtonian balance, cancelling out to zero.  
Some anarchists are similar, but seem to require breaking up large
concentrations of power so that lots of small power units can cancel out
better.

|3rd Expert Claims Probe of Brown's Death Botched
|By Christopher Ruddy
|FOR THE TRIBUNE-REVIEW
|January 13, 1998
|
|Washington - The head of the Armed Forces Institute of
|Pathology's forensic photography unit, like two other
|senior officials before her, has come forward to
|publicly claim that the military improperly handled the
|investigation of the death of Commerce Secretary Ron
|Brown.
|
|Chief Petty Officer Kathleen Janoski, a 22 year Navy
|veteran, also says she was told missing evidence of a
|possible homicide had been purposely destroyed.
|Janoski, the senior enlisted person at AFIP's
|Rockville, Md., offices, was present when Brown's body
|was examined by military pathologists at Dover Air
|Force Base in Delaware.
|
|The examination of Brown's remains took place four days
|after an Air Force CT-43 jet carrying him and 34 others
|crashed into a mountainside near Croatia's Dubrovnik
|airport on April 3, 1996.
|
|Janoski had initially declined to be interviewed but
|changed her mind shortly before a gag order was issued
|to AFIP staff. She came forward, she said, because AFIP
|had failed to properly investigate possible wrongdoing
|by its own officials in the Brown case, and because of
|the way the military treated two AFIP pathologists, Air
|Force Lt. Col. Steve Cogswell and Army Lt. Col. David
|Hause. 
|
|In Tribune-Review articles last month, Cogswell and
|Hause both went public about a small circular hole
|found in the very top of Brown's head. Both
|pathologists contend it looked like a gunshot wound and
|should have prompted an autopsy. No autopsy was
|performed.
|
|Janoski said she was disturbed by criticism of the
|lieutenant colonels and suggestions that their actions
|may be politically motivated. She described both
|pathologists as "serious professionals" and
|"competent." 
|
|Partisan politics has nothing to do with the issues at
|hand, she suggested, noting that she has been a
|lifelong and active Democrat, beginning with volunteer
|work for the 1972 presidential campaign of George
|McGovern. She says she voted for Bill Clinton and is
|proud to receive a White House Christmas Card each year
|for having worked as a volunteer at the Clinton White
|House.  
|
|INTERNAL PROBE 
|
|After Cogswell's allegations first surfaced in the
|Tribune-Review, AFIP launched an internal investigation
|of Cogswell and others to find out why and how the
|information about Brown's head wound got to the press. 
|
|Janoski said she was stunned that AFIP inquiry focused
|on the actions of Cogswell when she felt the real issue
|was AFIP's handling of Brown's death. 
|
|"The investigation is nothing more than a witch hunt.
|(AFIP) should be investigating what happened to the
|missing head X-rays. No one at AFIP seems to care that
|Brown did not receive an autopsy," Janoski said.
|
|On Easter Sunday, 1996, the task of examining Brown's
|body fell to Col. William Gormley, the highest ranking
|AFIP officer at Dover that day. 
|
|While Gormley conducted an external examination of
|Brown's body, Janoski was busy photographing and
|documenting his injuries. Brown was still partially
|clad in a his torn trousers. His body was intact, with
|chemical burns to his torso and face and several
|noticeable lacerations on the front, sides and top of
|his head. 
|
|As she continued to shoot photos, she noticed a large
|area of torn skin that left the top of Brown's skull
|exposed. 
|
|She was startled to find another injury. Dead center in
|the top of the head she observed what appeared to her
|to be a gunshot wound: a perfectly circular hole in the
|skull. 
|
|"Wow, look at the hole in Ron Brown's head. It looks
|like a gunshot wound," Janoski recalls exclaiming.
|
|Janoski has served as chief of forensic photography for
|2 (1/2) years, and has, by her account, handled
|numerous cases involving either gunshots or plane
|crashes. She received training at the FBI Academy and
|elsewhere in observing, identifying and photographing
|gunshot and other wounds. 
|
|Janoski's comments caused an immediate hubbub in the
|morgue facility, and several pathologists came over to
|view the wound. 
|
|One was Hause, a former Gulf War combat surgeon with 
|significant plane accident and gunshot experience.
|Hause examined the hole and said it looked like a .45
|caliber gunshot entry wound.
|
|Gormley, who has approximately 25 years of experience
|in pathology, has said that he, too, identified the
|wound as a "red flag" and that he consulted with other
|pathologists present, including Hause and Navy Cmdr.
|Edward Kilbane.
|
|"They agreed it look like an entrance gunshot wound,"
|Gormley recalled in a recent television interview. 
|
|In two interviews with the Tribune-Review, Gormley
|maintained he ruled out the possibility of a gunshot
|because he observed, on closer inspection, that the
|circular hole did not penetrate Brown's skull into the
|brain. He said the brain was not visible, and had a
|bullet struck Brown's head, it would have penetrated
|the skull. 
|
|Soon after the Tribune-Review published a photograph of
|the wound as well as photos of X-rays that showed the
|skull had been penetrated, Gormley changed his story. 
|
|During a television appearance, he admitted that the
|photo and X-ray indeed showed the skull was penetrated
|and brown's brain was visible.
|
|Gormley noted it had been more than a year and a half
|since the Brown crash, and said he had simply forgotten
|what the wound looked like. In his initial report on
|the examination, Gormley noted the bullet had
|penetrated the skull. He maintained that the hole
|definitely wasn't a gunshot wound because X-rays showed
|no slug or metal fragments in the head, and there was
|no exit wound.
|
|In a recent press statement, AFIP said extensive
|"forensic tests" disproved a bullet theory. Janoski
|said she was present for the entire examination and she
|did not observe any forensic tests, such those for
|gunpowder residue around the wound. 
|
|MISSING X-RAYS
|
|In addition to pictures of the corpse itself, Janoski
|took photos of the original head and body X-rays while
|they were pinned to a lightbox.
|
|After her slide film was developed, Janoski said she
|stored the images, which are typically used by
|pathologists for lectures and are not part of the
|official case file, in her office desk.
|
|Almost six months later, Janoski said she was prompted
|to review the film after Brown's name surfaced during a
|discussion with Jean Marie Sentell, a naval criminal
|investigator assigned to the AFIP. Sentell had also
|been present when Brown's body was examined. 
|
|Janoski alleges Sentell told her the original X-rays of
|Brown's head had been replaced in the case file.
|Janoski said she remembers that Sentell specifically
|told her "the first head X-ray that showed a 'lead
|snowstorm' was destroyed, and a second X-ray, that was
|less dense, was taken."
|
|Janoski said she had to ask, "What are you talking
|about?" in reference to Sentell's phrase "lead
|snowstorm." According to Janoski, Sentell explained
|that a lead snowstorm is the description of a pattern
|of metal fragments that appears on an X-ray after a
|bullet has disintegrated inside a body. 
|
|Janoski said Sentell did not say who destroyed the X-
|rays. 
|
|Sentell did not respond to repeated Tribune-Review
|phone messages seeking comment, even after being
|informed of Janoski's statements. An AFIP spokesman
|said Sentell declined to be interviewed. 
|
|After the conversation with Sentell, Janoski said she
|rummaged through her own desk and found the slide film
|she had taken of the original head X-rays. She gave the
|film to Cogswell to review. 
|
|Cogswell contends the original frontal X-ray of Brown's
|head indeed showed an apparent "lead snowstorm" of
|metal fragments in brown's head. Cogswell has stated
|that the suspicious hole and the X-ray should have
|prompted AFIP to notify the FBI that Brown's death was
|a possible homicide.
|
|Cogswell, too, has alleged that he heard that the first
|X-rays were destroyed. 
|
|Still curious about the matter, Janoski pulled out
|Brown's official case file and discovered that the file
|contained only 15 X-rays of Brown, none of which were
|of the skull. She found neither of the original X-rays
|that she had photographed on the lightbox. 
| 
|Janoski said she became terrified when she realized
|that "I  possessed the only physical evidence that
|those X-rays ever existed."  
|
|AFIP director Col. Michael Dickerson has acknowledged
|that all  skull X-rays of Brown are missing from the
|case file. 
|
|Gormley has stated that the initial head X-rays did
|show possible fragments that concerned him at the time,
|but that Brown's head was X-rayed again and he
|discovered the pattern of fragments on the initial 
|X-ray was actually caused by a defect in the 
|reusable film cartridge. 
|     
|The new images did not show any fragments in the head,
|but they, like the originals photographed by Janoski,
|have disappeared.
|
|One of the pathologists involved questions the timing
|of AFIP's explanation.
|
|"I find it interesting that this explanation about the
|film cartridge defect came after Lt. Col Cogswell made
|his allegations, and not at the time we were at Dover,"
|said Hause. 
|
|Hause, who made these comments to the Tribune-Review
|before a gag order had been placed on AFIP staff, said
|he does not recall ever being told there was problem
|with the X-rays. 
|
|Janoski noted that the photos she took of other Brown
|X-rays on the light box did not show any such pattern.
|
|Gormley and AFIP have not offered any explanation for
|how the  X-rays disappeared. Gormley referred calls to
|AFIP spokesman Chris Kelly,  who said that Gormley
|would not grant an additional interview.
|
|In recent days, Janoski was contacted and asked if she
|stood by her earlier comments. She said she did and
|added that AFIP officials are determined to "turn Lt.
|Col. Cogswell into scapegoat."
|
|She said AFIP investigators recently presented her with
|a list questions that focused on how the photographic
|images had found their way to the press. 
|
|"I was never advised of my rights, and the tone and
|manner... was threatening and coercive," she said. 
|
|Janoski reiterated to the Tribune-Review that she had
|done nothing improper, and that AFIP should be
|concentrating on why Ron Brown "did not receive a
|proper death investigation."

That's been the goal from day one and a lot of progress has been made, but 
the trouble is that as our programming tools get smarter our ambition gets 
larger too and we write more complex programs, so it never gets any easier.
 
In 1946 with the original "Eniac" if you wanted to change the program you had 
to change the plugs in a vast patch panel. Turing's "Colossus" built earlier 
didn't even have a path panel, you had to get out your soldering gun. 
A programmer didn't write code, he wrote about what wire should go where.
Later when computers had  stored programs you could get rid of the patch 
panel, but you still had no high level computer language, or even a decent 
assembler, so you had to have detailed knowledge of every aspect of the 
hardware you were writing for, the sort of knowledge only circuit designers
worry about now, and everything you wrote was in zeros and ones. Needless to 
say programs were very simple by today's standards. All these tasks still 
need to done, but now a machine does the job and we can just forget about 
them. Imagine if today a programmer was  confronted with a patch panel the 
size of the Himalayas and told to change the patches so the machine acted 
like Windows NT. It could not be done.

At one time 26 dimensions were in vogue, but now the most popular Superstring 
Theory postulates that all "elementary" particles are made up of one 
dimensional strings that vibrate in 10 dimensions of space-time, 9 of space 
and 1 of time. The reason we don't notice the other 6 spatial dimensions in 
everyday life is that they are curled up so tightly that they only become
significant when you approach the Plank Length of 10^-33 cm. Not much 
experimental evidence for this idea yet, but it's really just a work in 
progress.

Michio Kaku wrote a book called Hyperspace thats about the 10 dimensions, i
havent read it yet though, altho ive heard an interview with him.  Im
wondering, do the 10 dimensions include the 0 dimension, making 11 total?
(0-point, 1-line, 2-plane, 3-d etc..)

Your first mistake was using a "conspiracy theory" book as your sole
historical reference.  Not only are your examples way out of context, but
irrelevant.  Bell Helicopter was *the* vendor of helicopters to the
military *long* before the Vietnam (First delivery to the military in
1946).  Additionally, Bell was  one of the most prominent developers of new
aerospace technologies from WWII through the Vietnam War (first American
jet powered aircraft, first aircraft to break the sound barrier, *the*
leader in helicopter technology, etc) and received numerous military
contracts during the time period prior to the Vietnam war.  The founder of
Bell (Larry Bell?) died circa 1956, at which point the essentially
leaderless company became more or less for sale until they were finally
bought by Textron in 1960.  First National Bank had very little to do with
promoting a company who at the time was already considered to be the leader
in military helicopter technology.

Boeing is an even stupider example, which I'll get to in a moment.

You shot yourself in the foot here.  Boeing nearly went *bankrupt* after
WWII, as production of wartime products effectively stopped.  Boeing bet
the entire company on the 707 whiched was successful enough to keep the
company going.

The huge profit increases from '65-'70 correspond to the wildly successful
sales of the Boeing 727 (starting in 1964) and the best-selling commercial
aircraft ever, the 737, which became an instant success when introduced in
1967.  The large profit increases you noted were in no way related to war
time efforts, but in the commercial sector instead.
  
I *seriously* suggest that you take the time to research your evidence
prior to puking this crap all over the mailing list.  By citing your sole
source as a conspiracy novel, you make yourself look like even more of an
idiot.

Rich families are always in the top political positions because it is very
expensive to be a politician.  This is true even in the most socialist
countries.  But it is a good investment for rich people because the
government is an advantageous source of power that they can control.  A
source of power that wouldn't exist on the free market.  Take away this
unfair advantage and they have to compete based on their virtues, just like
everyone else.

Well duh.  That's the whole point.  A free market economy has never been
tried in any significant sense because government always gets in the way.
Do you think the government wants a free market?  Come to Silicon Valley
sometime and ask your average independant consultant.  Even a "pseudo-free
market" like the Internet scares the hell out of government because it
devalues their power structures.  But hey, they're in a postion to
legislate that nuisance away...

So what are you missing?  It obviously follows that if you eliminate the
government, you eliminate the power elite.  The only power elite that can
exist in a free market, exist by their own ingenuity.  What's so wrong with
a level playing field?

The only people who have to work harder are people too inflexible or too
stupid to work smarter.  Average people would enjoy the benefits of
progress a great deal more if they spent more of their energy accustomizing
themselves to it rather than resisting it.  Ability to adapt *is* an
evolutionary advantage.

In a free market economy, it is highly unlikely that all the major
industries would be making record profits and unemployment would be
increasing.  Most likely this is the result of subsidies, where a company
can make a decent profit, but be terribly non-competitive in the face of
foreign competition.  Many European countries are in this situation right
now, especially in the tech industries.  If government support didn't exist
for these industries, darwinian selection would have bred industries that
could actually result in economy-improving profits (government provided
profits are worthless as the money is effectively removed from the economy
in the first place).

Too protect populations from people with power who don't have your high
moral standards?  Actually, there is a rather large difference between
European militaries and the US military in general (which may be tempering
your view).  In many European countries (Germany, for example) the military
is used as an auxiliary police arm of the government, many times quite
violently.  This is simply not the case with the professional US
militaries, which have virtually no adversarial contact within the domestic
population.

Every person is the architect of their own future, be it good or bad.

People who start poor and stay poor either 1) don't mind being poor, 2)
make a lot of stupid choices that keep them poor, or 3) don't work hard
enough to change their socio-economic status.  Period.  In the US,
opportunities abound for a person to change their lot in life, and a person
can take advantage of them at almost any time in their life.  Whose fault
is it if they don't take advantage of these opportunities?  A clone would
be in a situation no different than everyone else.

One thing is for certain:  the government does very little to help people
work harder or make intelligent decisions.  Therefore, it should be no
surprise that the attempts of government to control poverty (by programs
like Welfare) do little to change the socio-economic status of the
individual involved.

The Genetic Algorithms Archive
http://www.aic.nrl.navy.mil/galist/

John Koza has a variant of GA he called GP patented (strictly speaking, I
do not see any difference in evolving code and data, for code is just data
interpreted by an abstract entity). He initiated a school of evolving
code trees of a Lisp subset, with sometimes interesting results.

The good things about GA/GP is that you need just to formally specify the
constraints, i.e. the results which you want to get. The method, in
theory, would generate systems with progressively higher fitness, which
ideally would met your specs fully. This might be useless for
cryptosystems, but great for VLSI design and real-world control problems.
Another cool things are GA evolved IFS for image compression, synthesis
and artwork.

I think what cripples current system is that the GA/GP system's metalevel
(obviously only the fitness function should be sacred, orelse we float off
into Never-Never land) is not open to GA optimization, which makes the
resulting system limited, and brittle. A good GP must adjust at least the
mutation rate and the coding to guarantee a certain kind of optimal
fitness landscape (roughly, a small ball in genespace encompassing maximal
variety in phenotypespace, while genespace being permeated by lots of
neutral filaments (multiple nonlethal migration pathways out of the local
minimum trap)).

I think such systems are easiest to design as CAs, which coincides nicely
with the expected (it'd better) future evolution of computer hardware. 
Random defect hit density for deep-submicron WSI considered, evolvable
hardware must obviously favour tiniest dies possible -- CA cells. (Just
for this time, I won't plug molecular dot CAMs here).

>From "New Technology Week"

Whether it's in longer-lasting drill bits, cosmetics that block the sun as well
as enhance personal appearance, or improved disk-drive heads to boost
data-storage density, nanotechnology is beginning to make its mark on the
American economy.
But the ability of U.S. industry to fully exploit the potential of
nanotechnology is not assured, according to the National Science Foundation
(NSF), which is leading an effort to get researchers in universities,
government, and industry to coordinate and collaborate more effectively.
In the last year NSF has quietly enlisted a dozen federal research agencies in
an ad hoc forum known as the Interagency Nanotechnology Group. The aim is to
provide a means of tracking the wide array of basic and applied research in
nanotechnology conducted in the United States.
"It is essential to have a coordinated activity in nanotechnology," says Mike
Roco, program director at NSF's Engineering Directorate. What the United States
is up against, he notes, is targeted research efforts backed by government
funding in Japan and Europe.
European R&D efforts in nanotechnology are supported both at a national level
and by the European Union. Germany's Federal Ministry of Research and
Technology is spending $50 million a year, and France is spending a similar
amount. Smaller efforts are under way in the UK, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,
and Russia.
Government agencies in Japan also are estimated to be investing at least $50
million a year in the field. In addition, there is strong support for
nanoscience and nanotechnology in Japanese industry. Elsewhere in Asia, China,
Taiwan, Korea, and Singapore have ongoing research efforts in nanotechnology.
At present annual U.S. federal spending on nanoscience and nanotechnology is
estimated at about $115 million, with about $63 million coming from NSF. Other
federal agencies supporting research in the field include the Air Force Office
of Scientific Research, Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, Department of
Commerce, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Department of Energy
(DOE), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), National
Institutes of Health (NIH), Naval Research Laboratory, National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST), and Office of Naval Research (ONR).
While the scope of U.S. research is diverse, it takes in basic science, as well
as industry- and DOD-driven development programs, it is by no means
comprehensive.
"(W)e have kinds of islands of knowledge," explains Roco. "There are many
experiments. We do not have good simulations and we do not have good methods to
build for a given purpose or a given use."
The U.S. is at a disadvantage because its research efforts in the field, which
encompasses such diverse areas as biology, chemistry, and physics, can be
relatively disconnected. At the same time, there are many unknowns, because
physical and chemical processes often yield different results at the nanoscale.
"The time has come to create the infrastructure for this field," says Roco,
stressing that the U.S. needs to position itself now on the nanotechnology
highway if it is going to reap big rewards in the decades to come.
Indeed, he says, ensuring that an adequate foundation exists in the U.S. for
exploring and utilizing nanotechnology is "the main goal that we see" for the
Interagency Nanotechnology Group.
What's the rush? Roco warns that if the nation's research communities don't
strengthen their focus now on the technology, which he describes as one of "the
most revolutionary forces in the next century," it could be difficult for many
American companies to compete in the future.
Nanoscience and nanotechnology cut across many industries, including
pharmaceuticals, electronics, chemical production and refining, and materials.
They are attracting growing research support because the technology provides a
means to enhance the structure and performance of materials at the molecular
level.
And already there is considerable evidence that ability to control the
composition of structures at dimensions of 50 nanometers or smaller can produce
breakthroughs in coatings, electronic components, and biomedicine. Some
estimates put the market for nanoparticles, nano-engineered materials, and
other nanotechnology at more than $1 billion annually.
The potential of the technology can barely be imagined, says Roco, who likens
its current state to that of computers in the 1950s. "People still have doubts
about this, but not the people who see the future," he says.
Roco's agency apparently agrees. NSF is boosting support for nanoscience and
nanotechnology by $10.6 million in fiscal year 1998. The agency allocated about
$63 million in FY 1997 to science programs that directly or indirectly
supported nanoscience and nanotechnology.
NSF's directorates for biological sciences; computer and information science
and engineering; engineering; and mathematical and physical sciences expect to
award around 20 grants of $300,000 to $700,000 each. Beyond just boosting the
level of research activity, the new NSF initiative is explicitly designed to
start drawing scattered researchers together in collaborative R&D efforts (see
story on page 9).
The grants program will engage other federal agencies in a novel way. In
addition to the standard peer review panel, 12 federal research agencies will
be able to observe and comment on project proposals. And, where appropriate,
NSF may send researchers with solid proposals to other federal agencies
supporting nanotechnology R&D.
Larry Kabacoff, a researcher at ONR's Materials Division, says the concept is
innovative and constructive. Not only will it give other R&D agencies an
opportunity to do some cherry picking, but it also should benefit NSF, he says.
"You need to have people who know why they are doing something (beyond just
pursuing good science)," says Kabacoff, noting that there may be a sound basis
for rejecting proposals if they have little relevance to other research or when
net benefit may be marginal.
Robert Shull, leader of the Magnetic Materials Group at NIST, rates NSF's new
grants initiative, along with the activities of the Interagency Nanotechnology
Group, as a good start at coordinating R&D in the field.
"We need to find out where there are big gaps in our knowledge. I know we are
going to finds big holes. This field is still in its formative stages," says
Shull. "What I'd like to get out of this is to identify barriers for developing
things faster and getting it into industry so that we begin to see real
progress."
Efforts to coordinate nanoscience and nanotechnology research across the
federal sector are supported by Herb Goronkin of Motorola. He suggests,
however, that such efforts be restrained because the field is very young, and
because it crosses so many scientific disciplines and industries. Cookie-cutter
approaches to research coordination, he says, aren't appropriate for the
nanoworld.
Neither NSF nor the Interagency Nanotechnology Group is seeking to place
limitations on research in the field, Roco says. Indeed, he contends that the
interagency group just wants to help "drive the field" to assure that it
develops adequately in the U.S. "You don't want to do this," he adds, "by
setting a lot of formal rules."
Nevertheless, Roco says, its now essential to have some sort of framework for
following R&D activities in the United States if nanotechnology is to get
better recognition from federal research funding agencies, the Congress, and
industry.
In pursuit of that goal, NSF, NASA, NIH, DOE, NIST, and ONR will hold a
workshop on the status of nanotechnology in conjunction with the World
Technology Evaluation Center on February 10 in Arlington, Va.
The group also is expected to push next year to get the White House's Office of
Science and Technology Policy to focus on nanotechnology and its long-term
infrastructure needs.

Each (metric) space has a certain dimensionality, an intrinsic
property of how it hangs together. Simply speaking the number of
dimensions of a space is the number of coordinates you need to
uniquely determine the position of a point. On a line you just need
one, in a plane you need two, in 3D you need three and in higher
dimensional spaces you need more. Higher dimensional spaces can of
course have lower dimensional spaces as a subset (like a line in the
plane or a plane inside a 3D space). 

Note that "dimensions" often are misused to mean something completely
different, especially in comic book physics where it seems to mean
"alternate universe".

There are infinitely many kinds of spaces of a given dimensionality
(and most are not isomorphic to each other), the big question is which
of them correspond to our universe.

I can attest to the opportunities here. When I got out of the Air Force, I was
unemployable. My skills with aircraft were not needed, as airlines and aircraft
mfrs. were laying people off. I was also broke. I lived a rather scarce existence
for about 3-6 months, until I was working 3 really BS jobs. A short time later, I
went into business with two other guys based on a device I invented. That lasted
for 5 years until the bottom fell out of the energy conservation industry in '95.
Then I was again difficult to employ, but I built up the computer skills I had
learned while running my business, and now I'm working for a software company,
making more money than before, and learning all sorts of new stuff. I do computer
consulting on the side, and am working on another invention. Change is difficult,
but good, and it makes life interesting. At get togethers, I've always got lots
of stories to tell because I've done a LOT of different things.

At the same time, as I've been unemployed several times, not once have I received
government support. I've applied a few times, but since I'm an able bodied white
male with no dependents, they always find a loophole to exclude me, and they try
to make the experience so humiliating that you just want to go out and shoot
yourself (which could be good or bad: if people don't like the experience, they
might be more motivated to get off their asses, as I have, but the treatment
could also act as a vicious cycle, keeping poor people too depressed with poor
self esteem to think that they can get off their asses.)

You've just re-invented a major research subject in computer science.
When I was at MIT, carrying my slide rule made of a Brontosaurus
thighbone, I knew people on the Automatic Programming Project within
Project MAC. They were working on compilers :-)

Some current VHLLs are almost magical (in the Clarkian sense) compared 
to the state of the art a few years ago. The software developers using 
them are still by and large running as fast as they can to keep up. 
Reasons:

1. Good new applications have a tendency to breed more demand from the 
user community.

2. In applications programming, coding time is no longer the schedule 
driver, if it ever was. Maintenance and rework, from faulty processes 
and from incomplete and shifting user requirements, are a much larger
drain.

Within the field, only a relatively small percentage of software people 
are working on new product development, while many labor away at data 
processing chores that do not contribute anything new. I don't see this 
changing either, until our machines have enough intelligence to start 
taking over this kind of development (how much intelligence does 
"Add/Change/Inquire/Delete" take, anyway? :-). Too much of this work is 
still being done by people who could be doing more innovative stuff, 
but there is a lot of uptake of "non-technical" people to do HTML,
end-user database development, and so on. This is not without a 
downside. My former boss at MTI, a small Boston-area consultancy and 
software shop, used to say, "If you make programming easy enough that 
non-programmers can do it, the trouble is, they WILL." 

So, on the whole, the process you envision is happening, in an
evolutionary way so far. There will be a software singularity, though,
and I can see it being the leading edge of The Singularity. When AI
software design agents work 24x7 on GHz machines and continually
replicate and refine themselves, revolution will oustrip evolution in
software development. (If I believe that, why am I not working on AI?
Good damned question.)

It was good to see you didn't fall into the common media misnomer of
conflating semi-automatic program generators (where you have to press
enter for each new program) with automatic program generators (where
new programs are fired off at a high rate as long as the key is held
down). 
 
Ad Astra,

IMHO, cloning in and of itself is not bad, what has to be considered is 
what you do with the clone afterwards. If you clone a Sheep, Dog or a 
Human, what do you do then, just chop it up for food or parts? The party 
involved should have a Parent's responsibility for that new organism. If I 
had a clone made of myself, and of course it would not grow to full size 
for many years, I would want to bring it up as a full person, not just a 
"body bag of parts". People seem to attach to much _religious_ topics to 
it, and not enough _natural_ topics.

Whether it is Cloning, Abortion or Genetics/Eugenics, you would think 
people would apply parenting to the problem first. If you are stopping an 
organism from becoming fully alive, changing it's genetic life or even 
creating a new life, it is still deserves a modicum of respect. It just 
seems that the news blows it up as a threat to society?

Fortunately enough, the mundanes understand effects of
only few technologies that directly relate to their
world (I do not expect any government to pass a ban
on certain classes of QM theories, for example).
Also, they ban the work when it mostly done, and
is just about to produce a "scary" effect.
  Even with these restrictions, they still work on
biotech, crypto, etc., because they produce things
the mundanes and their governments actually need now;
this both creates a foundation for transformations
of extropian interest, and raises the level of public
acceptance (I find the levels of synthetic supplements
consumption among regular athletes and New Age folk
just amazing).
  And then, at some point, there will be more ways to
hide interesting research from the government, and
people may have increased interest in it - if now
millions of people risk severe punishment for using
chemicals to build muscles or get high, just imagine
what they'd do for dramatic health improvement and
life extent ion.

Meanwhile - could somebody build a cloning facility
outside the "civilized" countries?

  I understand, and I can see what you mean. Its always good to start with a
more narrow focus, I guess I just wanted to make sure that this concept was
considered the backbone, that which is in need of little debate or waste of
bandwidth. Based on this, we should engage in legal cases where clear issues
of infringement of rights to use technology are infringed. I agree that while
what I originally was proposing just sounded like Libertarian Party II, we
need to put a more narrow focus on to emphasisze the technological aspects.

I think that the present cloning thing we should really rally about, as its
really becoming a flash point. Things are getting WAY out of hand.  If we had
a program with "Harry & Betty Smith" as the subjects, two ordinary people who
can't have healthy kids unless they clone, produced and put on one of the tv
news programs or some such, we could start to score points. Maybe get a couple
of religious nuts to say some really embarrassing things to illustrate who the
radicals really are.

It took me a little while to decipher this, so for our studio audience,
the answer to danny's original question is "no", because you need no
coordinates at all to determine the position of a point in a point, so
if you're counting coordinates or writing equations, the 0-dimension
never shows up.

Sigh, that doesn't sound clear enough either.  I probably got an intuitive
grasp of it from reading "Flatland", but not enough to explain it to
laymen.  Oh well.

Also we should keep working on our local media to cover these
issues better. Here in Atlanta today the local major paper
buried the telomerase story way back in D6! Personally I
think it should have been front page news (which they did
with cloning BTW) and I dropped them a note to say so. They
haven't even mentioned this whole Euro cloning ban thing
either.

check it out at http://www.wildauction.com .  Please note, due to our new SSL features some users (In particular AOL and 
IE3.x Users), Will have to use the unsecure registration. As a bonus to our first customers we are offering free shipping.  
You asked about what makes us different from the competition.  That's easy!

No minimum bids!
No Reserve prices!
On a dedicated T3!
Secure registration!
Loaded with computer products!

Again, the password protections have been removed so check it out.  You might even get a pentium 233MMX for 
around 40 bucks. (there aren't that many bidders yet :)

Thanks,
John

I find this very interesting - I understood perfectly what both Anders
and Kennita were saying, as I'm sure many others did - but why is this
so difficult to explain?  As Kennita puts it, we seem to have an
"intuitive grasp" of the idea.  If this is so, what was it that first
gave us this?  The same can be said of many other subjects which may be
considered extropian such as quantum theory (e.g. wave particle
duality).  What is it about such subjects that causes them to require
understanding on an intuitive level?  Is it their complexity, or just
their bizarreness?

I'm sure physics teachers (and people trying to explain other extropian
ideas) would love to know! @:-)

Reports of the death of the telomerase theory of aging have been greatly 
exaggerated. I think this is the biggest news since Dolly, and speaking of 
Dolly, there is a very obvious experiment that I'm sure somebody has thought 
of and already started.

Take a gene for telomerase production and a gene to turn it on and insert 
them into a sheep cell. With present techniques when you insert a gene into a 
cell it almost never finds its way to the correct place on the chromosome and 
gets expressed properly. It may take millions or billions of attempts before 
everything works correctly, but you can put trillions of cells in a test tube 
and if you also include a signaling gene for antibiotic resistance or for 
the production of a small amount of florescent dye, you can find the one 
successful cell out of billions. Then you use that cell to make a clone and 
observe if you get a cancerous sheep, an immortal sheep, or no sheep at all. 
Whatever the results of this experiment it will give us a profound lesson in 
how life works. We live in exciting times.

It seems that many have missed the first, admittedly somewhat informal
announcement -- hence this repost. 

The list is currently not being moderated, but will be as soon as traffic
goes up in volume. Slowly, but surely >Htech related forwards to the >H
list and extropians will cease.  As an experiment, we will be
investigating distributed moderation of (subscriber-submitted) content --
the truly smart web crawlers. As a side effect, this nicely takes care of
spam.

This is _not_ about further transhumanist balcanization, but should be
seen as an attempt to further contribute to the diversity of information
channels, to better fit your personal needs. Hopefully.

0. TRANSHUMANTECH
 Mailing List 

 This list is dedicated to the logical
 discussion of technologies of
 interest to transhumanists. 

 1. An Introduction to
 Transhumanism 

 Transhumanism is the idea of
 extending the biological object
 human through the use of
 high-level technology or other
 rational means. The Transhuman
 is supposed to have a superior
 body and/or mind. Research in
 Transhumanism covers
 technologies like cryonics,
 neurosciences, artificial
 intelligence, genetic engineering,
 nanotechnology, drugs and life
 extension. 

 All these technologies are complex
 and there are lots of books about
 each one. Many of them promise
 impressive progress in the future
 and maybe the Transcension of
 humankind. Transcension is no
 esoterical new age expression, it
 simply means the creation of
 Posthumans. People who want to
 further this goal and / or to become
 Transhuman in the future may call
 themselves Transhumanists. 

 2. What is Homo Excelsior? 

 Homo Excelsior is a magazine that
 is released on the web, as an
 ASCII file and as a compressed
 archive of the web version. It
 covers all topics of interest to
 Transhumanists, including book
 references, internet addresses and
 original articles. Its major goal is to
 further the Transcension, to outline
 dangers and possibilities and to
 show implications on society and
 power structures.

There had already been several unsuccessful attempts to immortalize non-human
cells with telomerase.  It was their failure which made me become very
skeptical of the telomerase theory.  I remain puzzled how telomerase could
avert the chromosomal traslocations, fissions, and fusions characteristic
of senescing cells and wonder if the human telomerase has regulatory 
functions as well as enzymatic ones.

Beating senescence is much bigger news than Dolly.  Cloning doesn't change
things too much, really; you can spread genes faster than with conventional
breeding but it doesn't allow much of interest that you couldn't do anyway.
Being able to grow "normal" cells in vitro indefinitely has all kinds of 
profound implications for research and organ replacement.

The error is in equating numbers of ways with probability. The opposite is more
true: Since there is, as far as we can tell, only one way for a universe to be
created, whatever the odds are will determine how many initially are or aren't,
and the conditions of that first something will determine whether there will be
more somethings.

All of that however, is equally irrelevant, as only those universes that are
capable of pondering their own existence really count (under the old tree in the
woods dillemma), so even if there is merely one universe with life, and the odds
of such universe developing are one in 10^^^10, and all universes outside that
one are unreachable, then Nozicks result is valid, just not for the reason he
claims.

I think they said that telomerase production was already turned on
in germ cells (e.g. egg cells).  These cells are already immortal in
the sense that some of their fission daughters become egg cells too,
ad infinitum.  So there must be something in the development process
which turns off telomerase production in most cell lines as they become
specialized.  Arranging to keep telomerase being produced throughout the
development process may be harder than just sticking an extra telomerase
gene into the egg cell.

In what universe?  My home machine is a PPro Dual 2x200, 64Mb, 4Gb,
20" monitor, 66MHz PCI, NT 4.0; I didn't pay $2895 for it, much less
$3895.  It's nice that Sun wants to compete with NT workstations,
but charging $1000 for their logo ain't the way to do it.

I will grant that the price/performance is still a little beyond the PC market, but it fills a nice gap.  Professionally, I do a lot of work on Sparc/Solaris, but use NT at home because of the cost of buying a decent Sparc workstation.  This causes a lot of difficulties for me when I work at home, especially if I am writing code specifically for the Solaris platform.

For software development, it is really nice to be able to work at home without making significant sacrifices because of serious cross-platform incapabilities (such as NT vs. Solaris/Unix/Posix threads), or application sacrifices (Linux is fine for portable Unix development, except for when I am developing binary extensions to products like Oracle, which happens to be a lot of my development work).

Having a "reasonably" priced Ultrasparc available gives more freedom of choice to people who do consulting or software development at home.  If nothing else, this is a move the RISC vendors should have done a long time ago.

It is axiomatic that a mathematical point has no dimensions.

I'm seeing more and more conspiracy theories posted to the Extropians
List.  TWA 800, Man arrested for child abuse just for spanking his son,
Microsoft evil empire, Gun Politics, Survivalism and Self Defense,
Avoiding Taxes, and now this.  They always seem to be posted without
comment or explanation.  Am I the only one who wonders what the

This is a letter to the editor I plan to send to my local paper
(Sacramento, CA) and a few other places (including the Pres.
himself, of course), and to place on my web site.  It is, like
all of my work, in the public domain, and I encourage everyone
to disseminate it as widely as possible, or edit and paraphrase
it to your liking, in the hope that some papers will have the
courage to print it.  Perhaps some will even read and understand it.



President Clinton and the Age of Ignorance

On May 25, 1961, President Kennedy called on the American
people to work toward the goal of landing a man on the moon,
expressing his hope that the nation would "move forward, with
the full speed of freedom, in the exciting adventure of space."
The age of discovery that followed his visionary goal saw not
only the moon landing itself but a cornucopia of advances in
science and industry that were side-effects of space research.
Diets improved, diseases were cured, cars and airplanes became
safer and cleaner, communication became faster and more
universal, and "space age" became the preferred description for
anything new and modern that made life better.

On January 10, 1997, President Clinton called on Congress to
ban the use of cloning technology on humans; the age of
discovery is now in danger of becoming the age of ignorance
and fear.  With science on the edge of discoveries in
biotechnology that promise to improve our diets, cure and
prevent disease, clean the environment, give hope to infertile
parents, and make life better in a thousand ways no one could
possibly predict, Clinton has allowed the irrational fears of
the Religious Right and the Luddite Left to put the brakes on
this exciting adventure before it has even begun.

Fear of the unknown is no excuse.  Much more is known now about
cloning--the form of reproduction used by most species on our
planet--than was known about space in 1961.  Identical twins
have been studied for decades.  Anyone who thinks a cloned child
is any different from a perfectly normal human baby is letting
bad science fiction stories cloud his understanding.

Clinton justifies his stance by saying that "scientific
advancement should not take place in a moral vacuum."  I
wholeheartedly agree.  It would be morally wrong for the
scientific community to stand idle and let the legislature
stifle research that could save thousands of lives.  It would
be morally wrong to tell two parents who carry a genetic disease
that they must abandon hope of having a child instead of using
a safe technique of science to bear a healthy, natural child of
their own without risk.

Morality and reason must be partners, not enemies.  If there are
dangers in the technology, we will find them by research, not by
wild speculation.  Shutting down reasearch will close off a new
generation from the benefits of this technology--and the possible
benefits are well known and too many to list here.  The possible
dangers are in mostly in the imagination of the uneducated.  But
even if the benefits were not well known, the research itself will
create new discoveries and opportunities the way space research
did in the past four decades.  I call on the American people, and
Congress, and the President, to look forward to a new age of
discovery in biosience, and all the miracles that it could bring.
I call on the scientific community to educate the people with
greater emphasis on real-life applications.  Let us all move
forward with the full speed of freedom toward better lives.

Here in Melbourne, Australia, it gets a small box this morning at the
bottom of the front page of The Age, one of the nation's major metropolitan
newspapers.  (The op-ed page has two contrasting pieces on the vileness vs
the worth of cloning human cells.)  

The telomere story featured on the news of the two non-commercial TV
channels last night, but in about fourth or five place, following stories
about drug testing of swimmers, the funeral of a murdered baby, and other
earth-shaking stuff.  Still, this was quite good by usual standards.
Hi-tech science breakthroughs and space events normally get the closing
slot, after the weather and financial details, usually with a quizzical
smile from the announcer (`What *will* those amusing and irrelevant nerds
get up to next?').

What did *I* do about it?  I e-rushed The Age a 900 word story [freelance
submission] called `The last mortal generation', culled from material on
telomeres in THE SPIKE and using the hottest info I could find on the Web
(and thanks to everyone who posted the news here on this list).  It will be
interesting to see if they run the story tomorrow or Saturday.  Go thou and
do likewise if thou hast the verbal prowess.

How about posting news of what sort of stuff may reall be going on that the
government and the media refuse to tell us. Its extropian in the
libertarian sense that we must take responsibility for keeping ourselves
informed of liberty related events, outside of government power monopoly
channels.

Nope. I try to bring it up most of the times somebody post, asking
what's extropian about the posts. Apparently some on this list thinks
that because they are interrested in extropy, that all they are
interrested in is extropian.

The problem with discussing these postings on the list (like now) is
that it's adding to the noise, so Usually I drop the case. Besides, the
posters allways have some poor excuse to why their post is extremely
important for extropians everywhere.

Infinities tend to cause problems in many places in probability 
theory. In this case, maybe we can fix the problem by 
introducing infinitesimals. So each of the infinitely many events 
would not have p(e)=0, but p(e)=i, where i is defined by i*oo=1.

Yes, it is of course problematic whether it makes sense at all to 
attribute an a priori probability of the world being in a certain 
way. Hmm... Inductive inferences, the rationality of which we can't 
doubt, implicitly presuppose that all sorts of things have 
conditional a priori probabilities; this seems to translate into an a 
priori probability assignment to all possible worlds... (I'm sorry 
I'm cryptic here; I just got an idea.)

Yes, it's not immediately obvious that this model doesn't raise more
difficulties than it resolves.  Luckily, David Deutsch addresses this topic
in his THE FABRIC OF REALITY (pp. 216-7):

`I said that [Shor's algorithm] requires only a few thousand arithmetic
operations.  I meant, of course, a few thousand operations *in each
universe* that contribute to the answer.  All those computations are
performed in parallel, in different universes, and share their results
through interference.'

That much, of course, is the basis for John Clark's claim.  The interesting
point follows:

`You may be wondering how we can persuade our counterparts in 10^500-odd
universes to start working on our factorization task.  Will they not have
their own agendas for the use of their computers?  No... Shor's algorrithm
operates initially only on a set of universes that are *identical* to one
another, and it causes them to become differentiated only within the
confines of the factorization engine. ...  There are, no doubt, many other
universes in which we programmed different numbers or never built the
factorization engine at all.  But those universe differ from ours in too
many variables - or more precisely, in variables that are not made to
interact in the right way by the programming of Shor's algorithm - and so
do not interfere with our universe.'

Is that the sort of issue you were thinking about, Mitch?

Actually, If you could forward the story to the Valley News here at:

I think you probably would produce a much more enjoyable story. I hope you post
it.

No, no, you're inserting it the wrong way.

True cryo-chic, or course, is to have both.  But yes, the
necklace makes a little more sense in that situation, while
the bracelet is a bit easier to wear (though it's a major
pain in the ass to put on).

||4th Expert Claims Probe of Brown's Death Botched
||By Christopher Ruddy
||FOR THE TRIBUNE-REVIEW
||January 13, 1998
||
||Washington - The head of the Armed Forces Institute of
||Pathology's forensic photography unit, like two other
||senior officials before her, has come forward to
||publicly claim that the military improperly handled the
||investigation of the death of Commerce Secretary Ron
||Brown.
||
||Chief Petty Officer Kathleen Janoski, a 22 year Navy
||veteran, also says she was told missing evidence of a
||possible homicide had been purposely destroyed.
||Janoski, the senior enlisted person at AFIP's
||Rockville, Md., offices, was present when Brown's body
||was examined by military pathologists at Dover Air
||Force Base in Delaware.
||
||The examination of Brown's remains took place four days
||after an Air Force CT-43 jet carrying him and 34 others
||crashed into a mountainside near Croatia's Dubrovnik
||airport on April 3, 1996.
||
||Janoski had initially declined to be interviewed but
||changed her mind shortly before a gag order was issued
||to AFIP staff. She came forward, she said, because AFIP
||had failed to properly investigate possible wrongdoing
||by its own officials in the Brown case, and because of
||the way the military treated two AFIP pathologists, Air
||Force Lt. Col. Steve Cogswell and Army Lt. Col. David
||Hause. 
||
||In Tribune-Review articles last month, Cogswell and
||Hause both went public about a small circular hole
||found in the very top of Brown's head. Both
||pathologists contend it looked like a gunshot wound and
||should have prompted an autopsy. No autopsy was
||performed.
||
||Janoski said she was disturbed by criticism of the
||lieutenant colonels and suggestions that their actions
||may be politically motivated. She described both
||pathologists as "serious professionals" and
||"competent." 
||
||Partisan politics has nothing to do with the issues at
||hand, she suggested, noting that she has been a
||lifelong and active Democrat, beginning with volunteer
||work for the 1972 presidential campaign of George
||McGovern. She says she voted for Bill Clinton and is
||proud to receive a White House Christmas Card each year
||for having worked as a volunteer at the Clinton White
||House.  
||
||INTERNAL PROBE 
||
||After Cogswell's allegations first surfaced in the
||Tribune-Review, AFIP launched an internal investigation
||of Cogswell and others to find out why and how the
||information about Brown's head wound got to the press. 
||
||Janoski said she was stunned that AFIP inquiry focused
||on the actions of Cogswell when she felt the real issue
||was AFIP's handling of Brown's death. 
||
||"The investigation is nothing more than a witch hunt.
||(AFIP) should be investigating what happened to the
||missing head X-rays. No one at AFIP seems to care that
||Brown did not receive an autopsy," Janoski said.
||
||On Easter Sunday, 1996, the task of examining Brown's
||body fell to Col. William Gormley, the highest ranking
||AFIP officer at Dover that day. 
||
||While Gormley conducted an external examination of
||Brown's body, Janoski was busy photographing and
||documenting his injuries. Brown was still partially
||clad in a his torn trousers. His body was intact, with
||chemical burns to his torso and face and several
||noticeable lacerations on the front, sides and top of
||his head. 
||
||As she continued to shoot photos, she noticed a large
||area of torn skin that left the top of Brown's skull
||exposed. 
||
||She was startled to find another injury. Dead center in
||the top of the head she observed what appeared to her
||to be a gunshot wound: a perfectly circular hole in the
||skull. 
||
||"Wow, look at the hole in Ron Brown's head. It looks
||like a gunshot wound," Janoski recalls exclaiming.
||
||Janoski has served as chief of forensic photography for
||2 (1/2) years, and has, by her account, handled
||numerous cases involving either gunshots or plane
||crashes. She received training at the FBI Academy and
||elsewhere in observing, identifying and photographing
||gunshot and other wounds. 
||
||Janoski's comments caused an immediate hubbub in the
||morgue facility, and several pathologists came over to
||view the wound. 
||
||One was Hause, a former Gulf War combat surgeon with 
||significant plane accident and gunshot experience.
||Hause examined the hole and said it looked like a .45
||caliber gunshot entry wound.
||
||Gormley, who has approximately 25 years of experience
||in pathology, has said that he, too, identified the
||wound as a "red flag" and that he consulted with other
||pathologists present, including Hause and Navy Cmdr.
||Edward Kilbane.
||
||"They agreed it look like an entrance gunshot wound,"
||Gormley recalled in a recent television interview. 
||
||In two interviews with the Tribune-Review, Gormley
||maintained he ruled out the possibility of a gunshot
||because he observed, on closer inspection, that the
||circular hole did not penetrate Brown's skull into the
||brain. He said the brain was not visible, and had a
||bullet struck Brown's head, it would have penetrated
||the skull. 
||
||Soon after the Tribune-Review published a photograph of
||the wound as well as photos of X-rays that showed the
||skull had been penetrated, Gormley changed his story. 
||
||During a television appearance, he admitted that the
||photo and X-ray indeed showed the skull was penetrated
||and brown's brain was visible.
||
||Gormley noted it had been more than a year and a half
||since the Brown crash, and said he had simply forgotten
||what the wound looked like. In his initial report on
||the examination, Gormley noted the bullet had
||penetrated the skull. He maintained that the hole
||definitely wasn't a gunshot wound because X-rays showed
||no slug or metal fragments in the head, and there was
||no exit wound.
||
||In a recent press statement, AFIP said extensive
||"forensic tests" disproved a bullet theory. Janoski
||said she was present for the entire examination and she
||did not observe any forensic tests, such those for
||gunpowder residue around the wound. 
||
||MISSING X-RAYS
||
||In addition to pictures of the corpse itself, Janoski
||took photos of the original head and body X-rays while
||they were pinned to a lightbox.
||
||After her slide film was developed, Janoski said she
||stored the images, which are typically used by
||pathologists for lectures and are not part of the
||official case file, in her office desk.
||
||Almost six months later, Janoski said she was prompted
||to review the film after Brown's name surfaced during a
||discussion with Jean Marie Sentell, a naval criminal
||investigator assigned to the AFIP. Sentell had also
||been present when Brown's body was examined. 
||
||Janoski alleges Sentell told her the original X-rays of
||Brown's head had been replaced in the case file.
||Janoski said she remembers that Sentell specifically
||told her "the first head X-ray that showed a 'lead
||snowstorm' was destroyed, and a second X-ray, that was
||less dense, was taken."
||
||Janoski said she had to ask, "What are you talking
||about?" in reference to Sentell's phrase "lead
||snowstorm." According to Janoski, Sentell explained
||that a lead snowstorm is the description of a pattern
||of metal fragments that appears on an X-ray after a
||bullet has disintegrated inside a body. 
||
||Janoski said Sentell did not say who destroyed the X-
||rays. 
||
||Sentell did not respond to repeated Tribune-Review
||phone messages seeking comment, even after being
||informed of Janoski's statements. An AFIP spokesman
||said Sentell declined to be interviewed. 
||
||After the conversation with Sentell, Janoski said she
||rummaged through her own desk and found the slide film
||she had taken of the original head X-rays. She gave the
||film to Cogswell to review. 
||
||Cogswell contends the original frontal X-ray of Brown's
||head indeed showed an apparent "lead snowstorm" of
||metal fragments in brown's head. Cogswell has stated
||that the suspicious hole and the X-ray should have
||prompted AFIP to notify the FBI that Brown's death was
||a possible homicide.
||
||Cogswell, too, has alleged that he heard that the first
||X-rays were destroyed. 
||
||Still curious about the matter, Janoski pulled out
||Brown's official case file and discovered that the file
||contained only 15 X-rays of Brown, none of which were
||of the skull. She found neither of the original X-rays
||that she had photographed on the lightbox. 
|| 
||Janoski said she became terrified when she realized
||that "I  possessed the only physical evidence that
||those X-rays ever existed."  
||
||AFIP director Col. Michael Dickerson has acknowledged
||that all  skull X-rays of Brown are missing from the
||case file. 
||
||Gormley has stated that the initial head X-rays did
||show possible fragments that concerned him at the time,
||but that Brown's head was X-rayed again and he
||discovered the pattern of fragments on the initial 
||X-ray was actually caused by a defect in the 
||reusable film cartridge. 
||     
||The new images did not show any fragments in the head,
||but they, like the originals photographed by Janoski,
||have disappeared.
||
||One of the pathologists involved questions the timing
||of AFIP's explanation.
||
||"I find it interesting that this explanation about the
||film cartridge defect came after Lt. Col Cogswell made
||his allegations, and not at the time we were at Dover,"
||said Hause. 
||
||Hause, who made these comments to the Tribune-Review
||before a gag order had been placed on AFIP staff, said
||he does not recall ever being told there was problem
||with the X-rays. 
||
||Janoski noted that the photos she took of other Brown
||X-rays on the light box did not show any such pattern.
||
||Gormley and AFIP have not offered any explanation for
||how the  X-rays disappeared. Gormley referred calls to
||AFIP spokesman Chris Kelly,  who said that Gormley
||would not grant an additional interview.
||
||In recent days, Janoski was contacted and asked if she
||stood by her earlier comments. She said she did and
||added that AFIP officials are determined to "turn Lt.
||Col. Cogswell into scapegoat."
||
||She said AFIP investigators recently presented her with
||a list questions that focused on how the photographic
||images had found their way to the press. 
||
||"I was never advised of my rights, and the tone and
||manner... was threatening and coercive," she said. 
||
||Janoski reiterated to the Tribune-Review that she had
||done nothing improper, and that AFIP should be
||concentrating on why Ron Brown "did not receive a
||proper death investigation."

I'm sure that puting the telomerase gene active in adult mammals will
soon follow -- if nothing unespected happens, like I propose in the
bottom of this message. Anyway, about this great experiment, I don't
want to be the skeptic of the group but I would like to remind a couple
of things: (1) certain cells that do not divide -- post-mitotic cells
like neurons -- might also age. The proof for this is that most of the
cells of the fruit fly do not divide after adulthood and yet it shows
signs of aging; (2) non-aging species also don't have telomerase and yet
they appear not to age; (3) the behaviour of the cells "in vivo" can be
completely different; (4) even that telomerase solves all our aging
problems, how are we going to make our cells produce telomerase or at
least make its genes active?

Even so, it was a very exciting discovery that can lead us towards
immortality.

Here's a question for you, if our cells have the genes that code for
telomerase, why isn't it active in all cells? Could it be that
telomerase has other functions? Could it be that the genes of telomerase
code other proteins that must be inibited after cellular
differentiation? Could it be that telomerase is harmful in some tissues?

>Could it be that telomerase is harmful in some tissues?

My guess is that its production is inactivated in somatic cells as a
general prophylaxis against cancer.  Immortal tumors do, indeed, switch
telomerase production back on.  If we wish to extend our lives by tweaking
this mechanism, we're going to have to be *very careful*...

Really?  I stand corrected.  The article I read was from
a news report that pretty much parroted Geron's press
release, and mentioned nothing of /Science/.  If that's
the case, then the result is worthy of more attention.

Well, it shows up in the overwhelming majority of cancer cells, so the 
presumption is that telomerase suppression interferes with the development
of cancer.

Yes, of course.

Possible, but alternative splicing is unusual with eukaryotic proteins.

Yes, again.

You said that the power structures remain after the state is REMOVED.
Was the Vietnam War run in the ABSENCE of a powerful government?
Did Nixon turn to crime to protect his PRIVATE power-base?
Did Bush start the Gulf War while he was OUT of office?

That some privileged people are able to manipulate the state's power
to their own ends, no one but a blindfolded idealist denies.  This proves
NOTHING about what they would be able to do WITHOUT using the state.

The claim that "Reagan was put up as a strawman for Bush" would be
more plausible if Reagan's and Bush's economic policies were similar.

The state, as a quasi-living self-perpetuating entity, repeats the
behaviors that tend to increase its power, irrespective of whether
such behaviors are good for the society that it nominally serves.
One such behavior is war-making.  (As I said before.)

Thank you Ian Goddard, et al, for turning the Extropians
list into a crossposting target for the conspiracy theories list.
Maybe I'll check back in six months, to see if sanity has come back.

If you like, but the "0 dimension" adds no dimensionality,
because it has no variation.

The Cartesian product of a line (d=1) and a line (d=1) is a plane (d=2).
The Cartesian product of a line (d=1) and a point (d=0) is a line (d=1).

|> 
|> Confusion or Coverup?
|> 
|> Ever since the crash, most reporters and officials have
|> refused to even consider the possibility of foul play.
|> Some of them have merely followed orders.  But most of
|> them have instinctively fled from the highly disturbing
|> possibility that Ron Brown was assassinated by people
|> close to his own President.
|> 
|> So confronted with the total impossibility of two
|> experienced pilots following an NDR beam to a crash site
|> 1.6 miles off course, they all shrug their shoulders in
|> bewilderment.  None of their theories have come even close
|> to explaining how a beacon that is accurate to within two
|> feet at the landing point could lead the plane so far astray.
|> But they have tried:
|> 
|> - The Air Force's official explanation is that the pilots set the
|> compass on the IFOR-21 10' off course.  That is impossible.
|> Pilots routinely set their compasses right before takeoff.  If
|> they set the compass off 10', they would not have been on
|> course when they passed the first beacon, 11.8 miles from
|> the airport.  Instead they would have been miles and miles
|> off course at this point.  To make this explanation even more
|> absurd, the plane was flying on the NDR signal, not the
|> compass.
|> 
|> - One desperate explanation was a nasty crosswind that
|> "blew" the plane sideways.  Not credible: This would require
|> a wind 90' off from the actual wind.
|> 
|> - Most of the press and officialdom have blamed poor
|> visibility to some extent.  To do this, they have to take the
|> ferocity of the rainstorm later that afternoon and evening
|> and move it back in time to the crash hour.  But records
|> show the weather from 2:54 P.M. to 2:58 P.M. was well
|> within the normal limits for landing.  And NDR beacons never
|> get blown off course.
|> 
|> In any case, pilots more than a few miles from an airport
|> normally rely on a beam rather than visual sighting anyway.
|> 
|> - Pilot fatigue and strain?  Not likely on a 45minute flight.
|> 
|> - Equipment malfunction on a rickety old plane?  IFOR-21
|> was the number two plane in the White House fleet: in
|> essence, Air Force Two.  It had carried Hillary and Chelsea
|> Clinton and Defense Secretary William Perry just the week
|> before.  Everything about the flight was checked out and
|> rehearsed a week in advance.
|> 
|> - Lightning or other troubles causing the pilots to lose track
|> of the beam?  No, they were both drilled in the standard
|> procedure for Cilipi: If you lose the beam or miss the airport,
|> you immediately veer TO THE RIGHT AND UP to make sure
|> you avoid Sveti Ivan.  Indisputably, the pilots thought they
|> were following the beacon, or they would have executed the
|> standard right turn within seconds.  Plus, their landing gear
|> was locked down, showing that they expected to land at any
|> moment.
|> 
|> In sum, none of the "official" explanations to date have held
|> any water.  And all of them ignore the glaring fact that
|> IFOR-21 did not simply stray off the path at the last moment;
|> by all accounts, it went straight as an arrow to its doom the
|> moment it left the Kolocep Island beacon and picked up the
|> Cilipi beacon.  The problem had to be the Cilipi beacon,
|> which was shut down at the airport while a substitute
|> transmitter at Sveti Ivan was turned on.
|> 
|> And Even Worse...
|> 
|> Could the problem have been that technician Niko Jerkuic
|> had let his equipment become rundown?  No, thousands of
|> landings had taken place while his equipment was running,
|> some just minutes before the crash.  To transmit an NDR
|> beacon that's ten degrees off, it takes more than an
|> accident.
|> 
|> Obviously, this explanation could do double duty by aiding
|> the suicide theory.  In this scenario, Jerkuic simply felt so
|> bad about his shoddy work that he shot himself.
|> Unfortunately for the theory, you can't just accidentally
|> bump a knob and make the whole apparatus line planes up
|> with Sveti Ivan.  It takes a sustained effort by a qualified
|> engineer.  Plus, other planes had landed just before IFOR-21.
|> So Jerkuic had to shut off his beacon at the last minute.
|> 
|> The question arises: Could not the whole issue be resolved
|> by a quick review of the tapes at the control tower?  They
|> probably could-if the tapes had not suddenly disappeared.
|> 
|> And couldn't the air traffic controller shed some light on
|> things?  Certainly.  But now he, too, has "committed suicide
|> which, by the way, is a rare event for such a cause in
|> Croatian culture.
|> 
|> I repeat: No official anywhere is facing these facts.  As a
|> result, their "explanations" are laced with words like
|> mysterious and unknown and inexplicably.

|> 
|> The First Time in History: Air Force Kills Investigation
|> 
|> The chief investigator for Pratt & Whitney happened to be at
|> the Paris Air Show on April 3.
|> 
|> Because Pratt & Whitney always sends an investigator
|> when a plane powered by their engines has a mishap, the
|> man called his boss in America, and said, in effect, "We've
|> just had a crash in Croatia.  I think I'd better get down there."
|> The response was, "Go pack."
|> 
|> But as the investigator was packing at his hotel, the boss
|> called back.  "Don't go," he said to the astonished employee.
|> 
|> "There's not going to be a safety investigation."
|> 
|> Sure enough, the Air Force had, for the first time in its
|> history, canceled the safety investigation of a crash on
|> friendly soil.  There would only be a quick token legal
|> investigation designed to enable a committee to blame the
|> pilots or some remote general and go home.
|> 
|> At this time it's an open question whether the black boxes
|> will play a role.  Within hours of the crash, the Croatian
|> Ministry of Transport announced that they had the black
|> boxes.  One and a half days after the crash, Croatian TV
|> (plus Russian and French TV) announced that the FDR (flight
|> data recorder) and the CVR (cockpit voice recorder) were
|> safely in the hands of U.S. Marines.  They said that soon "the
|> cause of the crash will be assessed to find out what
|> happened."
|> 
|> The U.S. European command in Stuttgart, Germany, also
|> stated that a black box was aboard.
|> 
|> Later, the Pentagon brass stoutly disputed all this, stating
|> that there were no black boxes aboard.  They claimed the

|> boxes are usually painted bright orange, and they can't be

|> 
|> Why would anyone want to Murder Ron Brown?
|> 
|> By all accounts, Ron Brown was a charming fellow who
|> worked very hard and very effectively to promote U.S.
|> business.
|> 
|> Why, then, would anyone want to kill him?  And who would
|> have the resources to do it by bringing down a large White

|> 
|> The answer, in brief, is that Ron Brown was going to
|> prison-no ifs, ands, or buts about it.
|> 
|> Also, Bill Clinton's presidency was surely going down with
|> him.  And that the President would not allow.
|>

|> mess, Mena, the Keating Five, Lillian Madsen and her Haitian
|> prostitutes, etc., etc.  Small wonder that 22 congressmen
|> wrote Clinton in February of 1995, demanding that he fire
|> Brown.
|> 
|> At the time of his murder, Brown was under investigation by:
|> - a special prosecutor in the Justice Dept.
|> - the FDIC
|> - the Congressional Reform and Oversight Committee
|> - the FBI
|> - the Energy Dept.
|> - the Senate Judiciary Committee
|> - and even his own Commerce Dept.  Inspector General.
|> 
|> But in case you missed the piecemeal accounts in the
|> papers, here is an extremely condensed summary of II of
|> Brown's woes (which were shortly going to become
|> Clinton's woes, as I'll show below):
|> 
|> 1. How did North Vietnam recently get us to drop our trade
|> embargo against them so suddenly?  Easy.  As a
|> Vietnamese businessman and official later revealed to the
|> press, the Communist government paid Brown $700,000 to
|> do it.  The money went into a Singapore bank account, the
|> embargo fell, and Clinton squashed a feeble FBI attempt to
|> investigate.  He and Brown also neutralized a federal grand
|> jury probe later.
|> 
|> 2. Brown sold plane seats on other trade trips besides the
|> one to Bosnia/Croatia.  Companies making big contributions
|> to the Democratic Party or the Clinton Victory Fund could
|> buy access and get tax breaks or regulatory favors.
|> 
|> 3. The 1/23/95 U.S. News & World Report broke the news
|> that Brown had bought a $360,000 townhouse for his
|> girlfriend, Lillian Madsen, a prominent political player and
|> whorehouse madam from Haiti.
|> 
|> 4. Brown used to receive $12,500 a month as the P.R. flack
|> for Baby Doc Duvalier, the much-loathed dictator of Haiti.
|> Brown also managed Baby Doc's $50 million investment
|> fund, most or all of which is now in Vietnam firms.
|> 
|> 5. Brown was a key board member of Chemfix, a Louisiana
|> "waste management" corporation that landed a $2 1 0
|> million contract with New York City in 1990 with Brown's
|> help despite the fact that Chemfix had two contracts with
|> other municipalities canceled because of the company's
|> inability to perform.  Brown got company stock at 24% of
|> market value (making him millions) and New York mayor
|> David Dinkins got to host the Democratic Convention.  A
|> typical Ron Brown win-win deal.
|> 
|> 6. Brown founded Capital/Pebsco, which-fresh out of the
|> box-got a contract with D.C. mayor Marion Barry to handle
|> the city's pension funds.  Not a bad start for a new company
|> with no investing experience.  Brown earned huge fees.
|> 
|> 7. In a deal that left CIA people livid, Brown okayed the sale
|> of a new U.S. gas turbine engine to China for use in its
|> cruise missiles.  McDonnell Douglas developed the turbine
|> as a military engine, but by arbitrarily reclassifying it as
|> "civilian," Brown enabled China to build a fleet of
|> missiles-which they can point at America (whom else?),
|> powered by our own engines.  As part of the lucrative deal,
|> McDonnell Douglas agreed to set up an airplane
|> manufacturing plant using cheap slave labor in China.
|> 
|> 8. Brown irked Congress and most of Europe by acting as
|> point man for Clinton to bring Iranian Muslims and their
|> weaponry into the Bosnia war.  That broke the
|> U.S.-endorsed arms embargo. The money for the arms was
|> most likely from Commerce and Agriculture, slush fund
|> money channeled to U.S. manufacturers, thence to
|> U.S.friendly nations and firms overseas, thence to Iran.  The
|> arms included: helicopter gunships stinger missiles
|> 
|> *land mines
|> *anti-aircraft guns
|> *anti-tank weapons
|> *grenade launchers
|> ... and other quality weaponry, most of which will remain on
|> the European scene for decades to come, keeping the area
|> destabilized.
|> 
|> As one leading munitions dealer put it: "Iran/Contra was
|> slingshots and cap guns compared to the quantities and
|> size of arms given the Croatian Serbs."
|> 
|> That is why the Croatians were enthusiastically hosting
|> Brown's planeload of executives.  They felt gratitude for the
|> free arms as well as a desire to do deals.
|> 
|> 9. Brown was the partner of a Democratic fundraiser named
|> Nolanda Hill, who paid him $500,000 for his 50% interest in
|> First International, Inc., a company that never made any
|> profits.  Most glaringly, Brown never invested a cent in First
|> Int'l.
|> 
|> First Int'l owned Corridor Broadcasting, which had defaulted
|> on massive government loans of $40 million.  The loans
|> were passed to the FDIC, which was unsuccessful in
|> collecting anything from Hill, even though at that time the
|> firm was making large contributions to the Democratic
|> Party and paying hundreds of thousands to Brown through
|> shell corporations.
|> 
|> These payments to Brown (three checks for $45,000 each)
|> were the core of evidence gathered by Rep. William F.
|> Clinger, Jr., that forced Reno to hire Daniel Pearson as
|> special investigator of Brown's crimes.  They were
|> cashier's checks, all cut on the same day in 1993 with
|> sequential numbers even though the money supposedly
|> came from three contributors acting independently.
|> 
|> Brown never disclosed or paid any taxes on these amounts.
|> 
|> 10. By personally delivering a warning letter signed by
|> Clinton, Brown was able to force a bargain deal with the
|> Saudis for $6 billion in American military aircraft and
|> hardware.  The quid pro quo: To get the planes, the Saudis
|> also had to accept a fat $4 billion phone contract with AT&T.
|> Also part of the deal: AT&T had a side agreement with
|> Brown's First International (see above).  And the Democratic
|> National Committee and the Clinton campaign fund were
|> beneficiaries.  This is how big business is done in Clinton's
|> America.
|> 
|> 11. The last nail in Brown's coffin was pounded in four days
|> before the crash.  FBI and IRS agents subpoenaed as many
|> as 20 witnesses for a serious new grand jury probe of
|> Brown in Washington.  It seems that an Oklahoma gas
|> company called Dynamic Energy Resources gave Brown's
|> son Michael $500,000 in stock, a $160,000 cash payment,
|> and exclusive country club memberships.  Fortner Dynamic
|> president Stewart Price told a Tulsa grand jury that the
|> money was to be routed to Ron Brown, who was expected
|> to "fix" a big lawsuit for Dynamic.
|> 
|> There is little chance you heard about this deathknell, grand
|> jury case.  It was reported on radio station KTOK in
|> Oklahoma on March 28 and on the front page of the
|> Washington Times March 29.  But then a lock was put on the

 If you like, but the "0 dimension" adds no dimensionality,
 because it has no variation.
 
 The Cartesian product of a line (d=1) and a line (d=1) is a plane (d=2).
 The Cartesian product of a line (d=1) and a point (d=0) is a line (d=1).

and the product of a point and a point is a line
if a point isnt a dimension and a line is, what is a point?
i very much think that a point is a dimension.  dimensions dont start with a
line, they start with a point i think, or maybe something else.

if you had three points it would be a plane, and 4 would be 3d    ....(if they
were randomly placed within 3d space, but what if they were randomly placed
within a 4d space?  What is a 4d space? time? it seems that would also include
movement and growth)  It seems a point would exist within all dimensions.

> |>
> |> 1. How did North Vietnam recently get us to drop our trade

> |> press, the Communist government paid Brown $700,000 to

> |> investigate.  He and Brown also neutralized a federal grand

> |>
> |> 2. Brown sold plane seats on other trade trips besides the
> |> one to Bosnia/Croatia.  Companies making big contributions
> |> to the Democratic Party or the Clinton Victory Fund could
> |> buy access and get tax breaks or regulatory favors.
> |>
> |> 3. The 1/23/95 U.S. News & World Report broke the news
> |> that Brown had bought a $360,000 townhouse for his
> |> girlfriend, Lillian Madsen, a prominent political player and
> |> whorehouse madam from Haiti.
> |>
> |> 4. Brown used to receive $12,500 a month as the P.R. flack
> |> for Baby Doc Duvalier, the much-loathed dictator of Haiti.
> |> Brown also managed Baby Doc's $50 million investment
> |> fund, most or all of which is now in Vietnam firms.
> |>
> |> 5. Brown was a key board member of Chemfix, a Louisiana
> |> "waste management" corporation that landed a $2 1 0
> |> million contract with New York City in 1990 with Brown's
> |> help despite the fact that Chemfix had two contracts with
> |> other municipalities canceled because of the company's

> |> market value (making him millions) and New York mayor
> |> David Dinkins got to host the Democratic Convention.  A
> |> typical Ron Brown win-win deal.
> |>
> |> 6. Brown founded Capital/Pebsco, which-fresh out of the
> |> box-got a contract with D.C. mayor Marion Barry to handle
> |> the city's pension funds.  Not a bad start for a new company
> |> with no investing experience.  Brown earned huge fees.
> |>
> |> 7. In a deal that left CIA people livid, Brown okayed the sale

> |> 8. Brown irked Congress and most of Europe by acting as

This rather rude message was supposed to be send to the sender, not the

Amazingly how much faster simpler it has become to makes mistakes in

True. But I'm becoming a bit worried about the prevalence of
conspiracy thinking; it is alsmot the secular religion of the 90's. I
almost daily hear people explain things in the world around them by
references to conspiracies, and it seems to be the favored rhetorical
tool for anybody outside the direct political mainstream (sometimes in
it too) to explain the situation by some form of conspiracy (ranging
from the patriarchal to the statist to the market conspiracy).

To me this is a sign of sloppy thinking. Sure, there are dirty
dealings and secret alliances out there, but that doesn't give
conspiracy theories explanatory power. A conspiracy theory usually
works by showing some suggestive but weak evidence, and then
explaining away the lack of confirmation by cover-up. It is
unfalsifiable ("Of course there are no witnessess, they have all been
scared into silence"), defends itself vigorously from criticism ("See?
They have indoctrinated you too!") and promotes spread (in order to
help others see the truth). In short, they make very efficient memes,
but they do not have to be true to spread well.

Keep an open mind, but not so open your brain falls out.

Just a small terminology nitpick: a point or a line isn't a
dimension. They have a dimension, but they are not themselves
dimensions. A dimension is just a measure of how many "degrees of
freedom" a certain space has, not the space itself (or a good example
of such a n-dimensional space, like a line).

Yes, there is likely a balance between cell regeneration and cancer risk. 

Something I have been thinking of is if we could find ways of making
the control machinery of cell division more robust. I have the
impression that the p53 control is far too easily sabotaged by
mutations; a double check there would be nice.

||> thinking on the cause of the crash.
||> 
||> Confusion or Coverup?
||> 
||> Ever since the crash, most reporters and officials have
||> refused to even consider the possibility of foul play.
||> Some of them have merely followed orders.  But most of
||> them have instinctively fled from the highly disturbing
||> possibility that Ron Brown was assassinated by people
||> close to his own President.
||> 
||> So confronted with the total impossibility of two
||> experienced pilots following an NDR beam to a crash site
||> 1.6 miles off course, they all shrug their shoulders in
||> bewilderment.  None of their theories have come even close
||> to explaining how a beacon that is accurate to within two
||> feet at the landing point could lead the plane so far astray.
||> But they have tried:
||> 
||> - The Air Force's official explanation is that the pilots set the
||> compass on the IFOR-21 10' off course.  That is impossible.
||> Pilots routinely set their compasses right before takeoff.  If
||> they set the compass off 10', they would not have been on
||> course when they passed the first beacon, 11.8 miles from
||> the airport.  Instead they would have been miles and miles
||> off course at this point.  To make this explanation even more
||> absurd, the plane was flying on the NDR signal, not the
||> compass.
||> 
||> - One desperate explanation was a nasty crosswind that
||> "blew" the plane sideways.  Not credible: This would require
||> a wind 90' off from the actual wind.
||> 
||> - Most of the press and officialdom have blamed poor
||> visibility to some extent.  To do this, they have to take the
||> ferocity of the rainstorm later that afternoon and evening
||> and move it back in time to the crash hour.  But records
||> show the weather from 2:54 P.M. to 2:58 P.M. was well
||> within the normal limits for landing.  And NDR beacons never
||> get blown off course.
||> 
||> In any case, pilots more than a few miles from an airport
||> normally rely on a beam rather than visual sighting anyway.
||> 
||> - Pilot fatigue and strain?  Not likely on a 45minute flight.
||> 
||> - Equipment malfunction on a rickety old plane?  IFOR-21
||> was the number two plane in the White House fleet: in
||> essence, Air Force Two.  It had carried Hillary and Chelsea
||> Clinton and Defense Secretary William Perry just the week
||> before.  Everything about the flight was checked out and
||> rehearsed a week in advance.
||> 
||> - Lightning or other troubles causing the pilots to lose track
||> of the beam?  No, they were both drilled in the standard
||> procedure for Cilipi: If you lose the beam or miss the airport,
||> you immediately veer TO THE RIGHT AND UP to make sure
||> you avoid Sveti Ivan.  Indisputably, the pilots thought they
||> were following the beacon, or they would have executed the
||> standard right turn within seconds.  Plus, their landing gear
||> was locked down, showing that they expected to land at any
||> moment.
||> 
||> In sum, none of the "official" explanations to date have held
||> any water.  And all of them ignore the glaring fact that
||> IFOR-21 did not simply stray off the path at the last moment;
||> by all accounts, it went straight as an arrow to its doom the
||> moment it left the Kolocep Island beacon and picked up the
||> Cilipi beacon.  The problem had to be the Cilipi beacon,
||> which was shut down at the airport while a substitute
||> transmitter at Sveti Ivan was turned on.
||> 
||> And Even Worse...
||> 
||> Could the problem have been that technician Niko Jerkuic
||> had let his equipment become rundown?  No, thousands of
||> landings had taken place while his equipment was running,
||> some just minutes before the crash.  To transmit an NDR
||> beacon that's ten degrees off, it takes more than an
||> accident.
||> 
||> Obviously, this explanation could do double duty by aiding
||> the suicide theory.  In this scenario, Jerkuic simply felt so
||> bad about his shoddy work that he shot himself.
||> Unfortunately for the theory, you can't just accidentally
||> bump a knob and make the whole apparatus line planes up
||> with Sveti Ivan.  It takes a sustained effort by a qualified
||> engineer.  Plus, other planes had landed just before IFOR-21.
||> So Jerkuic had to shut off his beacon at the last minute.
||> 
||> The question arises: Could not the whole issue be resolved
||> by a quick review of the tapes at the control tower?  They
||> probably could-if the tapes had not suddenly disappeared.
||> 
||> And couldn't the air traffic controller shed some light on
||> things?  Certainly.  But now he, too, has "committed suicide
||> which, by the way, is a rare event for such a cause in
||> Croatian culture.
||> 
||> I repeat: No official anywhere is facing these facts.  As a
||> result, their "explanations" are laced with words like
||> mysterious and unknown and inexplicably.

||> The unanimous opinion of our informants: This information,
||> if widely known, would eliminate any chance of Clinton's
||> re-election.
||> 
||> The First Time in History: Air Force Kills Investigation
||> 
||> The chief investigator for Pratt & Whitney happened to be at
||> the Paris Air Show on April 3.
||> 
||> Because Pratt & Whitney always sends an investigator
||> when a plane powered by their engines has a mishap, the
||> man called his boss in America, and said, in effect, "We've
||> just had a crash in Croatia.  I think I'd better get down there."
||> The response was, "Go pack."
||> 
||> But as the investigator was packing at his hotel, the boss
||> called back.  "Don't go," he said to the astonished employee.
||> 
||> "There's not going to be a safety investigation."
||> 
||> Sure enough, the Air Force had, for the first time in its
||> history, canceled the safety investigation of a crash on
||> friendly soil.  There would only be a quick token legal
||> investigation designed to enable a committee to blame the
||> pilots or some remote general and go home.
||> 
||> At this time it's an open question whether the black boxes
||> will play a role.  Within hours of the crash, the Croatian
||> Ministry of Transport announced that they had the black
||> boxes.  One and a half days after the crash, Croatian TV
||> (plus Russian and French TV) announced that the FDR (flight
||> data recorder) and the CVR (cockpit voice recorder) were
||> safely in the hands of U.S. Marines.  They said that soon "the
||> cause of the crash will be assessed to find out what
||> happened."
||> 
||> The U.S. European command in Stuttgart, Germany, also
||> stated that a black box was aboard.
||> 
||> Later, the Pentagon brass stoutly disputed all this, stating
||> that there were no black boxes aboard.  They claimed the
||> actual recovered boxes were designed to hold soda pop and
||> toilet paper. (The Croats, who feel they can tell a reel of tape
||> from a roll of toilet paper, are keeping mum.) Also, black
||> boxes are usually painted bright orange, and they can't be
||> opened with a thumb-or hardly at all.
||> 
||> It is difficult to imagine that America's #2 VIP plane had no
||> black box.  And a veteran Air Force mechanic who claims to
||> have worked on just about every T-43A in the USAF tells us
||> he never saw one without a black box.
||> 
||> Why would anyone want to Murder Ron Brown?
||> 
||> By all accounts, Ron Brown was a charming fellow who
||> worked very hard and very effectively to promote U.S.
||> business.
||> 
||> Why, then, would anyone want to kill him?  And who would
||> have the resources to do it by bringing down a large White
||> House airplane?
||> 
||> The answer, in brief, is that Ron Brown was going to
||> prison-no ifs, ands, or buts about it.
||> 
||> Also, Bill Clinton's presidency was surely going down with
||> him.  And that the President would not allow.

||> - the FDIC
||> - the Congressional Reform and Oversight Committee
||> - the FBI
||> - the Energy Dept.
||> - the Senate Judiciary Committee
||> - and even his own Commerce Dept.  Inspector General.
||> 
||> But in case you missed the piecemeal accounts in the
||> papers, here is an extremely condensed summary of II of
||> Brown's woes (which were shortly going to become
||> Clinton's woes, as I'll show below):
||> 
||> 1. How did North Vietnam recently get us to drop our trade
||> embargo against them so suddenly?  Easy.  As a
||> Vietnamese businessman and official later revealed to the
||> press, the Communist government paid Brown $700,000 to
||> do it.  The money went into a Singapore bank account, the
||> embargo fell, and Clinton squashed a feeble FBI attempt to
||> investigate.  He and Brown also neutralized a federal grand
||> jury probe later.
||> 
||> 2. Brown sold plane seats on other trade trips besides the
||> one to Bosnia/Croatia.  Companies making big contributions
||> to the Democratic Party or the Clinton Victory Fund could
||> buy access and get tax breaks or regulatory favors.
||> 
||> 3. The 1/23/95 U.S. News & World Report broke the news
||> that Brown had bought a $360,000 townhouse for his
||> girlfriend, Lillian Madsen, a prominent political player and
||> whorehouse madam from Haiti.
||> 
||> 4. Brown used to receive $12,500 a month as the P.R. flack
||> for Baby Doc Duvalier, the much-loathed dictator of Haiti.
||> Brown also managed Baby Doc's $50 million investment
||> fund, most or all of which is now in Vietnam firms.
||> 
||> 5. Brown was a key board member of Chemfix, a Louisiana
||> "waste management" corporation that landed a $2 1 0
||> million contract with New York City in 1990 with Brown's
||> help despite the fact that Chemfix had two contracts with
||> other municipalities canceled because of the company's
||> inability to perform.  Brown got company stock at 24% of
||> market value (making him millions) and New York mayor
||> David Dinkins got to host the Democratic Convention.  A
||> typical Ron Brown win-win deal.
||> 
||> 6. Brown founded Capital/Pebsco, which-fresh out of the
||> box-got a contract with D.C. mayor Marion Barry to handle
||> the city's pension funds.  Not a bad start for a new company
||> with no investing experience.  Brown earned huge fees.
||> 
||> 7. In a deal that left CIA people livid, Brown okayed the sale
||> of a new U.S. gas turbine engine to China for use in its
||> cruise missiles.  McDonnell Douglas developed the turbine
||> as a military engine, but by arbitrarily reclassifying it as
||> "civilian," Brown enabled China to build a fleet of
||> missiles-which they can point at America (whom else?),
||> powered by our own engines.  As part of the lucrative deal,
||> McDonnell Douglas agreed to set up an airplane
||> manufacturing plant using cheap slave labor in China.
||> 
||> 8. Brown irked Congress and most of Europe by acting as
||> point man for Clinton to bring Iranian Muslims and their
||> weaponry into the Bosnia war.  That broke the
||> U.S.-endorsed arms embargo. The money for the arms was
||> most likely from Commerce and Agriculture, slush fund
||> money channeled to U.S. manufacturers, thence to
||> U.S.friendly nations and firms overseas, thence to Iran.  The
||> arms included: helicopter gunships stinger missiles
||> 
||> *land mines
||> *anti-aircraft guns
||> *anti-tank weapons
||> *grenade launchers
||> ... and other quality weaponry, most of which will remain on
||> the European scene for decades to come, keeping the area
||> destabilized.
||> 
||> As one leading munitions dealer put it: "Iran/Contra was
||> slingshots and cap guns compared to the quantities and
||> size of arms given the Croatian Serbs."
||> 
||> That is why the Croatians were enthusiastically hosting
||> Brown's planeload of executives.  They felt gratitude for the
||> free arms as well as a desire to do deals.
||> 
||> 9. Brown was the partner of a Democratic fundraiser named
||> Nolanda Hill, who paid him $500,000 for his 50% interest in
||> First International, Inc., a company that never made any
||> profits.  Most glaringly, Brown never invested a cent in First
||> Int'l.
||> 
||> First Int'l owned Corridor Broadcasting, which had defaulted
||> on massive government loans of $40 million.  The loans
||> were passed to the FDIC, which was unsuccessful in
||> collecting anything from Hill, even though at that time the
||> firm was making large contributions to the Democratic
||> Party and paying hundreds of thousands to Brown through
||> shell corporations.
||> 
||> These payments to Brown (three checks for $45,000 each)
||> were the core of evidence gathered by Rep. William F.
||> Clinger, Jr., that forced Reno to hire Daniel Pearson as
||> special investigator of Brown's crimes.  They were
||> cashier's checks, all cut on the same day in 1993 with
||> sequential numbers even though the money supposedly
||> came from three contributors acting independently.
||> 
||> Brown never disclosed or paid any taxes on these amounts.
||> 
||> 10. By personally delivering a warning letter signed by
||> Clinton, Brown was able to force a bargain deal with the
||> Saudis for $6 billion in American military aircraft and
||> hardware.  The quid pro quo: To get the planes, the Saudis
||> also had to accept a fat $4 billion phone contract with AT&T.
||> Also part of the deal: AT&T had a side agreement with
||> Brown's First International (see above).  And the Democratic
||> National Committee and the Clinton campaign fund were
||> beneficiaries.  This is how big business is done in Clinton's
||> America.
||> 
||> 11. The last nail in Brown's coffin was pounded in four days
||> before the crash.  FBI and IRS agents subpoenaed as many
||> as 20 witnesses for a serious new grand jury probe of
||> Brown in Washington.  It seems that an Oklahoma gas
||> company called Dynamic Energy Resources gave Brown's
||> son Michael $500,000 in stock, a $160,000 cash payment,
||> and exclusive country club memberships.  Fortner Dynamic
||> president Stewart Price told a Tulsa grand jury that the
||> money was to be routed to Ron Brown, who was expected
||> to "fix" a big lawsuit for Dynamic.
||> 
||> There is little chance you heard about this deathknell, grand
||> jury case.  It was reported on radio station KTOK in
||> Oklahoma on March 28 and on the front page of the
||> Washington Times March 29.  But then a lock was put on the
||> story; the AP and New York Times wire services blocked
||> any further release of the information. (Welcome to the New
||> World Order)
||> 
||> Final proof: the 2/8/96 Washington Post reported that Brown
||> had retained top legal gun Reid Weingarten, a former high
||> official in the Justice Department, as his criminal attorney.
||> You don't pay his prices ($750 an hour) unless you know a
||> criminal indictment is coming and you're probably going to
||> jail.
||> 
||> Janet Reno appointed Daniel Pearson as Brown's special
||> prosecutor.  When she gave him blanket permission to
||> investigate anything, Brown angrily demanded that Clinton
||> force her to withdraw Pearson.  But Reno couldn't do that;
||> she had been backed into a comer by Rep. Clinger, who is
||> chairman of the House Govemment Refonn and Oversight
||> Conimittee.  Clinger had copies of Brown's First International
||> checks, among other incriminating documents.
||> 
||> When Clinton said he couldn't comply, Brown went ballistic.
||> His fatal mistake-according to Brown confidants who
||> requested anonymity-was telling Clinton that he wasn't
||> going to take the rap.  He wasn't going to let his wife and son
||> take the rap, either. (Both had received hundreds of

||> That would have sunk the reelection campaign on the spot.

  One can say the same about "government benevolence" theories.
Those are by far the more popular...Bill and Hilary "care" about us,

  Does so!  Unless you are a strict materialist reductionist...in
which case purposeful human action is a delusion.

 A conspiracy theory usually
|works by showing some suggestive but weak evidence, and then
|explaining away the lack of confirmation by cover-up. It is
|unfalsifiable ("Of course there are no witnessess, they have all been
|scared into silence"), defends itself vigorously from criticism ("See?
|They have indoctrinated you too!") and promotes spread (in order to
|help others see the truth). In short, they make very efficient memes,
|but they do not have to be true to spread well.

  This is bigotted stereotyping above.  Just as in any other field of
inquiry, some theories are better supported by evidence than others.
In the case of the Ron Brown  there are now 4 whistle blowers
who have come forward!  The reality of cover-up is now well supported by
evidence
but still, people supposedly interested in liberty and opposing govt
tyranny "aren't interested"!  Looks to me that irrational "pro-govt" memes
are much more powerful than "conspiracy memes"....too bad!

|Keep an open mind, but not so open your brain falls out.

  Sanders, you give no indication what-so-ever that you are considering
_any_ specific evidence regarding any particular conspiracy theory.  Methinks
many, but not all Extropians, fear to see and therefore reject, the evidence
that their hopes for the future will be dashed unless the conspiracy that is
government can be defeated.....pointing-out the chronic on-going conspiracies
within and around government are an important tool in building a better
future with little or no government.

  The govt's reaction to cloning is just a hint of how anti-extropian it is and
will continue to be unless a popular anti-govt memetic field can be erected.

Well, if we just consider the universe as the whole set of all, any
happening or phenomenum is just a selfrelashionship
of the universe itself... You just do not think using a subject-object
oriented logic but a selfrelashionship one...
And there will be no sense in arguing the only possibly meaningfull
question including a "G"od : creator-creation... (that just arises when we
use a subject-object oriented logic...)

Ok....taking this (below) and other complaints into account, I will from now on
post only my analysis of why various conspiracy theories are important
to Extropians and then provide a link for details!

I must admit I temp forgot about the desire for brevity on this list...many
others
have opposite preference.   Personally, I hate links which slow me down
in scanning for important info.....but then I have several gigs clear on my
hard disk and do not pay for on-line time.  Why does anyone still pay for
on line time?

|James, just adding my voice to the other extropian list members who wish
|you'd kindly stop relaying this material at such great length to the list.
|Some people pay for their net time, and receiving multiple 30-pages
|downloads of unwanted text is extremely irritating.
|
|*Please stop doing it*, unless individuals ask you to send stuff to them
|specifically.

Thats where its crucial. If you get decapitated, they'll find the dogtag

Of course. THings are getting to be like Renaissance Italy these days, where you
had a bunch of city states all vying for power, the only real superpower was the
vatican, which was ruled by corrupt people from corrupt influential families, and
everybody spoke of conspiracies here and there due to the dearth of real
informatiion sources that were reliable.

I think that the prevalence of conspiracy gossip is indicativeof three things: a)
that the mainstream media have abrogated their guardianship of the people against
tyranny in return for favors and power from government, and that b) people with
no prior capacity to have a public voice are in a toddler stage of development in
the use of this voice, and c) people (meaning the middle class, which has been
traditionally the bastion of the state) have lost faith in the political process.

Yesterday I remembered an interesting point:

Let's pay attention to "C"hurch's  declarations about human clones...

I would not get surprized if they would tell idiotnesses to justify their
positionment, like:

HUMAN CLONES HAVE NO SOUL OR SPIRIT....

And repeat their ignorant behaviour as when around 1500's to 1600's a mission
of the Church said that the American indians were like animals and *had no
soul*...
Then there was no problem when Spanish (or other)  soldiers killed them...

And more: In the name of   "G"od...

Gomes.

PS: Does anybody know if they have unsaid that publically... or "believers"
did not impose that... and even justified such
behaviour ???

Subject: Simple Models of Complex Physical Systems

The following MIT course announcement may be of interest to the
Physics of Computation community:


               Simple Models of Complex Physical Systems
	 	         12.517 G(2) 3-0-9
                           Spring, 1998

Instructor: Prof. Daniel Rothman, dan@segovia.mit.edu, Rm 54-626, 253-7861
TA:	    Peter Dodds,        dodds@segovia.mit.edu, Rm 54-627, 253-7278 

Many systems, both physical and otherwise, follow simple dynamics at a 
small scale while exhibiting complex behavior at a large scale.  This 
course introduces several modern theoretical approaches to the study of 
such problems.  

The first half of the course introduces discrete (cellular automata) models 
of fluids and shows how hydrodynamic equations may be derived for these 
models.  Students will also learn how these models can exhibit phase 
transitions, form fluid interfaces, and describe multiphase flow. 
The second half of the course will cover two other topics: percolation 
and surface growth.  Percolation is used to introduce concepts such as 
scaling, fractals, and renormalization.  The section on surfaces will
illustrate how these concepts apply in a setting far from equilibrium, in 
addition to introducing some stochastic differential equations.
Applications to problems in earth science are discussed in each topic.

The first meeting is Tuesday 3 February at 10:30 am in Room 54-317.
Unless interested students have schedule conflicts 
(please contact the instructor by email if you cannot attend this meeting)
the class will meet thereafter on Tuesdays and Thursdays 
from 10:30--12:00 in the same place.  Advanced undergraduates are welcome.

Human Cell Lifespan Extended

NEW YORK (Reuters) -- For the first time, researchers have confirmed that the
"clock" thought to control aging in human cells does indeed dictate that
process. What's more, they have found a way to circumvent the process --
extending the lifespan of normal, healthy human cells, according to a report
in Science.

The finding has "profound" implications for the study of cancer, which may
use the same process to escape the aging process, according to an editorial
accompanying the study.

And it may lead to treatment for human disease caused by worn out cells, such
as macular degeneration -- the leading cause of blindness in those over 65.

"This research raises the possibility that we could take a patient's own
cells, rejuvenate them, then modify the cells as needed and give them back to
the patient to treat a variety of genetic and other diseases," said senior
investigator Dr. Woodring E. Wright in a statement released by the University
of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. "The potential long-term
applications are simply staggering," said Wright, a professor of cell biology
and neuroscience. The study was a collaborative effort involving researchers
at the medical center and at Geron Corp., in Menlo Park, California.

Most cells will divide roughly 50 times in the laboratory before entering a
resting state known as senescence, a process that also occurs in the body.
For more than a decade, researchers have suspected that telomeres, sections of
DNA at the tips of chromosomes, control that process.

Like minutes ticking on a clock, a piece of telomere is lost each time the
cell divides. But some cells contain an enzyme, called telomerase, that can
re-build the telomere after cell division.

In the new study, the gene for telomerase was inserted inside three types of
cells that don't normally carry the enzyme -- retinal pigment epithelial
cells, foreskin fibroblasts, and the vascular endothelial cells -- or those
lining blood vessels. In contrast with cultured cells that have telomere
shortening, the genetically engineered cells continued to vigorously divide
and have long telomeres.

The treated cell population doubled at least 20 more times than normal and
continues to grow, according to the report. The new findings confirm that
telomeres are the "clock" that keeps cells from growing out of control,
according to an editorial by Titia de Lange, of the Laboratory for Cell
Biology and Genetics at The Rockefeller University in New York. And that
mechanism has all "the makings of a powerful tumor suppressor system," de
Lange wrote.

"The results should strengthen the determination of those who are searching
for telomerase inhibitors as potential anti-cancer agents." SOURCE: Science

Anders Sandberg has clarified this as a misunderstanding of

Exactly - and as a point has 0 degrees of freedom, it needs 0 dimensions
to describe.  (but n to describe _where_ it is... )

So you don't need to count "the 0 dimension" when counting dimensions.
Ok?

person who could prevent a reoccurrence, the person who posted it, he sen it 
to the entire list. But much worse, he then quotes every word, EVERY SINGLE
WORD, of the long, boring, pointless, uninformative, and off topic post. 
I hope I will be forgiven for not quoting the quotation in this post. 

Max M is certainly not the only one who does this, it seems to be an axiom on 
this list that if you see a particularly long and foolish post then very soon 
you will see it again. I guess you should prepare to see this post again.

What about finding single treatment drugs that will do a quick flood of the body
with telomerase to rebuild the telomeres, and then flush the drugs from the
system. With a short term exposure for rebuilding telomeres, long term effects on
cancer probabilty would be low.

That URL would not work for me this morning, but this one did:
http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/.  The specific article about computing
the universe is at:

ftp://ftp.idsia.ch/pub/juergen/everything.ps.gz

It does appear to mirror some of the considerations raised by Wei and Nick
in terms of possible universes.  I'll try to comment on it later.

crap-o-meters and head condoms are par for the course with mail lists, and as
much as I think that keeping informed of what may really be going on is extropic,
unless it bears directly on extropian topics/technology, etc., it really
shouldn't be posted here in such volume, especially without editorial comment.
THis isn't a newsgroup, or a push channel. Us links like most people here do. I
would suggest to those people whose mail readers don't automatically create a
link when they see an 'http://www.crapometer.com/" should upgrade or cease and
desist.

My take on what it means to have an intuitive understanding of a topic
(such as a physics theory) is that we understand it with the right
brain as well as the left (in shorthand). So it is, often, the
bizarreness of a theory that impedes this understanding, but I'd be
inclined to separate that from the basic definition of intuition.

Things we understand intuitively _seem_ more natural. We can visualize
them easily. Since this is easier to achieve with "commonsense" ideas,
it seems like ideas that resist intuition ("counter-intuitive" ideas)
are less natural and commonsensical. But of course we know that
commonsense physics (Aristotelian physics) is quite insufficient.

When we think about a problem in Newtonian mechanics we have a wealth 
of mental models to apply. Newtonian methods allow us to think in 3-D
which is easier for us. When we first meet relativity and have to try
to think in 4-D, we boggle. Then when we've done enough problems to 
begin to have a pictorial grasp of those concepts, it gets a lot 
easier. 

QM is even more slippery but people who really understand it (I exempt
myself) develop ways to think about quantum effects that don't depend
just on the equations. Example: the development of Feynman diagrams.
Feynman absorbed a certain class of QM theory so well that he found a
graphical shorthand for solving problems in it, and this was a great
step (the temptation to misuse "quantum leap" was excruciating :-) in
everyone's understanding. 

Seems to me that the experience of learning something extremely 
counterintuitive so well that it becomes intuitive is valuable in 
itself for our mental development, even if we do not use it directly
afterwards. Fits in with Boundless Expansion and Self-Transformation.

Ad Astra,

I'd like to begin some discussion re- life enhancing/extending
notions I use which are not very exotic to me but likely not used by 
many..

I have always been a health info. hound and over the years have found
a few good items.

2 years ago when my wife began to suffer from multiple sclerosis
I renewed my search for items my doctor would approve of but which
our medicare and medical system in Canada would not allow Rx for...
capitated/rationed/muzzeled/cost-benefit contained medicine.

Anyway before You all go to sleep/delete this item here's the
good stuff.

I have been using the immune modulant levamisole since 1976.
1976-1995 quite irregularly 185 mg per dose usually once per month.
1995-97 once per week.  1997 till today 150 mg every saturday and 
sunday.  

I buy the compound in a form identical to the human Rx as a powder
used worldwide to worm all kinds of livestock and also children
in 3rd world countries.  The Rx form from your physician is 75-120 X
as costly so I will continue this access method as gross as it may 
sound.

What does Levamisole do?  It finds utility in human medicine as
a treatment which enhances destruction of metasteses in melanoma.
NIH currently is funding a study to confirm it can be used as a life-
long chemopreventative agent. 

This is a medication which has been in common usage for 30 years
which may in another 20 become as common as vitamin C.

Bye for now ....megao@sk.sympatico.ca

True. Perhaps neurons age because the support they receive from other cells 
that do divide degrades, or perhaps telomere shorting is not the only clock  
in every cell, but if one clock can be found so can another.

Geron also has a patent on a telomerase inhibitor. Except for sperm and eggs 
most cells don't produce telomerase (some cells lining the stomach and 
intestine produce a little, but not enough to become immortal) so this 
inhibitor shouldn't have many side effects, but all known cancers produce 
lots of it. Geron has a sensitive method for detecting telomerase and hopes to 
use it to diagnose cancer. The company also wants to develop its telomerase 
inhibitor into a cancer treatment, if it works it would turn our worst enemy 
into a friend, a fast growing cancer would die of old age.

On Tuesday when Geron made the announcement that they had made human cells 
immortal its stock jumped up by 44%, does anybody have an opinion about Geron  
as an investment?

My preferred method would be to introduce the telomerase in a method
such that the cell does not have control over its existence.  For
example, add in a short artificial chromosome to the cells containing
the telomerase gene but a different kind of telomere which the telomerase
can't affect.  Set up the artificial chromosome so that after a 
specified number of divisions the shortening of its telomeres either
aborts its replication or, better, inactivates the telomerase.
That way you could protect the cells from senescence for a limited time
but after the desired number of replications the cell loses the telomerase
and returns to the normal replicative control and normal cancer risk.

No, not so simple.  Just lengthening the telomeres gives every pre-cancerous
but still telomere-limited 2^(extra divisions from lengthening) times as
many tries to mutate past the telomerase limitation.  In addition, just the
extra divisions permitted may be enough for the cancer to kill the host.
It's a good bet that the existence of telomerase and the number of
replications
permitted by the existing telomere lengths are, to a first approximation,
optimal for lifespan.  If, say 5 extra divisions improved average lifespan,
the germline telomeres would probably evolve to be that much longer.  
Likewise for shorter telomeres.

Better, for that kind of thing, would be to target the telomerase to tissues
where the risk of fatal cancer is relatively low (e.g. skin) or where the
hazards of senescence are particularly high (e.g. blood stem cells).

One general approach would be to take out crypt cells (cells from tissue that 
divide to replace those that die), proof them for pre-cancerous mutation,
telomere-lengthen the "clean" ones, and then put them back without telomerase.

I stand corrected with head bowed. You are right. Furthermore I
shouldn't have used profound language. I usually never do, and it
doesn't help at all. I just got so annoyed that half the list was filled
with unrelated.... stuff.

In my defence I must say that I was trying to send it to the posters.
But I have only been using computers for a limited period of time (18
years) so naturally i made a beginners mistake and sent it to the return
adress at extropy.com. Twice!

It shall never happen again, and now I will go to my room.

according to this you dont have to count the 1st dimension either.

I'm pretty sure he didn't mean to do that.  He probably hit reply,
thinking it would reply to the person who posted.  The List software
circumvents the reply function by adding a "Reply-To:" header.  Thus,
normal replies to the original poster are redirected by the List
software to go to the entire List.  To reply to the original poster, you
have to manual address it to him, and don't use the reply key.

Thanks to Anders for pointing out this paper, and to Hal for the fixed
URL. It's ideas are both similar and complementary to the ones in Max
Tegmark's "Theory of Everything"  (even though they don't reference each
other).  It's interesting to see the different emphases placed on the same
themes by the physicist compared to the computer scientist.

The idea that all possible universes exist is probabily not a new one, but
it seems there is only recently realization that it has non-trivial
implications. I remember that Marvin Minsky mentioned it in his book
"Society of Mind" but he said something to the effect that he didn't know
what to make of the idea. 

I am interested in furthur discussions, but I'm not sure if the extropian
list is the right place to do it. I'm creating a new mailing list to talk
about the idea that all possible universes exist, and I'll make an
announcement here when it's ready.

In an open universe, free energy is not an issue in the long run, because
no information ever needs to be erased. If you run out of memory, simply
wait until there is room to expand your memory store. If the memory store
is designed correctly, its capacity would grow with volume, even if its
mass is fixed. Thus the most important adaptation a civilization could
make to survive and grow indefinitely in an open universe is to design and
construct such a memory store. We still have quite a bit of time left
until we need to start doing that in earnest. But in the mean time, any
ideas?

Check your list entries for users from germany.net. It's an error message from
this free, advertising-financed German ISP. (I've got nothing to do with it, I

Do you ask me for evidence for something economically impossible? It's
actually
you who has to prove either by history (which should be possible) or by
economic facts
that the removal of governments will lead to the free market you imagine. You
never post
sources, you never quote statistics -- you don't need this because your belief

enough. It's time to get real, kiddo. And please, stop using caps.

Eurofighter increases no one's power. Vietnam War didn't increase US gov's
power, actually it caused a lot of havoc there (but not as much as where it
happened). WW II was nominally supposed to increase Hitler's power, but it was
obvious that he stood no chance against the US & the Soviets. Had they wanted
to, the US could have quit the war right after it started, the Holocaust would
never have happened. But they remained rather speechless until the Soviet
Union was in ruins.

Exactly how broad and solid are their patents?  Do they have a patent
on "a telomerase inhibitor" or do they have a patent on "telomerase
inhibition"?  There was a time when such questions were unnecessary
but the patent office has lost its mind recently.

Col. L. Fletcher Prouty did several secret operations, served the coordination
between
CIA, Air Force and the National Security Council and was in personal contact
with
CIA-Director Dulles, the Minister of Defense, the generals and the CIA-agents.
He was
in the "Office of Special Operations" and from 1962 to 1963 he was director of
"Special 
Operations" for the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Pentagon. One of the best
historical
references you can get for secret operations.

I never contradicted anything in this paragraph.

Microsoft was considered to be the leader in operating systems in 1992. Now
what is it
today? The super-leader? Capital accumulates, money goes where money is and
banks 
only invest where they can make money. And First National made a lot of money
with Bell/Textron. The helicopter war was an absolute waste of money and
strategically 
useless. Of 6415 deaths related to aircraft, 1792 happened in plane crashes
and 4622
in helicopters. Of these 4622 deaths, 1981 (43 %) occurred without any
influence of the enemy. Prouty: "If you had an helicopter, you didn't need any
enemies anymore." Still,
they were used in huge numbers. The US Army didn't know a lot, but they knew
how this
disaster could have been avoided. But they didn't want to avoid it -- it was
part of the strategy.

Similar for the Eurofighter project running now. They officially pay DM 50
billion (!!!) 
for it (without the weapon systems), and it's hopelessly overaged. I don't
regret this (in fact I prefer inactive weapons) but it's a great present to
those building it. Will probably cost them 10 % of what they earn with it. And
who pays this present? I do, with loan taxes and value added tax, which will
be raised once again next year (while my potential pension will be decreased
again). 

You say: The government steals your money. But the government gives the money
to those producing the Eurofighter (and other industries). It's just
redistribution of wealth from the poor to the rich -- some weird kind of Robin
Hood game. How blind must you be not to see this?

You're right, they nearly went bankrupt after war. *After* war. Quoting from
their
web site:

"At the height of the war, Boeing was assembling 362 B-17s per month. Yet that
effort paled in comparison to production at North American, which built 42,683
airplanes -- including more than 15,000 T-6 Texan trainers -- for an average
of nearly 600 airplanes per month during World War II."

While it ran, it brought the banks behind Boeing profit. Certainly. (Although
I don't know who was behind Boeing at that time and whether they exited after
the war - would be interesting.) Of course, when war is over and you've got

You might be right here. But while you insinuate that what I presented was
based on a "conspiracy theory", you did not give any sources at all. This
makes things a lot easier.

Your insults and those of others (you're not the first and not the last one
calling me an idiot) just show me that you have no serious arguments against
me.

Utter nonsense. We're not just talking about "a rich family" with a few
millions set aside. We're talking about a family with connections to the
people who trade *BILLIONS* every day. These people can put an end to any
company they own, if they want to see Sun dead, Sun is dead, if they want to
see M$ dead, Bill will get a run for his money.
Such direct influence as happened with Bush is rare, but sometimes it occurs.
In most cases, politicians are just straw men. Richard Nixon applied for the
job of a politician when he read an announcement in a newspaper. They're
recruited by the power elite, told what to do and they do it. Period.

They do not want the truly free market you imagine. As I said before, it could
be nice. But it won't work because some kind of government - I couldn't have
said it better myself - always gets in the way. It's simply economically
impossible. Power structures exist, the money *is* concentrated. Money will
keep its value when government is removed - and those who possess will be able
to exercise power.

We can make a little bet. Two bets, to be precise. Bet number one: E-commerce
with cybercash will boom in the next two years. Bet number two: Mainly the
(semi-)monopolies of today (who don't miss the train) will profit from it.

No, that's the major mistake you make. You only eliminate the current form of
government. It will immediately (!) be replaced by a new form, probably more
brutal. 
But we're just talking theoretical. You won't be able to accomplish this, not
even with Eugene in your militia. The problem is that parts of the power elite
might do it.

Yawn. Your record lows have been refuted so often, it's getting boring. First,
you count the jobs. Second, the standard of living has decreased together with
the loans. Third, the accumulation of money has also increased. I have posted
evidence for all of this before, but you will find it on my web page
(http://www.excelsior.org/~erik/documents.html) in case you weren't there.

You have misunderstood me. I advocate many kinds of progress, from cloning to
nanotechnology. Much is pointless, like cryo, but I'd like to see it develop
anyway. It just has to be cleverly used. People are simply too uneducated. If
we could educate the power elites, this would probably be good enough to
ensure a better living.

I have the evidence around me. Our economy is as free as a bee (i.e. as free
as the power elites want it to be). Darwinian selection doesn't work very well
since people have gained the ability to destroy each other in large numbers.

The military is rarely, if ever used as an auxiliary police arm in Germany.
Most of the time it just sits around doing nothing. (They want to participate
in the coming war in Bosnia, but it remains to be seen whether they'll be able
to do it. Our current defense minister won't take part in it, this is sure.)
Still they buy weapons and cost us lots of money. I have to pay for this shit.
I don't like that, but the less real government we have, the more I'll have to
pay.

You may get this impression, but it comes mainly from the worldview propagated
by the media and the propaganda itself. To be more precise: 

1) There are lots of books saying the stuff you just said, that conspiracy
theories are a new religion of the Generation Y (or Q, or ABC, anything but
X), that they help to explain things etc. Their evidence or inspiration is the
conspiracy stuff shown in TV.

2) A lot of pseudo-conspiracy-theory stuff like the X-Files is broadcasted in
TV. It's desinformation, plain bullshit and sometimes true information all
mixed together. And it's popular as hell. But not because of its conspiracies,
but because it deals with supernatural stuff,
has nice special effects, a good marketing department and likeable actors (the
last factor is important, too, as many X-clones failed).

By this defintion, conspiracy theories perfectly fit here. I've oftenly been
accused of being indoctrinated by "liberal media" or being an evil socialist.
The sources I've stated have been declared useless because they came in part
from the government or "conspiracy theorists". The suggestive but weak
evidence: "We all pay too many taxes, government is robbing us."

You are called a conspiracy theorist when you only mention the CIA nowadays.
Ian Goddard's postings about TWA 800 were all of very high quality and
although some of his conclusions are a little naive, I've archived them all.
The recent forwards from Albionic were a bit poor of evidence, but I know that
these guys can do better than this. Don't get too confused in this huge game
of information and desinformation. It's all a big conspiracy anyway.

I'd like to know what it means for one universe to "interfere with"

Ah.  I believe Deutsch's ontological answer to this invokes what he calls
`shadow light', a kind of explicit leakage between adjacent universes (not
to be confused, I gather, with Bohmian pilot waves or Cramer offer waves).
I say `ontological' because obviously to date everyone uses the same
equations and calculations in solving QT problems, irrespective of how they
suppose these formalisms cash out in ontic terms.

What he was trying to show is that no one man who wasn't in a position of
authority in a government has ever been able to pull off the kind of power stunts
he listed, Indonesia's claims about George Soros aside (which is simply more
tyrannic fear mongering). Take Bill Gate's for example. He's the richest guy on
the planet, yet if the DOJ gets the supreme court to tell him to hup too, he'll be
a shuckin' and a jivin' like any bum on the street pushing an idiot stick.
Somebody like Clinton, on the other hand, can evade civil litigation, criminal
investigation and prosecution, having both his former best freind as well as his
Commerce Secretary assasinated, do FBI background checks on 300 private citizens
with no due process or probable cause, while taking more bribe money than any
organization man in history as well as bombing and invading a few countries while
he was at it, yet Clinton is worth tops, maybe $2 million personally (and bankrupt
if you talk to his accountant). Tell me that government doesn't give people in
authority excessive power.

Actually, despite the nasty rumors of the European Powers, medeival europe was a

Just to clarify my thoughts.

Does the many universe theory state that all possible other combination
of events in our universe exist as physically real universes themselves?
This leaves two scenarios, although my use of the time concept outside
of our own universe may be limiting.

1. At every instant of time where I make a decision, for instance, there
are many (infinite?) universes splitting away from our own, the creation
of the various other possible actions.

2. These many (infinite?) possible universes already exist, but my
subjective experience is limited to one. 

These concepts fascinate me: maybe consciousness can be defined as a
force which freewheels between universes along a path of it's own
decisions?

Brad.

You are invited to join a mailing list for discussion of the idea that all
possible universes exist. Some possible topics of discussion might
include:

What is the set of all possible universes?
What is a reasonable prior/posterior distribution for the universe that I
am in?
Why do we believe that both the past and the future are non-random, but
the future is more random than the past?
Before observing anything about the universe, should we expect it to have
(infinitely?) many observers?
How can we/should we predict the future and postdict the past?

Here are some papers that can serve as a basis for the discussion:

"Investigations into the Doomsday Argument", Nick Bostrom,
http://www.hedweb.com/nickb/140797/doomsday.html

"A Computer Scientist's View of Life, the Universe, and Everything",
Juergen Schmidhuber, http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen

"Is ``the theory of everything'' merely the ultimate ensemble theory?",
Max Tegmark, http://www.sns.ias.edu/~max/toe.html

Refuted by whom? Actually, the official numbers are wrong in the other direction.
The government counts people who are changing jobs with even one day off between
them as unemployed for that whole month. The governments oft discredited BLS
statistics on cost of living (which is what the inflation rates are calculated from)
have been wildly high compared to actual consumer behavior, and have totally ignored
the productivity and qualititive improvements in a given product (take computers for
example, and dont digress on to another discussion on this, the point has already
been proven). All of this makes the inflation rate artifically high, so when
compared to wage growth, the claims of the left that actual income and standard of
living have been in decline is total and absolute hogwash. I and almost everyone I
know is living a much higher standard of living than 10 years ago. Just take a
computer. The peice of equipment I have on my desk right now I couldn't have bought
for less than $50,000.00 in the mid 80's, if it or something comparable were
available at all (its a PII 233, 64MRAM, 4.8gigHD). So for what I paid $900 for last
month, I couldn't have gotten if I had mortgaged my parents house back then. You say

WHAT?

Government used to be just delivering the mail, defending the borders, and coining
money. Since the internet has proven that private industry can do 1 and 3 much
better than government, all that needs to be done now is defend the borders.
Anything else is highway robbery.

Here's a thought, our somatic cells have the genes to produce
telomerase. All we have to do is "order" them to express these genes.
Since these genes are expressed during the early stages of development
and germ cells, if we could find out external impulses to control their
expression, we could have immortal cells without the need for some
dangerous and expensive procedures. Inserting genes, filling the body
with telomerase, removing cells and treat them for later implantation,
it all seems very hard and expensive. Also, changing the genes is
something very difficult. Only a few cells treated by gene therapy do
survive, only a few mice -- less than 20%, if I remember correctly --
treated by genetic engineering do born healthy!

Could be that neurons fail because the glial cells also fail. But its
still a big problem to prevent aging in the brain -- probably the
biggest of them all. Not only do we have to make the glial cells
immortal -- which is apparently difficult and dangerous because any
mistake leads to death or brain damage --, but we might also have to
change the neurons -- something even harder and incorporating huge
risks.

One last thing, telomerase could indeed have more functions than just
correct the telomers. I read a study (if you want to, I'll look for it)
a few months ago that showed that telomerase is highly active in cancer
cells with their telomers "fully-extended" -- not the exact definition,
but you get the point. Also, telomerase is active in leukocytes, but I
haven't found the extension of that action.

See ya,

Several people have remarked that Dolly is already evidence against any
simple understanding of the role of telomere length.  Here's a salient bit
(quoted without permission) from Gina Kolata's new book CLONE: THE ROAD TO
DOLLY AND THE THE PATH AHEAD (William Morrow 1997; Allen Lane 1997):

`More than 90 per cent of all the cell divisions that ever occur in an
animal's... life occur in the womb...  If Dolly's telomeres had only a few
divisions to go, she could not possibly have made it through foetal life...

`...another problem with the telomere hypothesis: Eggs are packed with
enzymes that lengthen telomeres.  [I assume she just means telomerase, and
that this is already in the cytoplasm of the host ovum.  DB]  In fact, one
of the first things eggs do when they are fertilized is to adjust the
lengths of the telomeres on their chromosomes.  So if a clone started out
with telomeres that were too short, it is all but certain that the egg
would lengthen them'  (pp. 204-5).

Okay, breathe easy for Dolly.  But here's the kicker, something I haven't
read anywhere else:

`[Lee M.] Silver [of MOUSE GENETICS (OUP 1995) fame] told me that mouse
researchers have even created mice that do not have [telomerase].  The mice
seemed healthy... are now up their fourth generation [sans telomerase]...
yet to find anything wrong...' (p. 205).

Hmm.

Sorry, usually I greatly enjoy your posts and agree with what you have to
say, but in this case I would counsel against your own rhetorical
technique.  I'd prefer to see a short, reasoned rebuttal.  As it is, all
you're saying is `yah yah, you're another!'  Besides, I think it needs to
be acknowledged that most people *will* be revolted by the prospect of
harvesting decorticate cloned bodies (even more than they would if they let
themselves think about harvesting machine-sustained cadavers right now).
Mockery of the kind you use here only works, I suspect, when one taps into
the audience's own suppressed agreement with one's case.  Here, your
response is too easily dismissed as `just another kook, Jim'.  IMHO.

The thing about secret operations is just that -- they are secret.  Using
one person's testimonial as a factual basis is unsound.  And even if he was
a spook, that doesn't make his sole opinion the "Word of God" so to speak,
of secret operations.

You are mixing industrial economics with information economics, which
operate on very different principles.  Industrial monopolies don't last
when they aren't government enforced.  Information monopolies are much more
difficult to oust because the investments are severely front-loaded, and
ubiquity increases value.  Microsoft is somewhere between and information
and industrial monopoly, and for this reason is much more difficult to
eliminate in the free market, although by no means impossible.  While Bell
was a leader in its time, it is by no means as prominent now, despite a lot
of government support that you claim it received.

Your helicopter accident figures have no relevant context i.e. you don't
show how many lives were saved by increased mobility and the ability to get
troops out of a tight situation if necessary, all due to the helicopter.
This like saying car airbags kill people (they do), but then forgetting to
mention that ten times that number are saved by airbags.  A net positive.  

Incidentally, having helicopters are a *huge* advantage on the battlefield,
so the benefits far outweighed the costs associated with them at the time.

I don't know how military contracting is done in Europe, but in the US
defense contractors are tightly regulated and audited.  The profit from a
typical US military contract never exceeds 7%, often less depending on the
contract type.  The small margins are made up for by volume of course, but
the huge margins aren't there.  In fact, most US companies won't take
defense contracts because it is often not profitable do so due to the extra
overhead associated with them.

Having a pension is nice and all, but if you didn't rely on someone else to
provide it, you wouldn't have to worry about it, would you?  Rather than
waiting for someone else to support me (i.e. Social Security) I have found
it far more prudent to take care of my own future.  It is your fault if it
is an issue.

I agree with about half of it.  It is indeed stupid and unjust for the
government to spend money on a net loss project like the Eurofighter, but
both the rich and the poor lose.  Neither of them are getting the money
they put into the system.  Eliminate taxes for these things, and both the
government and the rich are generally better off.  And yes, a few rich
people probably do make money on the Eurofighter, but most of the rich
people are paying for it.

The problem is that war is not profitable in the US.  In WWII, prices,
wages, production, profits, etc. were all strictly controlled by the
government to optimize wartime resource allocation.  It is the strict
wartime regulation that destroys the businesses afterwards.  If you don't
make profits when you ramp up production, you will suffer a significant net
loss when production stops.  You can't afford to support vast manufacturing
facilities if they aren't being utilized at a significant profit.  Too many
companies were forced to increase their facilities by the government, but
had no significant revenues to support them when the government stopped
buying war production.  Most of the companies that grew large (like Boeing)
during WWII were funded by the government, either directly or indirectly.

E-commerce already is big, and becoming bigger.  I've been in and out of
e-commerce since '94, but it may surprise you to find out that it is as
profitable for individuals as it is for companies.  Last year me and my
"partner in crime" made just over $100,000 in gross e-commerce revenues
(part-time) on a number of amusing little ventures intended to test the
current state of the e-commerce waters.  We also made a pretty decent net
profit.  And it isn't just us.  We know and have met a lot of other people
who are making a very nice spot of cash on the Internet.  More and more
people make a good living at it (we were doing it primarily for
fun/research).  The nice thing about the Internet is that the admission is
*much* lower than traditional commerce structures.

I have more reservations regarding cybercash at the moment, due mostly to
transaction costs that they never seem to be able to get rid of.

I am not going to waste my time arguing this, because it simply isn't true.
 Several industries are faced with *negative* unemployment.  I don't know
about standard of living (the definition is slippery), but violent crime is
way down, the cities are the cleanest they have been in a long time, and
most people can afford to buy more gizmos than ever.  The only real
complaint I know of is that people are having to work longer hours to make
up for the labor shortage.

It is not nearly as free as the US.  I do work for several European firms,
and many of the young, bright individuals in their IT departments complain
bitterly that they have been disallowed the opportunity to profit from the
tech industry.  Most European countries have much stricter regulations
concerning small companies and startups than in the US.  This has been
mostly imposed by legislation funded by the large European tech firms who
would rather not have the competition.  And just to make the point, if
there wasn't a government available to create such legislation, those large
companies in question would be forced to compete rather than opting out
illegitimately.

The German military *is* used to supress "radical" factions within the
country, sometimes with unjustified deadly force.  They are responsible for
dozens of deaths a year, but it never ends up in the media as far as I can
tell.  The only reason I am aware of this is because US military units have
been involved on occassion.   When I was in the Army (long story), we had a
few people in my platoon who had been in US Special Forces units in
Germany.  The German military units they worked with would, on occassion,
neutralize (to a man!) "radical" and "terrorist" factions in the country.
Apparently this is not all that uncommon.  I have another friend (also
Special Forces) who quit the Army after killing a man and a woman on one of
these missions (incidentally he was shot twice during that raid, but body
armor saved him).  We have bureaucrats like the FBI to fulfill that role in
the US.  The US military is for external affairs.

This makes no sense at all.  One way or another, the government already
takes more than half of my money.  If they took any more, I'd stop working.
 I work too hard to have the government take my money and piss it away on
someone who undoubtedly does not deserve it.

Yes, the telomerase "knockout" mice (to use the jargon) were perfectly
normal. They didn't even have increased rates of cancer, which I suppose
was unexpected. However, mice are not a good model for telomere research
because mouse cells can sometimes spontaneously immortalize in culture.
Human cells don't do that. Mice may have other ways of legthening their
telomeres other that telomerase.

The point you make about the ovum could be the crucial explanation of why
Dolly exists at all.

AFAIK PCR (pancritical rationalism) was based largely on Popper's
original work on critical rationalism. I don't think anybody has since
invented a better way of discerning potential knowledge from falsehood,
while keeping an open mind to new ideas and always reducing error. PCR
is the scaffolding upon which Extropian epistemology is based. I
woulnd't call that idiocy.

Popper's reasoning is a lot more coherent than John Horgan makes it out
to be in the shallow treatment presented in that interview. Horgan
doesn't stop after bashing Popper--through the rest of that book, a
number of other big-name scientists are shown to be bumbling idiots as
well. Horgan is a pretty sharp writer with a broad knowledge base, but
IMHO he gets way too uppity with a number of well-respected,
leading-edge thinkers. Most of the time he is *so* sure of himself, that
*his* theory (the rise of "ironic science") is right and nothin' nobody
says is gonna change his mind, no matter what.

His abusive tone and derisive remarks about some of the other
interviewees are downright childish at times. Of course, he doesn't say
anything rude to their faces, he saves it all for the narratives he
writes later to pad out the interviews. I lost a lot of respect for
Horgan while reading _The End of Science_...  Making fun of the guys you
don't agree with is not a valid way to go about making your point.

John Horgan is an anti-Extropian. He'd call us all hopeless dreamers
living in a fantasy world eagerly awaiting a technological utopia that's
never going to arrive. Instead, apparently, science is just going to
"run out of steam" and innovation will somehow just gradually slow down
and then stop.

Uh-huh. Right. I guess neo-tech is the only thing that can save us
now...

Nope, still a point: 0+0=0.

Neither *is* a dimension.  A point is an entity with no dimension

What do you think a dimension is?  How do you start one?

Nope.  Three points *determine* a unique plane - that means that (in
Euclidean or similar geometry) there's only one plane which *contains*
those three points.  It does not mean that those three points, all by
themselves, *make* a plane.

Then they determine a unique two-dimensional subspace (called a plane)

Spacetime is, indeed, an example of a four-dimensional continuum.
Other examples are more abstract.

Yes, an N-dimensional entity can be embedded in a continuum of N-or-more
dimensions; since a point is 0-dimensional, it can be embedded in 0-space

To state the position of a point in normal space requires 3 measurements.

So why preach to the choir? I can't think of a single extropian who has
any love for the government. IMHO being anti gov't is just another

Me! Me! (Fx: jumps in the air wavimng arms excitedly.) I love the government!

At least ... er, they didn't soak me for as much income tax as I was
expecting this year. (Must send my accountant a bottle of champagne.)

Or do you mean the concept of 'government' in general, rather than any
specific administration?

Seriously, though. If you look at things from the perspective of social
darwinism, an argument can be made that Government -- as a concept --
must have been, if not beneficial, then at least a functiona, rugged,
and competitive concept at some time in the past. Otherwise it wouldn't
be so ubiquitous today.

I don't like facile generalisations like "government BAD" and "free market 
GOOD". Both institutions may bring benefits and may be open to abuse,
depending on the specific implementation. What I want to know is WHY
governments at the end of the twentieth century have become bloated, 
inefficient, and counterproductive monsters that are resented by many 
of their citizens. 

Anyone got any good ideas? (Preferably ones that haven't been hashed
over until they're dead meat already; if the Extropians list is anything
like it was in the old days, even _whispering_ the idea that government
isn't automatically evil is going to induce a Pavlovian reaction among
some of the less flexible libertarian subscribers.) Better still: anyone
prepared to put on their Devil's Advocate hat and pretend to be a
government employee trying to explain why what they do is _good_ ?

Its certainly an entropic hole if one lets such things get to an obsessive stage. The
rational and practical things to do are to work to be able to and to enable others to
minimize the govt's role in our lives.

What I find so troubling is that an office so far away from the power centers, that
is supposedly under the aegis of the Inspector General (which, constitutionally, is
the watcher of the watchers), could hide such an implication, as well as cover up
the coverup, and conduct a vandetta against people in their organization who still
beleive in public oversight. That Ron Brown may have been murdered is not in my
opinion, the important thing. I do, however, think that there is an important
national security possibility here: That the administration could be covering this
up, becuase he might have been killed by the serbs, in order to prevent public
sentiment to come down in favor of a more vietnam-like involvement in Bosnia. If
this is the case, what they are doing could be laudable, but even then, I would say
that they still have handled things badly, as they have not gotten all involved
parties vetted and sworn to secrecy over this matter. Yeah, Im damning them if they
did and if they didn't, so what, its the incompetence that counts.

Personally I'm having an amusing time watching my socialist acquaintances
who voted for Tony Blair have fits because he's taking the British welfare
state apart; something the supposedly capitalist Tories always talked
about but were too scared to actually do. Frankly, anyone who still
believes that socialism stands a whelk's chance in hell should be looking
very closely at what the 'socialists' are doing in the UK.

My personal opinion is that with the rise of industrialisation and the
concentration of power in large industrial corporations, big government
became a good way for them to maintain power. Add to that that people
used to believe in socialism (which like other pyramid schemes actually
did deliver to the first in line) and hence it wasn't as bad initially
as it turned out to be in the long-term; people who believed in the 
system were much less likely to slack off and provide inefficient service
or exploit the system than those who grew up under socialism.

As people have got fed up with socialism and new technologies spread
power around, government is increasingly getting in the way and 
proving unable to do anything worthwhile.

Don't look at me -- I voted against both sets of bastards. (Nice little

Not exactly true. The Labour party in the UK has basically succumbed to
the same historic compromise that the Democrat party in the USA made
a couple of decades ago, realigning themselves on the right.

Big corporations as the engine of government?

That doesn't seem to explain the widespread _support_ for government
institutions I see around me, at least here in the UK.

My pet hypothesis is future shock; the whole of western civilization is
suffering from a subliminal but chronic case of the ailment, with most 
people unable to examine any new development without slight feelings of
panic and anxiety. This makes it really easy for moral panics and knee-
jerk rejection to take over. (It's an easy target for politicians, too;
in an increasingly globalized market, they _need_ some way of demonstrating
to their constituents that they care deeply and can do something about
their concerns. They can't jigger the interest rate or raise money through
taxation very easily, but they can strike postures over trivial irrelevencies
and promise legislation to control the perceived threat -- things like the
current idiotic ban on human cloning, or the mass hysteria over satanic
ritual child abuse a few years ago, or porn on the internet.)

Select a random push-button issue and watch your neighbour jump to
attention when you mention it; odds are, they haven't ever really
_thought_ about it, because they're running as hard as they can just
trying to get their heads around the necessary complexities of day to
day life.  The standard stock response to an unfamiliar challenge is
"the government ought to pass a law about it".  It's a lot easier to
shrug it off onto Big Brother's shoulders than to have to think about
uncomfortable and unfamiliar and possibly threatening new things --
especially with so many other demands on their attention to worry about.

I don't know if it has anything to do with aging but in today's (Jan 16) issue 
of Science, the same one that has the stuff about telomerase and immortal 
human cells, there is another interesting article. Scott Campbell and Patricia  
Murphy found another biological clock, it works at a much higher level than
the cell and is a part of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. 
This clock is responsible for our sleep patterns among other things, when it 
gets out of whack we get jet lag and winter depression. Campbell and Murphy 
found a way to reset this clock with light, but the astonishing thing is that 
the light need not be applied to the eyes, anywhere on the skin will do, 
the back of the knee for example. There must be a signal but how the brain 
knows that light is being applied to the back of the knee is a mystery. 
The authors say the procedure is harmless and easy to do  and should soon be 
in common use on airliners. Any potential for more profound applications 
remains to be seen.

I've been thinking about this "Extropian Party" idea, and I think we
should take a few things into account:

1. People are stupid
2. People are stupid
3. People are stupid

So taking these three points into account I have formulated the
following plan for an Extropian Party:

1. Rather than the usual Libertarian "everyone should be free"
nonsense, I propose - "We should be free.  You should do as we say."

2. Forget Democracy, Totalitarianism is the only route a modern party
should take.

3. Don't shy away from coercion - you're free (remember?) you can do
as you please.

4. We're not here to "make a better world" we're here to "make a
better self."  Anyone who isn't a member is simply media fodder - use
em and abuse em.

5. Our campaign should be one of lying, cheating and media propaganda
- in an election you can't stoop too low.

At this point many of you may think I'm joking - I'm not.  So I'd
better explain myself:

By creating a system where everyone's free I can't guarantee that
everything will go my way, there's bound to be some post-democracy
fallout of people who don't know what to do, so they'll carry on the
way they were.  Added to that are the people who are just inherently
stupid.  So what we want is a Totalitarian society that rewards the
intellectual (democracy tries to make everyone equal - big mistake!)
and ignores anyone against it.  And before the knee-jerk "you're
Hitler" mails come my way, Hitler (just like the majority of leaders)
was trying to make a better world, I'm simply trying to make the world
better for myself (a far more admirable goal.)

So if you want to join, agree, or just make some *critical* analysis.

	The report I heard on NPR didn't say the "signal" was a
mystery.  It's via the blood.  Evidently the "himo" in the hemoglobin
is molecularly very similar to light sensative stuff that makes plants
green.  The "back of the knee" is good because there are lots of blood
vessels close to the surface of the skin and light can be easily
applied there such that the eyes aren't aware of it.  Light shined in
the eyes also makes lots of contact with blood so this is why this
sets this clock so well.

	Interesting.

I suppose that you could store information by the position of a particle
in a box, and then if you could make the box twice as big, you could
store an extra bit of information (not a perfect example, due to the
momentum uncertainty, but maybe there are nondemolition measurement
systems which would work better).

In The Physics of Immortality, Frank Tipler argues that open universes
impose limits on calculation.  Unfortunately his argument is not technical.
Here is what he says, on page 139 (chapter 3, section "Experimental Tests
of the Omega Point Theory"):

"As I discussed in Chapter III, Freeman Dyson pointed out that, although
the energy is available in open and flat universes, the information
processing must be carried out over larger and larger proper volumes.
This fact ultimately makes impossible any communication between opposite
sides of the 'living' region in a flat universe, because the redshift
implies that arbitrarily large amounts of energy must be used to signal,
and Dyson showed that only a finite amount of energy is availble.
On the other hand, open universes expand so fast in the far future that
it becomes impossible for structures to form of sufficiently larger and
larger size to store a diverging amount of information."

Most of Tipler's book is devoted to exploring how things would go in a
closed universe, and he doesn't go into much detail about exactly what the
problems are in an open universe.  He doesn't refer to any technical
references to buttress the argument above, and it doesn't seem to be
mentioned in the "appendix for scientists".

I don't completely follow what Tipler's point is about redshifts.
I don't think he is saying that signalling involves a loss of energy,
since the photon used to signal can be recaptured, and although it will
be redshifted, the universe has cooled by the same factor so the photon's
energy upon recapture should be just as useful as the energy which was
used to create it.

He may be saying that at some point there won't be enough energy in
the whole universe to create a single photon of enough energy to signal
from one side of the computer to the other.  Apparently there is only a
finite amount of energy in the (accessible?) universe.  But I'm not sure
that there is a threshold energy which would be necessary to create the
signalling photon; perhaps photons can have arbitrarily small energies,
as long as they are hotter than the background.

Yes, but my point, in some post, was that whole-body levels of
telomerase are probably already close to optimal.  If the gains
from increasing telomerase exceeded the risks, evolution would
already have cranked it up.  In order to get big gains from
toying with telomerase, we will probably have to use it with more 
precision than evolution can usually manage.

A whole-body activation of a cancer-limiter is dangerous in the 
extreme.

Also, although genetic manipulation of removed cells is expensive,
we can usually get a few cells successfully manipulated.  Thanks
to the glories of exponential growth that may be all that's 
required.  If rejuvenation also increases response to growth
factors (probable) then just a few skin cells could eventually
replace a whole skin via faster reproduction.

That certainly seems true. The Gubbermint(tm) may have had an origin in
the mafia, the mafia certainly converges towards the same state (anecdotal
evidence, but then look at my current domain). The ecological niche
certainly seems to be very real. Corollary: if attempted now, from a
sudden power vacuum a a state very much resembling the current one will
spring. The only way to combat this would seem to boost education, which
is intrinsically difficult, the nature of your clientele considered.

I dunno, it seems the attitude of the people has lots of impact. The
reason current power semimonopoly in Russia exists is a function of
recent-to-mid history. Certainly long-duration patches of strong state
select for mindrot among its (granted, sometimes unwilling) subscribers. 
Globally/on the long run, strong state should have not much chance due to
its limited competitiveness, however.

Unfortunately for that plan, it fails to take into account that its far
easier to make the better world for yourself if you try to make the world
better for everyone, than by butting your head against the wall.

Not necessarily so, for the timescales available for the darwinian
optimization seem to be be smaller than the demand invoked by the
(evolutionary) quite recent memetic takeover. No refs whatsoever, of
course. (Otoh other suspectedly antigeriatric shenanigans as glutathione
level in serum which is close at the biological tolerance threshold seem

What amazes me most, that everyone (me included) seems to be knowing
everything about evolution, even arcane agendas inclusive. This seems
strange, for so far I've missed the daily fitness function synoptics
update in the news.

In a continuious manifold, the dimensionality is the number of real
numbers required to uniquely define a point therin. A line needs 1
number, a plane 2 numbers, etc. For flat eculidian space this is easily
used to calculate a lot of other things, for example, distance = sqrt
(x*x + y*y + ....). It gets harder for noneuclidian spaces - for example
the surface of a torus.

Though it is possible to map all the points on a plane to a line, and
all points in a 3 space to a plane and therefore to a line, such
mappings violate continuity, which requires that a small displacement of
the point result in a small change in the real number tuplet which
defines the location of the point.

I just read a message entitled "Immortal Astronaut"
on the Future Culture mailing list, about 77-year-old
John Glenn going to space again, and thought:
what if NASA decides to launch a manned star
mission at some point?   They would have to take
serious measures to extend the lives of the crew
then, and would explain to the public that radical
life extension is sometimes a good thing...

  There will probably be other uses of technologies
of extropian interest that would justify them in the
public opinion: improving the intelligence of military
commanders in the time of war so that they could better
protect the average citizens, enhancing physical skills
of surgeons and empathic abilities of social workers who
help "disadvantaged individuals", improve sensitivity of
doctors working with cute babies, extending lives of
public heroes, etc.  And then, among the thousands of
"good" uses, the technology wouldn't seem that evil anymore...
Look how little time was needed to make opponents of
"commercialization of the Net"  cool their rage...
They were so prominent just a couple of years ago -
and now nobody even discusses the topic.  The "Net
socialists" were not destroyed or out-argued; they
were just drowned by the practical logic of the Net
development.
  So if we just come up with some "PC uses" for cloning
and telomerase manipulation...

Yes, and what this advantage is is not really clear. As with many
objectionable things, there are reasons for their existence, and until
these reasons are known, it is not possible to design better
alternatives.

So far, I haven't heard much on this that makes much sense. The
Extropian knee-jerk libertarian and privatization notions just don't
quite cut it for me, and I admit I am a bit unclear as to why. I could
post a list of annoying questions, and expect that I would get lots of
references to the anarchic and libertarian press, but AFAIK, these ideas
don't seem to be very popular, and seem even harder to implement. I
suspect this difficulty lies in other areas than libertarianism or the
free market. My tendency is to think in terms of depth psychology, but
that too has its problems.

So, what is the REAL function of gummint monsters?? Really..

Also for nightshift workers!

The prevailing wisdom (and the one I know), is that the clock is reset by
something called the retinohypothalamic tract, which is *supposed* to be a
circuit that connects the retina/suprachiasmatic nucleus/hypothalamus/and
pineal gland.  What happened to this circuit?  Do the auther's propose
that is a fig newton of neuroscientist's imagination? (or an ancillary
mechanism?) This seems very plausible to me... I've always wondered how
moles have their clocks reset by light when they're blind!

This whole blood thing makes a fair amount of sense.  It seems to me the
clock must be generated by some chemical negative feedback mechanism,
maybe this mechanism's chemical constituents are altered by the transfer
of high energy electrons from a light-excited hemoglobin molecule?

Is this true? I once received an e-mail talking about this "mice without
telomerase" but I never had a change to confirm it.

True, I mention this in my site. The major problem is the brain. If
neurons do age independant of the glial cells, we have a big problem.
Even if they don't, glial cells would have to be "replaced" very
quickly, if things get out of control in the skin, we have some chances
of controling it again, in the brain we're dead. Also, this "cellular
proliferation theory" must be done very fast. "Corrected" cells might
spread in the body, but it's not an instantaneous process, it takes
time, during that time normal cells are losing activity but still are
alive in the body preventing the "immortal" cells from spreading. If we
don't make a good amount -- I don't know how many, but certainly a lot
more than we're doing now with gene therapy -- of cells immortal, we
might see our heart stop because only 1/3 of the cells are active!
(actually muscle cells are also post-mitotic, so what I'm saying is
impossible, but you get the idea)

See ya,

Persons 'expressing a lack of confidence in the presidency' are

ive been thinking of this

if you take any number of points (maybe or maybe not an infinite number), and
place them randomly within any space larger than a point, and cross a line
through that space at random intersections to the perimeters, the line will
not intersect any points.

also, any number of points smaller (maybe or maybe not an infinite number)
touching each other will still be one point.

Well, the memes might benefit from longer-lived humans, but being
able to transmit memes does not in and of itself change the biology.
While memes add to the benefit of long life, most species gene sets
have already evolved to let the individuals live as long as
as possible.

It's true that humans have been through a major lifespan change 
recently that extended lifespan by 50%-100% (the old 100% oft cited
seems to exaggerate a bit; chimps live longer than we had thought).
The genes might not yet have reached an optimum.  There's an 
interesting Danish twin longevity study which tackled whether
genetic variation in human lifespans can evolve (generally species
have a fair amount of genetic variability in lifespan but it's
not evolvable).  Frustratingly, they considered only the options
of "it's all evolvable" and "none is evolvable".  "None" won
out by a statistical hair.  Realistically, probably some of the
variation can evolve and some can't; if we assume that the similar
predictive power of the two approaches means we should split the
difference (completely uncalled for but oh well...) then 10%
of variation in human lifespan comes from evolvable genetic variation.
This is very high - fruit flies are at 3% - and would make broad-spectrum
approaches like whole-body telomerase stimulation somewhat plausible.

This is from near the end of an essay, "Notes on Kafka," by Theodor Adorno:

"The heroes of the *Trial* and the *Castle* become guilty not through
their own guilt--they have none--but because they try to get justice on
their side. 'The original sin, the ancient injustice committed by man,
consists in his protest--one which he never ceases to make--that he has
suffered injustice, that the original sin was done against him.'"
[I assume the final quote is from Kafka himself.]

Later Adorno uses the term "the reification of the subject," and I think
he means that the idea of an atomic self, with RIGHTs, who just SHOULD be
treated JUSTLY, is a kind of sucker's game that gets us to buy into...
   Rules that just MUST be obeyed;
   Quibbling over what those rules should be;
   Mutual suspicion, separation and alienation,
   The whole enforcing, patrolling, bureaucratic apparatus;
   A hierarchy of representatives, kings, God, who Stand For What's Right;
   and a hierarchy of body, id, ego, superego, all restless and incomplete
      without Justice (but also control) from outside and further up the
      chain.

In other words, the sort of society we have plants a permanent
dissatisfaction in our makeup, and in order to scratch the itch, we
continuously act in ways that buttress this society.  Justice is the
carrot we will grow in these pyramids we're building, the promised cure
for the unfairness of life.

None of which is to promote *in*justice, violation of personal boundaries,
passive giving up of what anyone holds dear; or to completely trash ideas
like dignity, property, protection, insurance or even What's Right; or to
deny the strategic benefits of treating bad guys like bad guys.

Instead the lesson is that if you take justice as an ideal that can
actually be achieved, or simply must be served, you're falling for a
bad misconception and pursuing an idol that someone sold you, rather
than your own interest.

Uncentered selfishness (of the everyday guess, grope and make-do kind) can
not be given up (or abdicated) in favor of a higher good like justice.
Both the higher (hint) good and the presumed more noble (hint) self who
sees it, are just self-perpetuating illusions that actually increase the
injustice and pettiness that scare people into buying.

This is not meant to explain or protest on behalf of anarchism, just to
present an interesting analogy:

There is no Protestant party line.  Different types of protestants
believe different sorts of things.  The one thing they have in common is
a belief that an intermediary between God and People isn't needed.  There
is no protestant alternative to the Pope except personal prayer and good
living, variously defined.

Similarly, all an anarchist believes, all anarchism says, is that
government isn't needed to intervene between reality and people.
We don't all believe in the same things.  We offer no alternative to
government except various ideas about things people can do on their own.

In this light the progress of Western Thought is a slow painful
simplification.

By that argument, anything that is must be great.  And stupidity is quite
pervasive, so it must be  "if not beneficial, then at least a functiona[sic],
rugged, and competitive concept".:)

A better question would be: when have governments ever not "become
bloated, inefficient, and counterproductive monsters that are resented
by many of their citizens"?  It might just be the nature of the beast
rather bad people that makes government do this.  If this is so, then
we must either kill the beast (the anarchist solution) or put it on a tight
leash (the minarchist ditto).  To dream that if only your team was in
power and all the good that would do is only to repeat the last few
millenia of reform and revolution.

Also, the big difference between government and markets is that the
former uses force, the latter persuasion.  Whenever one proposes
to use the government to do anything, one is supporting the use
of force to achieve that end -- which generally means one is
assuming persuasion would not work.  Now, would a posthuman
or even a mere transhuman need to use force?

Frankly, I don't think this list is a good place for this debate.

In creating a total state, you create a machine in which those who
just want power can take over.  The Joe Stalins and Idi Amins can
then move in, clean out the Extropians and other transhumanists,
take over the machine and use it just to expand their power.

And there are a lot of people out there who just want power.  Are
you sure only your boys/girls/hermaphrodites will be the ones
holding the reins?

I've a better plan, uplift octopodes and everything else, do all other
kinds of research underground and create new technologies that
the government can't control -- from new forms of money to new
ways to communicate.  Present faits accompli so that all the rest
of humanity can do is live with it.

This way, the effort you would've wasted on building the super
state will be better used on making the stuff you need to
ascend to posthumanity.

Of course.  It is a successful parasite or predator and we are the
host or prey.  Just because it's higher on the food chain,
doesn't mean it's better or worse than us.  But it is our enemy.

>I don't like facile generalisations like "government BAD" and "free market

Huh?  Food is good for us and predators are bad.  Perhaps in some self-
flagilating sense too much food makes us lazy and disease weeds out the
weak leaving the strong.  But in that case we're the strong but underfed
ones and it makes perfect sense to say: food is good and disease is bad.

Still, the self-flagilating truth is that government evolved from an
instability caused by our ignorance and fallacious beliefs.  It has
prospered by taking advantage of our imperfections and even discovering
more and more of them.  It actually has taught us things, demonstrated
dangers, and yet without destroying us totally (yet).  Yippee.

>What I want to know is WHY
>governments at the end of the twentieth century have become bloated,

The demonstration continues.  Because they can afford to.  Because we,
their food source, are sheep who haven't destroyed them.  I don't see
what's so mysterious.  Rot advances unless you stop it.  It has no
interest in being efficient, productive or not bloated.  Eating and
spreading is what it does, just like any successful, evolved life form.
Don't you understand your own idea?

You don't have to whisper.  My only reaction is mystification.  Here is
not the place to go over these basics, aren't there economics books on the
recommended reading list?  Haven't you read them?

If you don't have any ideas, what's the point?  Do you want someone
to advocate Santa Claus just because you think he *can't* be *all*
fictional?  I think you're taking a sense of fairness a little too far.

	I don't recall anything being said about the kind of light in
the NPR report I heard.  Just light.  The subjects having some kind of
heatless light (so they wouldn't know when the light was on or off)
being directed to a pad covering the back of the knee through fiber
optics I believe.  The subjects being in a sunless environment so the
didn't know what time it was or something like that.  Supposedly they
were able to reset their time clocks at will by properly controlling
the timing of the light to the back of the knee.  They talked about
the possibility of having such devices on long airplane flights and
such.

If you do that, the capacity of the memory store would only grow as the
log of the volume. Is it possible to do better, or is there an upper bound
of M*log V on the entropy of an isolated system? (Well that is clearly not
true since a black hole has entropy proportional to M*V^(1/3), but perhaps
the bound holds when M is small compared to V?)

Another problem is once you've stored information as the position of a
particle, how do you then retrieve it?

I don't understand why it would be impossible to form larger and larger
structures. I imagine that a structure would be gravationally bound and
contain a reserve of free energy to expand as needed.

If your computer is reversible, you shouldn't have to use up any energy
for computation, so this situation shouldn't come up.

I don't see anything unexpected in that, if fact, it's hard to see how mice 
without the enzyme telomerase could ever get cancer, unless the mice still 
had a the telomerase gene somewhere and it just wasn't turned on to make the 
enzyme. I'll bet somebody is exposing the mice to very carcinogenic chemicals
to see what happens.

I must admit that I would also expect the mice to have severe reproductive 
difficulties, but if they really have gone through 4 generations then the 
trouble can't be too bad. This probably means that we really don't understand 
what's going on very well. Lots about this puzzle seem contradictory, but the 
parts must fit together somehow.

I've mentioned before Jane Jacobs' theory that the economic ideal is
free-trading city-states, but the military ideal (as shown by history) is
large nation-states.

I've just read Richard Posner's _The Economics of Justice_, wherein he argues
that all societies have had economically efficient structures for their
technology.  (Robin tells me Posner is not unique in law and economics.)  He
goes into detailed analysis of case histories, but the simple argument is
evolutionary: the societies which survive and grow are the ones which are
equipped to survive and grow.  Especially hunter-gatherer societies,
which had a long time to adapt to a limited spectrum of environments and
environmetnal change.

To me it seems possible that we have one of the least efficient societies
ever seen on the planet, because of our rapid rate of change; still, while
the convergence of the Western democracies may be because of a shared
infatuation with semi-socialism, the welfare states may just as well be the
natural balance at this time between growth and social order.  Or maybe
it's because no one's tried a really efficient anarchy.  It's hard to
know.

I'm willing to consider the Communist countries a very failed experiment, not
the natural result of economic forces.  I'm less willing to dismiss the
structure of the West out of hand.

On the other hand, such analysis offers hope that new technologies may
change things.  Posner explains much about primitive societies by way of
their high transaction and information costs.  (Literacy by itself may
be a powerfully transformative technology.)  So modern technology may
eventually create more congenial governments for us.

On the gripping hand, we're hoping for evolution on the scale of
decades or less, which may be a lot to ask of humans.  And at some point
order and stability _is_ as important as growth, at least if growth
depends on large complex societies.  I'm not holding my anarchic breath
yet.

Strictly speaking, it is three NONcolinear -- i.e., not in the same line --
points that determined a unique plane in Euclidean space, while
four NONcoplanar -- i.e., not in the same plane -- points that
determine a unique Euclidean three space.

The problem with this analogy is that statists are like Protestants too.  They
all have different ideas on what to do with government once they are in
power.  They might seem similar to us looking it, but that's like someone
who doesn't like Techno saying, "All Techno sounds alike to me."

One might even blast the analogy further.  Even though Catholics believe
in a united front -- one Pope, one code of beliefs for all Christians -- they
are factionalized too.  The history of Catholicism seems to be a history
of heretics taking over.  Granted, not all heretics gained power, but it
is interesting to see how the usual progression is whichever idea gains
power was previously thought heretical.  See _A History of Heresy_
(1976) by David Christie-Murray for more on this.

In fact, it is usually those who argue for ideological unity wherein one
person or group rules all others that create such factions.  

For example, the World Communist movement, because each faction
believed only one could be the vanguard, splintered into many 
antagonist groups, starting long before the Sino-Soviet split.  See
_The Origins of Alliances_ (1987) by Kenneth M. Walt for more and
more detailed examples of this phenomena.

Yes indeed!  However, consider the idea that the beast (parasite or predator)

I think the only problem is there are neoLuddites and
technophobes.  They love to create doomsday scenarios,
such as your hyperintelligent generals turning into Ceasars
and taking over the nation, controlling the disadvantage
with new tech, and the like.  Also, the general public
seems to like these scare stories and the images painted
appear to be much longer lived than the pro-technology
ones.

This does not mean we shouldn't try, BUT it will be a
difficult and long struggle.  We should not expect
success overnight.

There is a problem with conspiracy theories.  On the whole, they
are wrong.  Surely, people do conspire, but it is not as successful
as conspiracy theorists think.

Also, as for its utility, it has a way of backfiring.  Those deeply
mired in conspiracy theories, from my experience, are either
apathetic -- because they believe they are impotent while any
group of conspirers are omnipotent -- or pro-government --
because they think government as a institution is great, if
it weren't for those evil conspiracies.  In other words, eliminate
the conspiracies and we can have a welfare state or a total
democracy that really works.  Thus, they are utopians.

These are the risks you run if you spread this meme.  Another
risk is that those who have no affinity for the simplistic
explanations of conspiracy theorists tend to think you are a
kook.  Thus, you gain influence amongst simpletons only to
lose it amongst those who would be better to have as allies.

I wouldn't bring this up if the average person, rightly or
wrongly -- and this applies to the average smart person
too -- thinks our ideas are weird or even insane.  Now,
couple transhumanism/Extropianism with conspiracy
theories and see if you are taken more seriously.

Cheers!

I think you need to use some energy temporarily, although you should be
able to recover it.

It may be that the universe expansion is worse than I thought.
Consider that the computer must, as time goes on, be composed more
and more of empty space, since the density of space is decreasing
(exponentially?).  We must signal from one side to the other by sending
something that takes energy, whether gravitational radiation, photons,
or particles.  Suppose we send a particle.  The problem may be that if we
give the particle too small an initial speed, that it never gets there.
It loses ground due to the universe expanding out from under it, and at
some point it actually starts to go backwards.  This means that there
is a certain minimum energy necessary for this kind of signalling, and
that minimum energy will increase as the structure grows larger.

I'm not 100% sure about this but Tipler describes a more moderate effect
like this in a closed universe, and it should be worse in an open one.
Also it's not clear how this generalizes to the other forms of signalling,
but maybe something similar happens.

This doesn't follow at all, at least if you assume that the only
advantage of increased levels of telomerase is increased lifespan.  To
reproduce during most of homo sapien's history on this planet, an
individual needed only to live long enough to produce and raise a (few)
healthy offspring.  This doesn't need more than about 20-25 years.  And
the estimated lifespan of humans before the advent of civilization
falls into the 20-30 year range.  There was absolute *no* evolutionary
advantage to living longer than that.  The same can be said for any
species, not just us.  Most species live just long enough to
successfully produce the next generation.  Long life has had no
evolutionary advantage until now, for us.

I want to join the chorus of praise I've been hearing for Jim Halperin's new 
novel "The First Immortal", if it becomes a best seller it could end up 
changing the world as much as "Uncle Tom's Cabin" or "The Origin of Species. 
The great thing is that he describes achieving physical immortality in the 
near future but rebels against the stale convention of crying copious tears
over how dreadful a world without death would be. Halperin will probably take 
some flack from death worshipers for not sprinkling in stuff about Man 
meddling in God's domain and other pious platitudes throughout his book, it 
seems to be the custom when discussing such matters, but Jim is just too 
original for that and he refuses to pander to the superstitions of the masses. 
This is an important book and I highly recommend it.

***  Firm's President Fails To Clarify Key Issues:
By Craig D. Rose 
SAN DIEGO UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER 
January 16, 1998 

Wayne Dunlap of Del Mar wants to talk with you about a great opportunity in 
the soon-to-be-deregulated $20 billion California electricity market.

The Del Mar resident and thousands of others across the state are touting 
Boston-Finney, a company that is aggressively recruiting distributors and 
electricity customers. They promise discounts of 20 percent on electricity bills.

The Harrisburg, Pa., company says it has enlisted 8,000 distributors like Dunlap 
and 30,000 customers in California, who expect to receive electricity from 
Boston-Finney when deregulation begins at the end of March.

There's a problem: Boston-Finney doesn't have the authority to provide 
electricity to anyone in California.

State regulators also are investigating the company's multilevel marketing practices,
which were also questioned by the Public Utilities Commission late last year.

What's more, one of the country's biggest energy providers said a key claim made
 by Boston-Finney's representatives -- that the company can deliver discounts of 
20 percent -- would require selling electricity below cost.

If deregulation of California's electricity market was crafted to cut power costs as 
well as avoid the massive scams of telephone deregulation, it may need some 
tinkering. The hundreds of new companies that have registered to provide electric 
service run the gamut from reputable to questionable, experts said.

Consumer advocates urge ratepayers to exercise caution before switching to 
suppliers, examine terms in writing -- and ask lots of question.

That isn't easy with Boston-Finney.

The company's president declined to provide specifics about key operations in
an interview yesterday. Christopher Mee, president of Boston-Finney, said the
company's rapid growth had caused conflicting and confusing materials to be 
distributed by the company's account executives. He promised all representatives 
would soon be mailed uniform sales materials.

But Mee refused to clarify many issues and declined to answer many questions 
about his company.

Mee was unable, for example, to disclose where Boston-Finney would purchase 
electricity, and he declined to offer a single business reference, despite claims that 
Boston-Finney is aligned with "many of the largest commercial and industrial 
companies in the nation."

Mee said his company has entered into service contracts with the state's major 
utilities. These agreements are essential if Boston-Finney is to assume 
responsibility for providing electricity to those customers. In fact, a spokesman 
for SDG&E emphasized that the local utility will not accept a request to shift a 
customer unless the new provider has a service contract.

But the SDG&E spokesman as well as representatives for the other two major 
California utilities contradicted Mee's claim that Boston-Finney has service 
contracts with their companies. All said Boston-Finney didn't have an agreement 
with them, although dozens of others do. Mee also declined to confirm or deny 
newspaper reports in Pennsylvania indicating that he is 19 years old and has 
limited experience. He refused to discuss any aspect of his educational or 
professional background.

State regulators say many customers are raising questions about aggressive 
marketers.

"We have gotten lots of calls from people who are concerned, so naturally that
 makes us concerned," said Wilson Lewis, supervisor of PUC's enforcement unit, 
which is a law enforcement agency. "We are looking into those allegations."

$295 fee

Some in the county already have seen enough.

One Carlsbad resident said he pulled back from involvement with Boston-Finney, 
soon after writing a $295 check to cover the fee for becoming an account executive.

"From what they presented it sounded good and fine," said Gordon Boslaviski of 
Carlsbad. "They say account executives receive corporate brochures, marketing 
material and letters of agency."

Boslaviski said he got little but offers to buy these materials and nothing he 
considered substantial enough to offer prospective customers.

"I couldn't sell people because I couldn't tell them this is what you're getting," 
said Boslaviski.

Dunlap, on the other hand, accepts the company's explanation that materials had 
to be reprinted because of last-minute changes in its service offerings and 
compensation plans. He says he is buying materials from other account executives 
because that's cheaper than buying them from Boston-Finney itself. He has seen 
one small, glossy brochure from the company.

"The quality of their brochures has little to do with with quality of the company,"
 said Dunlap.  'Not comforting'

Boston-Finney is set to purchase electricity cheaply as part of large national 
buying cooperative, allowing it to sell power cheaply in California and cut monthly
electric bills by 20 percent, said Dunlap. But he confessed ignorance regarding 
details of the co-op and said his inability to get past voice mail and reach a human
 being at Boston-Finney corporate headquarters -- a problem noted by others --
 was "not comforting." 

One of the largest new electric providers in the state said promises of 20 percent 
savings on electricity would be difficult to fulfill.

Stuart Rexrode, director of consumer services of Enron Energy Services, which 
yesterday announced an agreement valued at $280 million over four years to 
provide power to Pacific Telesis, noted that all companies selling electricity in 
California incur much the same overhead costs, which are imposed by the state to 
pay off unprofitable assets of the major utilities. 

Noting that Enron is the largest electricity wholesaler in the country, Rexrode 
added: "So companies that make claims of 20 percent are pricing their product at 
about 10 percent below what their cost structure would be."

One possible explaination is that mice achieve senescence via a different
mechanism.  They would then have no compelling need to use telomerase to
keep differentiated cells on a tight leash; they could have a backup system
or just long enough telomeres to tolerate lots of divisions.

It follows from the fact that in all continuously reproducing species,
evolvable genetic variation in lifespan has been virtually eliminated.
Remember that selection is very powerful.  If living a few more years
adds only a 1 in a 1000 chance of having another child, or successfully
raising one you've already had, selection can readily fix it.  This
is one of the problems with research in evolution - evolution can 
readily fix characteristics we can't even detect with normal scientific
research.

Since humans have recently expanded from an tight genetic bottleneck
and recently had major changes to lifespan, it's possible that evolution
"missed" some things during that bottleneck.  However, even then it's
unlikely to miss much and it's had 5-10,000 generations with a much
larger population to fix its errors.

Glenn said something very interesting in one of those interviews. He was
explaining why he was going up there, and said that they hoped to learn
something about the aging process by sending into space someone who has
already undergone much of the process. He said they might learn how to
switch aging on and off. (I don't use quotes, because I'm not sure those
are his exact words, but they are close.)

Yet another sign that it's becoming acceptable to talk about dramatic life
extension. Last night on ABC's 20/20, there was an excellent 15-20 report
on the Geron advances. The presenters, far from attacking the idea, were
clearly excited, delighted, and favorable. Barbara Walters looked stunned,
and kept saying "amazing" and similar things, while Hugh Downs was looking
forward to living well into a second century in good health.

Some of the scientists quoted were talking about major life extension in
five to ten years. I have major reservations about such an optimistic
scenario (though I badly hope to be shown too pessimistic!). I think it was
either Michael West or Michael Fossel (whose talk on telomerase I heard at
the LA Gerontology Research Group meeting a few months ago) who made this
claim. Has anyone read Fossel's book, and does his justify such an
optimistic timescale?

I recommend going to amazon.com, searching for "The First Immortal" and
reading the early reviews from booksellers. Incredibly positive. It looks
like the book will do very well. Jim Halperin deserves a prize.

Sorry, you're correct. I was very tired when I wrote the above. what I
meant to say was that they still got cancer!! What *is* unexpected, I
think, is that they didn't have a reduced lifespan. That's why I pointed
out that mice may have an alternative means of lengthening their
telomeres.

The inevitable question arises: is this dude a cryonicist himself, and if not, why?

Right on. Now, using this analogy to plan strategy, since lawyers could be
considered to be the nervous cells of the memetic organism, we need to focus our
memetic attacks on lawyers (and, given the already high level of memes that attack
lawyers, they seem to be rather rugged buggers). How about:

1) studies showing the lower life expectancy of lawyers over other similarly
educated professionals.
2) studies of the level of law breaking amongst lawyers
2.5) studies of lower sexual prowess among lawyers....
3) a political action group called: "Hang the Lawyers" that seeks to ban lawyers
from holding political office.

Bloom bases his argument on a revival of `group selection' theory.  This
approach to evolution has been pretty comprehensively demolished.  

On other other hand, if Benfordian memetic `kemes' really are emerging (and
are not merely illusory slices across discurive regimes), it might not be
absurd to suppose that they are reorganising human genetics in a top-down
fashion, or might do so eventually.  You'd need mighty good evidence to
take this out of the realm of racist idiocy and ooger-booger mysticism.

I got the impression from this story that the journalist is confusing the
use of quantum superposition for calculation using insanely large numbers
of simultaneous parallel crunches (on the order of 10^500), and far more
conventional possibilities for storing and manipulating data at the atomic
level.

 I see no sign that these are significant impediments to the usefullness
of GA/GP's. CPU time appears to be the biggest problem. Last I heard, Koza
had a 64 processor system, and was waiting hours if not days for a typical
run to finish.
 And of course, translating abstract problems into fitness functions
is not a trivial programming task.

True, the wrong conspiracy theories can be bad for liberty. That is
why it is important that liberty advocates get off their butts and
show government for the conspiracy of special, predatory interests it is.

Government itself rides on conspiracy theories, ie. the one that
the private sector is rife with predation from which only government
can protect us....however, objectively it is government that always
has been the conspiracy against liberty and justice.   Libertarians,
individualists, and extropians need to counter with the appropriate,
objective conspiracy theories integrated with an advocacy of liberty.

I've just completed reading a book by Charles Sheffield called "Tomorrow and
Tomorrow".(SF)  It was readable.  It was about the future.  The rest of the
future.  All of it.   Until the BIG CRUNCH.  (a closed universe scenario).

What was most interesting about the book in my opinion was the Appendix. <yes
I read the appendices...also the footnotes..and the copyright for that
matter.....you have no IDEA how boring it can be in a truckstop> in which Mr.
Sheffield more or less "summarized" the state of modern scientific opinion and
presented a little historical perspective to support his summary.

In it he mentioned James Hutton's "Theory of the Earth" and uniformitarianism
in geology.  ".......in spite of it's ugly name, is a beautiful and simple
idea........THE PROCESS THAT BUILT THE WORLD IN THE PAST ARE EXACTLY THOSE AT
WORK TODAY...."

Sheffield further says...."The great advantage of ..........theory is that it
removes the need for assumptions"

Sheffield goes on to explain that this (no assumptions....) was  fundamental
in moving away from the creationist view toward the modern view.

My thought is that it hasn't fundamentally changed at all.  What the Relegious
Right call "God"...is now called "the big Bang"... 

By that I mean...the Relegious assume a singular event...never to be
replicated...as does modern cosmology....only the names have been changed to
protect the innocent.

Skipping ahead a bit...Sheffield says...in regard to the Red Shift (the
genesis for the idea of the big bang) ..."the most plausible mechanism, to a
physicist, is the doppler effect'  

Oh?  That implies there are OTHER mechanisms?  I wonder what they are?

All this leads me to wonder if perhaps Eric Lerners "The Big Bang Never
Happened"  might perhaps be given more credibility.  I've read it a couple of
times and it appears to make sense to me.  

No assumptions...what is...IS.   The same mechanisms working today as they did
in the past.  "Universe forever...without end...amen"

One of William Gibson's characters (in _Burning Chrome_) suggested that
visiting extraterrestrials would probably recognize corporations as the
dominant organisms.

Perhaps a taxonomy of superorganisms could be constructed: governments,
corporations, religions, and subcultures remind me of meme-complexes
competing for the belief-space of a single individual.

The individual's memes "live" in the brain; they share neural pathways and
connections.  The specific cell doesn't matter but rather that the
connections exist.  Similarly, governments and other superorganisms don't
need or care about the particular individuals who serve as their "cells";
what matters is that some individual play a particular role.

Governments and religions such as the RC Church and Tibetan Buddhism seem
to be particularly robust superorganisms.  Corporations strike me as more
dependent on the attributes of specific people.  Would a company like
Microsoft exist without Bill Gates?

As an aside, to do these things, which I feel may be necessary, we (>H)

Nanotech, as an example, can't be contained, but good control software

(Sorry for crossposting, but I think this is important).

From: http://techweb.cmp.com/eet/news/98/990news/eda.html

BEVERLY, Mass. -- A radical new approach to system-on-a-chip architecture
and design is under development by Improv Systems, a startup launched here
recently by several EDA veterans. If this company's Programmable System
Architecture (PSA) and Java-based design system take hold, 21st-century
chip design will bear little relationship to any methodology known today.
Improv Systems is headed by several recent employees of Cadence Design's
Alta Group, including Cary Ussery, president and chief executive officer;
Oz Levia, vice president of engineering; and Ray Ryan, director of PSA
hardware. The new company, which has no relationship to Cadence, plans to
make its money by licensing PSA to semiconductor vendors and will offer
its Windows NT-based design system without charge.  Improv Systems is
proposing a new approach that changes the very vocabulary of design. There
is no notion of "hardware" vs.  "software" design; instead, one uses a
Java compiler to map a binary image onto a PSA chip. Synthesis, simulation
and layout as we know them today don't exist, nor does intellectual
property in the form of soft or hard cores.  While it might be tempting to
think of a PSA chip as a kind of glorified SRAM-based field-programmable
gate array, it's actually unlike anything that now exists. Billed as a new
alternative to the von Neumann/Harvard computer architecture, a PSAing
paper-thin computers, tiny digital still cameras and other digital
multimedia systems [...].

'gene{ Of course this approach is not exactly new, and not all that
radical. It still uses static (architecture does not change significantly
during the run), rational (similiar to VHDL silicon compilers) design.

However, for the first time reconfigurable hardware has stepped out of the
ivory tower labs into industry R&D. Via circuitry block paging, the path
to protean-flux architectures is now open, even though this substrate is
definitely not suitable for low-level Darwin in machina. This must be a
fine-grained architecture, potentially capable of bad-block remapping at
production and operation stage -- hence a deep-submicron
wafer-scale-integration-enabling key technology. (We have been waiting for
WSI far too long, methinks). 

Even more important is the imminent paradigm change in the heads of system
designers -- more radical approaches as evolvable hardware and CAMs
suddenly stop sounding like unintelligible noise. 

The Wintel technology road block may suddenly give, granting us a few
frantic years of progress before saturation sets in again.

Even though limited to 2d architectures, and being still quite grainy, the
new architecture boosts _nondedicated_ performance by orders of magnitude,
augmented by the boons WSI will be granting us.

The arbitrary boundary between hardware and software will go away, opening
large-scale free projects even wider vistas. The primate of design may
emerge, the first harbinger of the revolution molecular manufacturing is
promising us. 

Somewhat more unfortunate will be the growing impact of outfit size (Intel
would be a nice example for a semimonopoly), as future market success will
depend on investments in inherently costly R&D, as new processes and wafer
fabs. 

On a more lunatic note, a malignant, Blightlike Singularity (artefacts
awakening as a global whole) appears to become a bit more possible. }

Alas, many systems are intrinsically brittle in regards to mutations (no
neutral mutations, most mutations catastrophic -- the system randomwalks
in a chaotic fitness landscape). E.g. mutating processor instructions is
worse than mutating a subset of the same instructions, which is worse than
mutating a subset of SEXPR's. Which is worse than.. say mutating
connectivity in automaton networks with a certain Hamiltonian. The chance
of an ad-hoc system being near-optimal in regards to GA-optimization is
nil. If you allow the mutation function to mutate (quis custodiet...), it
will just gloss over the ugly edges with time. However, simply (well, it
is maybe not sooo simple) searching for the optimal system's parameters,
subsequently implementing them in dedicated hardware appears easier. As an
aesthete, I just don't believe in long-term usefulness of systems with
hidden holes.

Speed is another _major_ bottleneck. However, speed without proper
mutation fitness landscape brings nothing.

Of course. While coding a robot arm GA-learn the inverse kinematics
appears easy, higher problem-solving skills are not.

Hi,

For those interested, Albert's reaction to winning the Loebner Contest
is online (and unedited) at

	http://www.fringeware.com/~robitron/ALTALK.TXT

Several people have asked if Albert is named after Einstein, to which
the answer is no. Albert is named after a child I met while we were
both doing time at the scotish rite children's hospital around '74-75.
The real Albert had a rare form of arthritis that made it impossible
for him to get out of bed. I watched them take him screaming to PT
twice a day for 3 weeks. I realized then that there is more to life
than just being here.

That's all I'll have to say about Loebner's show unless they fail to
send me my prize, in which case I hope to enlist the aid of
SpaceHitler to help me fry their fucking brains!

This seems to be because of the shape of the subjective utility
function and the way people deal with risks; we seem to regard threats
as more dangerous than equivalent rewards, and evaluate more dramatic
disasters as more likely than they really are. So the subjective
effect of listing a long list of benefits of something and adding one,
very unlikely but spectacular risk is to make people concentrate on
the risk, and after a while they will remember mainly the risk. Silly?
Yes - but that is human cognitive psychology for you.

What to do about it (beside rewiring our cognitive structure at the
earliest opportunity)? One possibility is to create counter-images for
the disaster scenarios, just as vivid and showing clearly why they are
not valid. For example, the image of a dictator cloning an army can be
counter-imaged by pointing out that the dictator will have to wait
around 18 years for the babies to grow up - and few dictators want to
have an army in two decades, when they usually need it today. In
short, we should work to defuse the irrational disaster scenarios by
showing how they can be avoided or why they are so silly. Of course we
need good arguments for our positions too, but when it comes to
dealing with downright propaganda techniques like this are handy.

Seems true. Here in Sweden we do not vote for people, we vote for
parties which themselves select what cells (i.e politicians) to put in
the Parliament (OK, there are theoretical ways around this, but they
are irrelevant in practice), and it is clear that organizations have
more rights than people in some respects.

Of course, metaorganisms are not bad per se. It is just that we as
single cells cry "what's in it for me?". They do not need to have our
best interests at heart in order to prosper, they just have to
propagate their structure.

As transhumans we are interested in developing our own potential, not
necessarily the potential of the metaorganisms (although a case could
be made for the rights of intelligent metaorganisms). So we better
find a way around the metaorganisms (very hard) or come up with
metaorganism structures which benefit us (and themselves) directly,
thus giving us a fitness boost. Something like a colonial
metaorganism, rather than the unitary metaorganism model?

Both are hard. You have more time to plan for the flat energy
gradient, and can deal with physics at the same general low-energy
scale all the time, in an open universe. A Big Crunch is more
exciting, would occur sooner and has a certain apocalyptic flavor, but
it requires us to adapt to higher energy regimes all the time which
may all be different; if there is a finite chance for one of these
energy regimes to be untenable for complex systems, then we are
(literally) fried. 

The universe of course doesn't care the least what scenarios we like.

The problem I see with this notion of metaorganism and their rights
is that it winds up being in practice, the "right" of the leaders of
existing institutions to impose their will on other people.  Thus, I
think the case for metaorganisms has not been truly made.  It is an
analogy which is easily abused, and the abuse of it plays into the
hands of existing and would be elites.

BTW, the idea is not all that new.  The organic view of society goes
back at least to Plato.  (Just wanted to bring up this point because it
appears a lot of Extropians/transhumanists tend to think ideas like
this are relatively new and cutting edge.  In terms of memes, there
may be a suseptibility among our kind to anything which can be
packaged as "innovative", "radical", "cutting edge", etc.)

It seems this explanation fits the facts, though I wonder if any other

Though this seems possible, I think a lot of the tools are
already at hand.  Most people are smart enought to get
past the prejudices.  It's just a matter of getting through
to them.  Thus, we don't need radical surgery, uploading,
genetic engineering, etc. to overcome this.  Recall, last
century many people where against anesthesia. It didn't
take much more than a little convincing to change their
minds.

You might claim this was because the pro-anesthesia
camp could tap into the anti-suffering attitude prevalent
in many cultures.  If this is so, it can be argued that their
is a pro-technology attitude, despite the neoLuddite and
technophobic propoganda, in our cultures.  We can tap
into that in the same way.

I have advocated in earlier posts and tried to create such
counter-images, but in a lot of cases, I've tried to get people
to drop the whole horror story mindset.  This seems to work
amongst the more intellectual, who just as often have the
same prejudices as the nonintellectuals.  It's just that they
also can be helped to question them.

But this is not to say counter-images are useless.  I tend to
agree with Rand about art being a powerful tool.  Those
among us who are writers or film makers can use this to
project the moral and social problems of cloning in a more
rational light.

I think we should just keep a) expanding the movement (get more
people onboard the transhuman express:) and b) doing the hard
work of advancing the ideas -- in terms of planning or developing
them.  For the latter, one thing we can do which is low cost and
not as hard to do, is try to find porfitable uses for any new
technology that arises.

Thus, when arguing for cloning, we should not confine ourselves
to saying there's nothing morally repugnant with it or pointing to
flaws in the logic of the horror stories, but also point out the
benefits and opportunities.

To digress, an interesting recent argument against cloning I ran
into was that clones would be treated differently.  Perhaps they
will, but my counter was that so are lots of different kinds of
people.  Pick a minority in a given area, such as, in most of
America, Blacks, short people, gays, and atheists.  Surely,
these people are treated differently and often for the wrong
reasons, BUT would one argue that they should be carted
off and not allowed to mix because of this?  At the same time,
the solution to such prejudice might be just to make more
clones.  The mainstream will then come to see it as different
but tolerable.

>Good to have a distribution network already in place, no?

I agree, though we should evaluate the efficiency of various
networks -- real or imagined.  We already have the internet,
and it seems to be good at allowing us to chat, find information
and spread the latest news.

And some of the hacker community is no doubt in our ranks
already.:)

The assumption running through these posts is that an open universe
would tend toward a flat energy gradient -- that "heat death" would be
the outcome.  I question this assumption.  Again, I offer the work of
David Layzer as a possibility.  His model of an open hyperbolic
universe does not allow for heat death.

Anyway, as Anders mentioned, we've a long time, if the universe is
open, to think about it.:)

A leader-centered metaorganism is in some sense a huge exoself that
extends the leader and could be considered a transhuman technology if
it didn't involve the use of less-than-free humans as
components. Imagine having something equivalent to a major corporation
as an integral part of yourself, implementing your will and augmenting
your capabilities!

However, many organisations are not strongly under control of their
human leaders, but are more of a collective system. Usually they do
not become collective systems independent of leaders immediately, but
slowly grow in this direction as they age. I would say "true"
metaorganisms that have their own behavior independent of humans today
tend to be very old and large, and it might be that they have not yet
fully emerged.

Er, isn't this a bit of an over-simplification? I am not an astrophysicist,
however I vaguely recall reading a fair bit lately about head-scratching
over the initial era of expansion, and some suggestions (does the name
Linde mean anything?) that it was driven by a one-off particle which
subsequently disappeared behind an event horizon, creating yet another
universe, to repeat the process all over again ad infinitum -- indeed,
that our universe is just one of an infinite fractal foam of universes,
all budding off one another whenever and wherever a singularity is
formed. There's also been some muttering along the lines that this
implies that universes that spawn lots of black holes are evolutionarily
fit and will give rise to lots of children, and that our particular
set-up (which permits massive stars, atomic nucleosynthesis, and 
supernovae) is particularly well-tuned for this.

Or have I grasped the wrong end of the stick ...?

When anyone uses the term "people," they're obviously not including

Coming back to reality, I've made several suggestions along these
lines before.  ExI (or perhaps a spin-off) should dedicate themselves
to making sure the necessary research gets done, no matter what.  I'm
100% sure that there are many extremely rich people out there who
would put vast amounts of money into life-extension and genetic
enhancement research.  All we have to do is forgo any moral or ethical
imperative and take the money.

I'm currently working on a very large futurist website that will
contain information on the technology, social and political changes we
can expect in the future (and don't worry, it's not all my own
opinions.)  Although it will have a very transhumanist/extropian feel,
I'm trying to make it as open to 'the man on the street' as possible,
so the whole things one huge multimedia extravaganza (if your browser
supports it, if not you get a slightly smaller multimedia
extravaganza.)  I've also been trying to think of novel ways of
organise the content.  The standard category/subcategory structure
doesn't encourage enough exploration by people who are merely browsing
(of course, it's great if you know what you're looking for so it will
be an available.)  I've experimented with random content menus, but
they become confusing when the user is looking for something they've
just seen, but can't easily find it.  One idea I had was to organise
everything over a future timeline, but giving dates for predictions
isn't my favourite pastime.  One thing that did interest me was the
recent discussion on organising predictions according to probability,
but I've yet to think of an easy way to implement it on the web.  The
basic premise of what I'm trying to do is make it a 'walk through the
future' whatever that means.

So if you have any ideas or suggestions, I'd love to hear them.

Just to give you an idea of what it's like - the title to the cryonics
page reads, "This is where you go when you die."  I'm hoping to put it
on-line is a reduced format soon (i.e. a page saying "under
construction" and a picture of a workman :) so I'll post the address
when I do.

I know there is a new transhuman digest tech list but is there also an
extropy one?  Maybe I got the two transposed i.e. confused.  Please
inform me.  Thanks.  :-)  .

Many people think of Microsoft as a "huge exoself" of Bill Gates...
If so, is the guy (by fuzzy definition) already a transhuman, while
we are still merely transhumanists? I do not have any special
feelings for Microsoft (or Bill) one way or the other, but this thought
flew to mind after reading about ten "Microsoft is the Borg" articles
followed by this message. Hmm...

I had a similar thought the other day.

I started out with the following idea. Suppose we construct probes 
that fly out in all directions, and when they reach a lump of matter, 
they use some of the energy it contains to shoot fragments back to 
origo (Earth). Some fragments have to fly in the opposite direction 
to conserve total  momentum, but there should be a constant fraction 
of the energy in a lump of matter that we can send back to origo at a 
certain speed.

As the colonization wave spreads, the frontier surface that they 
harvest matter from increases as the square of the radius of the 
colonization bubble. My idea was that even if the average density of 
the universe decreases over time as a result of expansion, this 
decrease might slow enough so that amount of matter that 
could be sent back to origo at any moment would diverge as t goes to 
infinity. This could allow an infinity of computations at origo.

I did some back of the envelope calculations. I think the expansion 
rate of the universe (if it is open) will asymptotically approach a 
constant (could anybody confirm this?). So the density of the 
universe would decrease as t^3, for large values of t, and the volume 
from of the space where we can have harvested a constant fraction of 
its matter content grows as t^3 (if the probes have constant speed 
ans since the volume of a sphere is proportional to R^3). So far, 
things look bright.

But then I thought of this problem. Suppose the probes travel with 
the speed v. Then there must be some distance d such that if the 
probes start at that distance, they will never return to origo. For 
if d is big enough, then by the time the probes have traveled 10% of 
the way, the remaining 90% will have grown larger than the original 
100%, due to the expansion of space inbetween. So if that expansion 
rate settles down to a constant, then there must be a sphere centered 
around Earth such that nothing that is outside of that sphere can 
*ever* affect Earth, even if it travels with the speed of light. 
Hence the above proposal fails, unless somebody can point to some 
mistake in this reasoning.

Something (I think) you recently said inspired me to start scribbling
down ideas for a potential screenplay/novel, it was something along
the lines of you not caring if god does exist because he'd still be a
manipulative authority that you have no respect for.  This gave me an
idea - what if all these bible prophecies were true and our creator is
going to come down in the next millennium and wreak havoc on anyone
who hasn't lived their lives according to his word.  We'd have a fight
on our hands, and a big sci-fi summer-release movie style fight at
that.  So hands up anyone who wants to try and sell a movie about
humanities war against God!  Not likely, might stand a chance as a
novel though.

I love being controversial.

Well, if this approach fascinates you (it repels me) you'll probably enjoy
Greg Bear's new novel Slant. He even cites Extropians by name as respected
in one respect by the group in the book that thinks along the lines you're
suggesting. (I know you're not necessarily advocating these means.) There
will be a review of Slant in Extropy Online very soon.

And if too many make the boat it's going to be crowded. If

I'm not saying I believe this, I don't believe anything, so I'm

Natasha, can you post the name of the program?  With the time 
difference on the East Coast, I can't tell which program you are 
referring to, because we don't have anything that starts on the half 
hour.

Personally, I think Gloria Steinem needs to chill out.  The mix of 
androgens/estrogen definitely affects personalities, and I'm ready to 
propose it as a manner of identifying gender as opposed to body 
parts.

The biggest problem with conspiracy theories IMHO is that we all seem to be
to disorganized and other-directed to focus on putting a effective
conspiracy together!!!

      "Why Government?" -- a perennial question...

      Peter Marshall's fine book "Demanding the Impossible" on all the 
various kinds of Anarchism, and Movement histories, is a fine 
starting-point. And -- yes! -- there's a chapter on anarcho-capitalism too 
(which Noam Chomsky -- also an anarchist -- characterises as 'liable to 
lead to the most hideous tyranny the world has ever seen').

      Then ask a crucial question: "Do we ever get out of anarchy?"  Just 
because some people characterize themselves as 'State Officials' doesn't 
mean we have to recognize them as fundamentally different types of beings.
The social universe in a world of individual actors acting in different 
ways at different times.  What matters is the character of acts.

      If we characterize 'Government' as the unilateral exercise of 
coercion, we get a clearer picture of what it is about it that we really 
dislike: and the question is subtly altered into "How do we minimize the 
unilateral exercise of coercion?"

      Landlords charge rent: States charge taxes.  Most states let you 
leave, most of the time.  Most landlords ditto.  I had the following 
argument with David Ramsay Steele, an anarcho-capitalist theoretician.  
Agorism and anarcho-capitalism are fundamentally different ideas, so we 
argued a lot...  He attacked me and threatened to kill me once or twice.

      It seems to me, I said playfully, that any crafty group of 
capitalist could replicate the evils of government in a pre-existing 
anarcho-capitalist society by focusing their resources on buying a key 
resource, then imposing conditions of use on it:  i.e. fervent Islamic 
capitalists could buy the roads, then make adherence to Islam a condition 
of use for all the customers. They aren't interested in selling the roads 
again, remember, nor do they care about maximizing their _financial_ 
return on capital.

      So how would we address this problem?

      David Ramsay Steele just shrugged this off by saying "We would have 
a revolution, and reassign the property rights."   Oh, right...


  So it seemed a better bet to me, to focus on answering these questions:
       
 [A] How do we maximize negative liberties for all?  Freedom from restraint.

 [B] How to we maximize positive liberties for all?  Freedom-to-do. Means.

 [C] How do we minimize the incidence of coercion in society?
       

     This is Karl Popper's programme too.
     
     "Another, more familiar paradox, first implicitly frmulated by Plato, 
     is the paradox of freedom.  Unqualified freedom, like unqualified 
     tolerance, is not only self-destructive, but bound to produce its 
     opposite - for if all restraints were removed there would be nothing 
     to stop the strong enslaving the weak (or meek).  So complete freedom 
     would bring about the end of freedom, and therefore proponents of 
     complete freedom are in actuality, whatever their intentions, enemies 
     of freedom.  Popper points particularly to the paradox of economic 
     freedom, which makes possible the unrestrained exploitation of the 
     poor by the rich, and results in the almost complete loss of economic 
     freedom by the poor.  Here again, there 'must be a _political_ remedy 
     -- a remedy similar to the one we use against physical violence.  We 
     must construct social institutions, enforced by the power of the 
     state, for the protection of the economically weak from the 
     economically strong....  This means that the idea of 
     non-intervention, of an unrestrained economic system, has to be given 
     up; if we wish freedom to be safeguarded, then we must demand that 
     the policy of unlimited economic freedom must be replaced...'     
      
     In all these cases, the maximum possible tolerance or freedom is an 
     optimum, not an absolute, for it has to be restricted if it is to 
     exist at all.  The government intervention which alone can guarantee 
     it is a dangerous weapon: without it, or wit too little, freedom 
     dies; but with too much of it, freedom dies also.  We are brought 
     back by the inescapability of control -- which must mean, if it is to 
     be effective, removeability -- of government by the governed as the 
     _sine qua non_ of democracy.  This however, though necessary, is not 
     sufficient.  It does not guarantee the preservation of freedom, for 
     nothing can:  the price of freedom is eternal vigilance.  As Popper 
     has remarked, institutions are like fortresses in that althogh to be 
     effective, they have to be properly constructed this alone will not 
     make them work:  they have also to be properly manned....'
     
     The vital question is not 'Who should rule?' but 'How can we minimize 
     misrule -- both the likelihood of its occurring and, when it does 
     occur, its consequences?'" -- Bryan Magee, 'Popper' [1982].

        I assume that the transhuman tech list you are talking about is the
one that is run by Homo Excelsior; the main purpose of the list is to
discuss the technical aspect of transhumanism.  Check out Excelsior's site

Here's a simple solution:
An entity claiming to be God announces that it is here to take over the
Earth.  It gives "omnipotent" information that convinces the Churches of
all religions that it really is God.  (Probably secret information hidden
by the elite rulers of each religion.)  The religious believe and accept
"God".  Atheists and scientists disbelieve "God", and think he's an alien,
future entity, or something from another dimension.  They wage war with
"God", and must function underground because most of the Earth believes in
"God".  God fights with almost omnipotent power and/or future nanotech.
After a greatly entertaining story, the humans win.

Conclusion:  The religious decide that it could not have been God, because
we won.  It must have been the false-God as prophesied for the end times.
They announce that since the false-God prophesy was real, that this really
proves that there is a God!  They also announce that  according to the
now-proven prophesies, the real God is coming real-soon now.  (Hook for the
blockbuster sequel!)

Please make out my portion of the royalties in U.S. funds to Harvey
Newstrom.  Thanks.

The www.abc.com's tv scheduling doesn't list yesterday's programming.  It

I don't always agree with her position on these issues.  I have disparate
thoughts about her undercover work and Playboy Bunny years.
Journalistically, I think she did a fine job especially in light of how
women presented themselves to the world as tits and ass serving men.  On the

Hormones as part of chromosomes  XX, XY, XYY?

The host's (I suppose he was the journalist) commentary at the end of the
program included a statement to the effect that "our" individuality is more
diverse than our sexuality.  This certainly puts the assumed "group"
mentality at bay.

Yes. Set up in the home page a list of "tour" buttons, which tie to sets
of conditional links, ie, links which only appear for a given "tour". I
have never seen this, and don't know enough about HTML to suggest how it
may be done; perhaps some of the webmasters on this list might know
how...

"The First Immortal
by James L. Halperin
1 Ed
Hardcover, 352 pages
Published by Del Rey
Publication date: January 1, 1998


Reviews and Commentary for The First Immortal

Synopsis:
In his astonishing first novel, "The Truth Machine", James Halperin
envisioned a future world radically changed by the invention of a totally
foolproof lie detector. Now he once again examines the extraordinary
benefits--and moral implications--of future scientific breakthroughs with
the story of a man, cryonically frozen after his death, who is restore to
life 83 years later in the world of wonders that is the year 2071. 

The publisher, Ballantine , 01/08/98:
First Look bookseller comments (they're still coming in) 
Dianne Schulte Concord NC Manager -- Having greatly enjoyed Halperin's
vision in The Truth Machine, I wasted no time to settle down with his newest
work of art. Shivers go up my spine when I think of the scientific
breakthroughs glimpsed in The First Immortal. I AM AMAZED. "

Reminds me of a short SF story in which there is a board meeting. Seems
that a mean, nasty and successful tycoon (in Seattle?) had an incurable
disease, got frozen, instructed the board to revive him when a cure was
found. The board, now that a cure is found, decides NOT to revive the
tycoon, every year.

Ironically, doppler shift is probably *not* the best way of thinking
of the cosmological redshifts.  Rather, what happens is that photons
are emitted by the galaxies, then as they travel, spacetime expands
and the photons get "stretched".  Their wavelength lengthens, which
is a redshift.  Doppler shift is quite misleading when dealing with
cosmological distances.

I believe you have just reinvented the canonical explanation for Olbers'

What is the definition of "optimal" and who/what produced this 
definition?  Is this definition still acceptable?

Now I understand why a snowball (the American version of this

Judaeo-Christo-Islamic negative afterlife...

But why do the British (or at least this particular one) nominate a 
whelk for the same role?  Surely not because the heat would dry it 
out to death... things in that location are, by definition, already 
dead.

I suspect Kathryn's proposal makes more deep sense than any other,
including chromosome complement.  Sporting authorities are going to have to
come to terms, if they haven't already, with the fact that some XY people
are female because they lack the enzyme that enables testosterone or one of
its precursors to set off the usual XY masculinizing cascade (IIRC).

And speaking of Greg Bear's SLANT, as Max did a moment ago:

=====================

`[Torino] thinks there's a world-spanning bacterial mind,' Nathan says
lightly.

`A *mind*, in germs?'...

`Not like a human mind, or even like Jill [an AI thinker], not socially
self-aware.  He thinks every bacterium is a node in a loosely connected
network.  That would make them parts of the largest distributed network
anywhere - on Earth, at least.'

=====================

An intelligence you can't debug!

I wonder from time to time whether memetic meta-organisms might not be
running an entire slow, massively distributed and time-sharing kind of
ecology inside human brains/minds, so that each brain's modular structure
is itself MIP-snatched by fleeting computations *from different
interpenetrating critters* that operate, fairly fuzzily and with a lot of
noise-repair required, via *patterns* of speech and other semiotic
behaviour.  In a sense we'd be infested not just by collective moods and
fashions but by large-scale mind-animals that cross and merge and sometimes
contest within each single head.  

Perhaps this is just a restatement of the basic meme postulate, but I have
a hunch that it might be more than that.  But then I can only suspect this
while I'm being run by a mind-parasite that wants me to think so...

We can also use this to set bounds on the expansion rate.  The 
diameter of the sphere is set by the expansion rate, and we can (by 
definition) observe the edges of the observable universe, but nothing 
beyond those edges.

What's the current estimate of the diameter of the observable 
universe?

Seen "Stargate"?  Replace Christian God with Egyptian God, and you've got
a movie fairly similar to your idea.  Seems to me the idea has movie
possibilities... throw some angels in a highly armed spaceship, pepper
with flashy space battle scenes, garnish with cherub foot soldiers
marauding small towns, and you've got yourself a blockbuster!

Yes, remember in one of W. Gibson's books (Count Zero)
where there was the really rich guy (Virek?) living in the vat
who had a whole corporation doing his bidding in the real world.

The definition of "optimal" would be: that level of telomerase 
which produces longest expected lifespan in a natural (presumably 
hunter-gatherer here) environment.

>and who/what produced this definition?  

Defining it as "optimal" is me.  The idea that, with a few 
specified exceptions, any particular gene in a continuously 
reproducing species will have evolved to be close
to maximizing expected lifespan is a fairly well-established
tenet of the evolutionary biology of life histories.

>Is this definition still acceptable?

Me again...

I find this very interesting...but puzzeling...

For one thing...there's a "constant" problem that's (vaugely) bothering
me.....

If EVERYTHING is expanding...(The girl, the gold watch...and
everything)...then why should a red shift be noticeable?  Is this Eienstein's
non-intuitive relativity theory again...?  To me it would appear that for a
red shift to be noticable there would have to be SOME type of constant...by
which velocity, expansion...or whatever is measured against...if  "Space-Time"
is expanding...(which includes light)...then how would we know?  And what
difference would it make?

Another thing Charles Sheffeild said which also bothers me....

"We can go further, at least in theory, to the time, 10-35 sec After Creation,
when the universe went through a superrapid "inflationary " phase, growing
from the size of a proton to the size of a basket ball in about 5 x 10-32
seconds....

to which he foot notes

""SuperRapid" is an appropriate description.  Druing the inflation period the
universe was expanding in size MILLIONS OF TIMES FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF
LIGHT .  This does not violate the theory of relativity, since no signal is
being propagated..."

Curiosior and curiousior......

Also  he said..

"The universe may have been created out of nothing, by a zero energy
fluctuation.  And one day it may simply disappear, when the vacuum flutuation
that created it pops out of existence."

Now....if I understand correctly....Lerner  (The Big Bang Never Happened)...is
proposing something similar...but on a proton by proton basis...that is a
vacuum fluctuation "creates" a proton...(uncounted zillions of
them...constantly)...they coalesce to form hyrdogen...galaxies and whatever
(the carbon cycle)...and eventually go "poof" decay...on an individual
basis...

Current cosmological theory holds that the entire universe is the result of a
vacuum flux?....which is expanding ....and will eventually "pop"...like a soap
bubble?

Now what was Ander's saying about angles dancing on the head of a pin?

I think they're afraid of the slippery slope of identifying the sex/
gender of intersexuals.  Women of the type you describe certainly
are far closer to "normal" women than men; but there are lots of 
intersexuals who fall all over the map.  Many people in
this world who were born with essentially male biology but the parts
didn't come out right.  Conventional therapy for these kinds of 
intersexual is, to put it very crudely, lop off any genitalia that
sticks out and give them estrogens, starting as soon as possible
after birth.  I am *not* making this up.  Plus there are even more
people in all the states between "basically male" and "basically female".

The sporting authorities have a clear rule now and it would take a lot
to make them change.  In addition, intersexuality is a very touchy 
topic and I think few want to get into it.

We talk about governmental theory and revolution, but put our hopes in
some rich people saving us all by funding technology that would be good
for us and then making it widely available to everyone. 

If the research is to happen according to the ideas stated in this
list, then the people who believe in that research will need to pool
their resources and invest in it themselves (with enough people, of
course, the individual commitment need not be large). Otherwise, the other
large investors will, as usual, redirect the research towards other ends. 

As a more conventional approach, we should be able to find biotech startup
companies to invest in now. Several have made the news over the past year. 
Some should be acceptable to list members. Nothing stops us from
identifying and supporting them now.

The current "standard" expansion theory holds that the universe expands,
but
that local effects (mostly gravity) keep certain small bodies (up to
about the
size of galactic clusters) together. Galaxies therefore don't expand,
and
neither do gold watches. because the expansion isn't strong enough
to overcome chemical bonds, or even gravity when matter is dense enough.

In fact, the "open or closed?" question is actually a question of
whether
the universe's average density is great enough to eventually
gravitationally
overcome the expansion.

There really should be some kind of Extropian investor mailing
list. I know that a lot of us are working on generating capital,
and there likely could be a lot of discussion as to how to
use it once we acquire it.

Not everything is expanding.  Atoms are not expanding.  Their size is
determined by the strength of the electromagnetic force and the laws of
quantum mechanics, which are not changed by the expansion of space.

There is one key difference between creating the whole universe out
of a zero energy fluctuation and creating a single proton that way.
Making just the photon violates the conservation of mass-energy.  But when
you create the universe, the positive energy of all the mass is balanced
by the negative energy of the gravitational field (or so I've heard).
There is zero net energy, so it is no violation to create it.

One flaw with this plan, which is actually mentioned by Tipler, is that
there will be an infinite number of civilizations in the universe, each
with only a finite volume of space they can use.  Now, maybe you could
assume that when different civilizations meet, they will combine their
resources and collect them together at one point.  However, this would
have to go on an infinite number of times.  Maybe this is not really any
worse though than Tipler's assumption that life throughout the universe
will cooperate an infinite number of times to keep the universe collapsing
the right way.

Parenthetically, it grows faster than t^3 because of the hyperbolic

I think this is right for normal velocities, but I'm not sure it
generalizes to the speed of light.  I find a lot of references to
the behavior of light in a collapsing universe, how many times it can
circumnavigate during the collapse, but I will have to do more study to
figure out what happens in an expanding universe.  My intuition though
is that the region of space which can affect the earth will grow without
bounds, and that there is no limit to how far a photon can travel in an
infinite universe.

But it needs a double S for clarity: dysspiracies.  So it relates to

That's true, but it causes another paradox. If we look at a galaxy 15 billion 
light years away and then look at another galaxy in the opposite direction 
that is also 15 billion years away, and if the universe is only 15 billion  
years old and has always expanded at the present rate, then the two galaxies 
could NEVER have had anything to due with each other. The trouble is that we 
can see that the two look very similar to each other, and the laws of physics 
seem the same in both places, that is, electrons produce photons in exactly 
the same way. How do electrons in such distant places know to act identically 
if they never ever had any causal relationship with each other?
               
The inflationary model of the Big Bang was invented to explain this paradox, 
it postulated that for a extremely short time in the very early universe the 
expansion was accelerating at an exponential rate, enormously faster than 
light. If this is true then the matter in our two galaxies was once close 
enough for light to travel between them, and that explains why the galaxies
are so similar even today. 
               
Inflation also predicts that the universe should be right on the knife edge 
between eternal expansion and collapse. According to inflation the universe 
will not collapse, it will slow down but never completely stop expanding, 
it will not grow arbitrarily large. The very recent experimental evidence 
that the expansion is unbounded is NOT consistent with inflation theory.
If the evidence holds up the theory is in deep trouble and it's back to the 
drawing board.

I think this show was in part about coming to terms with this.  The androgen

Aw, come on. No community of this size can finance any R&D effort, however
pathetic. Have a look at the cryonics crowd.

time, even most misguided plans will ripen. But this does not mean to

I believe that due to time being  relative the effect of the space 
expanding infront of the light beam is cancled out but the relative 
change in time dialation.

E.G. The object sending out the light wave can not be traleving away 
from us at a speed higher than the speed of light no matter of how 
far away it is!  Therefor the light will allways reach us.

I just posted to the transhuman tech list about the discovery of a
human chimera: it had both male and female cells (it seems that the
embryos fused after IVF) and was a slight bit intersexual (one testis
developed into an ovary). It seems that there are natural human
chimeras around too, but in most cases they are never discovered (The
chimeras are amongst us! And the clones are everywhere!). Maybe it is
time to show people that it is normal with nonstandard reproduction
and genetics.

It is a strange effect, similar to the fact that everybody apparently
knows everything there is to know about the "soft sciences" and
economics, while being very humble about their scientific
knowledge. Must be some kind of subliminal information transmission
:-)

More seriously, in some sense the news are an approximative fitness
function synopsis.

There will be, and it would probably be up and running today except that
we're now discussing whether to revise the rules for access. Give us a week

It has great relevance. The postbiological era is a little ways off yet.
Before that is the era of biological transformations, a most extropian
thing. Choosing gender, altering sexuality, creating new variations seems
to be a completely appropriate topic of discussion, certainly as least as
much as talking about today's computer operating systems.

Sent by: Matt Fraser <mattf+@pitt.edu>



In a private message, I had asked Sherman Wilcox about possible sex
differences, as are found following unilateral brain trauma with
spoken language, in signed language.  He replied:

I still think that it might be interesting to know if, whether or not
sign was the primary language, there are differences in
lateralization of function in male and female signers, and whether
males suffer more from left hemispere trauma than females, along with
the associated sex difference in recovery of function.  Anyone?

Cheers,

Keep in mind that "your" property is only yours because the thousands or
millions of people around you haven't taken it from you.  There is
nothing in physical law that prevents them from doing so.  It is a
semi-mutual agreement among those millions of people which discourages
them from doing so.  Part of that agreement is that you must contribute a
certain amount of money every so often or they *will* take "your"
property from you.  You may not like the "State", but remember that it is
the same "State" which keeps all your neighbors from taking "your"
property.  Property "rights" are not inherent in an individual; we grant
each other the courtesy of possessing property.  Nothing in physical law
restrains us so; humans have just come to learn that it works out better
for everyone (generally) if we pretend that people "own" things and
respect that "ownership".  This semi-mutual agreement is part of the
"State".  Other, similar agreements form the rest of the "State".  You
may not like certain features of the "State", such as taxes and certain
restrictive laws, and that makes it extremely easy to forget all the
other aspects of human interaction, which are termed, "State", that
benefit you greatly, such as the respect that others show for "your"
property.  The "State" is not just the beuracracy; it is also our day to
day conformity to laws and other expected behaviors.  

The hope of Extropians is to make our semi-mutual agreements more
beneficial to all involved.

Now they are trying to clone by taking adult cells from various
mammals and placing them in cow egg cells. Apparently no successful births yet,
but the cells are "working".

This story was in the local paper today, so I don't know any
web references yet.

Assuming they get this to work- would it be possible to grow
cloned humans in cows?

Tipler's ideas (in _The Physics of Immortality_) depended on the universe
being closed, so that it would re-collapse upon itself, with ubiquitous
life modifying the way it collapsed so that an essentially infinite
amount of energy could be harnessed by life.  Now, with the news that the
universe is open and will expand forever (with 95% certainty), it seems
there is no hope for Tipler's ideas to come to pass.

But did his ideas really require that the *entire* universe collapse into
a singularity?  Or would it work if only a sufficiently large,
life-filled part of it collapsed into a singularity?  What if life does,
as Nick Bostrom suggested, send devices out into the universe which send
matter back to some area.  If enough is sent back, the mass will collapse
into a black hole.  If life organizes this right, will it be able to
accomplish Tipler's ideas?  Is there enough energy in the creation of
this singularity to simulate a universe of infinite (subjective) length,
as Tipler proposes there would be if the entire universe collapsed?

Why would I want to do that? Social darwinism is an old fashioned and foolish

not been invented in his lifetime but Darwin was certainly not a believer in  
social darwinism and would have been appalled to have his name associated

The same argument could be made of cancer. If something is evil then I'd 
rather it not be functional, rugged and competitive. Actually, government is  
beneficial, not at the level of the individual but at a higher level of 
organization. Government is good for government, that's why it loves itself  
and wants to grow.

Good generalizations are the key to science. A good generalization, as good

free market GOOD".

How could it be otherwise? Government claims power that individuals and  
corporations do not have, no organization is in the habit of voluntarily  
giving up power, rather they use any advantage they have to try to get even  
more power.

I think the purported puzzel (this is the so-called horizon problem) 
is not so much that the laws of physics are the same in causally 
unconnected parts of the universe, but rather that these different 
parts are in thermal equilibrium -- that the matter configuration and 
the cosmic background radiation look roughly the same in all 
directions.

According to it, they are just taking the cow eggs out and
using them in the lab to grow the clones, and then put the
clone into a surrogate of its same species. So I guess growing
humans in cows is out :-)

I'm not sure who wrote the above comment. And, perhaps this, in the long
run, is beside the point.  This issue is sex differences is of relevance to
the postbiological era, as well as the transhuman era that we presently
reside in.  This topic and related topics of engineering our bodies and our
minds are *paramount* to our continued evolution.  I have tried to
understand what significance negating this topic will bring to further our
understanding and designing of our present and future bodies and our
psychology, but I have not reached a positive result.

I disagree.  I quote David Friedman's definition of government from his
_The Machinery of Freedom_:

"A government is an agency of legitimized coercion.  I define 'coercion',
for the purposes of this definition, as the violation of what people in a
particular society believe to be the rights of individuals with respect to
other individuals.

"For instance, people in this society believe that an individual has the
right to turn down a job offer; the denial of that right is a form of
coercion called enslavement.  They believe that an individual has the right
to turn down a request for money or an offered trade.  The denial of that
right is called robbery or extortion.

"Government is an agency of legitimized coercion.  The special
characteristic that distinguishes governments from other agencies of
coercion (such as ordinary criminal gangs) is that most people accept
government coercion as normal and proper.  The same act that is regarded as
coercive when done by a private individual seems legitimate if done by an
agent of the government.

"If I yell 'Stop, thief!' at a stickup man escaping with my wallet, the
bystanders may or may not help, but they will at least recognize the
reasonableness of my act.  If I yell "Stop, thief!" at an employee of the
Internal Revenue Service, leaving my house after informing me that he has
just frozen my bank account, my neighbors will think I'm crazy.
Objectively, the IRS is engaged in the same act as the thief.  It seizes my
resources without my permission.  True, it claims to provide me with
services in exchange for my takes, but it insists on collecting the taxes
whether or not I want the services.  It is perhaps, a fine point whether
that is robbery or extortion.  In either case, if it were the act of a
private party, everyone would agree that it was a crime."

>The hope of Extropians is to make our semi-mutual agreements more
>beneficial to all involved.

Actually, your "semi-mutual agreements" sound an awful lot like coercion to
me.  I reason that if gov't exchanges were genuinely mutual, then any
private citizen could run a state based on mutual agreements.  However,
much of the time they are not mutual; by definition, exchanges which are
not mutually agreed upon by all participants are coercive.

I don't seek to make "semi-mutual agreements" more beneficial; rather I
seek to eliminate coercion through Intelligent Technology.

Hi.

I've been lurking on the list for about 4 months and have found the
discussion to be of consistently high value. I have been set, as part of
a Science and Technology Studies subject at Wollongong University
<http://www.uow.edu.au>, the essay question which follows - and my first
thought was that it is perfectly suited to this list. I would really
appreciate any links, book references, or discussion which might help me
to promote Extropian ideas through my response. The question is:

	Why do you think the image of modern technology being 'out of
control' has such a strong appeal? In what ways does technology appear
difficult to control? For some of the problems you identify, explore
their implications for government policy-makers. Provide examples for
your arguments.

My reasons for soliciting responses on this list are obviously focused
around a desire for high grades, but I am also very interested in any of
your opinions on the issue. I will not quote anyone without their
explicit approval.

Thanks,

Brad.

Maybe you are right, and we are too small to affect the outcome.  But
since a variety of high tech. startups exist now and we can invest in
them, I think that, with their incremental increase in funding, extropians
could support the research areas that they favor.

I favor research into all of those. I commented on biotech because the
original post was about biological research.

IMO, the appeal is based on reality: technology is out of control,
in the sense that no person or group can comprehend all of
technology. Peter the Great (?) managed to teach himself the
basics of the technology (European) of his time: that was
probably the last point in history that such a thing was
possible for one man. Today, a well-educated and capable
technologist cannot stay abreast of more than a small part
of one field. Even fairly dedicated techno-junkies such as
many on this list have trouble tracking most relevant
advances at a shallow level. No wonder the general public
is overwhelmed.

IMO, technology is actually considerably less under control
than most alarmists realize. Many futurists believe the
civilization of 50 years hence will be completely
incomprehensible from today's perspective. Some
more radical futurists think this is true for the civilization
of 15 years hence, or ten years hence.

Another way to put it is to ask "if technology is under control,
what is the nature of the control? Is this control sufficient to
prevent a runaway exponential growth leading to computer-based
superintelligence?"

Hmm.  From a somewhat oblique angle, I was thinking about something like
this the other day when I wrote a piece for the Melbourne Age (not yet
published) about the purported telomere breakthrough.  The newspaper had
published a snide editorial the day after the announcement, and I wrote in
part:

===================

Despite the beautiful patterns of life, evolution *has* no plan.  It is a
gigantic, stupid lottery.  In such a universe, we are freed from fears of
impiety.  Since evolution does not have a plan for us, we may choose one
for ourselves.  In fact, that is what we have always done, whether we knew
it or not.  

Yet people find it hard to grasp this essential moral point.  The day after
the immensely important Wright-Shay discovery was published, a whimsical
editorial appeared in the Age poking cautionary fun at the `tireless
scientists'.  I suspect the writer implied `tiresome' as well, for these
scientific wretches were pandering, apparently, `to this society's
adoration of youth'.  On the contrary - those benefiting most from
rejuvenation and an extended life span will be the elderly.  It's a grim
threat the editorial missed: rule forever by deathless Baby Boomers!

The editorial noted that in Jonathan Swift's *Gulliver's Travels*, the
immortal Struldbruggs `were the most miserable of mankind'.  Hmm - Dean
Swift himself was a notable grump, a dyspeptic misanthrope who never
recovered from the ghastly shock that his beautiful Celia defecated like
the rest of us.  Such one-sided fables - Frankenstein's hubristic fate is
another, and the Greek legend of Tithonus who lived forever in senility -
always get trotted out as if they prove something, as if they are *reports*
instead of *inventions*.

Defeating death and planning rejuvenation are no more absurd as goals than
finding remedies for short-sightedness or asthma (I've been on daily
prophylactic drugs for asthma for more than a quarter of a century, and it
has improved my life beyond recognition).  We manage quite well without an
evolved ability to read and write at birth, or to fly a jet by instinct.  

Ultimately, we might expect to fix what is called `ageing' - the damage and
at last senescence that now accumulates with the passage of time - and find
ways to outwit it.  The human population explosion will become an even more
pressing emergency, but we must solve that in any case.  Perhaps the price
of immortality will be elective or imposed sterilisation.

Does this also imply a sterile cultural future?  Why should it?  Remaining
young for centuries or millennia is not the same as an eternity of
sclerotic senility.  We will have time to learn all things - time enough,
as the optimistic science fiction writer Robert Heinlein wrote, for love.

The Age editorial ended, to my disbelief: `Dying (we think) is not all that
bad.'  Frankly, I can't think of anything to be said in its favour.  We're
stuck with death's pain, loss and grief at the moment, and must make as
decent a fist of it as we can.  But in the longest term of the history of
intelligent life in the universe, it will surely be the case - tragic, but
blessedly brief in comparative duration - that the routine and inevitable
death of conscious beings was a temporary error, quickly corrected.

=========================

I think the answer to Brad's question lies in the nagging painful questions
writhing between these two positions: the sarcastically defensive editorial
and my somewhat disingenuous rallying-cry (I acknowledge, of course, that
optional immortality will have an *immensely* disruptive impact on all
cultures, and on everyone's deepest sense of self and expectations from life).

Several people have posted questions about the recent cow cloning
experiments. I think this is one of the original articles:

___________
Human cloning could now develop faster

By Linda Carroll
MSNBC

Using egg shells from cows, scientists have created embryos from DNA
gathered from a variety of other animals, including primates. The new
research may allow human cloning to develop at a much faster rate,
experts say.


 NBC's Robert Hager reports Monday on recent breakthroughs in cloning
procedures.


THE NEW RESEARCH takes the cloning experiment that produced Dolly the
sheep in a new direction. Now scientists are learning that it may not
matter where the egg shell used to produce a cloned animal comes from.
Rather, they suggest that a mammal egg shell contains only the
machinery needed to spark life, not the information that determines what
species will develop. If the work pans out, it may allow scientists to
use eggs of one species as a universal recipient for the genes from
another species  including humans, researchers from the University of
Wisconsin said. The new research has medical ethicists worried. Cloning
experts have been saying we had some lead time before we had to worry
about cloning human beings, said David Magnus, an ethicist and
researcher at the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania
in Philadelphia. One of the major factors limiting the development of
cloning was the inefficiency of the process, Magnus said. It took more
than 270 tries before Dollys makers were able to create an embryo that
matured into a sheep. Since it would be very difficult and extremely
expensive to gather up that many human eggs, experts have predicted that
cloning of a human being would be far in the future, Magnus said. But
because cow eggs can be harvested cheaply and easily, one crucial
barrier to human cloning may have fallen, the Philadelphia ethicist
said.

CREATING THE EMBRYOS The studies, which were described Monday at a
meeting in Boston, come several days after Chicago physicist Richard
Seed announced to the world his plans to clone humans. Maverick cattle
cloner Neal L. First of the University of Wisconsin in Madison. While no
successful pregnancies have been achieved using the technique developed
in the laboratory of cloning pioneer Neal L. First, the eggs with the
foreign genes did develop into viable preimplantation-stage embryos. To
develop their experimental embryos, the Wisconsin researchers collected
unfertilized eggs from cows. Under a microscope, the researchers
inserted a fine glass needle into each cow egg and sucked out its
nucleus, explained Tanja Dominko, now a staff scientist at the Oregon
Regional Primate Research Center in Beaverton, Ore. After performing a
similar procedure on cells from the ears of mature sheep, monkeys and
pigs, Dominko and her colleagues replaced each cow egg nucleus with DNA
from another species. Then, the researchers zapped the cow eggs with a
small electric current.

The electricity serves two purposes, Dominko explained. It fuses the two
separate units  the DNA and the shell  into one egg. And sometimes,
the electric shock is enough to jump start the development of the egg
with its new nucleus into an embryo. Dominko and her colleagues have
watched their cow-egg embryos growing in the test tube. When the embryos
were seven to nine days old and about 100 cells large, the researchers
transferred them to the uteruses of potential surrogate animal mothers.
So far, none of the embryos appears to have implanted, Dominko admits.
We really dont know why, she said. We have to go back and check the
embryos to see if they have the right number of chromosomes, to see if
they have any chromosomal abnormalities. At this stage, this is really
just dreaming, Dominko said. I dont know if it will ever go any
further. If the research does progress, it might provide a way to
protect endangered species, Dominko said. The new research suggests that
the molecular machinery responsible for programming genes within the
eggs shell may be similar or identical in all mammals. Not everyone
thinks that the new research will lead to human cloning. The Wisconsin
group still hasnt produced a live animal with its technique, said Dr.
Jamie Griffo, director of the division of reproductive endocrinology at
the New York University Medical Center. We have tons of good looking
embryos in our in vitro fertilization lab and very few of them make
babies, Griffo said.  I dont think this is the next big breakthrough
that will allow us to clone human beings. Griffo himself is trying to
find a way to use the egg shells from younger women to house the DNA
of older women who have no viable eggs left. The New York Fertility
expert worries that a media furor over the Wisconsin research will
result in laws that limit experimentation with eggs and embryos. The
big losers in this could be infertility patients who want to be genetic
parents, he said.

So you propose that the control is not in the hands of the technologists
themselves - this leaves any control primarily in the hands of those who
would regulate the technology being developed. At the current time, this
is the government. If the technologists themselves are not in control of
the implications of technological developments what hope do governments
have of responsibly creating policies?

Alternatively the question becomes: "Is the guiding force of the
government sufficient to responsibly ensure human survival in the face
of rapidly advancing technology? If not, what is the solution?"

As Dan Clemmensen already noted, technology _is_ out of control in the
sense that the development of technology as a whole by our civilization is
neither controlled by any particular agency nor can it be known and
understood in its entirety.  The same holds true for other creative
endeavors: there is more art, more music, and more literature in the world
than anyone can hope to be familiar with, much less appreciate.
Furthermore, all such areas of creativity are the product of particular
individuals pursuing their own goals and listening to their own muses; no
agency or group directs where creative effort goes.  This is best so.

The difference (or at least A difference) between the expansion of the
body of the arts and the development of technology is that technological
changes can have direct, profound, and unpredictable effects in all other
areas of human life, with economic changes first.  Most people don't like
change, aren't willing to change, and think of change not as an
opportunity for growth and career advancement but as a threat to their
rut.  Untill we (as a species) develop a social counterpart to an ESS, one
accomodating ever-changing technology, I suspect this will remain the
case.

Moderately relevant annecdote:

Microfilm viewers are not particularly advanced technology; I'd say
they're about as hard to use as a car stereo.  Yet in the years I worked
in my university library's microfilm department, I saw literally thousands
of people who were plainly intimidated by those bulky screen-and-spool
machines.  They were unfamiliar technology and therefore a threat to the
ego, a challange to their ability to navigate the world and deal with its
contents.

I remember one particular patron whose viewer had repeatedly jammed when
printing.  I suggested she try another viewer, a newer model and one less
prone to jams.  She actually said, "Oh no, I don't want to learn something
NEW!"  Excuse me?  Why are you in college?

****

The widespread fear of change makes me wonder if widespread
implementation of technologies such as cloning, genetic alteration of
humans, IA/AI integration and dramatic life extension aren't going to have
to wait until the colonization of the solar system has begun.  Space
migration (and, to a lesser extent, undersea migration) will offer new
opportunities for social experiements unfettered by existing governments.
That assumes, of course, that one of the more eschatalogical models of
Singularity hasn't intervened.

The government has little hope of effectively controlling technology.
Advances in technology don't happen in the name of progress, but rather in
the name of economics.  This alone nearly guarantees that technological
progress will proceed, government willing or not.  Any progress that
results tends to be a by-product of the economics of technology.

Moving beyond this though, I have little faith that governments will create
useful policy no matter how "responsible" it appears to the Joe Average.
The problem is that politicians are generally as technologically inept as
the populace, and tend to fall prey to the same ridiculous memes.  While
technologists may not be able to fully control the technology and
implications that they create, they are much better equipped to understand
the ramifications and potential than the government.


>Alternatively the question becomes: "Is the guiding force of the

You are assuming things that are clearly questionable in my mind.  First,
government is simply not adaptive enough to qualify as a guiding force in a
technology driven environment.  Government policy changes *much* slower
than technology does.  Second, many humans *will* survive the onslaught of
rapidly advancing technology.  I will grant that as the pace increases
fewer people are able to make the grade as it were, but this is evolution
in action.  Much of the population, while potentially capable, has not
maintained their ability to adapt to these new technologies.

The solution?  Prepare yourself the best you can and HANG ON!  Most
importantly, people have to accept that change is a natural state of
affairs.  The ability to control technological change is beyond the
capability of individuals and governments.  However, it is through the
actions of millions of free individuals that technology is guided.
Therefore, the best and only way to "guide" technology is through the
proper education of the populace.  Do this, and technology will take care
of itself.

These types of comments have been bounced around on this list for a while
and I have a few comments that I think are very relevant to the issues here.

This community *is* large enough to effect significant change in the world
of technology.  The big problem is that everyone on this list seems to want
to make huge leaps in technology, rather than following a more incremental
path.  While huge leaps are great, it is highly unlikely and financially
unsound as an investment.  

There are numerous, profitable markets between here and singularity.  Don't
invest in nanotech, invest in a company that creates protein modeling
software.  It is unlikely that we will invent nanotech before we can
properly model complex organics.  As much as we would like to ignore it,
there is a great deal of continuity in technological progress.  If you want
to accelerate the outcome, work on fixing the more short-term technology
problems and make a little money while you are at it.  Not only is it
generally more profitable, but a lot more people will be willing to invest
in your ideas.

A strong suggestion ... go root out a copy of FUTURE SHOCK by Alvin
Toffler, pub. 1970 or thereabouts. Read it.

Yes, the book is obsolescent. Yes, things have moved on a long way since
it was written (and published). Many of the themes in it seem dated,
quaint, or just plain silly. But it lends a valuable perspective --
namely, it shows what attitudes to technology being 'out of control'
were like in 1970. People were feeling bewildered because of the rate
of change of technology back then. The anti-science shtick was visible
already. Things have accelerated a lot since 1970, and some new themes
have emerged, but the broad picture seems to me to be consistent, and
it can be summed up quite simply: most people can't adapt easily to
change.

As far as the central concept -- technology being 'out of control' -- I
suppose the only valid response is that it was never _under_ control in
the first place. Technological progress this century has almost all been
driven by market forces, which are blind to long-term prospects (else
we wouldn't have had leaded petrol or CFCs in aerosol cannisters -- or
microprocessors or aeroplanes for that matter). Moreover, government
policy regulators might _want_ to regulate the social impact of new
technologies (I doubt they could give a damn for technology in isolation,
were it not for the effect on their constituents), but they can't predict
where the next outbreak will occur. (If they could, they'd be investing
in it themselves, as individuals.)

Have fun telling 'em it's time to surrender ...

Probably because that's true, that's why. (Moreover, 'out of control' is
such a vague term that you can lump a gadzillion issues under this
label. If you think of it, a lot of things are 'out of control'. My
shoelaces, for example). 

> difficult to control? For some of the problems you identify, explore

Technology is impossible to control, for it would require concerted action
of a large, heterogenous agent population (the probabilistic argument). 
Also, a subpopulation treading the hitech path tends to have higher
fitness (military prowess, can better memefect due to its better media).
On the short to medium run technology promises excellent ROI. (Of course,
on the long run technology can be terminal to Life As We Know It). 

In other words, technology is good.

..Culture hacking

  These folks will pay you to mess with the mind of the consumer
  society

    The rTMark site [20] is the public face of a shadowy organization
    that sponsors and pays for acts of culture hacking. Their aim is to
    "encourage the intelligent sabotage of mass-produced items." (The
    name is intended to suggest "circle-R TM ark," and is pronounced
    "art mark.") This is the organization that solicited and then paid
    money to a programmer at Maxis who added kissing boys action figures
    to the game of SimCopter just before it shipped [21], [22]. The pro-
    grammer, Jacques Servin, was fired for his trouble but has bounced
    right back with the Whistlesmiths Web site [23], from which he offers
    career councelling for those dismissed for acts of product sabo-
    tage. In 1993 rTMark orchestrated the notorious Barbie Liberation
    Organization's GI Joe / Barbie voicebox switcheroo [24]. Read the
    rTMark manifesto here [25]. Wired covered the emergence of rTMark
    from its veil of secracy last April [26].

    Incidentally, the Web host fof the rTMark pages is paranoia.com in
    Austin, Texas, whose owner, as Zero Micro Software, registered the
    domain name micros0ft.com. After Redmond lawyers convinced the
    InterNIC to suspend the name, he preserved the joke page at [27].

    Another prolific and lifelong culture hacker is Joey Skaggs, self-
    described "socio-political satirist, media activist, culture jammer,
    hoaxer, and dedicated proponent of independent thinking and media
    literacy" [28].

    Finally, a tip of the Tasty Hat to the Boston Globe, which on 1/11
    ran an article (not online) profiling two software evangalists. The
    article describes a game they play called "reality hacking": They
    invent a meaningless jargon term, brainstorm a plausible meaning for
    it, then drop it into business conversations. The point is to get
    the term into play. Sort of like Jargon Scout [29] does, but less
    aboveboard.

It has always been out of control, since it is not something
controllable (you can influence it, but total control seems unlikely
as the others argue). The reason the image of "out of control" is so
widespread is that most people think along industrial age lines.  I
think Kevin Kelly was right on the mark when he described the
fundamental tenet of the industrial era as control: control of the
workings of the machine, control over the workers, control over the
means of production. But in the postindustrial era we are starting to
realise that control in the old sense is not essential and inf fact
counterproductive; self-organization can work quite well on its own.

The only real areas that have any measure of controlling the pace of
advancement are the supply of the capital markets to new technology
businesses, government funding for research, and the market's demand for new
features and capabilities. Because there isn't one area that has monopoly
control, if you try to limit one, the others will tend to compensate, and if
you limit them all, I would expect other, presently less influential paths,
will come to the fore. If government doesn't want what is happening, they
really only have the choice of either abdicating, or invoking a worldwide
'cultural revolution' to end the trends that began with the Rennaissance.
They cannot have their cake and eat it too.

People, as individuals, are tending to fall into two groups, which is
directly related to the level with which they as individuals use new
technologies, and with how late in life they as individuals are still
capable of new learning and growth. In the 60's, grandparents couldn't
relate to just about anything their grandkids were doing, as their personal
paradigms were calcified and obsolescent with the current and emerging
status quos, which aided the desctruction of the extended family. Today, the
trend is that parents are experiencing the same dysfunction with respect to
their kids. Parents who have trouble with, or can't program a VCR or set up
a sereo system, are totally oblivious to the manner in which their kids
easily become computer capable like fish to water.

The old societal paradigm was that the parents and grandparents taught the
children about getting along in the world, but today it is reversed, with
kids being the instructors in the use of technology. At my local community
college, most of the computer course instructors are in their 20's and early
30's, while most of the students are older. For people raised in a time when
elders were the respected members of society, this is a highly jarring
experience, to have to take instruction from 'young whippersnappers'.

In order to overcome this, there needs to be widespread dissemination of
exercises for stretching the mind, keeping it fit and flexible late in life.
However, I think that the public anti-tech furor is mostly the last gasps of
the beatnik and hippie adherents to an acadian reverence for technological
simplicity. There is a possibility of a New Amish subculture forming
(remember, the original Amish live by technology that was current at the
start of the industrial revolution) here at the beginning of the information
revolution, but those who do not take an active role in such separating
efforts will merely die out and be replaced by people who are already today
living with attitudes of flexibility, who rejoice in change.

Is the guiding force of technology sufficient to responsibly ensure human
survival in the face of the continuing threat of extermination and
oppression by obsolescent government organizations, and the narrowminded and
unfounded fears of willingly obsolete people who exercise undue influence
over those governments?

* Cough cough *

First you reject an old fashioned philosophical attempt to derive morality
from nature, they you start pinning loaded terms like 'evil' on the
administrative donkey. (If I didn't know better, why: I might even wonder
if you bore a grudge against government! :)

Explain that to diabetics who can't get reasonably priced medical
insurance cover, then. It's in an insurance company's interest, and the
interests of its other customers, not to take on board individuals who
are at high risk. But life's never that simple, and the obvious
first-order approach ("diabetics are high risk, don't touch 'em") isn't
the whole answer to the question.  For example -- pursuing a speculative
train of thought -- I seem to recall a recent statement by the RAC (here
in the UK) that diabetic hypoglycaemia is a not-too-uncommon cause of
auto accidents. One could prognosticate that it would be of indirect
benefit to the users of a medical insurance company for it to offer
cover for diabetics, because presumably diabetics with adequate medical
supervision are less likely to let their condition get out of hand  
and kill people (including users of our hypothetical insurance
company) while behind the wheel of a car.

The market is good at looking after local problems. It's complete crap
at predicting the future, though, and it provides no solution to the
tragedy of the commons without the imposition of an external regulator.

I could hypothesize that the role of government since the age of 
enlightenment -- the role that made it useful enough to have persisted
as an institution -- was simply to provide a workable legal and
enforcement environment in which the market could operate. Do away
with governments that think they're there to enforce laws, and you're
left with the next level down: gangsterism. And most people would
prefer their neighbourhood gangsters to use a rule-book, rather than
make up the extortion demands as they go along.

(This isn't an argument for coercive authority in any absolute sense;
but it's an attempt to explain why _more_ coercive authority can
sometimes be less painful for the people who live under it than
a less powerful but more capricious extortionist.)

A nit: each of us can choose our own plan, but as humanity we cannot
choose a plan for ourselves.  Evolutionary selection still functions, and 
plans have reproductive consequences.  Those who choose plans which result
in fewer progeny will be selected out in the long term.

In our case, it is not as much genetic progeny as memetic progeny that
counts.

Buckminster Fuller used to talk about a rebel zone, a place where the
restrictive laws and gummint didn't apply. These days there isn't a
place physically, but the technical edge is like that. It takes a
minimum of 5 years for a gummint to discover what's happening with new
stuff and attempt to shut it down. Stay on the edge, and be free.....

You are right.  The "semi-mutual agreements" that people currently live
under are forms of coercion.  And yet these agreements have come about by
choice; maybe not on the part of the ones being coerced, but certainly on
the part of the ones coercing (unless they are being coerced to coerce). 
And if we really want to end coercion in all forms of human interaction,
then we need to understand why so many millions of individuals so
willingly choose to be coercive.  And keep in mind that coercion goes
beyond government; it happens in families, and it happens on the
playground, and it happens in many other places as well.  Many millions
of people like to boss other people around.  Why?

We all like to get our way, but many people like to coerce others into
helping them get their way.  And some people just like the feeling of
power they get from having others obey them.  Coercion is a very
widespread phenomenon, and it is a very deep and ingrained part of human
interaction.  It isn't going to be easy to eliminate it.  Getting rid of
governments won't do it; governments are only the products of a coercive
society; the problem is not "government", but the coercive nature of the
society which created and supports government.  It's *individual people*,
working together to force their will on those who won't go along
willingly, that creates government.  *Individuals* are coercive, and they
form coercive groups.  But to eliminate coercion, coercive individuals
must be taught to be non-coercive, and this may take a lot of
psychotherapy, or something similar. If we just eliminate coercive
organizations, like government, coercive individuals will just form other
coercive organizations.  If we're going to stop coercion we must stop it
at it's source; individuals.

Any ideas how to practically do this?  Self help books? (_Controlling
Coercion_: How Coercive Behavior is Self-Defeating)?  Lots of Internet
sites on the subject, with lots of information on how to eliminate
coercive behavior in oneself?  TV documentaries?  Popularizing discussion
of coercion?

Announcement for the NECSI working group: Information Mechanics
===============================================================

First meeting:

Topic: Physical Limits to Computation.
Location: A room will be reserved on the MIT campus.
Date: Friday, Jan 30.
Schedule: 9am - 5pm, including a relaxed,informal lunch, lunch will be
served on the premises, possibility of going out to dinner afterwards
for those who wish.
Fee: We ask that each participant contribute $20, which will provide for
all refreshments and the lunch.

Second meeting:

Topic: Information flow in non-equilibrium systems.
Location: again MIT.
Date: Friday, March 27.
Schedule: similar, if we find that it works.

Participation:

Participation is limited to 30 people and is by application/invitation
only.  This is to ensure easy, informal communication between those
present. Interested people should contact me, Rick Bagley:
                        Richard.Bagley@digital.com,
with their queries and contributions.  Michel Baranger and I are the
organizers.  We will notify registered participants (and send
directions) via email beforehand.

What is expected of participants?:

Participants should be ready to present ideas which contribute to the
theme.

There will be no long formal talks. But hopefully there will be many
interested, knowledgeable people ready to contribute something from
their own work, some work from the literature, well-posed questions,
suggestions for collaborations, etc.  We welcome suggestions from
participants beforehand concerning the format, the topics, or possible
speakers.

Topics:

Here are some possible topics to provoke interest:

- Potential and limitations of quantum computation (recent work on
teleportation is topical)
- Limits to the efficiency of a parallel computation (as a function of
the number of processors, or alternatively, the fundamental limits to
the decomposition of a computation)
- The possible role of self-organization in computation
- Minimal energy requirements for communication (ref: Landauer: 1996
Science 272:1914)
- Symbolic dynamics of dynamical systems seen as computational systems,
and association of dynamics regimes with different characterizations of
computation
- Stability of a computation, and the role and limitations of error
correction, randomness
- Algorithmic stability (perhaps not directly relevant to physical
aspects of computation? )
- Applications of coding theory

We encourage interested people to contribute topics and improve upon
this list.

There will also be a web-based bulletin board available for the group to
augment the overall discussion.

The first meeting will allow time for exploration of the subjects of
future working group meetings and the objectives for collective
contributions from these meetings.

Additional information about working groups at NECSI on other topics can
be found at
http://necsi.org/html/WG.html
and general information about necsi can be found at

Is modern technology out of control?  If, by "control", you mean that
someone or some group of people can dictate exactly how it develops,
then, yes, it is out of control.  But in a more subtle sense, it *is* in
control.  

>From the perspective of your neurons or even groups of neruons (if they
even have a perspective), you are out of control.  None of your neurons
control you or *can* control you; they are too small in the overall
process of you to exert much control.  Yet, your overall behavior comes
out reasonably intelligent, with no one really in charge of the system.  

The whole system of technology seems reasonably intelligent (which is not
surprising, since the participants in the system all make reasonably
intelligent decisions), but the *whole* system isn't under any direct
control by anyone or any group; everyone has their own little part of the
system to manage, and because everyone is managing their own part
intelligently, the whole system of modern technology is fairly
intelligent.  No *one* is in charge because *everyone* is in charge, to a
small degree.

Modern technology is under -distributed control-, not centralized
control.  Which is a very good thing, since a powerful, centralized
authority is capable of making much more devastating errors than any one
of the millions of distributed entities, who have far less power.  Spread
the power and control around to as many as possible, and it is difficult
for anyone to make too big of a mistake.  If everyone's keeping an eye on
their own part of things, then everything's being watched over. 
Distributed control is the safest form of control that modern technology
could have.  We are in our own hands; not in the hands of any leader. 
That makes some uncomfortable because they like prominant leaders, but it
makes me feel very safe, because I trust my fellow humans to make good
choices, in general, and to keep an eye out for dangerous people.

A nit with this: This isn't quite accurate. Those plans may not take over
the society of all persons, but the plans of those with few progeny can
take over sub-societies. If, as I suspect, posthumanity will diverge both
in space as well as in form, even those who don't reproduce can form
cultures independent of most of posthumanity. Their plans would only be
selected out if you assume that only one culture/set of ideas will exist. I
see no reason to believe this.

Typically the people who think that psychotherapy is good (for everyone
else), or that things should be such and so a way (for your own good), are
usually motivated out of the best of intentions, and feel that they are
somehow annointed to do so, no matter how conservative or liberal those
people are, for the same reasona Columbus felt annointed to exterminate the
Native Americans, for the same reason the Kennedy's are always in politics,
for the same reason Lenin and Stalin did their deeds, and for the same reason
religious nuts bomb abortion clinics, and Hillary tries to push health care
'reform' on us.

Well i just thought that it might be of some interrest, especially to
the Moore's that I just saw them on a Danish sattelite channel (TV
Danmark) in the program "Future Fantastic."

The Extropians were mentioned briefly, and there was a short interview
with Max More about transformation of the body.

First of all, thanks to all those who have provided input. I especially
like David Musick's view of technology as being under distributed
control - there are some good analogies which can be drawn with this and
technology itself, such as robotics. I intend a major part of my
response to be that technology is self-guided and therefore centralised
control (ie. governmental intervention) is unnecessary.

For one example of the difficulty of control/policy-making I am going to
use (surprise surprise) cloning. I have not saved many of the emails on
this list about the issue - how quickly does the archive appear on the
web? If I can access the list postings from last week and earlier it
would be great. If not, it would be good to get some pointers towards
good web sites which treat the issue (although I suspect a quick web
search will do the trick).

Also, I am looking for a technology which does not seem to be
acknowledged by government in policy (yet...) but which may provide
dilemma in the future. Would Artificial Intelligence be appropriate? As
a computer science undergrad this would be my preference, but if anyone
has any better suggestions I would gratefully receive them.

Thanks,

Brad.

A great book you should take a look at:  Kevin Kelley's _Out of Control_,
on exactly this question.  What's more, it's online at:

And a nit upon a nit: people can have both genetic and memetic progeny.
So far, plans which result in fewer genetic but more memetic progeny 
(e.g. celibate priests) are doing OK.

>Hormones as part of chromosomes XX, XY, XYY?

If doctors respond to the Duke University study on intersexual
children and turn the decision as to whether to apply any sort of
treatment over the intersexual individuals, we will have more
members of the human population not in conformity with male/female
classifications.  (Not to mention currently existing androgynes)  I
figure that it would be more precise for medical purposes for each
human to carry a profile based on internal factors, such as
XX/(n)E/(n)T (with E= estrogen and T= testosterone).  For social 
purposes, each individual could decide for themselves what gender 
they wish to be known under, if any at all.

Having disagreements wasn't my point.  My point is that Anarchism

And the general public agrees that any specific coercive group is

I said nothing about the government. I propose that no one is
in control and that no one can be in control. I don't say that
I like or dislike this state of affairs. Government can try to
control this but the reaction time of government, or anyone else,
is simply too slow. The only way to control this chaos would be
to severely restrict the availability of computers and computer
communications, and this will not happen unless a world government
does it. The structural impedements to a powerful world government
are too large to overcome in the time available, so this is a
non-starter.
Thus, we will see the end of our current society and the advent
of its successor fairly soon. I'm optimistic about the results.

There is a fatal problem with this analogy. The homeostasis (i.e.,
corrective feedback) of the neural system is not spontaneous, but is
the result of evolution by mutation and natural selection. 
Robotics fails as an analogy because the design of a robot is
under control, and the functions of the robot are typically adjusted
during the design phase to produce a desired range of results.
IMO, there is no equivalent selective force in society as a
whole that will cause the techno-societal system to tend toward
homeostasis. "Spontaneous order" does occur in many arbitray
complex systems, but other arbitrary complex systems exhibit
self-destructive behaviour. You cannot simply chant "spontaneous
order" as a mantra. You must attempt to identify the corective
mechanisms.

Try software design productivity improvement in general, and
software tools for the development of distributed algorithms in
particular. These technologies are uncontrolled, but result in
supercomputing for everyman. The "great Mersienne prime search"
and other recent distributed computing challenges are a crude
first step. The distinguishing attribute of technology, as
opposed to other human endeavors such as art sports, etc., is that
technological advancement contributes strongly and measurably
to further technological advance. This is almost a definition
of positive feedback, which is exactly the wrong kind of feedback
for a stable system.

This says to me that society as we know it is doomed, but I'm
optimistic that successor to our society will be an unimaginable
improvement.

We are building our successor, and we're almost finished.

In the early 80's, before he had heard of memes but while computer
viruses were getting their first media exposure, my friend Steve
Robsky at Data General (aka Dirty Genitals Corporation) came up
with the following:

Steve: "Suppose there were ideas that were like viruses, so that once
you hear them, they take over your mental processes and you can't
stop thinking of them?"
Me: "I think there are plenty of ideas like that."
Steve (conspiratorial whisper): "Right! And further suppose that the 
idea of a mental virus was one such ..."

----------------------------------------

It's possible to view the output of any identifiable group of
organisms, including humanity-as-a-whole, as a computation which is an
emergent property of the group's functioning (cf. Tipler [there's more
to Tipler's hypothesis, of course] and Douglas Adams, not to mention a
lot of half-remembered early posts to this list). These computations
vary in their degree of directedness and efficiency. Seems to me the
efficiency of all but a few of them is ~0, especially since the
"results" aren't recorded anywhere or recognized as such. Surely part
of the appeal of cyberspace (and eventually upload space) is the
potential for raising that ~0 to a usable fraction.

So far, =0 of this is new. OK, suppose there are a number of diffuse 
computations that are timesharing our nervous systems, mostly at levels
we're not conscious of (because if we were conscious of them, as good
capitalists, we'd be looking for a billing address, neh?). Maybe a
lot of our undirected, inexplicable behaviors are I/O operations in
those computations. It is then also possible that as we expand our
awareness and control of mental functioning, a side effect is that we
disrupt a number of these parasites. Maybe those of us who eventually
upload shed all of the old organic ones ...

... and find a new set of much more efficient parasite programs running 
around "up" there ... <evil grin>. This says I should definitely keep 
working on data security, I'll always have work! Just imagine the 
disaster recovery plan for a Jupiter brain ...

I prefer to use my personal opinion and tell nature to go to hell. I don't 
believe in objective morality, but I do believe in subjective morality. Why 
do I like some things and dislike others? Because that's the way my brain is 
built.

As I said, Darwin himself was not a social Darwinist, he was a very moral man 
but he lost his religious faith because he thought a God that sanctioned  
a hideously cruel process like natural selection did not deserve worship.  
He writes that he was very disturbed at the reproductive behavior of a 
species of wasp that he discovered as a young man. The wasp stings a spider 
enough to paralyze it but not enough to kill it, it then laid it's eggs on 
the poor beast. When the eggs hatch several days later the maggots slowly 
consume the still living creature, carefully  avoiding vital organs and 
leaving the brain for last.

Darwin's best friend and vigorous defender Thomas Huxley in his essay  
"Evolution and Ethics"  wrote that morality was objective, but could be found  
by looking in the exact opposite direction from the dog eat dog would of 
nature. I wouldn't go as far as Huxley, but I don't think natural selection 
has a morality,  at least not a morality I want to follow, and if I ever meet 
you in a dark alley I hope you don't either.

True, that's exactly what I did.

Actually, I pinned the word "evil" onto cancer, and I did so for only one   
reason, I don't like it. Cancer is just not my cup of tea, if you disagree  
that's fine, there is no disputing matters of taste.

Reasonably priced? You mean explain why everybody can not always receive  
medical benefits that are more expensive than the premiums they pay? I think 
it's sufficient to say that you can't get something for nothing.

Exactly. If diabetics pay less than they should then non diabetics will have 
to pay more. There is only one reason non diabetics would want to do that, 
they might want to be charitable. It's true that if nobody is in a charitable 
mood and if diabetics really can't afford their treatment then people are
going to die, but how will government improve things? If I hate the idea of 
giving you money why would I vote for politicians to pass laws that make me?

It sounds like a pretty far fetched idea to me, but maybe. If you really 
believe in it and can convince others of the wisdom of your idea then start  
your own insurance company. If you're right then you'll become very rich, 
I'm skeptical myself so I'll refrain from buying any of your stock, but I've  
been wrong before and I wish you well on your endeavor.

The tragedy of the commons is just that, a tragedy, and unfortunately no 
system has a solution for it. There is no compelling reason why government 
should engage in projects that help most people most of the time, it's much 
more likely that they'd do things that help a very few people a lot but is
slightly harmful to most. When the number of projects becomes large the harm 
is no longer slight.
            
Suppose I want to make $10,000,  there are two ways to go about it. I can 
work to repeal hundreds of special interest laws, each one costing me a few 
dollars, or I can lobby for the passage of one more special interest law that 
will give me and my friends $10,000 and cost everybody else a dollar or two. 
The second method makes much more sense, it's far easier to pass one law than 
to repeal hundreds .

This sort of lobbying won't work in the free market. If I want an executive   
at Microsoft to be promoted to a position of greater power there is only one  
thing I can do to help that come about, purchase the product that the 
executive has been advocating. Bribery will help the executive's bank

Coercion is actually a form of immaturity, or low EQ as some put it. It
is also ingrained into much of childrearing as a form of pedagogy. Here
is how to do it,
given what we know so far:

	1. Read Alice Miller, "For Your Own Good".
	2. Do a really GOOD rage workshop, one in which you feel safe
	   enough to experience lethal killing rage.
	3. Read Stanislav Grof, "LSD Psychotherapy".
	4. Learn about and practice Holotropic Breathwork (invented
	    by Grof)
	5. Find an experienced sitter and do supervised internalized
	   psychedelic sessions with MDMA, LSD, Mescaline or Psilocybin.
	6. Do this until you expereince what Grof calls BPM4, or at
	   least two successive sessions in which childhood and birth
	   material does not arise.

This WORKS. Coercion vanishes as a personal approach to all situations
with the possible exception of self defence. Anyone seriously interested
in doing this contact me by private email. (Oh Oh, I'm coming out!)

BTW, the ONLY way to interest others is to have done it yourself, people
seem to know this in some way... Forget laws, media, etc, etc.

MEMS. (Micro electromechanical systems; mechanical systems -- as opposed
to electronics -- that you can make using a chip fab.) Time scale: 1-5
years; it's already working in the lab stage and commercial applications
will be coming to a street near YOU real soon now. Impact: Not quite as
big as nanotechnology, but grossly underestimated. (Imagine: your
friendly neighbourhood police department has robot drones with high-
definition low-light TV cameras so that it can fly round suspicious
neighbourhoods looking for drug deals. Meanwhile, the drug dealers are
tooling up with labs capable of producing etorphine by the milligram --
that's all you need -- that fit in an innocuous-looking PCMCIA card in
a laptop. And their guns shoot guided bullets. Oh, and did I mention
the 20-watt turbogenerator a centimetre in diameter and two millimetres
thick that ARPA is paying the development costs of?)

This one seems to have blind-sided even the SF writers who went hog-wild
over nanotech a decade ago, but it's real and it's here today the way
personal computers were 'here today' in 1975.

I agree that it is a great book, but unfortunately there are only
excerpts at absolutvodka (still good excerpts, manages to convey many
of the important ideas).

Yes, I would be surprised if there were no cognitive parasites or
selfish replicators even among uploads; it is a big ecological niche
where there are already prototypes.

Making backups and reboots of Jupiter brains is an interesting
problem. Some RAID scheme might help preserve the data, but what do
you do when the central cognitive systems have been messed up? It
would be a mixture between system operations and psychology, on a
posthuman level.

Apropos replicators and jupiter brains (and rebooting of them), I
recommend Charles Stross' novel _Scratch Monkey_ (on the net at
http://www.antipope.org/charlie/fiction/monkey/index.html) for one
look at the problem of expanding into an uploaded state where
selection pressures (for access to computing resources) become
significant. I don't really agree with his "ecological succession",
but it is a fun (if very dark) read.

Just read a great SF novel called Kaleidoscope Century, by either John or
Stephen Barnes. He really went nuts with memetic warfare, even developing an
era in the next century which he calls the Meme Wars, in which 7 or 8 memes
are the controlling intelligences of the populace, and are engaged in warfare
with each other, using people as their proxies.

John Barnes. (Very good indeed, IMO.) 

BTW, if you can get locate it, read the SF short story BLIT (by Dave
Langford, first published in Interzone a few years ago and reprinted a
couple of times since then). Someone discovers a fractal image that
makes the human brain's wetware crash ...

That makes two of us. (Although I tend to think in terms of altruism as
usually being a Good Thing, at least towards those who hold the same
opinion towards me, and act that way.)

Of course, this approach can cover a multitude of conflicting viewpoints ...

Quite true. However, the whole point of insurance is _collective_ risk
cover -- from the customer's point of view. From the insurer's point of
view it's to make a profit by maximizing the return on money while 
minimizing payouts. So there's a built-in conflict of interests.

Now, at this point the market is supposed to come into play, wave a
magic wand, and Make Everything Work Optimally. At least, that the official
truth I keep hearing from libertarians. (Warning: I Am Not A Libertarian --
although I have more sympathy for libertarian social ideals than for
conventional political ones).
           
> Exactly. If diabetics pay less than they should then non diabetics will have

That's the 'market knows best' answer. I am not happy with it. It
subordinates ethics to market realities. (The ethical viewpoint being
"everybody should have access to equal treatment, in an ideal world" and
the market viewpoint being "you get what you pays for".) While it's
inarguably a description of a current state of affairs, it's not an
ideal state (which would probably be: nobody gets diabetes, grows old,
dies, or needs insurance in the first place) or even an optimal
one (everybody can afford insurance).

No. A screamingly obvious hole in our knowledge is how to reason under
conditions of uncertainty. There's no rigorous methodology available
for doing so (although 20/20 hindsight, in the form of Bayes' theorem,
comes in handy).

But I maintain -- the market is simply a mechanism for adjusting
resource imbalances on a local scale. One thing I notice a lot of
libertarians do is idealise the concept of the market, turning it into
a holy cow of economic dogma: as if the market is the _only_ way of
allocating resources.

It's a lot better than, say, Soviet-style central planning. But it's
got weaknesses, and I'm fairly certain that better resource allocation
algorithms exist, if only we are smart enough to identify them. What
constitutes a better resource allocation algorithm? Any way of reconciling 
supply and demand that isn't vulnerable to the production and manipulation
of monopolies, doesn't encourage its core functional units to become Feudal 
dictatorships -- corporation mini-states -- and encourages cooperative,
as opposed to defective, use of common resources. Oh, and it also needs
to encourage cooperation non-coercively, not by being a free market with
a coercive regulatory mechanism bolted on top of it.  (In other words:
a system that encourages mutually beneficial exchanges and discourages
zero-sum games. Fun, huh?)

That's what I'm banging on about (above). Just because no system has
solved the problem, it does not follow that it is insoluble. And I see
a lot of extropian/libertarian thinkers seeming to blandly ignore it,
instead of fixing the defect. (The day some libertarian thinker dreams
up a non-coercive economic system that is not susceptive to the tragedy
of the commons is the day I become a libertarian.)

There are exceptions. I live in the UK, where we have a national health
system. It's underfunded -- but then, we don't pay much for it; about
US $1000 per taxpayer-year that covers everything from antibiotics to
heart transplants. The advantage it has over the US system is that there's
no insurance industry; treatment is free at the point of demand, so 
none of your healthcare budget is diverted into the insurance company's
back pocket. The disadvantage is that demand is potentially infinite --
leading to shortages. Ultimately an equilibrium is reached: I don't go
and pester my doctor about trivia because I know there's a long queue.
On the other hand, if I need emergency surgery in a hurry, nobody's
going to waste time asking if I've got insurance. The system's not
without shortcomings, but it's worked for more than fifty years on a
massive scale (annual budget around US $50 billion), so I'll assert
that it _is_ possible for a government to undertake a project of general
benefit to all its citizens [once in fifty years].

Alternative: a political system that is not amenable to bribery,
nepotism, or corruption and that follows the old dictum of kings that 
"he who rules best, rules least". But that's another matter.

Does Windows crash? I wouldn't know -- I don't let it near any of my PC's.

Charlie, I think you need to clarify your argument. You seem to be
saying that diabetics can't get cheap health insurance, whereas a
government funded system would cover them. Yet you then say that thanks
to the NHS there's no free health insurance market, and that untreated
diabetes is a major cause of road accidents, implying that the NHS is
doing a lousy job of treating them.

Healthcare is probably the most heavily controlled industry on the
planet, and attempting to use it as a demonstration of free-market
failure seems absurd to say the least (particularly when the NHS does it
so badly, and severely restricts treatment for the elderly folks who
need it the most).

Good !! 

Generallizing, it is v'ry interesting how some (lots of...) people are
influenced by mere affirmatives... and, worse, construct all their lives as
if such sillinesses were really true !!!
They just live in illusion... (what is also common in other existencial

Eh?!? You're attributing causal relationships between the things I was
talking about that I was carefully not drawing, because they ain't there.

What I was going on about is the problem that there's a conflict of
interest between people selling health care insurance and people buying 
it, and this conflict of interests may be a side-effect of the market
system itself. (Diabetes was the first example that sprang to mind.
It's not a huge cause of car accidents, either, although it's been
fingered as a contributory factor recently.)

That's not what I'm trying to do. Rather, I'm trying to point out 
that free market systems are not very good at globally optimizing
some situations, and if anyone could come up with something better ...

The NHS _doesn't_ do it badly; it does it very well indeed, given
that it is grossly underfunded and massively oversubscribed. (Compare
the situation with the USA, where per-capital healthcare spending
is 30-50% higher but something like 30% of the population have *no* 
healthcare cover at all.) The problem is, life is a 100% fatal
condition, and almost everyone will be willing to spend infinite
resources if they can stave it off for just one more minute; faced
with that kind of demand, what sort of system _can_ allocate
resources fairly?

Have you already considered on observing clones' behaviour ??
For example try to clone trainned animals... and verify wich of clones'
psychological and intelectual characteristics are independent from the

Or Neal Stephenson's _Snow Crash_?

It is unlikely the wetware can be permanently crashed by a simple
stimuli, although the flicker-induced epilepsy is a real
possibility. Our brains are rather robust systems, they have to be in
order to survive in a real world with all sorts of stimuli and plenty
of noise.

Although there is the possibility of two images at right angles to each other,
or even a hologram, that, when illuminated, people passing through the scalar
zone would be influenced by ELF range resonances. Dunno, just speculating.

Originally, I was only going to ask about weaknesses.
I need to write a report on the "basic human problem."
I thought that a debate or survey would provide some
useful information about what people think are the most
important weaknesses.

I mentioned my idea of asking "weakness questions" on
the Internet to a teacher friend.  She suggested that
I should also ask about strengths.

The primary purpose for posing these questions is to
gain further insight into the greatest human strengths
and weaknesses and what could or should be done about
them.

A secondary purpose is to generate a classification
or taxonomy of human strengths and weaknesses.  So,
please list and/or discuss what you consider important
human strengths and weaknesses.

An important consideration is my thinking that progress
in the direction of greater freedom could be accelerated
if more freedom activists could identify their greatest
strengths and find out how to best utilize them.

It would also be useful to us to identify important
weaknesses and find out how to overcome them.

I would appreciate your feedback.

an addenteum to this thread...unrelated to my earlier post.

It might be interesting to check out some of the earlier works (Science
Fiction) of Larry Niven.  The "Gil The Arm" series in particular.

In it is depectied a society in which technology is "under control".  You
might not like to live in it...I certainly wouldn't.

What you describe here sounds similar to what Life
already does with each individual organism. It may
also reflect how the cosmos already works as well.

Check out the cover story of the Jan 1998 Scientific
American at
http://www.sciam.com/1998/0198issue/0198ingber.html.
It's called "The Architecture of Life" and Donald
Ingber describes his work at the MIT Center for
Bioengineering on applications of the architectural
principles of 'tensegrity' to biology. The point that
I find most relevant to singularities comes at the
article's conclusion where Ingber speculates: "the
fact that our expanding (tensing) universe contains
huge filaments of gravitationally linked galaxies and
isolated black holes that experience immense
compressive forces locally can only lead us to
wonder. Perhaps there is a single underlying theme to
nature after all."  In other words, tensegrity seems
to apply from the cell all the way up to the
structure of the universe.

Tipler's "physics of immortality" always struck me as
being 'rather' totalitarian.  Gregory Benford's novel
_Sailing Bright Eternity_ describes the possibilities
for Omega-pointish 'computation' at the somewhat more
benign 'distributed' level of galactic black holes
(definitely an essential novel for the Extropian book
shelf - BTW, Benford's term is KENE, not KEME, as the
other thread keeps putting it.)

As for Tipler's idea of infinite subjective time;
well, that's a more subjective subject ;-)

I find it amusing to note that some mystics like this
idea as well.  I'm thinking, in particular, of Carlos
Castaneda who, by the way, now gives fitness seminars
and sells videos that incorporate the tensegrity
concepts!  In Castaneda's 9603 "Readers of Infinity:
A Journal of Applied Hermeneutics", he explicitly
tries to bring the concept of black holes to the
personal level: "[Don Juan's] contention was that
this vibratory, agglutinating force that holds
together the conglomerate of energy fields that we
are is apparently similar to what modern-day
astronomers believe must happen at the core of all
the galaxies that exist in the cosmos".  And,
somewhere in his earlier books, Castaneda also wrote
this, about a 'Warrior's Last Stand':

"... when his time on earth is up ... his spirit
which is always ready, flies to the place of his
predilection and there the warrior dances to his
death ... If a warrior has limited power, his dance
is short; if his power is grandiose, his dance is
magnificent.  But regardless of whether his power is
small or magnificent, death must stop to witness his
last stand on earth. Death cannot overtake the
warrior who is recounting the toil of his life for
the last time until he has finished his dance".

Linda Nagata's story _Tech Heaven_ even wonders
whether something similar might happen to a
cryonically-preserved person...

hara ra was overheard to say:

>It takes a minimum of 5 years for a gummint to discover what's happening with
>new stuff and attempt to shut it down. 

Five years?

My favorite author, Vernor Vinge, at one time put forth a theory.  To
summarize, hoping not to mangle it too badly, it is as follows.

The power of government in growing...BUT....the power of individuals (thanks
to technological advance) is growing at a FASTER RATE.

To illustrate the point.

Pick any area of interest. ( Communications, weapons, medicine,
transportation...dairy farming....etc.) There is a time frame sometime in the
not-too-distant past to which  it could be argued that a reasonably affluent
individual of today..(the further in the past you go...the less
affluent).....is NATION EQUIVALENT. 

That is:

Transportation: I...an individual, own a truck...a tractor-trailer
rig,...which has roughly the cargo capacity of any one of Christopher
Colombus's ships,(48,000 lbs. due to government imposed restrictions...actual
capacity is MUCH greater)... and it took the Nation of Spain to fund his
expedition. True...I only have one truck.(and I DID use a bank to fund
it...but some truckers don't...they pay cash)..and spain had many ships...but
some individuals today have MANY trucks....Schnieder for example(which I
beleive is NOT a public stock company)  has about 12,000. Did the Spain of
Chris's time have that many ships?  To compound this analogy  (which struck me
because I DO own a truck)...shipping now, as then, is the most effecient form
of transportation (for non time-critical cargo).  I beleive that some
individuals of today own ships...compare them to Spain's ships of that era.  I
wouldn't be suprised to discover that ONE cargo ship of today could carry as
much freight as all of the historical Spain's ships  put together...and
probably need less men to operate...than ONE of the Spainish ships.  (might be
wrong here..due to government imposed sanctions forcing the dispersion of
individual wealth...and  thus the ascendency of corporations....but go back in
time FAR enough...and I'm right)

Communications: I...an individual, am at this moment  preparing a
communication which will shortly be available to individuals in several
different countries....surely as great a number of countries as it took the
resources of the British Empire....only a couple of centuries ago....to
likewise communicate with.  But my communication takes less minutes to reach
it's destination(s) than the British Empire's took months. (now conside Ted
Turner)

Weapons?:  An individual of today...armed with weapons(s) available within his
price range would be the match for an army of how long ago?  Three
hundred...four hundred years...perhaps longer? (governments have always
been...and remain...REAL GOOD at killing..especialy killing women and
children...like at Ruby Ridge or Waco)  I strongly suspect that an L.A.
gangbanger with an AK-47 could take out a Roman Legion...(as long as he didn't
run out of ammo).

Computer Programming.   My two year old grandson is an expert "electronic
media entertainment facilitator" (he's a whiz with the VCR and the remote)
better than the whole WORLD of less than a century ago...of course the world
of a century ago didn't have VCR's, Television and remotes....which is the
point.

<These (spur of the minute) examples may not be EXACTLY correct..your milage
may vary....but I beleive that overall they  correctlly illustrate an
(historically) observable trend.>

  
This implies that sometime in the rapidly approaching future governments
become extinct....<the sooner the better>..since corrupt as they are...they
could NEVER compete on an equal basis with an individual or small
group..todays's "war on drugs" in the US  for example. (communication lag for
one thing..as well as laziness, stupidity, indecisiveness...and overall
ineptitude)...like all bullies they require the use <or threat>  of
overwhelming force to maintain their position, and inefficient use for that
matter, (HOW many bullets to kill one Viet Cong? HOW many thousand of tons of
bombs?...how much money spent)  to win. (or in the case of Viet Nam...to
loose..)

(A small country fighting a much larger country to a standstill....and then
the larger country running like a scalded dog.   It's happened twice that I'm
aware of....Viet Nam and Afghanistan..poor countries...paupers really ...and
it took  a Coalition of countries to slap down (down but not out) a RICH small
country....  Iran.....hmmmmmm.)

This  implies an increasing "Balkanization"...as governments  break up into
smaller and smaller pieces in order to improve their response time.    The
first of which may have been the Soviet Union ....once the largest government
on earth <land area> recently disintergrated. Perhaps the significant attempts
of secession by Quebec in Canada...as well as a province in Spain <can't
remember it's name right now...the one with the  language unrelated to it's
neighbors>..a semi serious effort on the part of california and texas to
"fission" into three and five states respectively are other examples of the
balkanization process in the early stages.

Five years did you say?  How many years  was it a decade ago, twenty years
ago?  Can a curve be established? (WHEN can I break out the Champagne?)

By "selected out" I meant becoming a declining fraction of the whole.  
In a growing society, entities could stably occupy a niche and still be a
declining percentage of the whole.

Why does it repel you?  Extropy is about rational thought, so what
rational reason have you got against human culling, genocide or
general murder?  Of course, you could argue that culling people is a
bad idea because maybe you'll accidentally kill someone who would have
been useful, etc.  But I'm talking about the act, what I want to know
is for what rational reason does this *idea* repel you?

I ask this not just because it's a difficult question, but because
Extropy has rationality at its core.  Now it's possible to think of
rational reasons for war, genocide, culling or anything else you care
to mention, but when a reason against it is called for we tend to fall
back on morality, ethics, and right and wrong.  These IMHO are weak
arguments against raw and unrelenting rationality, so what defenses do
we have against someone who's taken a very different slant on Extropy?

But the original point was - "That's God, our all powerful creator. 
What the hell, let's kill him anyway."  You've lost the whole social

I like the ending, just like real life.

Anyway here's the story so far:  Crowded street, traffic jam (tip: all
good movies have traffic jams) a strange winged creature falls out of
the sky and land on the top of a taxi (tip: if you're going to focus
on one car make it a taxi, taxis pull crowds) and that's as far as I
got.

The check is in the post.  Here's some other sci-fi themes ticking
over in my mind:

An uploaded universe ruled by a "Reality Council" who decides what's
real and what's not, young hopefuls struggle to make it up the
political ladder so that they can reap the benefits of being able to
pass "Reality Legislation." 

A Sci-fi television series where there are no psychics and/or social
comments.

Aliens land and don't want to judge us because we're so barbaric.

The worlds first science fiction novel that actually covers social
changes beyond - "We no longer shake hands, we rub feet."

Androids that don't want to be human.

An upload who downloads into a human body and is overwhelmed by the
shear lack of substance in the real world.

The H/P/A/V scene is pretty played out right about now... children

That was what I had in mind with my post. Only a level of control that Niven
describes in the ARM era of his known space series could hope to stabilize things
at this point, possibly even something more along the lines of  The State
(Rammer, Integral Trees, etc.).

This was briefly done with twins, testing the extension of the genes in 
intelectual and psychological skills. However with clones it is much more 
interesting, first because the environmental similarities between clones are 
less than between true twins -- because they don't spend their time in the 
womb together neither their early, sometimes even later, development. 
Changing the environmental conditions would be therefore very interesting, 
changing the "mother" -- the animal in which they develop in fetal states 
--, changing their infancy, it would be very interesting indeed.
One more thing I'd like to point is that the environment where an animal 
lives, can genetically influence its genes, it's sexual line. For example, 
if an animal lives in an environment with few food, it'll create smaller 
offspring also because its genes will be coded that way. Applying this to 
the mind would be fascinating! For example, if a person lives in a violent 
environment, its children will be likely to become violent. The question is 
weather this violence comes from the environment where they're raised or if 
it also comes from their genes. cloning could answer this questions.

See ya,

Now that I've been researching this more, I'm getting the idea that the
'out of control' meme is merely perpetrated by the corporate mind set to
subvert people's sense of independence and capability, soon to be
followed by the "we'll take care of you" meme of consumer slavery. "Buy
more, you'll feel better", "procreate, you'll feel better", "consume,
you'll feel better"....

I had a discussion with somebody about the amount of 
information required to store a persons state of mind.
I have written down my reasoning here...

By the way, Hans Moravec used this same kind of reasoning: 
Estimate the amount of information required to describe 
the brain by estimating the total amount of information 
entering the brain.

---------------

First lets assume that every arbitrary state of the 
human brain can be approached discretely. 

The beginning state of the brain (at least before birth, 
or better, before any actual inputs arrive) we should 
in principle be able to deduct from the information 
stored in the DNA. (The DNA contains about 10^10 bits)

Lets assume that the exact behavior of the brain can be 
predicted. However, we do not have to understand how 
the total system can behave as it will behave. 
It is sufficient to be able to exactly predict how 
the seperate elements from which the brain is constituted 
(i.e. the neurons) will behave (when you know how they 
are connected).

Now, every new successive state should be derivable from 
the original state and the inputs it receives during the 
interval in between. (The inputs to the brain also include 
those originating from the rest of the internal body.)

The question now is : how much is the total information 
input a person receives during his life. Or, on average, 
how much input does a person receive during a day.

Of course this input enters via the sensory organs. You 
could try to estimate the amount of digital information 
per unit of time, required to discretely describe the 
(ordinary average) input for ALL seperate sensory nerves.

However not all information that enters the brain (or the 
sensory nerves) is actually being used by the brain. It 
filters the information and uses only parts of it. We 
should be able to do this filtering beforehand. For 
example, the brain does not remember every detail of 
a picture it has seen (or even one it is seeing).


Lets formulate it differently:

Assumed we would connect all sensory nerves to a computer. 
Assumed the steps of the DACs are sufficiently small to 
not be noticed by the brain. The question then is: 
how much information per unit of time do I need to 
simulate the real life environment of a human individual 
in such a way that his brain will not notice the difference. 

I guess that, for example, 50 gigabytes per day should 
be sufficient to describe (simulate) all the sensory 
impressions our brains receive during a day, without 
our brains being able to notice the diffenrence between 
the real impressions and the simulated ones. 

An information input of 50 gigabytes per day results 
in a total of approximately 10^16 bits after an average 
human life time. The 10^10 of the DNA are much less and 
can thus be neglected.

Of course these methods only indicate what could be 
achieved when optimal compression methods are being 
used. In what way (the algoritm by which) this compression 
can be obtained is another (much more complex) problem. 

However there is still some time left. After the arrival 
of the singularity a posthuman jupiterbrain could try to 
spend some time to come up with a good algoritm. :->


When molecular tape storage systems should arive that 
can store 10^22 bits in a cubic centimeter, this would 
mean that the identities of a 1000 human equivalent 
individuals could be stored in a cubic millimeter (the 
size of a grain of salt?). 


Can somebody detect a fault in this reasoning?

Based on my extensive research (i.e., reading this list) I've
concluded that the "conspiracy" meme is an evil plot fomented
by a vast shadowy evil organization to completely fill the
meme space and drive out all other memes.

WAY too small an estimate, if you ask me.  Graphic image
storage and transmission is something of a specialty of
mine, so I'll try to estimate just the visual component:
Just to represent my field of vision, and no other data,
to the resolution of my retina (let's call it ~50 pixels,
which would be something like an 8kx8k large screen),
assuming very good data compression (say MPEG-2 or better,
which can get down to about 1-2MB a minute for images at
about 1/100th of that resolution), and a frame rate good
to human perception (perhaps just a bit faster than 60Hz),
I get well over 100 gigabytes a day /just for the video/.

Add all the other senses: sound, taste/smell, balance,
skin pressure, temperature, pain, propioception, and any
we haven't discovered yet, I'd say you're at least two
orders of magnitude low.

No. Insurance was invented because of the non linear nature of disaster. 
Paying a $100 premium is a very minor disaster, not having $100,000 to pay 
for a operation that would save my life is not a thousand times greater  
disaster, it is astronomically greater. Insurance companies exploit this 
inequality to their benefit and to mine. They expect to make a profit for 
their service or they wouldn't do it and I'm happy to pay the premium even if 
there is only one chance in 2 thousand that I'd ever need such an operation. 
The fact that the company has other customers than me is of interest to the 
insurance company but irrelevant to me.

Raging against that is like raging against gravity. If the pie is small then 
it's pointless to taking endlessly about how to divide it up because however 
you do it the pieces will be very small. The solution is to get a bigger pie, 
and no system creates more wealth than the free market.

I think it subordinates ethics to logic, but even if you disagree, I still 
don't see the problem. If that's the way you feel then give money to 
diabetics to pay their bills, give as much as you want, I wouldn't dream of 
stopping you.

Of course it has weakness, nothing human is perfect, but it's the best thing

your  followers will be so rich, smart, happy, and good looking that you 
won't need  to use force to make me join as governments do, I'll join your

Our positions are not symmetrical because I have no wish to force you to join

so, just don't make me.

Phew! how could I have missed that one?

While "tensegrity" is an interesting concept, and probably
does have something to do with how cells hang together,
that article was lacking in scientific rigor, to put 
it mildly. At one point the scientist takes a model
of, I believe, 3 sticks and 6 strings, pushes it on 
some plastic, and sees some ripples in the plastic.
This is presented as conclusive evidence that tensegrity
explains how cells work.  Good grief.

He even overstates the case for tensegrity in cells.
Humans cells, other than blood cells, generally can't
maintain their shape by themselves. They must get
some outside thing to provide most of the support
against compression.

Fix your eyes on the "l" in the word "resolution" and you can't even make out

By making people understand that it's easy and profitable.

By using one's own intelligence, intuition, creativity and critical
reflection to spread the right memes ("right memes" are those that make
people aware of their own capabilities - and once they're aware, they
should spread those memes, too)

> >Human Weaknesses

Irresponsibility - for themselves and the world around them.

Because at first sight, it looks like the path of least resistance.

Because they know that their life is really much easier if they don't
give in to irresponsibility. They prefer making their own choices
instead of letting others make decisions.

> >4. What are the consequences of these weaknesses?

Failure. Not always, but quite often irresponsibility lets people become
addicts (any sort of addiction is probably the perfect state of
irresponsibility).

> >5. How can people overcome these weaknesses?

Give them responsibility (suppose your name is King John "Government").
Basically, they just have to make that one first decision that they will
make their own decisions. They need to practice discipline a lot (that's
probably the hardest part), they need to educate themselves - more
knowledge will make decisions somewhat easier.

Actually, I think the major problem is finding out about one's
weaknesses (whatever they are) - consciously understanding what kind of
weakness one is dealing with, and consciously working on improving
oneself.

> Originally, I was only going to ask about weaknesses.

Not a good idea in my point of view - instead of looking for weaknesses,
I'd rather look for strengths. It's much easier for people to try to
improve their strengths than fighting their weaknesses. Even considering
something a "weakness" is demotivating already - if you look at the same
thing from the perspective "ok, what have we here, I can still be
somewhat better at that", you've almost got it done...

> I need to write a report on the "basic human problem."

Sounds like quite an interesting challenge - good luck!

[...]

That was a very good idea - you'll find whatever you look for. When you
look for weakness, or any "negative" things - you'll find them, and the
more you look, the more you'll find. Especially when looking at people,
this is quite tricky - personally, I tend to have quite a negative
opinion of the "general public", but the more I look for positive
things, the more I find - the more I can learn (I don't have any
interest in learning negative things).

[...]

Definitely - the more people actively spread the right memes, the
better!

Hm... same as above. If you identify the skill contrary to a weakness,
you're already half-way there...

later,

Not quite true. The human eye contains, in effect, two different imaging
systems: the fovea, and the rest of the retina. In the vicinity of the
fovea you get good colour vision and very high resolution -- it's what
you see the 'l' in 'resolution' with, and it covers a couple of degrees
(at most) of the field of view. The rest of the retina combined has
about the same number of photoreceptive cells, and covers a much wider
field; it's less sensitive to colour, much lower resolution, but is
functional in very low light levels.

I think there are some figures for visual data sensitivity in Foley, Van
Damm et al, but it's a while since I had to read that (read: since I last
had anything to do with real-time photorealistic rendering for 
simulator graphics engines). About 4kx4k pixels springs to mind ...

No; nobody has solved the problem. I assert, however, the libertarians
_should_ be interested in the issues, because if they _can_ propose a
workable solution they'll gain a lot of converts from among the (large!)
body of people who agree that the current system ain't working, who
don't like big government, but who don't think that an unrestricted
free market is the ideal answer. Otherwise, all you're going to do is
carry on preaching to the choir.

It works better than any of the known alternatives, I'll concede that
much. Question: why the hell isn't anyone looking for new, hitherto-unknown,
alternatives?

Apropos the war-against-god movie idea, I'm working on a atheistic
fantasy setting for my roleplaying group. The gods, who were rather
troublesome ("Worship, or I'll smite thee!"), were *assassinated* by a
group of clever philosophers who tricked them into accepting a
poisoned blood-sacrifice. The death of the gods wrecked the world
(things like the sun crashing down into the sea, continents were
tilted and apocalyptic similar stuff), but after a few centuries new
civilizations have sprung up in a world which is completely god-free:
there is no point with religions, since everybody *knows* the gods are
dead. Instead of religion philosophy has become the major memetic
force, influencing the politics of the various city-states deeply. It
is a bit like the Italian renaissance/4th century BC Greece. A major
theme is the struggle between reason (represented by the philosophers)
and irrationalism (represented by the dragons). I call the setting
"Philosophers & Dragons" :-)

:-) Reminds me a bit of the ideological conflicts between the
different poli in Egan's _Diaspora_: one regards physical reality as
boring and trivial, while another thinks it is dangerous to forget it
and our ties to it. In a third objects in the virtual reality can all
interpenetrate, since it would be coersion to block passage.

Which ones? You said that untreated diabetes caused lots of road
accidents, which should be impossible if the NHS was doing a good
job of treating them. You also said that there was no health 
insurance market in the UK because of the NHS.

Yes, but there's always a conflict of interest between people who
want more money than they have, and people who don't want to pay.
I don't see how this can ever be avoided.

But we don't have anything like a free market in healthcare, so
you can't claim that healthcare problems are free market failures.
For all I know, if diabetics couldn't get cheap health insurance
in a free market they would have got together and paid researchers
to find a cure. That won't happen in a controlled market.

According to what I've heard/read/seen on TV from NHS doctors
the NHS denies many treatments for those over seventy (sixty?), 
puts others on waiting lists which can last for years, and routinely
lets people die to save money. Is this good healthcare?

>(Compare

Do you really think that healthcare in the US is a free market? It's
less government controlled than the UK, but that's all.

Yep, which is one major reason why healthcare costs in America are
so much larger; when an NHS doctor would be allowing a patient to
die, US doctors will continue expensive treatment.

A free market?

I think this is wrong, since the genetic information is just the basic
rules to grow the brain, the exact structure is laid down in an
emergent fashion most likely very dependent on the environment; brain
growth creates information.

A quick and rough estimate (I can get real numbers with some effort,
but right now I'm lazy) is that there are around 2 million axons from
the eyes, around 6 million axons in the spinal cord, one million axons
in the auditory nerves and lets add one million for the rest of the
brain nerves. That makes 10 million axons of sensory information. The
normal activity for neurons lie beneath 1 KHz, so an upper bound on
the input would be 10 billion bits/s.

That makes around 10^14-10^15 bits per day, or 10 terabytes. This is
most likely a big overestimate (neural activity is sparse, there are
lots of correlations in the input etc). Over a lifetime that would be
10^18-10^19 bits. This is an upper estimate of the human capacity.

But we do not store this flood of information, in fact most of it is
quickly removed. Only the salient information is retained and
amplified in the brain, and it is from this we learn. Of course, we do
not have good figures of how much this is.

My personal estimate for the human capacity is around a bit per
synapse (based on assumptions from neural networks), there are around
10^14 synapses, making a capacity of around 10^14 bits.

That's interesting: I don't remember writing any of that. In fact,
looking back at my earlier poster, I said: "I seem to recall a recent
statement by the RAC (here in the UK) that diabetic hypoglycaemia is a
not-too-uncommon cause of auto accidents." That's a fair way -- in
quantitative terms -- from saying "untreated diabetes caused lots of
road accidents." The same goes for your other quotes: they're distortions
of what I said.

Please don't put words into my mouth. I'll try to substantiate my own
utterances, if you want to make targets of them, but I'm not going to
stand behind a straw man.

You seem to be locked into a fairly narrow way of understanding 
human relationships, then.

Look: I don't want to get bogged down in a discussion of the minutiae
of healthcare economics in 1990's USA/UK or wherever. What I'm commenting
on is, in a nutshell, the perception that the market is the _best_
way of handling resource allocation disputes. It's NOT proven to be
the _best_ way, it's just the * best _known_ way *. It has defects
which, in some circumstances, render it unworkable without external
regulation. Unless you consider industrial feudalism to be a valid
and desirable extropian future -- I don't, I'd prefer a system that
lets _everyone_ realise their maximum potential -- this means that
it's not the final answer.

I look around the extropians list and I see people -- same as it was
in 1992 -- with their eyes fixed on the stars, but their whole idea
of economic interaction is based on an uncritical acceptance of 
dogma inherited from the 1920's (and formulated to some extent as a
backlash against the then-dire threat of Soviet collectivism). This
is a weird paradox: forward-thinkers who _refuse_ to examine some
of their assumptions and try to improve on them.

I dunno. The free market _may_ be the optimal mediational method, for
all I know;  but what I see here isn't people trying to _prove_ it,
or, alternatively, trying to invent something better: what I see 
is people taking it as a forgone conclusion.

This is a blind spot. You have been notified.

Maybe I'm just dense, but I honestly don't see the difference between
the two statements:

>"diabetic hypoglycaemia is a..."

"Untreated diabetes..."

>"...not-too-uncommon cause of auto accidents"

"...causes lots of road accidents"

I'm not trying to put words into your mouth, just rephrasing what you
said. What precisely is the difference here?

>You seem to be locked into a fairly narrow way of understanding

On the contrary, I often help out friends who need money. But I strongly
resent the government stealing half my income to give to their bureaucrats
and people I don't know and will probably never meet, and that kind of
conflict will always exist when people take money by force.

This whole century has been a series of grand experiments in finding
better ways to organise a society than a free market, and they've all 
proven far worse. Noone has ever done any better, but as I've said
many times before, the great advantage of a free society is that those
who wish to try alternate ways of living can go off and set up their
own voluntary communities to test them out. If one of them turns out
to be better than a free market then you can be sure that most people
will soon join them.

Yes, shame on SciAm for popularizing such New-Agey

	I can't believe what I'm reading here!  You guys have been
seriously deluded by the irrationalist's claims about the alleged
stark/cold hideousness of rationality.  Isn't it all a false,
irrational, and completely backwards lie to insure the servivability
of irrational memes?

	First and foremost rationality seeks after the best that is
possible, whatever that is.  This is the absolute stone cold rational
fact!  Nothing can be any different, unless of course you're being
irrational.  And it's not seeking after just the best for the one
single best person, but that which is best for everyone.

	Culling, hellfire/damnation, and all that stems from some very
old and irrational religious ideas and assumptions.  False ideas like
there are a fixed set of resources to go around to each individual,
and the more people there are the less each person gets.  Or other
false, hate provoking, ideas like there is some fundamental eternal
unchangeable, unrepairable, "essence" or "soul", where all that are
less than the (single or those less than me?) best souls, must be cast
into hell or culled or whatever.

	In contrast, for an extropian, it isn't what you are (or have
done) that matters right?  It is what you can become or what you can
clean up or make up for right?  There is no culling required for the
stone cold rationalists.  Rather, the extropian wants to use her
infinite resources (or seek to obtain the required resources) to help
those that are lessor (or to pay back those that have been unjustly
wronged by her) to be at least equal to herself as they desire right?
Only this is perfect justice which is perfectly rationally compatible
with perfect mercy...

	Rationalists first and foremost want the best that is possible
and use the best possible rational means to discover and seek after
that for everyone!  Anything that deviates from this is faithless,
despairing, stone cold, irrationalism and less than the best.  It is
only the irrationalists that think they want, or think they must
accept, something less than this best possible that are the faithless
stone cold, hateful, evil ones - the ones that have been irrationally
deluded into thinking that something less than the best is really what
they want.

	*IF* "My Little Pony ethics" are the best, don't extropians
seek to find a way to achieve it perfectly for all?  If not, then we
seek after whatever is better right?  The most rational way
possible?...

Light sensitivity is irrelevant, we're talking about the amount of information 
that the brain gets from an eye in normal operating conditions. Peripheral 
vision is good for spotting motion, but it doesn't take much information to 
alert the brain of something of interest so it can turn the eye and the fovea
can get a good look at it.

That would mean we could distinguish between 16 million objects without 
moving our eye at all! The letter "l" in "resolution" just does not seem to 
me to be made of 16 million parts, something is not right. Even in the 
unlikely event that the fovea was capable of such a prodigious feat, I doubt  
it could transmit the description, and even if it could the brain is 
certainly not able to handle such a glut of information.

It's true that there are an infinite number of systems, and it's also  
true that due to a bad chip in my Quantum Computer I have been unable to 
examine each and every system individually. I have however managed to examine 
all the simple ones, and the vast majority of systems can be eliminated 
immediately because they are too complicated to be of any use.

If I want to sell something, and you want to buy, we agree on a price and 
make the exchange, end of story. It's understandable to both of us, it's 
simple, it's elegant, it works. A system that was as simple as the market and 
worked as well, would have been found by now, and as I have not heard any 
reports of this interesting development, leads me to believe that it does not 
exist. A protocol that needs 10 years of super computer time before I can buy
a can od beer is not better than the market, regardless of what it's other 
virtues may be.

Hi.

For everyone that hasn't heard yet, Netscape announced today that Navigator and Communicator 4.x are will be freely available for download from this day forward.

More interesting, they also announced that the source code for Navigator/Communicator, starting with version 5.0, will be freely available on the Internet for the taking.  It appears that Netscape wants to try a Linux-esque model for development and bug fixes on its flagship product.  


I find this to be an interesting turn of events that could only happen in an information economy.  The freely available/distributeable/modifiable source code (available end of March) gives Netscape a very good chance of trumping Microsofts slow encroachment of Netscape's market share.  Given to the developer community at large, Navigator could be whipped into a great browser a lot quicker and cheaper than Netscape could manage by themselves.  It is *highly* unlikely that Microsoft will give up control of their source, IMO.  

It will be very interesting to see what happens...

It is a hypothetical "super-meme"; what memes are to humans, kemes are
to memes. The term originated in one of Gregory Benford's novels,
_Sailing Bright Eternity_.

If your firmware (I suggest an update) happens to poopoo the act, ok. Now,
browse around:

I mean, do you like it? C'mon. Can('t) you make you love/hate it? Is this

You don't happen to mean 'morality', 'ethics', and 'right' and 'wrong'? 
Then why don't you say just that? It's downright confusing, like.

Raw and unrelenting, that's not the terms I'd use. I'd use 'sterile' and
'mythical' in that context.

What you're doing is saying: "look, we've got this existing system that
works better than any known system - perhaps there's x system that works
even better than that".  

What libertarians and libertarian extropians are saying is "look, we've
got this existing system that works better than any known system -
perhaps we should find out *why* it works, and have *more* of whatever
makes it work as well as it does."

One of the conclusions we come to from this line of thought is that the
whole "tinkering with the market" approach actually makes things *worse*
than they would be if things were left alone.

But, deeper than this, there's a certain prejudice in all this "we"
talk.  This sense of "we" is a false comfort - democracy as a false god.
 "We" aren't actually in the position of being able to design a system
>from scratch.  Your camp's having the impression that we are is (from a
libertarian point of view) part of the problem.

Concerning this from Yak Wax...

****
"Why does it repel you?  Extropy is about rational
thought, so what rational reason have you got against
human culling, genocide or general murder?  Of
course, you could argue that culling people is a bad
idea because maybe you'll accidentally kill someone
who would have been useful, etc.  But I'm talking
about the act, what I want to know is for what
rational reason does this *idea* repel you?

I ask this not just because it's a difficult
question, but because Extropy has rationality at its
core.  Now it's possible to think of rational reasons
for war, genocide, culling or anything else you care
to mention, but when a reason against it is called
for we tend to fall back on morality, ethics, and
right and wrong.  These IMHO are weak arguments
against raw and unrelenting rationality, so what
defenses do we have against someone who's taken a
very different slant on Extropy?"
****

There have been many attempts by philosophers to come
up with RATIONALLY reasons to oppose war, genocide,
murder, etc. I'm not expert enough in the subject of
philosophy (or maybe I just don't want to spend a
long time typing just now) to judge their success or
lack of success.

However, I will say that even if one of them was
successful in coming up with RATIONAL reasons for
behaving "morally", their reasons have so far failed
to be as widely disemminated as the reasons
associated with religious belief systems.

The old standby of "what you sow, so shall you reap",
can and has been restated less poetically along the
lines "Humans tend to imitate one other. Your actions
therefore influence the behavior of others. When you
behave violently, you make people angry and influence
them to do the same. In this way, violent behavior on
your part adds to a violent atmosphere in society
which injures you by making mutually-beneficial
cooperation less likely and could even ultimately
result in direct physical injury to yourself."
However, people can always find enough squirming room
in this sort of argument to rationalize major acts of
violence, basically arguing that they can commit an
act of violence and escape the negative consequences.
A lot of people find this to be a major failure on
the part of pure rationalism.


As for this from den Otter...

"Seriously...Wax has a point. Why are Star Trek (or
My Little Pony) ethics so popular with this allegedly
rational crowd? It does not compute."

I suspect that many in this crowd supplement their
extropianism with ethics from other sources.
Extropianism is probably not their whole life.


As for the use of tactics such as genocide for the
furtherance of the interests of extropians, I also am
repelled by such notions, and if they ever become
even close to commonplace in extropianism, you can
count me out.

jamesr@best.com gave us the exciting news about free netscape browsers
and source code.

	James, what is your source of this information?  I've been

Most of the news sites have picked it up by now (like wired.com) and it is on Netscape's site under their News link.  It hasn't fully percolated through the media channels yet.  Most investment/stock news sources (like quote.yahoo.com) have links to information on it when you look up Netscape (symbol NSCP).

I'm not sure, I have been looking through the appendices of _The
Physics of Immortality_, and the theorems do not seem to apply. If you
can somehow "separate" a part of spacetime and give it the right
geometry, then an omega point seems to be possible. The big problem is
how to do this; just adding together a lot of mass will create a mere
black hole, which has the wrong internal geometry to act as an omega
point (the singularity is spacelike but extended to an infalling
observer, so you cannot communicate indefinitely as it is
approached). How to make a topology that looks like a closed universe?

I think you can extract a diverging amount of energy from the shear,
but it doesn't seem to diverge fast enough.

Yak Wax wrote: "Extropy is about rational thought."

Actually, Extropy is about making life more complex, intelligent,
powerful and full of more opportunity.  Rational thought is simply a tool
that Extropians use, when appropriate, to achieve their goals of
increasing extropy in the world.

Yak Wax goes on to question what rational reason there is against "human
culling, genocide or general murder".  At the core, this is simply a
question about the merits of various courses of action.  We have a huge
number of options available to us every day.  Many of those options
include killing other people and hurting other people as well as helping
other people or ignoring other people or whatever.  To evaluate the
merits of these options they must be considered in terms of one's short
and long-term goals.  If someone's goal in life is to kill as many people
as possible, then it is rational for them to do things which result in
the death of many people.  If one's goal is to help as many people as
possible live as long as possible, it would be rational to take action
which results in that goal.  Whether an action is rational or not depends
on the goals of the one choosing.

Rationality, by itself, with no goal-oriented context, says nothing about
what courses of action we "should" take.  However, Extropians have the
goal of increasing extropy in the world, and even though "extropy" is
somewhat vaguely defined, many types of actions, especially ones which
destroy intelligent systems or impede the progress of life into more
intelligence and complexity, are considered non-extropian, and it would
be irrational for an Extropian to carry out these actions or make them
significantly more likely to occur.  Entropic decisions are irrational
*only* because they conflict with their goal of increasing extropy.

Rationality can be used to evaluate decisions in terms of goals, but it
cannot generate the goals themselves.

No system of ethics is rational *in and of itself*; however if a system
of ethics consistently guides the actions of an extropian to make more
extropy in the world, then it is rational *for that particular person* to
follow *that particular ethical system*.  It is unlikely that there is a
"one best" ethical system that is rational for everyone to follow.  The
only way this could be so is if every person had the same goals.

For the rational, morality and ethics are simply behavioral strategies
for accomplishing their goals in a world of other people.  If your way of
treating others consistently gets you what you want, then your personal
systems of morality and ethics is rational *for you*.

We don't agree on this. Off course they are hard pressed by Microsoft.
But I think that somebody at Netscape understands netwoerk economy, and

Surely, since memetic reproduction of information exists, an ecology must
also exist there.  It's a well-greased surface on which information can
slide around and interact with other information, at least as compared to 
genetics.

But what does this creature eat?  Hmmn...  It must secrete waste products, 
also.  I think it eats plants, since meat is grown from plants...  But it 
put the plants (farms) there as part of its own system.  It also eats land 
(mining, building, etc).  So, it runs on sunlight and eats land.

It's a plant!  Plants are smarter than humans after all!

I think it secretes television as a waste product.

In response to: Eugene Leitl <eugene@liposome.genebee.msu.su>, M. E. Smith
<mesmith@rocketmail.com> and Brent Allsop <allsop@swttools.fc.hp.com>

Rational means (to me) that you neither promote, or seek, genocide, 
coercion etc, but you don't *automatically* reject them either. There
are no "good" or "evil" actions, just tools that help you to survive
and prosper. Sometimes the smart thing to do might be helping others,
sometimes it means damaging them. A "rational" person/animal/being
is *opportunistic*, and not bound by any rules that don't help to maximize
his success. Of course, IRL such an entity would probably (and duely?) be 
called an "asshole" by most people.

You can have (sub) societies based on this principle, in theory at least.
A good example would be the group of vampires from "Intervieuw with a (the?)
Vampire" (the movie). These folks have only one rule: you are not allowed
to kill (or otherwise damage, I suppose) one of your own kind. Offenders are
executed. What you do to outsiders is irrelevant (as long as it doesn't somehow
harm members of your own group). This is the core of any rational society: a social 
contract for mutual benefit, which includes non-agression within the group itself. 
This sounds almost libertarian, doesn't it. IMO this is about as close as you can 
get to "pure rationality".

My original remark:

> Seriously...Wax has a point. Why are Star Trek (or My Little Pony)

See, the very mild, sometimes even altruistic, "vibe" on the list is in no
way what one (I) would call "rational" (unless faked, in which case it would
be very rational indeed). It is seems to be in sharp contrast with the (otherwise) 
no-BS (classically rational) approach of extropianism. That's all. I'm not 
endorsing genocide or otherwise nasty behaviour, just a bit puzzled by this
apparent contradiction.

Love & peace to all ;-)

A keme is a stupid typo of mine.  I meant to write `kene', which is a
borrowing from Gregory Benford's Galactic Center sequence of sf novels.  In
SAILING BRIGHT ETERNITY,  we are told:

`Memes evolved in turn far faster than genes.  Brains are easier to infest
than DNA.

`The organized constellation of information in computers were *kenes* -
from *ken*, to know.

`[...] Kenes evolved faster than memes.  Soon, they learned to leave even
the substrate of silicon.  Ordered, replicating data propagated beyond its
*in silico* origins.  Rather than matter, it sought out fields - electric,
magnetic, even gravitational.'  And so on.

And then there are *datavores* - `these use the energy equivalence of
information... Predators do not propagate memes; they feed upon them.'

I suspect a link with Greg Bear's *evolvons*, which are Son-of-Computer-Virus.

I visited a lab at Princeton in 1996 where work was being done on imagery;
I believe I recall their estimate of the retina's total receptivity as
being about a million pixels.  Obviously much of that is peripheral.  (I
just had a quick flip through Zeki but couldn't find the exact data.)

A complete and unrestricted free market with property rights IS a 
solution to this.

However, there are a few potential practical problems in implementing 
such a system.  Those problems are mostly of the sort of "how do you 
define, recognise, and enforce property rights to..."

A few examples:

 * clean air -- which gets blown all over the place
 * water -- which flows, in most cases eventually into the ocean
 * wild creatures, most particularly mobile sea creatures (e.g. fish)

The development of economics generally has been a process of 
internalizing costs and benefits -- that is, making sure that the 
person who makes the decision reaps the benefits *and* pays the 
consequences.  The end of slavery (not just chattel slavery, but also 
feudual serfdom) internalized the tradeoff between more leisure and 
more labor, between taking it easy and working hard&smart.  The 
enclosure movement internalized the cost of damage to the land.  
Every instance of a cost being internalized has been followed by a 
general increase in prosperity.  We haven't finished these increases 
in prosperity, but we really do need to be internalizing the cost of 
pollution (and right now, with current environmental laws, government 
is the single biggest obstacle to that process).

I have the right to dump garbage on my land, as long as it doesn't 
threaten or damage the neighbors.  I should have an equal right to 
dump garbage into the air over my land.  At the same time, I don't 
have the right to dump garbage on my neighbor's land, and I shouldn't 
have the right to dump garbage into the air over my neighbor's 
land.

Right now, either I am punished for dumping garbage into the air over 
my land, without regard to its impact on the neighbors (and the 
neighbors get no compensation for any negative impact); or I am 
granted the privilege of dumping garbage into the air over my 
neighbor's land (with no compensation to the neighbors); and it is 
the government that decides.

Look at what the relatively unsuccessful systems have in common: 
concentration of political power, as compared to the successful 
systems.

But if political power is not concentrated, what people actually do 
is free-market capitalism.

You cannot ENFORCE any alternative to free-market capitalism, except 
by means that are already known to be worse than free-market 
capitalism.  And if you don't enforce the alternative, you won't get 
the alternative.

There's always a conflict between two people who want to use the same

Exchange is a way of bringing these conflicting desires into harmony.

By its very nature, the NHS will inevitably be oversubscribed (and
a Public Choice economist might say it's inevitably underfunded).

That's largely an artifact of WW2 wage controls, strangely enough.
Employers forbidden to raise wages tried sweetening the deal by
throwing in benefits like medical insurance; eventually this was
made tax-exempt, which meant that job-tied insurance was suddenly
far cheaper than private insurance, which meant that the whole
medical industry was soon geared to job-tied insurance, which is
a stupidly brittle way to run it.

(There are sporadic attempts to level the field, and thus open it,
with such devices as tax-exempt medical savings accounts; I gather
that bills to this effect usually fade under cries of "tax giveaways
for the rich!", but the idea isn't going away.)

Burden the system further with rules mandating, for example, that I
can't get medical insurance that does *not* cover drug addiction rehab
(surely after thirty-odd years I should have a good idea whether or not
I'm at risk?), or that private insurers *must* give premium discounts
for X but must *not* take Y into account -- and it's no wonder that
the insurance market is a mare's nest.

And then of course there are the byzantine Medicare rules, under which
physicians big-hearted enough to accept Medicare patients spend hours
on paperwork to get paid a fraction of their normal fee ...

And now we hear the government announce that there are too many doctors!

It's the entire eye that does this, although the fovea can do some 
rather prodigious feats.  Some people can reliable identify faces
at a mile away - that would be quite a whopper of a resolution.

In terms of whole-eye function.  I know one guy who can read an entire page
without moving his eye.  I didn't believe it when I first saw it,
but he had read the page I handed him, and he'd never read it before
as I'd just written it.

The brain is quite capable of it.  It has about 1 billion neurons with
several trillion synapses devoted to just that function.

The "vibe" seems pretty rational to me. One could propose that the
primary purpose of any living entity is to increase extropy. By killing
other conscious entities for material or other forms of gain, the net
"extropic content" of the universe is decreased. Personally, I think it
_is_ possible to make a tight link between personal ethics and
"rational" thought.

We can begin with a system that does not take any more from any

Not true. The nervous system is noisy, so successive states

this factor.

50 gigs/day is waaay too large. Some estimates are about 1 bit/sec
of non redundant information - a CDROM can hold a lifetime at this
data rate.

Another approach is to count the number of possible brain states.
Like kinetic gas theory, the important number is the number of

Anyone care to estimate these??

This is perhaps a bit courageous, perhaps a bit desperate, but
also inevitable.  The age of proprietary software is over; the
dominance of copyright is dead.  This is merely the first in what
will become the new model of software distribution: the popular
stuff is free, and serves to advertise your customized, limited-
market, and service products.  Creative talent and technical
expertise is the product, and with the instant distribution and
duplication and open competition of the Net, it will be impossible
for any company to sit on its ass /after/ development and rake in
cash for yesterday's work.

Anyone care to take bets on how long it will be before Word and
Excel are free?  My money is on sometime before 2002.

Though I am not surprized by the move, I'm shocked that it was
actually Netscape Corporation who managed to do something right.
Of course, they probably don't realize it, and will probably
cling like drowning rats to the old model on all their other
products, but I suppose there is hope.

Dead right it isn't; becuase the letter "l" is fairly simple. Instead,
try looking at a very high-resolution true-colour image of the
Mandelbrot set. You can fit it inside the 2% or so of your visual
field that the fovea covers, and you'll see a lot more detail on it
than that nice courier-medium letter "l" on your terminal ;-)

The fovea handles about 50% of the sensory bandwidth of the entire
retina, if I remember correctly. The rest isn't just "motion sensors",
but it's not far off. (You can get an idea of this by wandering around
in the near-total dark; the cones in your fovea are no use in low light
levels, so you're reduced to using your peripheral vision (mostly rods).

Minor point: even insulin-dependent diabetics who receive treatment
are prone to occasionally losing track of their blood glucose level
and going hypo. You can be receiving treatment and still screw up --
that's all.

The real linguistic mangling is in this one:

Lots.   The  two statements are not equivalent, because one effectively
asserts "there are lots of accidents" and the other boils down to "of
those accidents that happen, many are caused by ..."

I will agree that the overt experiments -- fascism, communism -- were
disastrous. But I assert that nobody has tried a 100% free market,
either; while markets exist, they're all controlled. And those attempts
at finding better ways to organise society haven't exhausted the
space of possible solutions -- they haven't even scratched the surface!

What about network externalities? How do you test a new system for 
viability within the scope of an existing system?

Yes. Top-down control doesn't work well, except in situations where there's
a clearly-defined goal to work towards -- which is not a characteristic of
society at large.

Er, yeah. And what's the goal of most of the participants? (Could it
be, by any chance, the centralization of power? If for no other
reason than the sentiment expressed in the old adage about shit sandwiches.)

On the contrary. Why do people try to wheel and deal? Nobody holds a gun
to their heads and says "you're gonna be a good capitalist todauy, boy,
or I'm sending you to the People's Number Four Holiday Camp for
re-education in Proper Corporate Behaviour," do they?  (Well, actually
they _do_, in this here wonderful country -- the UK -- or at least
that's what the government seems to be trying to do. But that's a rant
of a different stripe ...) No: the reason people try to engage in
free-market exchanges is because those exhanges seem to be beneficial to
them. And usually they are, although this ain't invariably the case if
one of the parties to the transaction is determined to rip off the
other.

This last point is important. You can argue until you're blue in the
face that a free market is best, but unless you can ensure that it
_stays_ a free market -- and functions properly, without abuse by the
participants -- then you've got problems. (I classify as 'abuse'
activities where one participant defrauds, suckers, or otherwise
exploits another without their willing connivance. This includes 
attempts to establish a monopoly or manipulate the market itself 
in order to skew the 'level playing field'. Any problems with this 
working definition?)

Now, as someone else pointed out here recently:

	People are stooopid.

Most people are bad as assessing risks. They tend to value short-term
limited gain over long-term benefits. They view disastrous but rare
risks as being more dangerous than smaller-scale but more common risks
(for example, airliner crashes against car crashes).

It's usually in your best interests to cooperate with other people,
assuming they don't defect; but most people can be tempted into
defecting by a prospect of short-term gain. This leads to the problem of
common goods;   areas where it's in your interests if everyone else
cooperates, but where it's also in your interests to defect.

A pure market system doesn't recognize most commons because they don't 
have any component that's amenable to trade. If you introduce something
that can be traded -- say, air polution permits that lets you emit CO2 --
well, you can apply market economics to a commons problem (in this case,
air polution). But to do so you've had to dilute the purity of essence
of your market by essentially imposing a control on polution (that forces
people to buy polution permits before they can emit CO2). Ergo, a
big problem. Markets can't work in a vacuum ...

Let's see, there are around 10^11 neurons, and assuming each neuron
can be in two states (this is a big and uncertain assumption; it might
be better to say they can be in N different states, where N could be
large) there are 2^10^11 possible brain states. 

If we regard a cortical column as the smallest unit of cognition, and
that differences in activations of cortical columns are what is
important, then there will be on the order of 2^10^9 possible
distinguishable brain states (assuming a binary activation of the
columns; very doubtful).

(the log of the ratio between these estimates gives an entropy of
10^11 bits or so; we can obviously stand plenty of noise)

There are other arguments in favour of a rational basis for personal
ethics. Let's start by assuming  that everyone wants to optimize their
own prospects in social or market exchanges. On that basis, we can
consider life as a rather more complex version of a classic iterated
prisoner's dilemma. To recap: if two people cooperate, they get a small
payoff. If one cooperates and the other defects, the defector gets a
small payoff and the cooperator is stung. If both defect, they both get
stung. Now make this a repeating situation, where both players can
remember the other's previous behaviour: it turns out that the optimal
strategy is to always cooperate _unless_ in the last round the other
player stabbed you in the back. But don't hold grudges -- if they
start cooperating again, follow their example.

Apply this principle in general and you get something not unlike the
"golden rule"; do unto others what you'd like them to do until you (but
don't turn the other cheek if they spit in your eye).

Is it rational to want to base your ethics on a game-theoretical
approach to maximizing prosperity?

All systems except the market depend on granting extensive powers to
others...only the market system leaves me and other individuals free.   There is
no effective way know to grant extensive powers to others without subjecting
oneself to extensive exploitation.  Of course, we live in an extremely hampered
market system rife with exploitation and only a small amount of market wiggle
room.

I don't expect Microsoft to survive (in current form, at least). To
quote shamelessly and at length from one of http://slashdot.org/ 's
contributors (in turn quoting someone else):

-- snip --
Thought you all might like this:

One Microsoft executive called Netscape's move to make the Navigator
source code widely available "odd." Sam Jadallah, vice president of
Microsoft's Organization Customer Unit, said, "Consumers want to know
what they are getting. They like one version. They want to know a
McDonald's hamburger is a McDonald's hamburger wherever they go."
Jadallah also noted that, "Whenever source code is out and gets
distributed, things can get fragmented. That's what happened with Unix
and Linux."

The beauty of Netscape's move is that Microsoft probably can't
comprehend it.

-- snip --

Microsoft is close to being a monopoly, insofar as they have such a
death-grip on the corporate desktop that all the application
developers have to develop for their products. GPLing Microsoft
code would relinquish this. Have you ever known a monopoly to
reform itself from the inside, willingly?

_The Wealth of Nations_ was published in 1776, Charlie. Not that being 
formulated in the 1920's or being anti-Communist is necessarily a
disqualifier for an idea. Hell of a lot of good ideas are from the 
20's, are anti-Communist, or both.

Oh, now the members of the list are tasked with advancing the state
of the art in economics. Do we even have an economist on the list
anymore? Or anyone who can speak for the field? I was under the 
impression that there were "proofs," to the extent economics supports 
such, of optimality of free markets. 

You're suffering from a dislocated onus here. The evidence of failure
of non-free-market solutions is abundant. Yes, there *may* be a method
of computing something more optimal, under some set of assumptions, in
some cases. There could even be a general method that allocates costs
incrementally better than a free market (I suspect you'd have to 
start with some definitions of optimality that assume what you're 
trying to prove, though). There's not even a candidate idea, after all 
the statist schemes that have been tried. Without at least the germ of 
a workable idea, you're asking us to look for a chimera.

One reason this whole conflict of ideas is chronic and irreducible is 
the limits of economics itself. Simplest example I've seen of that is 
that in the healthcare discussion, whatever scheme we work under 
implicitly assigns some cash value to a human life, whereas we all like 
to think of our lives as infinitely valuable. Also, different people 
put different values on freedom, or come into the discussion with all 
kinds of dysfunctional memes like "the rights of society" or "the duty 
of altruism."

"Intangibles", also, are by definition hard to quantify. You just have
to leave every actor in charge of his or her own valuations of them,
with exceptions (e.g., goodwill is intangible but people often agree
on a specific value for it).

Taking a quick leap here, at the risk of being critical without having 
the data to back it up, I also suspect that different economic axioms 
lead economists to collect and interpret data differently. I would not 
be surprised to find some detailed criticism of the field along these 
lines. Maybe a paper from the 20's ?<G>.

In the meantime, as others have said, the free market is simple, works 
extremely well, and the alternatives by definition require coercion.

You realize how deeply funny this is, at least two different ways,  when
viewed in a certain light, don't you? :)

BTW, although my own path was different, I have no bone to pick with your
specific approach; I have some additional suggestions you might find
worthwhile, or maybe not. Next time we're f2f, perhaps we can discuss...

To riff on for a moment:

The whole issue of personal self-determination is a strange field (or, in
Hofstadter's term, a strange loop).

A big part of that strange loop, for someone who comes to appreciate the
N.A.P. (whether you capitalize Nonaggression Principle or not) is to
apprehend for oneself, at a deep level, that coercion is, given your
setting and goals, suboptimal *and* that better, effective alternatives
exist. 

Examine each phrase there carefully. There are traps. The above is
necessary, but not sufficient--as a big ferinstance, if the alternatives
don't actually exist, you're lying to yourself/being lied to, which is
functionally crazy. And of course _coercing people to believe in
noncoercion_ is bogus, and also directly leads to functional crazy.

Now, it may be "impossible" for some people to apprehend that coercion is
suboptimal given their settings and goals. 
And it may be verging on impossible for disparate cultures to agree on what
constitutes coercion. 
Those are toughies. 

Further, I keep harping on the not-very-subtext of Axelrod's _Evolution of
Cooperation_, too, the biggest parts of which are rough parity among
participants, punishment/negative consequences that *matter*, and no
certainty that this will be your only/last interaction. None of these go
without saying, and yet a lot of Axelrod-fanciers seem to put them aside.
In my view, they have to be placed squarely on the table.

IMHO, a lot of the "for your own good" people really haven't examined their
own lives properly. Some did it once and never checked up and wandered off
into the cornfields trailing paying customers. I do not name Ron or Werner
here. :)

I think these last three paras of mine relate to:

>Typically the people who think that psychotherapy is good (for everyone
>else), or that things should be such and so a way (for your own good), are
>usually motivated out of the best of intentions, and feel that they are
>somehow annointed to do so, no matter how conservative or liberal those

>Native Americans, for the same reason the Kennedy's are always in politics,
>for the same reason Lenin and Stalin did their deeds, and for the same reason
>religious nuts bomb abortion clinics, and Hillary tries to push health care
>'reform' on us.

My favorite reframing of much of this is "You can't trust
<people/yourself>, but you can trust MEEEeeeeee."

>> Any ideas how to practically do this?  Self help books? (_Controlling
>> Coercion_: How Coercive Behavior is Self-Defeating)?  Lots of Internet
>> sites on the subject, with lots of information on how to eliminate
>> coercive behavior in oneself?  TV documentaries?  Popularizing discussion
>> of coercion?

Fostering "the lights going on" is a toughie. Cults get started that way.
:) :)

Given what I said above, it's what is technically termed a "wicked"
problem. It's crying out for solution, but it's a minefield of local
maxima--what I call "payoff traps"--plus history, hormones and strange
attractors.

I try to talk it and walk it, and am refining my ability to tell when the
lights are on in other people. 

I try to maximize the payoff for others I know for whom the lights are on. 

Is this an ivory tower, ghettoization, or freedom of association? :)

I'm curious how China is dealing with the Asian Market Flu. Did they cause
it to discredit free markets? Will they use it to justify more control in
Hong Kong? Has the level of international money basically voting with its
dollars on the asian concept of a "different, asian form of human rights"
showed that their arrogance is misplaced?

Certainly their current military modernization program is ominous, but they
haven't really done much in blatant agression in a long time, with the

The population control program in China is having the effect of a much
larger percentage of the population being born as males. Sociologists have
commented in the past on the relative levels of agression of societies with
balanced versus imbalanced populations of genders. I wonding if having so
many frustrated males in the population 20-30 years from now will wind up
with a much more militarist regieme coming to power.

Take a look in the archives for Greg Burch's posting about confucian
capitalism for one angle.

What sociologists and what societies? As far as I know, there have not
been that many societies with imbalanced populations of genders
(possibly in some of the smaller arabian states: I have read somewhere
that a significant fraction of the girls were in the harem at some
points in history; this might be apocryphal though).

Is frustrated males a significant factor in militarism? Could they not
also be a source for subversion or major-scale sublimation?

One thing that has some people worried is China becoming a huge
consumerist nation.  If the Chinese decide to adopt
a predominately meat diet and a large percentage of them decide to start
driving cars, then the impact on the environment may be a little messy. 
A story I read in Business Week said an automobile-centered Chinese
society would suck up most of the world's oil, or something close to
it.  I haven't put any math to it, so this is just anecdote.

      John K Clark writes eloquently, and well:

      This is true, but it also completely begs the question of how 
      _either_ of you come to own anything in the first place.  No-one has 
      ever provided a satisfying explanation of how a person comes to 
      'own' a given piece of land from a state of nature.  The 
      'labour-mixing' argument doesn't hold water.  Why is your labour not 
      just wasted effort?  The 'resources-mixing' argument begs the first 
      question, and fails Nozick's test of why -- if you pour a can of 
      beer into the Pacific -- you haven't just wasted 'your' beer, 
      instead of acquiring a part-share in the Pacific!  >:-}

      There is a legal maxim: "Non Dat Quod Non Habet" (you cannot give 
      what you do not have).  97% of American land is owned by around 3% 
      of the population, or so I understand.  Wonder why there's this wild 
      skew?  It bears looking into.  Look back far enough, and you find 
      something pretty questionable (or outright predatory).  Partial land 
      rights in 80% of Australia are presently being awarded to 
      Aboriginals by the Australian civil courts.  The politicians are 
      threatening revocation.

      Next problem: As the Austrian Economists tell us, catallaxies (or 
      economic games) are abstract 'Wertfrei' systems capapble of 
      configuration in a myriad ways.  How do we decide on which 
      _particular_ catallaxy is operative?   You're no better off with 
      'Chicago School' reasoning either: Milton Friedman points out that 
      property rights _cannot_ be ontological; and are ineluctably _agreed 
      conventions_.  How do you handle problems of unequal bargaining 
      powers?  Coerced 'consent'?
      
      You would surely counsel any player in the economic game to seek the 
      best deal possible for their consent to any _particular_ game taking 
      place, wouldn't you?  Remember Lee Marvin and Toshio Mifune in 'Hell 
      in the Pacific'?  A lovely and illuminating movie, with Marvin as a 
      coarse, predatory G.I.; and Mifune as a refined, gratification 
      delaying Japanese hunter-gatherer and producer. They're shipwrecked 
      together on a Pacific island in WWII.  Marvin can always screw up 
      Mifune's hunting, gathering and production unless given his 'share' 
      in the 'take'.  A 'modus vivendi' must somehow be reached, or 
      pre-emptive 'race-to-kill-first' rules come into play.


      A fair part of your body was once part of other peoples' bodies.  If 
      their heirs could prove this, should you give the 'pound of flesh' 
      back?  Even if you _could_?

      
      The LeFevrian Agorist Objection: How, precisely, do you assert 
      'your' exclusive property claim to _anything_, without threatening 
      to initiate _violence_ againt a non-violent 'intruder'?  Rather as 
      the white Australian farmers did against the nomadic 'Abos.'  When I 
      lived in Australia, attending Geelong Grammar School, I used to hear 
      stories of armed 'Abo' hunts at week-ends, and bowls of 'free' 
      poisoned porridge placed conveniently near fences...  The 'Abos' 
      couldn't get it through their thick heads that the settlers believed 
      _they_ owned all the -- 'Terra Nullius' -- land now.  And all those 
      tasty woolly white animals wandering around all over it...

      You see the problem?


      Rather than engage in a fruitless search for 'ontological' property 
      rights, isn't it better to offer people this deal?
      
      "Let's choose the (Pareto-optimal?) catallaxy together; and agree 
      shares in the output; and that way, we _all_ gain from selecting the 
      most productive, rights-enhancing system."

      This becomes especially important as the classical-liberal model of 
      economic participation fails, as intelligent machines pre-empt even 
      the dollar-a-day penns, Lao-Gai slaves and Asian sweatshop 
      labourers. If we are to preserve the priceless (!) core values of 
      classical liberalism (and I hope we do!), we have to adapt our 
      vector-driven catallactic economic systems to the 21st Century.
      
      Most people cannot hope to play the economic game and win against 
      intelligent machines; any more than World Champion Garry Kasparov 
      can make a living playing chess against chess computers for piece 
      rates.  That way lies the Marxian madness of fewer and fewer 
      capitalists immiserating a greater and greater number of everyday 
      people.  Here, we had the goddamn Norman invaders stealing 
      everything from the indigenous Saxons, Celts, Angles etc., 
      destroyingtheir free ways of life, and subjugating them.  

      A thousand years later, and the Norman bastards (or rather, their 
      bastard descendants) still have around 90% of all the land and all 
      the money and all the power, and are overdue for expropriation.
      
      Or do you rather want us to find a fine future in our -- feudal -- 
      past?  >:-}

This is very widespread idea, but there is something wrong with it. If
all chinese used cars, then they would not afford gasoline - or they
would have to find a cheaper substitute. Overall I think this fear is
based on linear extrapolation: if we have a certain standard of living
producing a certain level of pollution, then if X times us chinese
have the same standard they will produce X times as much
pollution. The fallacy is the assumption that they develop *identical*
systems, without learning anything from mistakes and without trying to
improve them.

"But Grog, if there really will be *millions* of people in the future
as you say, then there won't be enough caves, and their cooking-fires
will produce so much smoke that it will cause a new ice age."

This seems unlikely, the chinese seem to be quite good at modifying
foreign ideas for their own use. Advanced technology as a rule is less
polluting than less advanced, so it would be a good thing
environmentally speaking to encourage the chinese to use the most
efficient methods available, giving/selling them our know-how.

I'm not sure exactly. I've heard this several times in the past (so I'm sure its
true ;) ) but I'll have to check up on it. I think some of it was to do with some
african societies having gender imbalances that caused eras of increased tribal
strife.

That is the mechanism. For the establishment to respond effectively to the
threat, they must institute a harsh regeime, with heavy nationalist/militarist
tones to it to keep the subversive forces in check.. (Japan 1880-1945 comes to
mind as an example, as well as possibly the whole samurai era.)

The more Chines that are getting rich and well educated, the more people
will be able to help with this planets troubles.

THing is, if they changed over to an oil energy infrastructure, they'd
probably be polluting less than they are now. Their current coal energy
industry burns the dirtiest coal in the world, stuff that would be out and
out illegal in most other countries, though of course, their CO2 emissions
would go up, but everything else would be lower. Between the Yangtse Valley
project and new nukes coming online, though, I expect that they will most
likely focus on non fossil sources for new energy needs.

This would be great in an ideal world.  But, look who is trying to sell
the Chinese the infrastructure.
It seems to be the same folks who have hugely vested interest in the
status quo.  I only follow this subject
in the detail provided by the likes of Business Week.  But, I believe
this could be problematic; despite it
being linear extropolation.  It certainly would be nice if it were not
so.

It isn't at all hard to come up with a system that works better in 
theory than free market capitalism works in reality.

The problem is in implementing the theory.  Every such system I have 
seen works great if the average joe on the street is omniscient and 
omnibenevolent (omnipotent is not required), or if a sufficient 
number of such people exist along with a 100% reliable method of 
selecting them for management positions.

(I want to mention that in such an environment, free-market 
capitalism also works really well.)

Unfortunately, we don't operate in such an environment.

Free-market capitalism survives mistakes better than any other system 
yet tried to the same degree of purity.  This is largely because it 
inherently contains rigorous, constant, automatic (but not 
necessarily fast -- oh well) correction mechanisms that are firmly 
rooted in human nature.  (There are other reasons, but that's the 
biggest and most essential one.)  

Therefore, in evaluating the 
applicability of any new proposal for the arrangement of an economic 
system, we can begin by looking for equivalent correction mechanisms; 
if we don't find them, we can (assuming strictly logical 
debate) discard that proposal without further consideration.

Socialism fails and should be discarded.  Unfortunately the debate is 
*not* strictly logical, so we must continue.

Next we look at the source of growth, and we find that it lies 
overwhelmingly in individuals acting for their own profit -- however 
those individuals may define profit.  So if a proposed economic 
system is intended to provide growth -- a wonderful idea unless you 
intend the population to remain stable or shrink and further have 
protection against natural disasters so you never have to rebuild 
anything -- we look for ways that individuals can act for their own 
profit.  If these are nonexistent or insignificant, then the proposal 
fails.

Socialism fails and should be discarded.

And third we look at how it happens that people do what the system 
says they should do.  Free-market capitalism says people should 
decide for themselves what to do.  Even if one slavishly follows some 
economic or spiritual guru, one has chosen for oneself to do so.  No 
problem.  All other systems require that people be persuaded or 
coerced, and the cost of this persuasion or coercion -- combined with 
the fact that neither the persuasion nor the coercion nor any 
combination of the two will be 100% successful -- is a drag on the 
system.

Socialism has the problem that those who don't do as the system 
commands, come to possess more resources per capita than those who 
do.  This means that persuasion will be of decreasing value, and 
coercion will require an increasing fraction of the 
resources possessed by those who behave as socialism demands.  So 
again socialism as a system fails and not only should, but inevitably 
will, be discarded.

Note: this does *not* address a *voluntary* socialist enclave in a 
free-market capitalist system.  Such enclaves can be reasonably 
stable and reasonably successful.

Given the amply-demonstrated advantages of a system of individual 
ownership over all the alternatives man has yet come up with, the 
only pragmatic reason for wondering about the origin of ownership is 
to assist in devising reasonable means of transferring all 
currently-unowned resources to individuals.

I can easily prove that you understand incorrectly.

That leaves only 3% of the land owned by anyone other than those 3% 
of the population.

Government-owned land in states whose names begin with the letter A, 
amounts to more than 3% of the land in the US.  If you restrict 
consideration to the 48 contiguous states, you may have to add states 
whose names begin with C.

The biggest problem I see with conspiracy theories is that the 
conspirators seem to be so incredibly (and I mean that literally) 
good at predicting not only direct effects, but also second- and 
third-order effects of their actions, and at choosing the actions 
that will produce the desired effects.

Such people, if they actually exist, will take over the world whether 
they conspire together to do so or not.

My opinion of what we would find in real-world conspirators is more 
accurately summarized by Michael Flynn's book "In the Country of the 
Blind".

What relevance does transhumanity have in a future where the strong AI
hypothesis turns out to be true?  The intuitive answers appears to be "very
little".  To the extent that we can create artificial minds that are more
intelligent that the human mind, transhumanity would appear to have the same
significance in such a world as trans-raccoonism has today.

We do not discuss trans-raccoonism that much since even a transraccoon would
still be less intelligent than a human.  Put another way, in terms of future
boundaries of possibilities it makes sense only to concentrate attention on the
group that would possess the highest level of intelligence.  In a weak AI
future, that group very well could be transhumans.  However, in a strong AI
world it appears highly probably that some nonhuman nonbiological group would
be at the top of the intelligence "heap".

A fair amount of discourse exists concerning what such ultra-intelligent
artificial minds would "do" with humans (or transhumans for that matter).  Some
scenarios have humans being discarded but allowed to exist.  The scenario I
consider more probable would be the eventual eclipse of humanity.  This
scenario is based on several assumptions about the nature of superintellgient
nonhuman entities which I will not go into here.

I submit that such discourse is irrelevant.  Does it matter what happens to
humanity in a strong AI future?  The raccoon example serves as a useful
parallel.  Is there significant (or any) discourse on the fate of raccoons (or
any nonhuman biological lifeform) in a transhuman future (regardless of the
variation)?  Not that I am aware of.  Why?  Its irrelevant.  What does it
matter what happens to raccoons in the future?

Following the consequences of a strong AI future leads me to believe that
transhumanity and the very fate of humanity (and transhumanity) will become
irrelevant.  After a cursory review of this conclusion I do not see any way to
avoid this conclusion.   We have moved from a geocentric to heliocentric to
baryonic to anthropic view of the universe.  Our own universe may not even be
that big of a deal, one of a virtual infinity of universes.  Now it seems, that
in a future where the strong AI hypothesis holds true, that humanity is
irrelevant.  Though I would rather not sound melodramatic (maybe its too late
for that) it appears rueful that we would have the ability to fathom our own
irrelevance.

I invite others views on such a future and ways in which humanity
(transhumanity) can maintain relevance.  Then again, is "relevance" such a
noble goal in the first place?

I just had a thought with regards to your CO2 example.

What if companies were required to clean up their waste (in this case CO2)
by purchasing/creating forested land that can convert their equivalent CO2
output into clean air?  Granted it would be more expensive than just
polluting, but it would be an interesting way to handle industrial
pollutants.  This is already done to some extent in the timber industry
through reforestation.  A system like this could be applied to a great many
industries and would go a long way towards protecting "public goods" by
enforcing a zero-sum usage policy.

I already see some obvious flaws in this, but it could be a step in the
right direction in some industries.  Instead of purchasing the "right" to
pollute from the government, many people would be better off if industry
returned public goods in the condition they obtained them in.

Now, I know this isn't the most directly "extropian" topic... In many ways 
what the U.S. President does or doesn't do is irrelevant...

<RANT>

Am I the only one pissed off by the apparent fact that so many
people want to hang him if it turns out he had an affair?  I mean, come on! I
saw one quote from one of the lawyers who, while not rushing to judgement about
the veracity of the claims, said that if the claims were true, it would mean
that the president is a misogynist.

On what planet?

Did anyone else ever see an obscure movie called "Eating the Rich"?  Among a
variety of strange plotlines, there is the story of a high-ranking Government
Official who gets trapped in a sex scandal based on having had an extramarital
affair.  The person who sets him up hopes, of course, that this will ruin the 
Official and force him from office.  Except in that story, the trap backfires.
The Official's popularity soars like never before, as the Tabloids run story 
after story about how the Official "gets his little bit on the side."

I've always loved that line, and wish it were more like that in this country.
Does anyone, in this day and age, actually believe that a guy like Clinton is 
a wife-loving family man?  That he could possibly resist the allure of 
sex brought by the mystique of being powerful?  Of course not. 

But once it's out in the open, well, then we'd better hang him, eh?

Fist, a semantic quibble: I think you misuse the term strong AI to
mean "superintelligent AI". The term already has a standard use in
discussions about AI where the strong AI hypothesis refers to the idea
that artificial intelligence is possible and implementable.

BTW, this is yet another incarnation of an old debate. Look in the
archives for more.

I don't trust intuitive answers. I think you have fallen for what I
sometimes call the "cult of superintelligence": the entity that is
most intelligent will by necessity run the show. It is by no mean
obvious that this is true, even on earth today there are plenty of
species that couldn't care less about the doings of humans unless we
start to mess up the biosphere *strongly*. And it is not inconceivable
with superintelligent AI programmed or convinced to behave in a
humanocentric fashion, much weirder motivations and value systems are
possible.

I think this is a mistake. One should concentrate on the group or
groups that have the most influence on events, regardless of their
intelligence level. Of course, SI makes a very likely candidate for
this, but one should not blithely assume that just because an AI is
superintelligent it would run the world (cf. Stanislaw Lem's _Golem
XIV_ where the SI had better things to do).

There has been discussions about trans- and posthuman ecology. There
are plenty of us on the list who regard biological diversity as
desirable, and I seem to recall several discussions over the years I
have participated on this and similar lists on animal rights,
ecological modifications and the possibility of uplifting animals (not
to mention the extropian squirrels). It should be noted that there are
transhumanists who regard the fate of non-intelligent species as very
relevant. I think this shows that what values the dominant entities
will express is probably a very relevant question, and that some
conceivable value sets might well involve the wellfare of racoons.

> I invite others views on such a future and ways in which humanity

My partial answer is that, no, relevance is not neccessarily a noble
or important goal (it is an expression of our evolutionarily developed
tendency to value our survival and social freedom), but I seriously
doubt many on this list wouldn't do their best to retain their
relevance in the context they can fathom (note that we could become
irrelevant in a context we do not care about, like amount of memorized
decimals of pi (to use a silly example), which was very important for
some other group of entities).

However, I see one likely way for us humans and transhumans to retain
our relevance even in a strongly posthuman era. And that is to become
an integral part of the emerging superintelligences. After all,
intelligence amplification provides a technology with obvious
short-term benefits, and can in the long run be combined with ever
more advanced AI systems (in fact, it is a reasonable assumption to
guess that it is easier to develop human-supported AI than stand-alone
AI, and much more profitable). 

If we play our cards well, our mental structure and values could
remain a part of the emerging superintelligences just as our brains
contain a trans-fish, a trans-lizard and a trans-marsupial in the form
of the spinal cord, limbic system and cortex. We cannot do without
them, but at the same time they have been subsumed into something
greater. I suggest the same fate for humanity: we will not be replaced
by the posthumans, we will become parts of the posthumans, their
seeds.

There is a fundamental difference. Trans-racoons are not the
progenitors of humans.

There are two possible relationships between humanity and
post-human computer-based superintelligences (SI). Humans will either
be "merely" the progenitors, or human-derived conscionesses will be
incorporated into the SI. Even if we are "only" the initial
creators of th SI, this still places us in the same relationship
to the SI as we are to our human children. Unless you believe in
an afterlife, our children and the artifacts and ideas we leave behind
is all there is. With SI, your progeny are likely to remember
you longer than your merely human decendents would, so you are
more "relevant" to the SI than to simple humanity.

More interesting is the possibility that your consciousness will
be incorporated into the SI, or will evolve into the SI, or will
upload into the SI, anywhere along the contuum from separate
unmodified entity to complete assimilation. In any such
scenario, you are as relevant to the SI as your current
self is to you self of next week.

Is the current need to beleive in our own superiority a true reflection of our

Thanks for the rant, but like all of the liberal pundits running interference in
the press for Clinton, you are completely missing or ignoring why this is such a
big deal: He is covering it up, lying about it to the special prosecutor, to
congress, and the American people. He apparently also has commited obstruction of
justice, in trying to get the girl to not say anything. Thats called interfering
with a witness, and is a felony. Lying about whether or not he did that is also an
offense. I personally don't care if he lines them up 20 deep every day for a romp
on the oval office couch. That is the least of his offences. If he did that with
his campaign contributors, they'd at least be getting a service a bit more than one
night on a lumpy 150 year old haunted bed

I could care less about what Clinton's sexual history is. It has little or no
effect on his being able to run the country. His first term looked kinda 
amatuerish in places, but though I'd have rather had Dole, he'd managed to 
mostly get it together in the second term (Noteably, bringing in Albright as
Secretary of State dramatically improved the handling of foreign policy).
That said, there are two points that have to be made. First and by far the 
most important, is that the real question is whether or not he and Vernon
Jordan asked someone to commit perjury. That's a felony. Now, many of us on
this list don't like a lot of things about our government and legal system
(myself included), but this man is the leader and symbol of that system, and
if it's ok for him to do that, what does it say for the validity of that
system?
I remember my complete disgust when Mitchell, during Watergate said with a 
straight face to the House committee "Obeying the law, and upholding the 
constitution would have hurt us politically.". That was the Attorney General
of the United States saying that. That was incredible hypocrisy, and so is this if it turns out to be true.

If the president was soliciting perjury, then it IS a big deal.

The second is only a minor quibble. If he indeed did have an affair with
Lewinsky (as yet unproven, and not particularly reprehensible, save for any 
effect on his family), he might have shown a little more restraint
during his time in office, given the PR problems he's had with allegations
in the past. I think the sexual standards the country tries to impose on
officials are ridiculous, but that's a fact of political life at the moment.
Tempting fate that way is not good judgement.


> But once it's out in the open, well, then we'd better hang him, eh?  

If it's getting someone to lie under oath that's getting out in the open,
then he has to face charges just like any of the rest of us would. 
And saying that doing that is just "business as usual" is IMHO just admitting
the the process has failed.


> Sorry for taking up bandwidth with nothing more than a complaint.

No prob. I like the political discussions even more than the philosophical 
ones. (grin)

One group that might be worth looking at was the Fore in New Guinea, whose
females died in devastating numbers due to kuru (contracted from mortuary
cannabilism, mostly practised only by females).  I think this practice was
abandoned within a couple of generations of its fairly recent adoption
after the arrival of Australian law and intervention, and before the link
with kuru as a slow virus or prion was uncovered.  Oddly, the many diverse
cultures in New Guinea were notably ferocious and warlike even in
conditions of gender parity.  I get the impression that the deaths of Fore
wives, mothers and daughters was altogether demoralising to the men, rather
than cause for maddened war and wife-taking.  In part, perhaps, this is
because the deaths were attributed to `sorcery' by other members of the
Fore.  And of course this horrible episode isn't much like growing up in a
society where boys have *always* majorly outnumbered girls.

The First Immortal Web site is now up and running correctly. The site
<http://www.firstimmortal.com> contains a list of cryonics, nanotech and
futurism links (along with a mechanism to submit your own Web site for
reciprocal linkage), sample chapters, a poll, interview, bookseller
reviews, and last but not least, a forum called "talk with the author"
where participants may post comments about the book, cryonics, cloning,
nanotech and related topics. Next week an e-mailing will be sent out to
500,000 NetMind subscribers (not spam -- every recipient of a NetMind
e-mail has actually requested it) with the following sponsorship
message:

Would you want to live forever? Read James Halperin's latest bestselling
novel of the future: The First Immortal, from DelRey, now at bookstores

Yes!

Last night I watched The Tonight Show with Jay Leno  and also Vibe while
roaring in laughter at the  jokes made about Clinton and his choice of gals.  

To be frank, I am not interested in how many people Clinton has sex with.  I
don't care where he does it and how he does it. I don't even care that the
women are unaesthetic!  What I do care are three things:

1.      His Interfering with a witness is a felony. -- BIG mistake.
2.      His lying is distasteful.  -- Unhealthy problem.
3.      The unabashed and blatantly crude tell-tale behavior of those who
had sex with him (more likely than not because of his power) in
disclosing/blabbing it to the press (more likely than not because of the
money) and then the ultimate insult of acting as if they are doing something
for some kind of justice or cause for "women" is an act of pretention. --
Dim-sightedness!

Yo yo.

What irritates me the most about this situation is that this whole 
story is only in the allegation stage, with absolutely no proof other 
than this story from an ex-intern who may or may not have made up the 
whole thing to impress her coworkers.  On this basis alone, the 
networks and newspapers shoved aside coverage of the Unabomber trial, 
the FDA stance against cloning, and the new space probe mission.

      C'mon!  So first we have predatory feaudalism (or whatever) and thus 
      a distribution of property (and the positional advantages property 
      buys over time), and the resulting patterns of injustice aren't of 
      any concern?  That's just a stale 'conservative' apologia for 
      inherited privilege!  Hardly fair, let alone optimal.
      
      Why does 'capital' hire 'labour'?  Why does not 'labour' hire 
      'capital' for time-preference (interest) plus a risk factor?  Why do 
      we still have a _hierarchical_ -- 'Crony-Capitalist' -- verticalist 
      structure for our prevailing version of a 'free-market' society, 
      when most people would prefer a much more 'horizontal' reticular -- 
      Agorist! -- pattern of economic interactions?

      What objection (if any) would you advance to this idea?
      

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

                HOW TO RESOLVE THE LARGER 'BT PROBLEM'?

   Much of BT's network was built via capital levies on subscribers' phone 
   bills.  Clearly, when BT was 'denationalized', this should have been 
   done simply (and without megabucks in 'sweeteners' and 'fees') by 
   mailing out equal shareholdings in BT to every elector on Monday 
   morning

   BT staff seem to _hate_ BT -- most people do too, after all.  Who can 
   forget the cartoon of a man making a call from a phone box, while Busby 
   (remember him?  >:-} ) leaned out of the 'returned' slot and 
   surreptitiously picked the punter's pocket...  >:-}


                     NOW, IMAGINE THIS FUNNY SCENARIO:

      [A] BT staff start to 'work to rule' and make innocent mistakes...  
      Such things do happen... They all hate the bloody company, anyway...

      [B] The BT Network declines. BT will never get into America now: 
      whoever would possibly want to import an MI5 spy network?  >:-}
      All of BT's competitors go all-out for new business.

      [C] Job opportunities boom with BT's rivals, creaming off all the 
      more 'mobile' and/or competent BT staffers.

      [D] Rumours spread like wildfire that BT is on the skids...

      [E] The great offshore Hedge Funds (like George Soros' Quantum Fund 
      -- remember Black Wednesday? ERM?  The Tories? ) smell 'blood in the 
      water', and start running relentless bear raids against BT stocks 
      and shares round the clock.  BT shares decline more or less gracefully.

      [F] Meanwhile President Clinton has issued Executive orders tasking:

      the Central Intelligence Agency

                  http;//www.odci.gov/cia

      and the National Security Agency
      
                  http://www.nsa.gov:8080

      to become commercial 'players.'
      

      Top flight outfit, NSA -- US$ 30,000,000,000 budget, 100 000 
      brilliant,dedicated and playful staffers, worldwide SIGINT and 
      Electronic Warfare capabilities, you know...  Now tasked to gather 
      commercial and poplitical intelligence which can be useful to 
      American companies.  America has lots of fiercely competitive telcos 
      (Actually, anyone with NSA's resources could bring down BT's entire 
      network in around five minutes...).

      (A former CinCPAC and DIRNSA (Director, NSA) is a friend of mine...)
      
      [G]  BT slides inexorably into receivership.  In the reconstruction, 
      the public finally receive the shares they should have received in 
      the first place, and the BT staff run BT as a co-op, replacing the 
      'senior management' and the board (Good Riddance!), and take on any 
      external management advisers necessary for the 'difficult bits.'

      We-all then have our own phone company in our own hands, BT's 
      previous -- 'looter' -- shareholders see their shares zeroed, and 
      the good guys (all of us!) win!  We can then have free local calls, 
      with competing trunk services, and superfast 'blinking' datacomms 
      services via spread-spectrum protocols over standard twisted-pair 
      lines.

      That's a bit evasive!  I'm more than happy to know the correct 
      distributions -- just amend the estimate to '97% of privately-held 
      American land is owned by 3% of the population, or so I understand.' 
      I think you'll find that the distributions of ownership are 
      _something_ like this.  If the estimate's quite wrong, I'd like to 
      know a more accurate estimate, for purposes of future discussions.

A high five to Natasha for her three salient points.

<pseudo-conspiracy-rant mode on>

READ MY BITS, "NSA-CIA-How's your police state run today"--and a big HELLO
to aaaaall those lovely Inslaw shareware supporters out there in the 'net
who may just be tuning in now...

Buying off a witness is not what the good guys do. Absent principle,
someone who purports to be a "leader" of a "free world" has only got the
slop bucket and the slaughterhouse. I am fortunate to be able to say that
neither move me as much as my principle moves me; I don't claim it makes me
fundamentally superior to others with different priorities. But if such a
person is found out while in office, the rules say they get removed from
the game. Let's do _that_ the lawful way, shall we? 

<mockery mode on>

Hey Hillary! If it takes a village, I nominate your husband's penis for
village idiot.

There *is* a quite a bit of circumstantial evidence (which, despite 
what Perry Mason will tell you, is often the most important and 
accurate).  These points have either been admitted or have 
documentary proof:

1.  Vernon Jordan, the President's right hand man and First Pal, 
was active in finding her a job outside the White House before the 
last election.

2.  She was visiting the White House and receiving phone calls from 
it as late as last month.

3.  She was receiving packages from the White House by courier.

This is extremely unusual for a White House intern, who is at the 
*bottom* of the totem pole, who might catch a glimpse of the 
President 2 or 3 times in the entire time, and who are specifically 
ordered to stay away from the President if they do see him. 

Now this all just suggests that she and the President were having 
an affair, and I will join the chorus of those who don't give a damn 
what he does with his wing-wang, but it does also lend the woman 
more credibility in her statements.

But MPEG-2 is not the optimal compression method 
theoretically achievable for human visual data input.
(Maybe it is the optimal method achievable with 
presently affordable hardware and software. )

I had in mind the compression which results from the actions 
of the neural networks in the retina and the visual cortex. 
(Not only the compression achieved by methods like Delta Y-UV, 
discrete cosine transformation etc.. which are implemented in MPEG 
formats.)

Furthermore the 50 gigabytes per day was just meant as an upper 
bound. Originally I estimated even less, but to be on the safe 
side I enlarged this number.

I agree. The problem, ofcourse, is that inputs arrive even during 
the embryonic growth of the brain. However (theoretically) even 
these imputs could be simulated.

I agree. 
But this way of estimating an upper bound was just a theoritical 
example! (The standard way, ofcourse, is to count the total 
number of synapses and the number of bits to describe their state.)

And what about the information required to store which connection 
the synapses belong to. I.e which other neuron each dendrite is 
connected to.

I assumed the neural network of the brain can be 
simulated by a deterministic system. (i.e. that a selfconsiousnes 
intelligence can be created by a deterministic system) 
This has ofcourse not been proven but seems quite likely. 

Some persons claim that some internal randomness should be 
inherent for generating selfconsiousness intelligence.
However others claim that the random noise input from the 
environment is sufficent.

That the human consiousness could be transferred to a
deterministic system is unacceptable to some people 
because it kind of reduces themselves to machines...?

The number of 50 gigs/day was just meant as an upper bound 
(a very rough upper bound).

 Why do you expect that there is some way of handling scarce resources
that is fundamentally different from what has already been tried?
 I see plenty of room for innovation in taking things out of the
realm of scarce resources (e.g. medical care could be done by freeware
for our molecular assemblers eventually). But I think the laws of
physics appear to require that some things be in limited supply, and
my desire to experiment with Jupiter sized brains will probably be
sufficient to keep the demand unlimited.
 It appears to me that any commons suffers from the well-known tragedy
unless there are restrictions on its use, and that any such restriction
would fall under my concept of a property right. We seem to have tried
enough variations on the concept of property rights (individual vs.
communal, bundled vs. things like mineral rights) that we are ready
to draw general conclusions about how they work.

 I find it ironic that you make this claim at the same time that
Netscape is announcing it will make its browser source code public.
I've just seen a report that all of Netscape's top people read and
were influenced by a paper written by a former member of this list at
http://www.ccil.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-paper.html.

 Well, the list charter does discourage rehashing certain basics that
most of us consider already as proven as they can be. Especially when
most attempts at questioning whether it's a forgone conclusion just
repeat the same old ideas.

 You are trying to strip the words "market" and "capitalism" of their
meaning.
 Linux is an example of a free non-market non-capitalist solution.

Ok Extropians,

Here is a challenge for you 'upbeat' folk.

Imagine a near-future world where the only access on to the internet is 
through a Microsoft owned network, computer and or service.  Where the 
bulk of the backbone is run on NT servers.  Where the only browser is a 
Microsoft one.  Where most of the content is filtered through Microsoft?  
Sound Implausible?  Well, it is already happening at an unprescendented 
rate.  Why should it bother you?  Because Bill Gates has shown no qualms 
about controlling content.  Why do you think he has bought up at a 
furious rate the rights to tons of artwork, history, and images?  What 
is moticating him to do this?  If itsn't to *control* then why?

Tell me why I should have the "warm & fuzzies" about a man who seems to 
be hell-bent on complete world domination?  After all if he controls the 
intenet he controls the future?  If not, why not?

And if we should be worries about this ominous menace, what can we as 
critical optimist do about it?

Sincerly,

Zeke Daystrom

Although I have been very displeased with Clinton since 93, especially 
his position on civil liberties; what are our alternatives if he is 
impeached?

President Gore?  (his stance on those issues is worse, he is a 
well-known centralist and proponent of a one-world governemtn).

President Colin Powell?  (He is also a world federalist, and in favor of 
very strong gun-control)

And if the christian right is able to use this Paula Jones thing to its 
advantage, we might end up with:

President Gingrich or President Buchannan.

Although I would love to see a strong libertarian candidate make it, I 
am not holding my breath.

So where does this leave us?  I hope that Clinton is *not* impeached 
because the alternative will fare much worse.

Thank you for providing that info, because I've been having to tune 
out the immense deluge of coverage in Federal City just to get things 
done from day to day.

An interesting point came up in our local Extropian gathering last 
night:  If we are indeed 'one orgasim away' from a Gore presidency, 
that means that we will be dealing with a president with strong 
autocratic tendencies, who has actively supported the arrest of 
internet systems administrators who run afoul of decency standards, 
who has pushed for severe environmental restrictions on corporations, 
and who has a harsher stance against cloning technologies than his 
counterpart.

Sin,

Kathryn Aegis

This is technically true.  It made me think of a great meme-generating
political machine.  I do not claim this is true, because imagine this
possible scenario:  The Whitewater team leaks the details about the tapes,
calls a press conference, and indicates that a deposition will occur the
next day.  All the news organizations send their top people and start
scheduling news specials to cover the events.  When all the news people
show up for the press conference, they are told that it was a mistake and
that there would be no news.  The deposition is postponed indefinitely.
Now the news media have nothing official to put in all their news specials
which they have already announced and schedules.  So now, all the networks
are having hour long specials with no real news, just rehashing old
scandals and speculating on the new one with no real information.

Again, I'm not claiming this was intentional.  But, it makes me consider
the possibility of leading the media to schedule news shows without facts,
and then leaving them without evidence so they have nothing to present but
allegations, so they present that.  The idea of this occurring is a good
lesson in meme-spreading.  This latest allegation is much more important
and believed by the public than any of the previous scandals, even though
previous allegations have had much more proof than anything we have yet
heard about this one.  It seems that the way it was presented is more
important to meme-infection than the actual content.  The amount of
coverage it receives in the news media makes it seem more factual than any
real evidence.

What you say about Linux is true except for the claim that it is 
non-market and non-capitalist.

Linux does compete in a market both for users against other operating 
systems, and for programmers against other programming projects.

And the capital is essential to its effort.  It happens to be almost 
entirely human capital -- something nobody but libertarians and 
advocates of free-market capitalism takes seriously.

My guess is that these inputs are fairly easy to deal with compared to
the inputs that appear later; at this point they are mainly chemical
and temperature signals. Things get more complex later.

The big question is of course the coding. If it is just frequency
coding, then we will have a huge compression ratio. Phase coding would
complicate things a bit. But assuming only spikes are relevant, then
one could code a signal as (spike at axon N at time T), replacing
around a thousand values per axon per second with tens to a hundred of
values (depending on activity), creating an compression ratio of
0.1-0.01.

(but never trust this kind of computer science estimate for the CNS; I
have already started to think that nature has gone out of its way to
surprise and complicate things for us scientists)

Good point, I overlooked that. That would take log2(10^11) =~36 bits
per synapse. Interesting, it seems that there may be more information
in the connectivity than in the exact synaptic values.

Just having internal randomness is not enough, since it can be
emulated by a deterministic system with a look-up table. It seems
obvious that one random look-up table would do just as well as another
with the same statistical properties, so in that case it could be
generated using pseudorandom numbers.

Yes, many people seem to dislike the idea immensely. I see it the
other way around: instead of seeing us as mere machines, the "mere
machines" can in fact be equal to us!

How about learning enough basic facts about the structure and
history if the net to understand why the possibility you raise
is utterly ridiculous?  The way the net is built makes it not
only unfeasible but technically impossible for anyone to have
any overall control of the technologies used; in fact, diversity
is a well-known security blanket.  Every node on the net--which
connects to any number of other nodes any way it wants to, using
any software that follows the standards, has 100% control of its
own little piece of the net like a good decentralized system
should, and they all know that being different from your neighbor
is a good way to ensure the robustness of the system from
attack.  So the more homogenized the system becomes, the greater
the value of something different becomes solely for that fact
alone.  Also, since the net--even a 100% Microsoft net--is used
for sending big chunks of bytes to anyone who wants them, those
chunks of bytes can be competing software that finds it easier
and easier to compete as the network improves.

Anyone who thinks Microsoft is a threat to the net is as far
from reality as someone who thinks throwing away an aluminum can
is a threat to the planet.

Coase's work makes that completely irrelevant.  In a sufficiently
free market with sufficiently low tansaction costs, the optimal
result will be found /regardless of initial distribution/.  So why
whine about how anyone came to own things originally?  It doesn't
matter; what matters is working on reducing transaction costs.

What would happen if people went against the conditions of use (or
whatever it is you see that's pasted all over linux when you first come
across it)?

He means that linux has not been made free by a political process but by
the free decision of those involved.  Perhaps "capitalism" and "market"
aren't quite precisely what's being pointed out here, but certainly a
classical liberal or libertarian system of property rights is presupposed.

Yes, since past injustices are probably piled up pretty high in every
direction, the best thing to do to start off a libertarian society is
just START ENFORCING PROPERTY RIGHTS (equally for all) PROPERLY NOW, and
provided they are rigorously adhered to from this moment on, the (Pareto?)
optimal result will come about.  (Meaning, basically, keep politics the
fuck out of economics, except for reasons with a *much* higher
"threshold" than are tolerated now.)

This is what's always struck me about Marx's conversion from classical
liberalism to socialism.  The pro-propertied bias he experienced in the
legal system was an example not of liberalism working itself out but of
liberal principles not being adhered to.  He must have already had an
*emotional* bee in his bonnet for such a weak reason to turn him.

Bill Gates capability to rapidly monopolize the very new industry of 
computer software and internet browsers is simply symptom of a business 
man taking full advantage of a new situation and technologies.  
Government is slow to react, but has begun to see Bill Gates as a threat 
and are trying to break his monopoly.  To say Mr. Gates desires to 
conquer the world is not being pessimistic but instead being highly 
paranoid.  I'm sure the government has it's eyes on Bill Gates since 
there are many paranoid people in government. My question is will the 
government in it's present form be able to keep up with the Bill Gates 
of the future.  As new technologies rapidly develop, can we afford to 
depend on government to restrict abuses?  As technology evolves at a 
mind boggling speed, shouldn't we design a government which can keep 
pace?

Anders spoke of 2 million axons from the retina.

It seems we were all understating the case.  According to Richard Dawkins,
in MOUNT IMPROBABLE, 

`the human retina has about 166 million photocells' (p. 160).

Why am I bothering to post this `We Were Wrong'?  Like, who really cares?
I dunno, just habit I guess.

Hey Charlie,

Perhaps we should all realize that capitalism will soon become an
absurdity and cease to exist.  As technology increases productive
capacities, and automates the whole process, you, me and all extropians
may soon be able to sit on our butts, doing whatever we like, and still
have all the goods and services we can dream of. . .absolutely free. .
.all without working.

In Robotopia, as I have described it, everything will be free for
everyone, because robots will do all the work,  detect human needs and
demands, acquire the raw materials, build the factories,  replicate
themselves,  deliver the bounty to us, and never charge a penny.

There would be no money.  Because there would be no money, there would
be no taxes. . .and possibly no government.

As I have repeated endlessly, the distribution of property is askew
not because of original thefts and conquests, whose results would disperse
over time, but because of Central Banking which creates capital out
of nothing and distributes it to the privileged ruling, state-capitalist class
on an on-going basis.  This is the central state interference, but most of
the other State Interventions from regulation (covert cartels) to income tax
favor the Established over the new comer and thus tend to concentrate
wealth in the hands of the few.

I don't want to exchange Dynamic Optimism for Dynamic Pessimism, but I've
heard this song before...   Slave labor was supposed to do this, then steam
engines, then electricity, then nuclear power, then solar power, and now
computers, robots, nanites and genetic engineering.  It ain't gonna happen!

In the super-future, I with my Jupiter-sized brain will reconfigure whole
galaxies in a day's work.  My boss will yell at me for not remaking two
galaxies in that time.  I will only have enough money to buy a small
sub-universe, and will have to mortgage my next 47 galaxy remakes to pay
for my coveted universe enlarger upgrade.

No matter how much more power we get, we'll want more.  No matter how much
work we can produce, our bosses will want more.  No matter how much profit
we make, there will be more things to spend it on.  It's like network
bandwidth.  For every doubling in network speed, we quadruple our data
bandwidth with more 3-D animated graphics and full featured sound.  The
more powerful the network gets, the slower our web browsers go.  The more
choices we have in our life, the harder it is to choose.

I am rushing toward the future as fast as I can, but it will be a fast and
furious future.  There will be no time for sitting on our
Boundlessly-Expanding Butts while robots feed us grapes.

. . . Or, am I just reading to much Cyberpunk?

There are a few funny things here.  First, John and others are suggesting
breaking an alleged monopoly (Gates' businesses) with a real monopoly
(government).  In other words, to keep some people from getting too
much power, they want to give other people even more power.  That
strikes me as odd.

Second, what about the Gateses of the past?  Microsoft is not the
first startup to sweep through an industry and leave the old elite
and others panting.  Ford nealy had a monopoly on cars.  Have
you driven a Ford lately?  Most people don't today.  Was it the
government that worked some magic to make other car companies
compete?  No.  In fact, tariffs and import quotas help to keep Ford's
competitors out, but yet it moves.  Honda, Toyota, Chrysler, etc.
all make cars and compete with Ford.

Third, the personal computer software market is relatively new.  As it
matures, not only do I think more competitors will break into it, but
consumers will demand more of an OS.  Maybe this will be more
than Gates and Microsoft can deliver.  If so, competitors will eat
his company alive.  If not, then perhaps it is because he is giving
the people what they want.

Vivamus!

True, and it doesn't explain why continental drift exists either. I wasn't 
talking philosophy, I was talking about a practical way to get things done. 
It doesn't matter why people own anything in the first place, the fact is 
that in the real world they do and we must deal with it.


        >No-one has ever provided a satisfying explanation of how a person         
        >comes to 'own' a given piece of land from a state of nature.         


So what? People undoubtedly do own land and if you believe in determinism, 
and I'll bet you do, then there must be a reason that they do, you just don't 
know what it is. Even if you did have an explanation, of what practical value  
could it possibly be.


        >The 'labour-mixing' argument doesn't hold water. [...].The 'resources        
        >-mixing' argument begs the first question      


That could be, but I wouldn't know. What are those arguments?
              

        >Why is your labour not just wasted effort?        


If your labor is foolish then it is wasted effort, not all labor is of equal
value, or of any value at all. The great thing about the market is that it 
will tell  you very quickly if you're working smart or stupid.


        >Look back far enough, and you find something pretty questionable         
        >(or outright predatory). 
              

Look back far enough, and you can find anything you want. It's pointless to 
worry about what a bunch of dead men I never met did to another bunch of dead 
men I never met, I just want the best system for making me rich, free, and 
happy and it certainly isn't socialism.

Obviously you can not, who said you could?

It's of absolutely no concern to me because the perpetrators of the injustice 
as well as the victims have all been dead for a thousand years. With the  
exception of Antarctica , every square inch of land on planet Earth has been 
stolen from somebody else a thousand times over, I can't sort it out and I 
see no reason to even try. I don't believe in object morality but I do think 
it would be nice if most people were free and rich most of the time. If your
goal is a happy creative world you will never achieve it by trying avenge 
every ancient crime.

It would seem to me to be a rather large jump from "the human retina has  
about 166 million photocells" to the human retina can produce 166 million  
pixels, much less deliver them to the visual centers of the brain where they 
are all processed. The human eye can not detect individual photons, although 
some species of frogs can.

By the way, somebody suggested that I look at the Mandelbrot set without 
moving my eyes, I did and it's very beautiful, but I still can't believe I'm 
seeing 16 million parts, or 166 million, that's why I think Fractint is a

And what choices will they be?? Every millisecond another real cool deal

It was remarked recently that many people are hostile to the idea that
humans are basically machines.  From my point of view, the hostility is
not rational; the idea says more about machines than it does about us. 
We are still who we've always been, even if we are machines.  But if we
are machines, then that tells us a lot about the Capabilities of
machines.  If we are machines, then machines can experience things
subjectively, can feel emotions, can think, can contemplate, can do
everything we can do, and more.  

I think the hostility towards the idea that we are machines comes from
the low opinion people hold of machines, in general.  People tend to form
the category "machine" around the machines they have experienced, not
around the abstract idea of "machine" that computer scientists and
engineers use. The machines people use are fairly stupid and far from
sentient.  Calling us "machines" is insulting to those who only think of
machines as they are today.

I suppose the popular opinion of machines will improve as the machines we
create improve. If we create highly sentient and loveable machines,
people might not mind being called "machines" any more.

I think the key word here is setient. once something has become setient 
it has gone beyond machine or animal.  Machine is not a proper thing to 
label a human.  Because we as humans are more than machine or animal yet 
we are very much both.  When a computer becomes aware, it will become 
more than a machine, and most likely be insulted if we were to call it a 
machine.

Actually, GNU/free Unices is a good example of what I call digital
communism. No, wait. It is just a community of non-defectors (as a user,
you are expected to contribute) giving a free ride to the throng of the
consumers. The net impact of seemingly neutral consumers is actually
slightly positive, as they form a guiding force in the market.

According to my office-mate Mikael, the acuity of the fovea is
apparently higher than expected just by seeing each receptor cell as a
'pixel', it is smaller than their receptice fields! (I don't know how
it is done).

On the other hand, the number of axons in the visual nerve is around
one million, so the total resolution is somewhat limited even given
the data compression/image processing in the retina.

--Recieved message "Bill Gates Goes Global" from
http://msnews.msbc.mscom

Welcome to MSNBC Direct Mail(TM) service.

Best viewed with Internet Explorer 13.08 Release 3

Date:		29.Aug.2006
Headline:	Bill Gates goes global
Subject:	Microsoft
Meta:		Microsoft, domination, conspiracy.
Content:	Casual use of the word "penis."
Reader Level:	Monkey, or above average Gazelle

Today Microsoft has announced that it's new interface software, the
Billagotchi(TM), will be released around the world within the next
Microsoft Year(TM.  This will mean that the Billagotchi(TM) could be
in your Den(TM) by the end of 2011.  But what will this mean for Bill
Gates after 1999's Whitehouse scandal?

--History File - Clinton vs. Gates - 13.Feb.1999

	In 1998 Microsoft(R) realeased a new "open" strategy to counter
Netscapes new-found success in the Internet(TM) market after releasing
it's browser source code.  Microsoft(R) did not only release source
code for Internet Explorer(TM), Internet Information Server(TM), and
Office(TM), but also set a new agenda for it's business practises. 
The MS Open Strategy(TM) will mean that Microsoft(R) will release
details of all previous business practises and all new business
practises on it's website (WWW route directory (http://))

	Visitors to the website were shocked to find pages of government
bribes, mafia connections and, most shocking of all, a personal
confession from Sir William Gates III about his connection with the
1997/1998 whitehouse scandal.  The confession clearly states that the
"sexual missdealings" of former President Bill Clinton were all a PR
joke set to coincide with the release of Windows(R) 98(TM).  The joke
did not go according to plan when Windows(R) 98(TM) was delyed for the
16th time.  Along with the confession is a scanned receipt for a 1000
mile long piece of string, that was allegedly attached to the
Presidents penis.

	Sir William Gates was quoted as saying "I just tugged on that string
and out popped the little chap!"

--End History file

The Billagotchi(TM) software is an 6-inch high holographic agent
modelled on the likeness of Sir William Gates (a Barney(TM) version is
also available.)  The agent software will respond to any user requests
and then achieve those requests by "aquiring" or "merging" infromation
for the lowest possible price.  The 6-inch character is already being
refered to as "Little Bill" by Sir Gates.  Shortly after Microsoft(R)
made the annoucement Netscape filed a complaint with the MSDOJ(TM) and
released a list of bugs (personality flaws) on their website
(http://mswww.netscape.com)  The MSDOJ(TM) have yet to take action,
but are said to be humoring the request.

$2 have been tranferred from your MS Wallet(TM)

MSNBC is owned by Microsoft(R) Corporation and the opinions expressed
within are of Microsoft Corporation.  Microsoft Corporation is the
worlds largest supplier of software and Internet(TM) services.  Sir
Williams Gates was knighted by the British Empire after Microsoft's
hostile takeover of the British monarchy (07.Apr.2002)

Where do you want to go today?(TM)

I don't understand how "awareness" magically makes a machine not a
machine or more than a machine.  Its fundamental processes are still the
same; it's mechanisms for going from one state to another are still
fundamentally the same.  If we are fundamentally machines, then being
sentient doesn't make us not machines or more than machines; it puts us
in a different category of machines, sentient machines.  I think your
reluctance in labeling humans "machines" is that your concept of machine
is based on currently existing human artifacts, rather than the abstract
category of machine, which loosely includes any physical system which has
"rules" governing its change from one state to another.  So, unless
there's something mystical going on (and if the mystical is not
rule-bound), then humans are machines.  

We are who we are whether we call ourselves "machines" or not.  But if we
understand ourselves to be machines, then that gives us great hope about
what sorts of machines we may be able to create.  And if we are machines,
then how could knowing our true nature be insulting?

Actually, well crafted and evolved machines are perceived as living
things. For example racing cars, ferraris, quality boats, etc. So
there's something about ease of interfacing involved here. Computer
interfaces are very new and haven't had time to become comfortable to
use.

There is also the legacy of the steam age. Steam engines were the first
self powered machines, and were highly repetitious, with a very fixed
suite of behaviour. This is similar to the actions of retarded and
autistic and mentally ill people, so we perceive this kind of behaviour
with dread and rejection, as broken people are not in general either
useful or a survival advantage. This dread may come from levels as deep
as our limbic system. Both machines and broken people can make
unpredictable inept decisions which are survival negative...

Second, what about the Gateses of the past?  Microsoft is not the
first startup to sweep through an industry and leave the old elite
and others panting.  Ford nealy had a monopoly on cars.  Have
you driven a Ford lately?  Most people don't today.  Was it the
government that worked some magic to make other car companies
compete?  No.  In fact, tariffs and import quotas help to keep Ford's
competitors out, but yet it moves.  Honda, Toyota, Chrysler, etc.
all make cars and compete with Ford.

Third, the personal computer software market is relatively new.  As it
matures, not only do I think more competitors will break into it, but
consumers will demand more of an OS.  Maybe this will be more
than Gates and Microsoft can deliver.  If so, competitors will eat
his company alive.  If not, then perhaps it is because he is giving
the people what they want.


My Response::

There is *no* historical prescedent like Bill Gates. His control is much 
deeper and more fundamental than that.   Bill Gates does not have 
control over just an industry like automobiles.  He is beginning to have 
control over ALL INFORMATION ITSELF; the very fabric of our new economy. 
This would be equivalanent to Morgan or Ford having control over most of 
industrial processes themselves; both horizontally and vertically.  In 
other words you wouldn't even be able to invent the airplane, because 
every industrial process in doing so, would be owned and controlled by 
ONE person.

That is the irony!  The Information revolution is fundamentally 
different than the Industrial revolution in that it is more fundamental 
to how our whole socio-economic system functions.  And in turn allows 
less people to have more control over the whole process.

This whole browser war is a perfect case of how Bill can control and 
crush anyone he finds a threat.  If anyone thinks that a few intelligent 
and business savvy individuals can bring him down I am all ears, because 
I think it is becoming increasingly impossible (i.e Netscape, Sun, and a 
1000 other corpses left dying on Bill's information hwy) to do so.  If 
Bill Gates is not stopped now, it will too late.  In a thousand years, 
the late 20 and 21st centuries will be known as the Gates Dynasty!

By realizing that the means by which you came to have a property 
claim on something represents a piece of your life.  Therefore the 
supposedly non-violent intruder is seizing a piece of your life 
without your consent -- an act of violence against you.

Responding to an act of violence, however subtle it may be, with 
violence, is *not* initiating violence.

At first glance it appears that software is a distinctly different 
field from near-monopolies of the past.  After all, Standard Oil 
couldn't change the definition of petroleum.

But does that really apply?

Let's see.  One company controlled about 90% of the market for 
local-area networking software only a couple years ago.  One company 
controlled about 90% of the market for database servers at the same 
time.  Both these companies are in trouble today, one of them being 
threatened by something that is demonstrably inferior in several 
regards and cannot coexist on the same network without creating 
stability or security issues and substantial additional 
network-management complexity.

Apparently having a non-protected near-monopoly isn't much of a help.

Suppose some company were to bring out a well-written, relatively 
bug-free, efficient shim so that Windows95 software would run on top 
of Linux... put together all necessary permissions and a good, 
easy-to-use installation package with Linux and their shim...

The fundamental capital is human capital; therefore the alternative 
-- the ONLY alternative -- to capitalism, is slavery.  I for one will 
be quite upset if capitalism ceases to exist.

But, the details of the capitalist system are subject to change.

I think it will be a while before  the process of invention, or the 
process of creation of art, are "automated".  I think that about the 
time this happens, we will have to change our definitions and 
consider the machines that are capable of such things to be people.

Live performances, of course, can *never* be automated.  By 
definition.  Why do people pay more today to see live theater than to 
see a movie?

      If we're talking comparative economic systems and reasons for 
      choosing between them, we _are_ -- ineluctably -- doing philosophy.

      We have to start from where we are if we want to get anywhere else, 
      and to start 'here' we have to know what 'here' is, and how it came 
      to be.  We can't design and build a ship from scratch in mid-ocean 
      (nor can we tear the existing ship to pieces, then hope to be able 
      to build a new ship).  We can gradually remodel the whole ship from 
      stem to stern, however, in a  way that's nearer to our hearts' and 
      our minds' desires.

        So the history and the rationale affects the validity of the 
        claims to title.  It's an unavoidable problem.

        Who owns land in the Falklands/Malvinas, say?  Or Red China?

        I'm not sure that 'determiniosm' is the word you meant to use.

        I'm certainly not a determinist in any sense of the word other 
        than that I'm not a Copenhagen-school subjectivist 'quantum 
        indeterminist.'

      You'll find the basic propertarian models neatly summarized in 
      Harvard philosophy professor Robert Nozick's brilliant (and 
      award-winning) work of libertarian philosophy, "Anarch, State and 
      Utopia."  Since Nozick offers the only really viable alternative to 
      John Rawls' "A Theory of Justice" (another lovely book), we have to 
      deal with these problems if we want to compete for 'hearts and 
      minds' in the political philosophy marketplace.  And win!

      Think of the problem like this.  You find a piece of driftwood, and 
      carve it into a sculpture.  You've now mixed your (intellectual, 
      artistic and physical) labour with the driftwood, right?  If I take 
      the sculpture while you are sleeping, you'll be pissed off  when you 
      wake up and find it gone.  If you find I've sold your scultpure and 
      kept the money, you'll consider that you've suffered an _injustice_, 
      because _you_ had a just claim on the sculpture.

      It's the idea of _justice in property claims_  we're  discussing all 
      the while, when we discuss different systems of property rights.

        So how do _you_ adjudicate Aboriginal land rights claims?

        Abdicate the responsibility?

        I want this for _all_ of us, not just for me.

        I'm not comfortable with a system where 350 000 children starve to 
        death each day, or die of avoidable illness.  Are you?  Imagine 
        them sitting all around you while you lecture them on the virtues 
        of the free market, as they're dying.

> it certainly isn't socialism.

        It certainly isn't State Socialism without market prices, fer 
        sure!  But the original dream of Socialism -- a society where, 
        within reason, everyone can have what they want and do what they 
        like, is an ideal that _is_ worth striving for, however 
        imperfectly we may achieve it in practice.  I think market 
        liberalism can do this much better than State Socialism, is all.  
        Democratic Agorism can do better still.

        But there's the -- coercive -- core of the 'taxation' issue:  'A'

        property.

        I'm not trying to avenge historical crimes (though they do make me 
        angry) so much as to rectify _present injustices_.  Insofar as the 
        better-off tend to be the beneficiaries of past injustices, while 
        the worst-off tend to be descendants of their victims, there is a 
        real moral and practical problem to be addressed.  If we don't

        'Vectors' are forces with both direction and magnitude.  Just like 
        profit margins in the exchange ratios (or 'market prices') in the 
        'market-price system'  (or 'catallaxy' in Austrian Economics 
        jargon).

I wrote my recent "pro-totalitarian" posts to see if I'd get the
'correct' answer to the question, "for what rational reason shouldn't
we do this?"  But I didn't, so here is the answer I was looking for:

If you've got a problem, change yourself *not* everyone else.

And why is this rational?  Because the laws of complexity say you aint
ganna change everyone else.

That's what I understood 'self-transformation' to mean, and that's
what I've been doing all this time.  Am I wrong?

There will always be money (or some medium of exchange) because there will always be more desirable and less desirable places to live ("live" in whatever
contradictory senses as things diversify and evolve).

Government (in the sense of an accepted mechanism for arbitration with the power to enforce its rulings, if nothing else) will always have a use.

Taxes, in one form or another, seem to cover pretty well any way you can think of paying for government.

Dunno if this is true or walrus-shit.  I searched hither & yon on the net,
couldn't find any substantiation:

Forwarded from Sci.bio.ecology:


January 25th

An AP story today reported two scientists at the Charleston
Oceanographic Institute have successfully genetically engineered the
first mammal hybrid.  The Scientists, Dr. Lisa Velasquez and Dr.
Michael Poczkinsky, used bits of genetic material from both a
bottle-nosed dolphin and the egg of a walrus, fertilized in vitro, and
implanted into an adult walrus for gestation.  The healthy offspring,
termed a "Dolrus", seems healthy and is now three months old.
Phenotypically, it has the features of a somewhat larger dolphin, only
it is able to carry itself out of the water and locomote on land.  The
Dolrus appears to have the breathing apparatus of the dolphin, but
preliminary study seems to show tusks will develop much like the
walrus.

One of the limiting factors in human population is food production.  One
of the main reasons so many humans are alive today is because of the
tremendous success of agricultural science.  Much of that success has to
do with learning to grow more food in less space.  Much work has been
done and is still being done with growing food hydroponically (spraying
the fully exposed roots of growing plants with nutrient solutions), with
excellent results.  If the work continues as expected, the costs of
growing food hydroponically will continue to decrease, and agriculture
will no longer be confined to the soil.  This would also mean that there
would eventually be no reason to locate major agricultural production
facilities hundreds of miles away from highly populated cities.  When we
have the technology to do so, it will make more sense to carry out
agriculture right in the city, in tall buildings; layers and layers of
dense agricultural production.  Stacking the layers up, instead of only
using one layer as we do now, will mean we can produce more food using
less land space.  Also, the fact that plants can be grown several times
more densely when grown hydroponically will save even more on the land
space.

Besides being able to get fresh fruit and vegetables at low prices all
year round, this sort of agriculture would mean that the amount of
cultivatible land would no longer be the limit to human population that
it is now.  Agricultural production could occur almost everywhere.  All
we need is the facilities, water and a large supply of energy for the
lights and environmental controls.  

The human population could become quite large, indeed.  But how desirable
is a huge human population, one several times larger than the current
population?  Considering that nothing like it has ever happened before,
it's very hard to predict what so many billions of people will do.  It
will mean far more brilliant and hard-working geniuses than ever before. 
And it may also mean far more psychopaths and criminals, but it also
means more people to stop them.  

Of course, humans can't maintain our current exponential growth rate
forever (we would quickly use all of the matter in the solar system, just
for human bodies, but we have enough resources here on earth and in the
surrounding space (asteroids and near-by planets) to increase our
population to quite a large number.  Any speculations on the results of a
population several times larger than the current one?

I can think of one way. If an on-off photo receptor has a field of view 
X degrees wide and you want to know where a star is to better accuracy than X,  
then turn your receptor 1/2 X degrees to the right, if you still register a 
pixel then the star must have been in the right half of the original field of 
view, if not then it was in the left.
             
If we couldn't move our eyes but had to move our entire head I think we'd end 
up with some very tired and sore neck muscles or we'd be virtually blind.

Excerpts from the journal of David Jensen, an early mind transfer patient.

<> 2031 March 12th, Wednesday, 2:02 PM

Riding to my third and final briefing session with the brain surgeons. I
review my notes from the last two sessions. At the first session they
talked about early discoveries with the corpus callosum, (big nerve
bundle linking the left brain with the right brain) and the experiences
of patients in the 1900's who had one side of their brain removed, and
other patients who had to have various pieces taken out. It was kind of
creepy but I think they were getting me used to the fact that some
pretty serious things were going to happen to me if I gave the go-ahead.
I'm still a little queasy about having them cut into me. Anyway, at the
end of the session they asked the $100,000 question: Now that you've
heard what it's like to have half your brain disconnected and removed,
imagine the reverse -- having a new brain *added* and *attached*.

The second briefing was all about the information theory and statistical
properties of brains. They talked about how the links of a brain's
neurons had been found to have the same statistical distribution as:
healthy societies, the 1900's telephone system, large massively parallel
supercomputers, N-dimensional hypercubes and several other things I had
never heard of, like "linguistic root-concept networks". They also
talked about the different functional components of the brain and how
quickly each function would begin to feel different as it diffused over
into the new brain.

<> 4:35 PM

The doctors gave me a handout from the third session. I'm going to type
it in here so I can recycle the paper.

    "The artificial brain will be simulated until it reaches the point
    where it is ready to become part of the intelligence wave pattern,
    more precisely called 'the function ring of adaptive entropic
    stimulus/response'.
    
    "The human brain will be connected to the artificial brain by means
    of trillions of connections, between individual neurons -- enough
    connections so that the bisection bandwidth is enough to keep the
    two brains almost completely up to date with each other."

(I asked about "bisection bandwidth", and the doctors said it measured
how much information, in bits per second, could travel between two
halves of a brain, or a computer network. An old 1990's term, I
remembered right after I asked. In computer architecture we call it
"interchange rate".)

    "The two brains then begin to interoperate as one brain. Thoughts,
    perceptions, emotions and other similar phenomena begin to occur in
    both halves nearly simultaneously just as they do on the left and
    right halves of a normal brain.
    
    "The human consciousness will start to perceive the actions of the
    artificial brain as part of its consciousness. This will happen
    gradually, like fingers slowly creeping across the 'new callosum'
    and into the other brain. The process is gradual because the new
    neurons take a while to develop new 'wave patterns'. At the
    patient's request or if the neuroanalyst deems necessary, the
    process can be made more gradual by switching on the connections
    gradually.
    
    "The patient starts to get accustomed to his/her new thoughts, as
    each piece of the new brain becomes part of one consciousness. It
    becomes part of you; your senses and actions are directly linked
    through the new parts of the brain as well as the old.
    
    "Cautious patients often worry that the new brain will influence the
    old brain just as much as the old brain influences the new. This
    doesn't happen because the new 'neurons' are initially configured in
    'high learning index' mode, much like the neurons in the speech
    processing centers during the first few years of a child's life. The
    new neurons essentially rewire themselves until they 'realize' that
    they're interoperating in a consistent way. For a technical
    explanation see [ANG:anthro.brain.learn-7:/Salter.Evan/2008a
    ID-6ew4-51aah-401-200-9044,sec7.6ff]
    
    "The 'new corpus callosum' has one end in the computer system the
    patient will communicate with, and the other end in a massive bundle
    of tiny fibers that extends into the brain. The surgeons are
    responsible for making sure that the millions of fibers are
    reasonably evenly distributed throughout all active parts of the
    brain. It doesn't matter precisely where each one ends up as long as
    they're fairly evenly distibuted, because the new brain maps itself
    to all the neural patterns during the neuronal learning process.
    Each fiber picks up signals from twenty thousand points along its
    length, for a total of a few trillion connections. The precise
    number varies by patient.
    
    "The fundamental physical technology dates back to the mid-1900's,
    initially developed as a prosthesis for patients born blind. In
    early operations a mere 100 to 1000 connections were made to the
    visual cortex but the brain quickly learned to derive useful visual
    information and incorporate the signals into its experience."

<> 2031 March 14th, Friday, 11:35 PM

Had a really nice dinner with Linda tonight. I took her out to the
Italian place on Collins Av, where we went on that midsummer when we met
Andrew. We've been closer and happier these last few days than anytime I
remember since that midsummer. I think she knows what I'm heading into
and really respects me for it. Anyway, I told her about my decision when
we got home, and we had a great night together. It's nice to have her
sleeping so softly next to me.

<> 2031 April 3rd, Thursday

They brought the new eyes "on line" today. At first they seemed like a
totally alien input; "a new sense" as the doctors said. I've got this
annoying mess of -- sort of like hallucinations or -- well they're not
sights or sounds anyway, but they're synchronized with what I'm seeing.
I should have done drugs when I had the chance, maybe I'd be able to
describe this if I had experienced synesthesia firsthand.

Anyway, whatever it is, it dosn't appear as vision, yet! The doctors say
it'll "click" within a few weeks, like when you're learning French and
they throw you into the middle of Lyons or someplace and you have no one
to speak English with anymore. Time will tell.

<> April 7th, 8:30 AM

Oh my god -- I have just re-experienced a memory from when I was in the
womb -- I can't describe it at all but I have this gut feeling just like
when my vision started working for the first time. I know it sounds
crazy, but I've felt this before and it's the deepest oldest sensation
I've ever had. I also had that weird "embryo" feeling this morning, like
I felt sometimes during the chemotherapy in 1987. This feels just like
that! Wow, that's cool.

<> 2031 April 19th, Saturday, 2:58 PM

With the new headset on I can close my eyes, and I still see! My new
'eyes' are still open. When I turn my head I see different parts of the
world around me. The only drawback right now, is this irritating
sensation that I'm forcing my eyes not to blink, like in a childhood
staring contest. The doctors say it'll go away after a few days on the
headset.

My hearing is mostly transferred, too. Linda asked me today about the
other senses, like smell and taste. I told her that those senses are
being linked electronically, but there are no physical prostheses so I
won't be able to smell her perfume for example, once they've transferred
the olfactory nerves out of my body -- unless she sets it in the
simulator preferences on the console.

That didn't help at all. Linda got pretty sad when I said that. I'm
going to start giving her more time to be with me alone, so I can just
listen and be with her. I'll make sure the doctors know how important
this is. We've been through it several times but nothing can prepare you
for the real experience. She needs to face it and she's facing it now
and I'm going to give her my undivided attention.

<> 2031 May 20th, Tuesday

They briefed me for the next stage today. Basically the old brain will
be shut down bit by bit. As this is happening I have to take a lot of
time and effort reexperiencing all kinds of memories, emotions, and
thoughts in order to recall the memory contents of my old mind and let
the new mind learn the patterns. The whole process can take up to 7
years! That's a long time for me to have to stay in this wheelchair! I
know I've thought about it for years but it still seems like a big deal.
I guess the last couple months have spoiled me, with so many things
happening so quickly.

But, the doctors assure me I need to do this, 'memory lane therapy' as
they call it. It's this part of the process, this slow experiencing of
the millions of different thoughts and emotions that really accomplishes
the mind transfer. I'll undergo lots of trauma later if I leave any
large parts of my memory behind. I remember the horror stories of
recovering Alzheimer's patients 20 years ago!

Again I'm glad I kept such detailed journals, particularly during the
90's and 2000's. Those are years I will always cherish. Linda has found
me some more monthly documentaries of national and world history,
including a great series for the 1970's. I hope so -- nobody I've
watched so far really did justice to that period.

<> 2032 October 23rd, Saturday, 11:00 AM

I just finished reliving the Sterling Men's Weekend today! It was the
Simmons-Thomas adaptation, with all my journal notes woven into the
holoplay by Andrew's studio, and level 3 subliminal prompting. Anyway,
IT WAS AWESOME!!! and I'm glad I decided to do this, a great way to
spend my 69th birthday indeed! Linda was impressed. I still wish I had
her with me the first time I completed the Weekend, and I think now she
understands why. If not, well... she soon will! O-8

<> 2044 Feb 3rd, Wednesday, 8:30 AM (Ether Time: 2048 Nov 11th, Wednesday,
11:14 PM)

Preparing my summary statement for the Ether Society SIG, New Candidates
Introduction. My 125th prepared public speech, near as I can tell. What
a great life I've had! No, what a great life I've *started*!

You will live in a distributed redundant multiprocessing system, on
several computers around the world, along with many others like you. The
computers still need to be maintained physically, and many human beings
who do not wish to forego their mortality are happy to do so. The
symbiosis between the mortals and the immortals is nearly perfect.

The immortals vacate the planet, freeing the environment and physical
space for the remaining mortals to live in greater comfort. Earthers
finally get the smaller population they've been fighting so long to get.
The immortals earn their keep by continuing to invent and create,
solving more and more of the remaining problems of the mortals. As their
minds multiply the invention rate increases.

The mortals, while sacrificing immortality and burdened with physical
work (which nevertheless decreases with passing years as the immortals
continue to invent more automation and efficiency), are blessed with the
simple physical life they love and believe in. They can bear children
the old fashioned way, and their children live into a choice that they
can take when they're ready -- remain mortal and risk death, or transfer
and become immortal.

It is proposed that a substantial number of humans will form a third
class, of mortal humans who are linked to the etherworld through
computer implants. We still don't have good technology for doing this
without confining them to some sort of wheelchair, but many consider
that no problem. This third class becomes dependent on both the physical
world *and* the etherworld, and provides the important services of
diplomacy and policing the balance of power between the mortals and the
immortals. It is in their best interests that the symbiosis continue and
neither side "defeat" the other. Much like the checks and balances of
the three branches of American government, the three classes of people
cooperate to maintain a working global society.

Within the etherworld, many new possibilities will develop. Trek fans --
remember the Holodeck? It is one of the *simpler* things you could do!
Individual minds begin to discover that they can share thoughts, and
even combine if they wish, with other minds. A new type of marriage,
much more powerful than anything possible in the mortal world, occurs
when two minds irrevocably merge into one -- greater than the sum of the
original two. This new, greater intelligence can do things neither of
the two could do alone, much faster and more efficiently than the two
could do working together as partners. One can imagine this merging
process continuing, producing larger and larger intelligences... Can you
imagine yourself one day saying:

    "I will no longer be much compared to one of these merged
    intelligences. No matter how smart I am on my own, these larger
    intelligences are smarter! Eventually I'll see that my personal
    pride isn't worth it -- after all, I'm not doing much at all
    compared to one of *them*!"

Alternately, two individuals may retain their seperate consciousness but
choose to create a new intelligence, trained by both of them -- a child.
The neuroscientists learned that it takes 7 years (normalized to the
year 2000, or about 4.1 years today) to train the new intelligence
enough to consider it an adult. The natural human generation time has
gone from 14 or 15 down to 7.

The mortals will have one unique experience that we might never enjoy
ourselves -- watching the other half of their society accelerate and
ultimately reach lightning speed. As computing speed continues to
improve, everyone gets more processing time for their money, and no-one
foregoes the opportunity to keep up with everyone else. The
child-training process becomes faster (in real time). The human
generation time continues to decrease. Generations come more and more
quickly. As the population grows, invention happens faster and computing
speed evolves more quickly too. To the immortals, this speeding up won't
be happening -- as if traveling at near the speed of light -- they'll
see the physical world *slowing down*.

For those still waiting to decide if they want to step over, just
remember: you *can* take it with you. Everything you are doing now is
useful if it can ultimately be transferred into etherspace. Your
posessions are useful if they can be digitized, photographed, or
otherwise brought over. Your home TV movies and journals of all kinds
will be very useful; they will provide the immortals with a way of going
back into the old world and visualizing what it was like.

Hey Jeff, hope things are going well. Yeah I know I didn't write back
when I said I would. I'll give you 50 as soon as I'm off link.

Today's the big day: I'm 100 years old. Of course, I keep reminding
Linda that back on Earth I'm only 86 (and she's barely 85!). Anyway,
we're spending the day in the holoprogram I picked out last spring, the
Las Vegas Luxor honeymoon suite, circa 1995. The rest of Linda's
presents are -- appropriate to the setting. That's all I'll say here.
Even in Etherspace there are circles of confidentiality.

So, let me know when you're coming across. (-: Ha ha, only serious. I
really *do* get that you're ready for it though. I wouldn't say it if I
didn't! Anyway, there's an open house at 4:00 PM on the 18th, your time.
I'd love to have you there.

Call back anytime, I'll set the machine if it's nighttime. You've got a
day or else it's *your* 50! (-:  See ya, jerk

As stated, this has the wiff of decomposing crustaceans.  If true, I
think a lot of critical details on "bits of genetic material" are

different ways have different plausibilities.

I just want to add that another limiting factor simply is our eating
habbits. If we would stop eating  so much meat, we would loose a level

Sarcasm will get you nowhere.

What keeps me going, which I assume is what's forced you to rise to this
heights of biting wit, is the prevalent assumption around these parts
that not-black == white, at least in economic terms.  (Gee, if it isn't
pure market capitalism it MUST be Stalinism!) Ignoring fine distinctions
such as free trade based on barter [direct exchange of goods] or money
[an indirection layer for goods and services] or other systems [LETS?],
it assumes that any market system is always good, and any non-market
system is always coercive and, of necessity, bad. Which makes about as
much sense as declaring that families are evil because they are
tantamount to a communist dictatorship; after all, in an old-fashioned
nuclear family there tends to be a coercive relationship between parents
and children, there may well be a degree of economic dependency enforced
by law or custom between the adults, and they hold property collectively.

I guess I just don't like the way that people who claim to be committed
to dynamic optimism seem to be so afraid of the bogey-man. Massive
exercises in irrational behaviour tend to reap the seeds they sowed
to begin with.

In the UK. A country where the nearest thing to a libertarian politician
ever to gain power was fairly regulary burned in effigy until she resigned.

That's a good idea. (Hell, let 'em pay companies that exist specifically 
to fix atmospheric CO2 by growing wood, right?) Only it requires an
extra level of regulation. Who's going to make sure the companies 
do what they're supposed to do?

Nice idea. Er, how smart are these robots? If they're
less than human-equivalent, who tells 'em what to do? If they're
human-equivalent or smarter, don't they have anything better to do with
their free time than pander to the whims of cerebrally- hypertrophied
apes? And where are they going to get the raw materials from?

You paint a pretty picture. Somehow I don't think it's going to be
that simple ...
 
Hmm. you might want to read some of Iain M. Banks' novels for a
different take on a robotopia. (Personally, I'd _like_ to be a Mind.)

What version of AI do you have in mind?

There's a fascinating essay by Vernor Vinge (Whole Earth Review, Fall 1994
issue) in which he makes a distinction between "weakly superhuman" AI
and "strongly superhuman" AI. 

In a nutshell: weak superhuman AI is qualitatively human-equivalent. It
may run faster than us (cramming a month of thinking into a few minutes)
but it's still not fundamentally better at thinking than a human being
with equivalent information resources and subjective time.

A strongly superhuman AI is a different kettle of fish: it compares to us
-- or to a weakly superhuman AI -- the way we compare to a dog or a squirrel.

Vinge postulates that if AI is possible, what we get to start with is a
weakly superhuman AI. However, by adding resources we can enable the 
WSAI to do a lot more thinking in a given period of time than we can --
so if it is _possible_ for human-equivalents to give rise to something
qualitatively superior, then the WSAI probably will generate a SSAI
(and do so rather faster than human onlookers expect).

An intereting point is that Vinge bases his idea of the singularity on
the immediate consequences of an SSAI emerging within our light cone. We
simply _can't_ guess at such an entity's motivations or interests. It
might be an omnibenevolent Tipler-style god-wannabee, or it might be a
Terminator-style kill-em-all Skynet; if you ask me, both 
contingencies are about equal (low) probabilities.

One possibility that occurs to me is that there's an obvious trade-off
between expansion in space and expansion in time. If you want to get lots of
thinking done (but a finite amount -- this isn't a rehash of the old debate
over closed/open universes) do you prefer to expand into a large spherical
region of space, or to stay tightly focussed, run slower, and occupy a long
tubular slice of spacetime? Hmm...

Uh, Thatcher was a hell of a long way from a libertarian; she raised taxes
while claiming to reduce them, increased government centralisation while
claiming to want to reduce government power, not to mention railroading the
'Ugly Guns Ban' of 1988 through Parliament. While she was able to take
an economic basket-case and turn it into a reasonably functioning economy,
so did Hitler.

So certainly more libertarian than Callaghan or Tony Benn, but nowhere near
as libertarian as many nineteenth century politicians.

> until she resigned.

I thought Major was voted in to replace her.

>(Clue: the whole world doesn't work the same way as your back yard, or mine.)

Yes it does; the people who were burning her effigy were the ones who
were no longer able to skive off at work or live off my taxes, the
same kind of people who have been protesting in France and other
socialist nations. America just hasn't yet gone as far down the socialist
road, so there's less resistance from those outside the government who
benefit from legitimized theft.

And if the people really disliked her that much, why did 40-45% of them 
keep voting for her?

Not neccesarily true; if the estimates published in 'Extropy' in the past
are realistic, a human-level SI could easily fit into the head of a racoon.
One of the characters in a short story I'm writing is a human-level SI
in a ferret's body.

It does to me; unlike many people here I'm in no rush to upload. But in
the long run I don't think they'll survive as anything other than cool
pets for SIs.

Also a country where they celebrate a double-edged patsy-terrorist by
blowing up fireworks and singing ambiguous songs about blowing up Parliament.

Of course, they burn Guy Fawkes in effigy too, now don't they?

This subject is speculated upon quite extensively in The First Immortal.
By the end of the story in 2125, the Earth's population exceeds 20
billion, against a government "goal" of 26 billion humans by 2150, and
there is earlier discussion among scientists about how humanity might
eventually reach comfortably into the trillions.  
I'd enjoy receiving feedback from any Extropians who read the book.

Point of order: first, she resigned (under extreme pressure). _Then_ there
was a nasty little scramble for the top of the greasy pole, which Major
somehow won.

Unask that question, or I'll ask it's inverse: why did the electoral 
system let someone who was voted _against_ by 55-60% of the electorate
retain power? (Answer: "first past the post". Which we -- in the UK and
also in the USA -- have been conditioned to believe is a "fair" way of
running elections. Yeah, and I have this neat bridge you might want to

Check out "Goddard's Metaphysics" where you will find in
the publication "The Logical Verification of the Mystical 
Experience" the mathematical proof of holistic identity 
and a short outline of Zero Mechanics, which is the meta-
physical system I have developed over the years of which 
my holistic identity theory forms the logical basis.

I encourage you to evaluate zero mechanics and offer 
any constructive critique that you feel is warranted. 
I always present my metaphysical theories in a matter-
of-fact fashion, which does not mean I do not allow
that they may be missing the mark. I believe this
analysis presents the hard mathematical proof of 
the theory of holistic identity I have promoted.

GODDARD'S METAPHYSICS: http://www.erols.com/igoddard/meta.htm 

Also be sure to check out Frank Wiley's analysis (which
you will find at Goddard's Metaphysics page) that proves 
that infinity equals zero. Both Wiley's and my own pre-
sentation are offered as proofs of the truthfulness of
the mystical, or spiritual, experience of enlightenment.

We don't have to wait around for this to happen perfectly for everyone.
There are whole classes today for whom this is effectively true.  For many,
market signals all point towards taking up space in somebody's cubicle farm.
This is called Knowledge Work.

The only incentive to really get off your butt (not literally of course)
is to be able consume excess goods and services comprising the next
level conceived of by marketers and desired by a television-addicted
population.  (or is it?)

What's your point?  Is this an ideal:  to sit on your butt?  I would argue
that a little extrapolation seems to indicate that the abundance of goods
and services you speak about (at least as they are provided in our
current economic system) is predicated on a life of subtle slavery
for many of the most "productive" (==predictable) citizens whose
economic lives (production and consumption patterns) are hardly
matters of conscious choice or will.  What does it mean to "do what
we like" when the requirements for life are so easy to obtain at even
the most modest levels of modern American society and most of the
visible production and consumption is driven by marketing?

The fundamental capital is human capital; therefore the alternative
- -- the ONLY alternative -- to capitalism, is slavery.  I for one will
be quite upset if capitalism ceases to exist.

---------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------

To:  "Warrl kyree Tale'sedrin"

What you fail to see is that BOTH capitalism  AND communism, are ways
of  FORCING humans to produce and buy goods and services, OR STARVE TO
DEATH.

Therefore,  it is not logical to say that the ONLY  ALTERNATIVE to
capitalism is slavery for humans.

In a Robotopia, only the robots,  which may soon provide humans a bounty
of whatever we desire absolutely free,  could be considered slaves.

This raises another question:  If the robots are smart enough to supply
all the goods and services  humans could demand, why would they?

I have spent the last thirty years as an accountant in private practice
advising clients on how to cut costs and optimize production.  I have 
discussed this notion at length in my Robotopia article.

http://www.cyberlewis.com/graphic/posthuman/topia/Robotopia.htm

I, too, will miss capitalism if it is replaced by Robotopia.

I have had fun rough housing in boardrooms and bankers' parties.   From
an early age, capitalism has been in my blood.

I am also a realist.  After thirty years in accounting, watching some
business prosper while others collapsed into insolvancy, I can see where
my advice and that of other accountants is leading.    But I can't stop
the flow toward better, more efficient technologies.   Business,
listening to their accountants, will continue competing, continue
cutting costs, continue to upgrade equipment, until the last cent of
cost is sqeezed to zero and machines are doing all the work without
human assistance.    Any business which refuses to cut cost, will be put
out of business that much sooner by those which do.

Look at transitors:

Bardeen, Shockley and Brattain invented the transitor in Bell Labs in
1948.  Bell Labs offered to license  the chip technology for $25,000
against future royalties.  Sony was the only taker.

Those first transitors sold for $45 each.  Today, transitors sell at
.00001cent each when combined by the millions in computer chips that are
smaller than the original transitor.   In accordance with Moore's law,  
these trends continue today actually accellerating  with each new
generation of chip design.   The power of a computer costing millions in
1960 can now be bought for under a thousand dollars.

Next, look at what is happening in the browser wars.

Microsoft has been  giving away its browser, Internet Explorer (often
bundled, of course).

Netscape then sees its market share dwindle from 90% to 80% to 70% etc.

Last week, Netscape anounced it will also give away its browser, plus
make the source code for Version 5 available free to world on its web
site.

Good old capitalist  competition is at work again, driving costs for
browser users to zero. . .absolutely FREE. . .

Look at the web itself.  From the users point of view, there are
tremendous amounts of goods and services that are already absolutely
free.

Look around the fast changing, high tech world we all share.  It is not 
much of a stretch  to say:

" Perhaps we should all realize that capitalism will soon become an
absurdity and cease to exist. . ."
 

Please take a second look at my  Robotopia article.

A very nice posting, it mirrors my views perfectly. I have never
really liked the idea of farms in the first place (I'm a 100% city
person - when I as a 5 year old was brought out into nature I
immediately found a concrete slab to sit on :-). Of course, in order
for hydroponics to become widely used it must be cheap and efficient
enough. I wonder if it could be streamlined into a nearly
self-sustaining system, driven by solar power with minimal
requirements for human service.

Note that the buildings need to avoid shadow; this limits their use in
many dense city settings. In many ways it is a situation similar to a
forest, where trees compete for sunlight.

I think population density and culture are important factors
here. Humans get stressed when the population density is too large,
but this can be affected by cultural conditioning (compare Japan with
Australia), and with some care we might design working societies even
at very high densities. The problem is, as always, that even if
something can be designed in principle it might not be implementable
in practice. Most likely there is an upper limit to how densely we can
build and retain our sanity.

> Any speculations on the results of a
> population several times larger than the current one?

Much will depend on how dense communications are. My guess is that
eith enough humans even mass media will not be homogenizing enough,
and mankind will diversify intensely into numerous incompatible
cultures.

I think it was something similar to this technique which was used by JPL
to get some Mars Pathfinder pictures in "super resolution".  They took
multiple pictures at slightly different angles and combined them digitally
to produce higher resolution than the camera was capable of.

The human eye is constantly jiggling.  If you manage to stare at an
object without moving your eyes, it disappears.  Using artificial means
to stabilize an image on the retina, it quickly fades to invisibility.
So it is conceivable that the eye could produce higher resolution images
than the spacing of its photoreceptors would imply.

You mean halogen lightbulbs? I don't know about the situation in the
US, but here in Sweden they are actively pushed by the electricity
companies (yes, our electricity companies try to make us consume less
electricity, and the liquor monopoly does it best to discourage
drinking. Sweden is fantastic :-).

As for hydroponics, yes, electric light would do with the right kind
of illumination. No need for skyscrapers: Genetic Engineering News had
an article in March 15 1995 about growing plants in an underground
mine, with very positive results. 

With enough energy, most things are possible. Sunlight is nice because
it is so available in most places (i.e. everywhere but Sweden :-) - I
really like the idea of skyscrapers with glass walls facing the south,
filled with greenery. The hydroponics could be grown in trellises
between the outer wall and an inner, thinner glass wall with
apartments on the inside. That way you could get both sunlight,
greenery and climate control.

Have you ever read Douglas Adams' book _The Long Dark Tea-time of the Soul_?
There's a character (actually a robot) called the electric monk: he was
constructed to believe things; anything you told him to, without question.
He starts out in the book unable to move about because a malfunction has
made him believe that everything in the world is a particular shade of
pink, so he can't see anything else.

Isn't it blindingly obvious that any major advance in energy production,
which would instantly make a millionaire out of the first guy to get to
the patent office, can't possibly be "supressed" by anyone, and the
larger the corporation, the /less/ likely it is that there will be leaks.
Hell, Texaco couldn't even keep secret that one of their executives
referred to black employees as "black jelly beans".  You honestly think
that same gang--and every other company--could keep secret an efficient
motor?  And besides, it wouldn't be them who created it--it would be
engine makers, and they have no love of oil companies; in fact, they'd
love nothing more than to drop the price of oil to nothing to make their
profits go up.

There's a very good reason this "information" has never been leaked--
because it never existed.

The technique of enhancing resolution beyond the acuity of individual
receptors is already in use in at least one tethered digital camera.
Quoting from their FAQ:

How does the Pixera Camera achieve a one-million-pixel resolution from a
1/3" CCD?

                       Pixera camera achieves the one-million pixel resolution
                       through its innovative optical image capture
                       mechanism. The Pixera camera captures four frames of
                       the image and overlays them, increasing the resolution
                       of the image to four times the resolution of the CCD
                       chip (250,000 pixels).

Most crops plants, when planted in a field, completely cover the field,
capturng all the available solar energy that a plant can capture. To
beat this in a multi-level skyscraper, you'll have to add energy. What
source do you propose? Obviously not solar. Unless you indend to build
solar cells that are more efficient than plants, you will be better off
simply replacing your solar collectors with farms, either on earth or
in space. Your only other alternatives are fossil fuels or nuclear
(fusion or fission.) Burning fossil fuels to convert the energy to
photonc to then reconvert it to plant mass is horribly inefficient.
why not engineer a bug to convert the fuel directly?

For green plants, it's cheaper to build single-level greenhouses.
The reason we have farms instead of greenhouses is  ... economics!
if greehouses were more cost-effective, farmers would install them.
It's true that governments interfere with the economics of the
agriculural
sector more than with any other, but the underlying economics are
still there.

As Leno suggested, the title of her next book will be "It Takes a Village to Keep

Today, the White House was complaining that all of these sexual scandals are
interfering with Clinton's ability to govern the country. I have just one
question and a statement  in response:

Why didn't you think of that BEFORE you unzipped?

The root of the word dork is that it is meant to describe someone who tries to

This weekend I saw "Wag the Dog" and I was just STUNNED by the parallels to the
current story. Keep your hats on and get out your New World Order detectors when
we start bombing Albania..... ;)

If the current scandal IS manufactured, I give them a big aesthetic thumbs down
for complete unoriginality in that they are reduced to stealing the plot of a
movie.

That's true.  Overall, Australia has the highest urban density in the
world.  (Most of the country is effectively waste land with no water.)  The
Japanese are far more spread out.

It's not capitalism that forces people to work or starve to death.  It's
*reality* that forces us to work or starve to death.  In case you forgot,
your body needs food to live, and food takes work to produce.  Capitalism
doesn't force you to buy goods and services; it just provides an

The ultra-efficient light bulbs are for sale, today, at your local hardware
store.  They're the new funky compact fluorescents.  Nobody's suppressing
them, they're just not so popular, for various reasons.

What would a RON box be?  The British equivalent of "None of the

I asked a British friend if they burned Mr. Fawkes in effigy to 
denounce his intentions...

or to bemoan his incompetence.

He thought it was an interesting question, but didn't answer.

I don't think we need capitalism OR communism to make that happen.

I've heard numerous stories along this line.

There is one essential fact:

**ALL** US patents are a matter of public record unless **THE US 
GOVERNMENT** has stepped in and classified them.

If you hear a story about an oil company suppressing a patent for a 
highly efficient engine, there are three possibilities:

(1) the story is true, the patent is on file and publically 
accessible, and someone should produce the patent number so that 
anyone can confirm the story -- failure to do so is careless 
rumor-mongering.

(2) the story is true and THE US GOVERNMENT -- not an oil company -- 
is suppressing it.

(3) the story is false, at least to the extent that no such device 
was patented.

Considering that the first such story I heard was from my father and 
alleged that the high-performance high-mileage engine was developed 
in the early 1960s, I am quite certain that at least some of these 
patents (if they ever existed) have expired by now.  They would still 
be on file and it would now be legal for anyone to start producing 
them without any licensing requirements or royalties.

There's another twist to that.  It was a standing joke in the Soviet 
Union that said country's greatest inventor was Comrade Reguspatoff.  
If you wonder at the joke, let me add a bit of punctuation to the 
comrade's name:
          Reg.  U.S. Pat. Off.
If such super-engines, super-carburetors, etc.  were on file with the 
US patent office, we *would* see them in Soviet-made military 
vehicles.

We don't.

Unless you assume that the global news media are also in on this 
conspiracy to keep these things from us.

Re-Open Nominations. In other words: all the above are DISQUALIFIED,

Ever heard of WINE? Or TWIN? (See http://www.winehq.com/ or 
http://www.willows.com/ for details.)  BOTH of these are (a) GPL'd,
and (b) run Windows 3.1 binaries fairly well, and Wine also runs
some Win95/WinNT binaries. Work is in progress on turning Wine into
a full-blown Win32 API implementation.

The problem is that all Microsoft has to do is move the goal-posts once 
every three years, by adding a new API to some valuable service. The
commercial developers who Microsoft want to help get help aid in
updating/understanding their APIs, so that new applications rely on
it; the white-room cloners on the Wine team have to run just to keep
up, otherwise not all the bleeding edge applications will run on their
shim, and the luser-base and PHB's will complain "wine is no good, it
can't run xyzzy release 75.4b1".

I have a PC at home. It runs Linux applications. It also runs java
bytecode, Macintosh applications, DOS applications, SCO Xenix or
UNIX applications, and Windows 3.1 applications (without needing a
reboot :). But will it satisfy someone who wants to run Lotus Notes
Server for NT? Nope.

One proposal I've seen floated a while ago was to take the Windows
APIs are in effect grab 'em from Microsoft, saying "this is now an
ANSI or ISO standard for a windowing applications programming interface
on intel hardware: live with it". Microsoft would still own their code
base, and would be free to produce a superset of ANSI Windows, but the
availability of a standards document and alternative implementations
would drive a post into the ground and send a message to developers: "if
you use proprietary extensions to the open standard, your code may not
run on other systems". Unfortunately it's either three years too late
or two years too early to do this right now -- M$ are migrating from
a 16-bit API to a 32-bit API, and freezing a standard in the middle would
result in a horrendous mess. But I think by designating the APIs as
an open standard, some of the sting might be taken out of their 
ownership by a single monopolistic company. After all, who would have
complained in 1995 about UNIX being owned by Sun or SCO, even though
those companies shipped most of the branded UNIX boxes in circulation?
UNIX was an open standard, administered by The Open Group (or X/Open
as it then was). 

Open standards are bad for monopolies. If Windows was an open standard
rather than Microsoft's +3 magic aluminium baseball bat of compatability,
I'd have a lot less trouble with it.

  There is also the E-Lamp, which is like a fluorescent lamp, ecept that the
gasses inside get excited by radio waves generated by a coil in the base of the
lamp. These are about 20% more efficient than compact fluorescents and don't
require the ugly tube mess.

Another development you can look at on my web site
http://homepages.together.net/~retroman/ and follow the 'business' link to my
Northstar Technologies and Lighting page. This product I developed in 1991 and
92, did market research, got manufacturing set up and brought to market. It is a
retrofit kit for exit signs. Compared to an incandescent lit exit sign, my EL
Retrofit Kit was 99.7% efficient, and while incandescent lamps last for a few
months, my lamp lasts for 30 years, with a 10 year guarrantee. We sold these from
92-95 mostly in the Northwest, but also in California and scattered locations
around the country, for around $65.00 (at which point I was breaking even, due to
the cost of the technology. WHile this sounds like a lot, these kits were able to
save the owners between $1000-4000 over a 20-30 year period.

Why didn't we clean up the market? three main reasons:
1) the energy conservation rebate programs funded by the energy department and
your local utilities set fixed dollar rates for any retrofit of a certain minimum
efficiency. Because more efficient retrofits tend to use more expensive
technology, the less efficient technologies get a preponderance of  the
subsidies, since a larger percentage of their cost gets paid for by the
government as opposed to the end user, so people are more likely to buy the least
efficient/least cost solution that meets the minimum requirements to earn rebates
from the government. Since ours was the most efficient, we were the most biased
against in the market by these government programs.

2) Our manufacturer, Loctite/Luminescent Systems, Inc., which at the time was the
only company with the technology to give us that 30 year life/10 year warrantee,
lied to us about thier focus on developing our product to the point that we got
18 months behind schedule, and lost a big advantage in our marketing window. (I
wound up getting several of the top people there fired over that)

3) because of this loss of time, the big lighting companies were able to come out
with retrofit kits using LEDs that were not as efficient as ours (3-4 watts as
opposed to our 1/3 of one watt), but were half of our cost, so they were able to
gain marketshare much quicker, and used the earned credibility of that
marketshare to unjustifiably smear our technology and our company.

Now, outside of these LED kits being made by chinese slaves, I really cannot say
anything bad about them, except possibly that they were not quite as efficient as
my product. They are moving the market from use of 2 20 watts bulbs to one 3-4
watt kit in each exit sign, which is a good thing.

As for myself, we sold over 6000 kits, and I learned a lot about business. My
kits are saving 48,000 kilowatt hours a year around the country, and thousands of
hours of labor and dollars of bulb expenses. So, I've got a lot of good karma
from that, at the very least.

However, my story is an excellent example of how government takes good ideas an
royally fucks them up so that the policies that are suppose to attain those ideas
actually impede them.

U.S. electric companies are very active in encouraging conservation 
as well, for very valid economic reasons.  Conservation over the last 
2 decades has enabled most of the industry to avoid building new base 
capacity, an *extremely* expensive proposition.  Since they are a 
regulated monopoly, and prices are set by government bureaucrats, it 
can be very difficult to recover these capital costs.  These facts, 
by the way, are the reason nuclear power is considered "uneconomic" 
in this country, not anything inherent to nuclear technology.

Liquor companies, on the other hand.....

Regarding the worry and concern of cheap food.

Please explain why for several decades and currently the Government is
involved in PRICE SUPPORT?  In a free market given todays technology the cost
of agricultural products would be much less than it currently is...else why
the current price support structure?

Also...we're no where near being short on land...I drive across Arizona, New
Mexico, Nevada etc about once a weekly lately...theres LOTS of open land out
there..some places it's a hundred miles between habitations...(desert)
....just needs a little water is all...seems a pipeline system from say...the
great lakes? would be money better spent than veggie high rises.

Agricultural skyscrapers is all very nice...unless you've worked in the
agricultural business in the past...then it seems awfully impracticle.
Consider all that's involved in ......wheat production for
instance....planting, growing (weeding, feeding, watering), harvesting.

I currently have two John Deere on my trailer, enroute to California.  Big
Brutes...able to plow square miles per day.  It'd take SOME skyscraper to
match the surface area these guys can cover....and then after the harvest
..(harvest is a messy business)...you gonna process the wheat in the middle of
the city?

I encounter a multitude of silly rules designed to keep machinery (my truck)
OUT of cities...I don't think that mindset is gonna change any time soon.

I'm NOT saying it COULDN'T happen...I just think it unlikely given the infra
structure changes need and the less than obvious benefits...(and I think if it
did.....it'd be a pyramid...perhaps a MONSTER arcology)

Oh...by the way...with an increase in CO2 content in the air...farming becomes
more effecient...less land needed for more crops....(lets hear it for Global
Warming!!!!!)

 I see no reason to believe this. It is true that solving the protein
folding problem would speed up nanotech development, but the protein
folding problem appears to be at least as hard as producing a crude
molecular assembler. Zyvex appears to have a serious approach to building
an assembler that doesn't involve complex organics, and Bruce Smith and
Markus Krummenacker have some well thought out plans about making an
assembler from protein and dna that doesn't seem to require any software
advances. (A company with good protein modeling software would be a
good investment regardless of nanotech).

>there is a great deal of continuity in technological progress.  If you want

 People who advocate nanotech without trying to understand the technical
details tend to believe in unrealistic discontinuities. I don't think
the technically minded nanotech enthusiasts make this mistake.

 Only if you stretch the word market well beyond its original meaning
of a place where people buy and sell things (i.e. make it synonymous
with a free system, in which case the word market doesn't serve much
purpose).

 Which would still exist in a free non-propertarian system, which most
people wouldn't think of as capitalist.

 Not much. The violater would get harrased a bit, and wouldn't derive

 How would Linux be different if there were no property rights for

 a) reducing transaction costs is hard; and
 b) Coase only proved that the result would have optimal efficiency;
 most people use a broader notion of optimality which includes some
 measure of how much property they own.

Yes, there is plenty of land, but that is not the point. The point is
that you grow the plants right in the middle of the city, next to the
consumers. Very low transport costs, and you can get extremely fresh
vegetables directly (with no soil to wash away!). Besides, if you keep
the hydroponics sealed, you can avoid many pests and have no need for
pesticides.

This will not likely replace all crops, but some vegetables can most
likely be profitably grown in this way. There is already a mall
somewhere in the US (saw it on Discovery Channel) were this is done,
apparently earning real money.

It seems that you think of agriscrapers as something similar to normal
agriculture. But if you look at real hydroponics, it is a quiet affair
with plants tending themselves in plastic nutrient vats and electrical
elevators to bring down the vats for harvest. No need for huge
machinery (or rather, it is part of the building).

Depends a lot on how the climate changes. I seem to recall an old
study made of productivity of wheat and other crops as a function of
temperature and moisture. Some areas of the US were very near the
maximum for at least one crop (I think it was wheat), and any change
would decrease productivity sharply. It is not easy to move farms to
suit a changed climate (although it would be nice to see wineyeards in
the hills of northern Sweden :-).

     At the 'Freedom Association' in 1979, when I worked there, the 
     Research Chief had a poster on his Office wall:
      
     It showed a caped Guy Fawkes with cherry-bomb, and carried the legend:
      
     "Guy Fawkes: the only man to enter Parliament with honest intentions"
      
     According to founder Brian Crozier's later-published autobiography  
     'Free Agent', the 'Freedom Association' was a joint MI6/CIA project...

	I. ZERO IDENTITY

	The Conservation Of Identity


	THE LAW

	Every ID (identity) unit (attribute) corresponds
	to a symmetrical ID unit such that net ID = 0.


	THE PROOF

	ID attributes express relational difference.
	"A unit of ID" = "a degree of difference." The
	ID units, or attributes, of A are defined by the
	difference between A and ~A. For example, the ID
	units of the numerical entity "1" are defined by
	differences between 1 and numbers that are not 1:


	           Degrees Of Difference
	            Between 1, 2, and 3

	                   1  2  3
	                  _________
	               1 | 0  1  2 |
	                 |         |
	               2 |-1  0  1 |
	                 |         |
	               3 |-2 -1  0 |
	                 -----------

	               ID Attributes
	               of 1, 2 and 3

	Each ID unit quantifies the difference between 
	two intersecting numerical entities listed along
	the top and the left side of the box. The units 
	listed vertically below the number 1 on the top 
	are the ID units,  or attributes,  of 1 in our 
	universe of discourse containing 1, 2, and 3. 

	As we can see, 1 is 1 less (-1) than 2, while 
	symmetrically, 2 is 1 more (+1) than 1. 1 is 2 
	less (-2) than 3, while  symmetrically 3 is 2 
	more (+2) than 1. -2 is an ID attribute, or
	unit, of 1 relative to 3 just as Mr. Jones
	being shorter than Mr. Johnson by 2 feet
	(-2) is an ID attribute of Mr. Jones.

	As we can see, the sum of all ID units (which
	are the numerical quantifications of degrees of 
	difference) equals zero.  This zero sum of net 
	ID holds regardless of the number of entities 
	in our universe of discourse. For example:


	          Degrees Of Difference
	        Between 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


	               1  2  3  4  5
	              _______________
	           1 | 0  1  2  3  4 |
	             |               |
	           2 |-1  0  1  2  3 |
	             |               |
	           3 |-2 -1  0  1  2 |
	             |               |
	           4 |-3 -2 -1  0  1 |
	             |               |
	           5 |-4 -3 -2 -1  0 |
			----------------


	Thus the net difference between all numbers = 0.
	This establishes the "conservation of identity"
	and the "equilibrium of difference" as constants.
	The identification of constants, or laws, is a,
	or the, primary quest of all scientific inquiry.

	The conservation of ID is implicit in everything.
	Due to the conservation of ID, every ID unit you
	gain corresponds to an ID unit lost by not-you.  

	For example: 

	Football team A is the best team, and thus "best"
	is an ID attribute of team A (this attribute can 
	be expressed as ID units by defining the number-
	ical difference between the wins of A and other 
	teams). When team B becomes the best team, team 
	B gains (+) the ID attribute team A looses (-).

	There are two people, A and B. A is "the tallest 
	person," and thus "tall" is an ID attribute of A.
	But when B grows taller than A, A looses the ID 
	attribute that B gains, and  symmetrically, A 
	gains the ID attribute B lost, which is "short."
	Such is the zero sum, or conservation, of ID.

	 For further analysis of the zero sum of ID:

	   http://www.erols.com/igoddard/0-id.htm 

	 http://www.erols.com/igoddard/0-differ.htm 

	Identity is the basis of logic, and the physical 
	universe adheres to and defines the laws of logic. 
	Accordingly, the conservation of identity defines
	the structural nature of the physical universe.



	II. ZERO SPACE-TIME-MOTION 

	The Conservation of Space-Time-Motion


	THE LAW

	Every unit of forward (+) space-time-motion corresponds
	to a symmetrical unit of backward (-) space-time-motion 
	such that net space-time-motion always equals zero.


	THE PROOF

	All relative and absolute space-time-motion is symmetrical
	and is therefore composed of equal yet opposite components
	the sum of which equals zero. For the full analysis visit:

      This is an excellent concise summary.  But there are a few puzzles.

      
      Here are a few, chosen (almost) at random.
      
      [1] French-Rumanian aeronautic engineer Henri Coanda (of 'Coanda 
      Bubble' fame!) was the world's leading aerofoil section designer -- 
      his was the first library of aerofoil sections.  In [1932] he 
      invented 'Lenticular Aerodynes' capable of VTOL _and_ fast 
      translational flight.  Idea is, we direct blown airflows over the 
      craft's surface (just like blown flaps) and it rises vertically into 
      the air.  Vectored thrust gives you gentle translation into level 
      flight.  The aerodynamics are magnificent (especially for air 
      combat dogfights and RPVs).

      Coanda didn't have lightweight superefficent turbo-compressors.  We 
      surely do, now.
      
      I phoned them up, and discussed this project extensively with 
      Lockheed's Advanced Projects Division at Palmdale three or four 
      years back.  The name 'Richard M. Bissell' opens many doors...  They 
      built the U-2s and SR-71s together.

      Coanda's idea works...  Would you believe us if we landed one right 
      on the White House lawn?  >:-}

      Oddly enough, Lockheed Palmdale later sent _me_ a non-disclosure 
      agreement... >:-}


            
      [2] BHT (Butylated Hydroxytoluene, generic, E321) is a potent zapper 
      of lipid-coated viruses as well as free radicals (Ref: Pearson & 
      Shaw, 'L:ife Extension').  No side effects, five bucks a kilo. Much 
      better than megadoses of Vit. C; and your threshhold of infection is 
      raised by orders of magnitude.  Existing viral infections are 
      suppressed.  Just go look at the list of lipid-coated viruses 
      sometime...  No more 'flu either, Max!



      [3] Internal Evaporative Cooling by water-injection. 
      Internal-combustion engines run much more economically, cooler and 
      cleaner, if you inject water into the explosion cycle.  The big WWI 
      Wright Cyclone radials (I've flown with these!) showed 50% fuel 
      economies.
      
      Water is vastly cheaper than petrol...  OK, you need two tanks, and 
      you have to fill up at two pumps.  The technology can usually be 
      retrofitted.  Scrap the (absurd) external cooling system.
      

      [4] If we direst .2MeV protons into Lithium-7 nuclei, we get this:
      
      .2 MeV proton --> Li-7 --> Be-8 --> 2 Alpha particles at 17 MeV.

      This is a _fusion interaction_ which takes place at Standard 
      Temperature and Pressure, and which shows a huge energy surplus.
      Cockroft and Walton got a Nobel Prize for discovering it in [1932].

      In principle, a fusion reactor would comprise a proton accelerator 
      and a lithium target and a heat recovery system.  All 'non-hit' 
      energy losses are in principle recovrable (ref: energy conservation 
      laws).  For every fusion 'hit' you get a 17MeV payout.

      Oh well, who is John Galt?

Technological progress is never certain, and there are a lot of great
inventions that never got anywhere because of lack of interest among
researchers, superiors, investors or the public, or quietly failed due
to obscure problems or non-obvious flaws. The mortality of good ideas
is frighteningly high. And people tend to stick with tried-and-proven
technologies, even if they are worse than the new alternatives. Very
sad, but it keeps Microsoft and internal combustion in business.

Since this scandal is in no way like watergate, and is on the other side of the
political aisle, bimbogate is not a good name for these events. I would suggest that
the term Bubbaquiddick be used....

Hmm, I got interested and did a small medline search. While most of
the stuff tends to support your claims, I also found the article
abstracted below, which suggests that BHT may not be as great as
Pearson & Shaw claim due to carcinogenic properties.

[ It should be noted that many scientific biogerontologists apparently
regard Pearson & Shaw as coloful but unscientific (cf. Walford, _The
120-Year Diet_). ]

[Toxicology of the synthetic antioxidants BHA and BHT in
comparison with the natural antioxidant vitamin E].

Kahl R, Kappus H
Abteilung fur Pharmakologie, Universitat Hamburg, Deutschland. 

The toxicology of the food preservatives butylhydroxyanisole (BHA) and
butylhydroxytoluene (BHT) as well as the naturally occurring vitamin E
(alpha-tocopherol) is described. In high dosages all three compounds
induce in animals impairment of blood clotting, which can be explained
by an antagonism with vitamin K. Specific toxic effects to the lung
have only been observed with BHT. The other described toxic effects of
BHA and BHT are less characteristic and often occur only after high
dosage and long-term treatment. However, BHA induces in animals
tumours of the forestomach, which are dose dependent, whereas BHT
induces liver tumours in long-term experiments. Because there is no
indication of genotoxicity of BHA and BHT, all published findings
agree with the fact that BHA and BHT are tumour promoters. In contrast
to BHA and BHT, vitamin E is not carcinogenic. On the other hand, all
three antioxidants have also anticarcinogenic properties. The intake
of the necessary high doses as for these effects are, however,
contraindicated with BHA and BHT because of their carcinogenic
effects. The present overview concludes that the concentrations of BHA
and BHT nowadays used in food, drugs and cosmetics are probably
harmless. In addition, vitamin E can also be used in higher doses
without the occurrence of adverse effects.

If you, like me, enjoyed Lego as a child, you'll find this interesting
(even more so if you have children). In fact, I'm tempted to go back to
playing with Lego now...

<excerpt>A thinking Lego? Blocks now come with computer chips=20

Copyright =A9 1998 Reuters=20



LONDON (January 27, 1998 12:49 p.m. EST http://www.nando.net) - Toy maker
Lego unveiled on Tuesday the world's first thinking child's building
brick.


The Danish company launched an intelligent brick equipped with a
micro-computer that will enable children to design, build and program
their own robots.


The manufacturer of interlocking plastic building bricks used by children
all over the world unveiled products it dubbed "a new generation of
intelligent construction toys and learning tools for children" and
incorporating computer technology.


"Now we are able to put the Lego universe into the computer and the
computer into the Lego brick," said Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen, the
third-generation owner and president of the international group, at the
official launch in London.


The basic construction brick was created in 1949 and the addition of
wheels, gears and motors in the 1960s enabled children to build machines
that move.


This third level of innovation allows the new generation of
computer-literate children to give their creations a personality.


A personal computer is used to program the Lego invention using the
intelligent brick which controls the model's motors. Sensors allow the
model to react and respond to its environment independently of the
child.


"When children combine the three levels, there is basically no limit to
what they can create," Kristiansen said.


Gordon Carpenter, Managing Director of Lego UK Ltd, said
computer-literate children aged 10 and older would be able to grasp the
basics of the system in under an hour and would soon be dealing with
concepts previously taught only at university.


"It adds even more to our concepts of aiding imagination, creativity and
development in children," he said.


The privately-owned Lego company has been working on the project for over
a decade with Dr Seymour Papert, Professor of Learning Research at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.


"When you give children this kind of material, very often they perform at
an intellectual level that astonishes their teachers and themselves," he
said.


Children testing the new product have built and programmed musical
instruments which play tunes when light sensors read different colours
and a robotic arm that could pick up a soft-drink can.


A nine-year-old girl built a bird feeder digitally linked to a camera
which took pictures of every bird that landed on the feeder platform.


Lego has also created a computer game to complement the intelligent brick
used in the models, providing a futuristic fantasy environment called
Lego Technic City of Tomorrow which sets the scene for models that 'come
alive' on the floor.

I was simply using protein modelling software as an example.  My point was merely that there are better investments in technology (from the standpoint of probable ROI) than nanotech and similar technologies.  If your interest is geared more toward investing in technology rather than investing your money, then nanotech is a good choice.

As far as nanotech is concerned, my personal bias is towards protein/wetware implementations.  While non-organic approaches (like Zyvex) are much easier to engineer, I believe that complex organics are more likely to provide the first usable nanotech.  The engineering is more difficult, but there is a huge database of prior art (i.e. nature) that can be borrowed from to solve many of the problems involved.  Implementations like Zyvex's will be very important, but I think they are a lot further off, far enough so that investment in a specific company would be very uncertain.

I agree, but in the context of *investment* the timeline is sufficiently long enough to make the prospects for individual companies uncertain.  If the path is long enough, a great many companies will not be able to fund research from here to nanotech.  My comment was intended to point out the economic issues of nanotech research at this stage of development.

The general flaw in any attempt to "explain" mystical or spiritual aspects (in
the general meaning of such terms) is that invariably such discussions involve
"leaps" (of faith, perhaps) where the argument is disjointed.  I find the same
leaps in the various essays contained at the Goddard Metaphysics site.

The most glaring leap I observed is the "necessity of divinity" as I like to
call it.  It is the assertion that something about the universe "just has to
be"  spiritual or mystical.  This statement is never explained or
rationalized.  The general defense to this lack of rationalization is that such
divine affairs defy our abilities to rationalize them.  If this is the case
then they fit securely in the realm of Agnosticism, the unknowable.  By
"knowable" I mean phenomena of the universe (multiverse) that can be
independently verified by a variety of observers.  To me, it does not make
sense to construct elaborate "proofs" of something that is by its very nature
unprovable.  Furthermore, is it not a paradox to assert that one can use logic
to prove the existence of something that is allegedly transcendental?

Additional Note on Wiley's "The  Nothing that is Everything"
I do not believe that Wiley's argument successfully proves that infinity equals
zero.  What he has shown is that infinity minus infinity equals zero, which I
believe is an uncontended point.  I am probably reading more meaning into
Wiley's paper than prudence would dictate, but technically the universe is a
zero sum game in that (at least according to theory) there is an equal amount
of positive energy (matter, mc^2, and so forth) and negative energy
(antimatter, gravitational energy, etc.)  What evades me is how the zero sum
aspect of the universe can be construed to prove that something about the
universe is "divine".  In my opinion, Wiley uses lots of mathematics, logic,
and analogies wholly unrelated to his objective (substantiate the claim that
something about the universe is divine) to obfuscate the leaps of faith he
takes in his paper.

Whether or not it would be profitable to grow plants in the middle of a
city probably depends mostly on the relative costs of transportation of
food versus construction and operation of an agricultural skyscraper. Is
there any reason to expect that the latter will fall much faster than the
former?

By nearly any objective measure, the country is in far better shapethan it has
been in decades. This isn't all Clinton's doing, of course.
The president get too much of the blame when things go wrong, and
too much credit when they go right.

Perhaps the gov is correct to try and restrain Microsift from taking over the
data sphere.  The Wintel conspiracy expands.  The below snipped text is really
caused by Intel's recent aquisition of DEC's semiconductor operation.  Intel
teaming with the boys in Redmond want to squash all other operating system/HW
alternatives.  Sinister indeed. Will the anti-trust folks allow the Intel take
over of the Alpha manufacturer?   Intel promises to "support" the Alpha for 10
years, but this will be a vehicle for Microsoft domination.

If all the low cost Alpha systems become exclusively available for NT, this
will seriously impede continued development of Linux for Alpha, and close
the door on a cheap, high-performance, non-Microsoft platform.  This was
part of a much larger article on Wired, so I don't know if the normal cheap
Alphas will be phased out or not (I would hope not, but it may affect
availability)."

Neat stuff. 400 Gigabits/sec/fiber. they use the existing fiber bundles
which each have 8 fibers. A rough calculation shows that a total
of ten bundles would carry a phone call for every person in the U.S.
simultaneously.

"None of the above", close enough.  (Although I somewhat favor a 
system where if "none of the above" wins, you get what the people 
voted for and skip the hassle and expense of a new election.  I also 
want the government to be small enough that doing without any 
arbitrary elected official for a term would be no big deal.)

I use "market" in the sense of an arrangement where people trade 
goods, services, and valuables for other goods, services, and 
valuables on the basis that they benefit thereby.  Linux is an 
excellent example.

It would have developed a lot more slowly and would probably be 
called GatesWare, on the basis that Bill Gates is better at marketing 
than Linus is -- even though Bill Gates would not necessarily have 
anything whatsoever to do with the production of it, neither Linus 
nor any of the many thousands of other developers who have jointly 
created Linux would get any credit at all; Gates would get it all.  
(And this lack of proper credit is precisely why it would develop 
more slowly.)

 Pardon? I thought the market and dollar are UP.

Story I heard on the radio on one of those "MoneyTalk" talk shows was that
things were in a bit of turmoil due to zippergate.  I heard that the dollar
was soft on the overseas market and that the stock market was down several
hundred points attributed to our boy.  I've not been able to acces the net for
several days now so I can only go by archaic means of communication available
to me....sorry if it's innacurate.

And I think that, being a multitrillion dollar entity...and my experience in
the lag time between investment in a small business and when it FINALLY begins
to make money...that Ronal Regan deserves more credit for the current state of
the economy than does slick willy.

If what I've read is correct, celery would be a prime candidate for 
growing in this way.  Apparently wild celery produces a natural 
pesticide that makes the stuff taste truly horrid (but then, that's 
my opinion of celery anyway), and the only difference between wild 
and domestic celery is that the latter is very carefully protected 
from bugs.

What of all the effort put into upkeep of grazelands and of cattle and of
havesting cattle?  Does it balance out?  I've only seen some simplified
calculations on this.

Actually, this scandal has one essential similarity to Watergate:

if the President goes down, it won't be because of the initial act -- 
it will be because of the cover-up.

 If what I've read is correct, celery would be a prime candidate for 
 growing in this way.  Apparently wild celery produces a natural 
 pesticide that makes the stuff taste truly horrid (but then, that's 
 my opinion of celery anyway), and the only difference between wild 
 and domestic celery is that the latter is very carefully protected 
 from bugs. >>

also, things grown hydroponically grow much faster, healthier, and with
bigger, tastier fruit, and without pesticides (plus there are a lot of natural
pesticides).

Recently, I have received an Unsolicited Commercial E-mail from you.
I do not like UCE's and I would like to inform you that sending
unsolicited messages to someone while he or she may have to pay for
reading your message may be illegal.  Anyway, it is highly annoying
and not welcome by anyone.  It is rude, after all.

If you think that this is a good way to advertise your products or
services you are mistaken.  Spamming will only make people hate you, not
buy from you.

If you have any list of people you send unsolicited commercial emails to, 
REMOVE me from such list immediately.  I suggest that you make this list 
just empty.

	----------------------------------------------------

If you are not an administrator of any site and still have received
this message then your email address is being abused by some spammer.
They fake your address in From: or Reply-To: header.  In this case,
you might want to show this message to your system administrator, and
ask him/her to investigate this matter.

Note to the postmaster(s): I append the text of UCE in question to
this message; I would like to hear from you about action(s) taken.
This message has been sent to postmasters at the host that is
mentioned as original sender's host (I do realize that it may be
faked, but I think that if your domain name is being abused this way
you might want to learn about it, and take actions) and to the
postmaster whose host was used as mail relay for this message.  If
message was sent not by your user, could you please compare time when
this message was sent (use time in Received: field of the envelope
rather than Date: field) with your sendmail logs and see what host was
using your sendmail at this moment of time.

Thank you.

Don't think of it as a cow, think of it as a "mobile cereal
compression/archive device." (one that happens to be mighty tasty if
you marinate it just right and then toss it onto the bbq :)  The food
problem you allude to is not one of production but of distribution.
It costs too much to move the grain to where it is needed.  We are
much better at growing food than we are at processing and
distributing it; we are so good at it that we have to pay people not
to grow food to prevent over-production.  All of those resources go
into producing meat because the animal converts the grain into a much
denser package which is easier to transport.  The conversion is not
even close to 100% efficient, but it is cheaper than piling the grain
up at the elevator and then watching it rot.

The whole "diet for a small planet" mantra reminds me of Karl Marx
spending time in England and coming to the conclusion that production
was everything because the transportation and distribution system was
so well-developed (comparatively) that he didn't even notice it.  If
you examine the food production system closely you will see that we
have actually become damn good at it; at the beginning of this
century the overwhelming majority of Americans worked on a farm or at
a farm-related job, now fewer than one in a hundred have a job in
agriculture and we still produce too much food.

The urban greenhouse idea is nice, but it will require a major
breakthrough to beat the efficiency of the current system.  You are
adding all sorts of complexity to cut out a single step, namely the
long-haul transportation.  Even if you can make the engineering work
there is nothing to prevent the farmer from using the same methods to
increase the efficiency of her farm and she will always have you beat
on the energy costs (unless the government figures out how to
regulate sunlight :)

jim

p.s. skip the veggie flames please.  I eat very little meat and have
almost completely given it up for health reasons, but spent most of
my childhood on a farm I know that the only reason cattle, sheep, and
most livestock exist in the world today are because we keep them
alive.  If it were not to become burgers and steaks then cows would
have long since become another evolutionary dead-end (you cannot
quite appreciate just how dumb these animals have been bred until you
watch sheep trying to get out of the rain by hiding under the other
sheep.)

isnt the reason the south american rainforests are getting burned is to make
room for cows?   And they eat up the resources (fertilized soil from ash, to
grow grazing grass) in a few years and then they have to burn more forest?

It actually goes a bit further than this. In 1996, somebody or other
who nobody had ever heard of took out a trademark on Linux(TM), then wrote
to various companies (SSC and Yggdrasil spring to mind) who make their
living selling Linux books, distributions, or software demanding a pay-
off for use of the name.

With the approval of Linus Torvalds, and a pro bono attorney, SSC,
Yggdrasil, Red Hat, and most of the other companies making money out 
of Linux started a lawsuit against the parasite, and tried to get
the trademark invalidated.

The outcome was that before the case came to court the opportunist
folded, and the trademark was assigned (by mutual consent) to Linus
Torvalds (who (a) invented Linux, and therefore deserves to hold it
if anyone does, and (b) who has no intention of using it to make
money).

This is an interesting case insofar as it shows commercial entities
_defending_ a common good (free access to the name "Linux"). The Linux
industry, foetal though it might be at present, seems to have
accomodated itself to the "bazaar" model of software development just
when the rest of the computer industry is at the opposite extreme.
Moreover, those companies -- even the most aggressively corporate
ones, like Caldera -- are putting back freeware into the communal
pot (RedHat's RPM system, Caldera's COAS and PPP code). They're treating
their field as a positive-sum game, where cooperation results in greater
growth than defection and it therefore pays dividends to give software
away for free -- because, of course, the more Good Stuff there is in
the free Linux systems, the more people will use it, and the more
the businesses employing them will be inclined to pay for the commercial 
support packages aimed at businesses.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

1. Design and construction of an assembler. There will
soon be a web page where you can go and describe a nanosystem 
by shape and substance, and a Java applet will generate an 
atomic blueprint to those specifications. I base this 
prediction on discussions at nanocad@world.std.com. 
The core of the applet will be based on 
ftp://ftp.std.com/pub/wware/alg_gen.tgz.

Similar programs could be used to generate complete
nonsense (from a chemical POV), but as time passes more
and more chemical knowledge will be encoded in them,
and the designs will become more robust. So we will
shortly have a flood of DIY nanomachine designs. Maybe
it'll be a standard feature on some homepages - "Here
is my CV, here is my cat, here are my nanodesigns."

The question then becomes, how do you actually build an 
assembler? The most promising path I've thought of would 
involve what I call a "buckybot", a nanobot built of 
fullerenes. This appears promising because we already 
have fullerenes, and the guru, Richard Smalley, expects 
nanotubes "to become available by the megaton, and to become 
available with precisely controlled terminating groups." 
(http://www.foresight.org/Updates/Update31/Update31.1.html)

Perhaps fullerenes with appropriate terminating groups can 
implement the Merkle toolset for mechanosynthesis of diamond 
(http://nano.xerox.com/nanotech/hydroCarbonMetabolism.html);
then "all" we need is a way to position and move the tools
with nanometer precision. (We don't initially need an onboard 
nanocomputer; that's only for *programmable* assemblers, as
opposed to directly-controlled.)

2. Developing useful applications of NT. I recently made
a post to sci.nanotech, "Priority uses for nanotechnology",
which says what I'd say here, namely that it's time serious
design work began on the "utopian" applications of NT, so
that we're ready to use the technology the moment it
arrives. (Yes, I know "arrival" is not a literally instantaneous
thing, but I think it will be a *very* fast climb from
clunky limited assemblers to scary powerful world-class
assemblers, thanks to the rapidity with which one will be
able to build, test, and redesign. If nanotube mechanisms
aren't the start of this process, it might come from
biotech, through the use of ribosomes, as de novo protein
design improves.)

3. Picotechnology and spacetime engineering through the
use of "Q-balls". Q-balls are (wholly hypothetical)
solitons in scalar fields like the Higgs, inside of
which these fields take different values from outside. 
To the extent that low-energy physics is governed by the 
values of scalar fields (and in some models all particle 
masses are set by the values of Higgs fields), physics can 
be different inside a Q-ball. For example, a proton entering
a Q-ball might decay more quickly. Alexander Kusenko
(http://insti.physics.sunysb.edu/~sasha/) suggests
using Q-balls as an energy source: drop them in water,
tap the heat generated by proton decay
(http://www.newscientist.com/ns/970830/nqballs.html).
He also says (in his papers) that Q-balls are a feature 
of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, which is a 
conservative guess at physics beyond the Standard Model. 
Kusenko seems to be the main theorist of Q-balls, although
they are originally the invention of Sidney Coleman.

An example of the advantages one might accrue by
modulating the values of the physical "constants":
http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/9703017 tells us that
the probability of a wormhole tunneling into existence
depends on the value of the fine-structure constant
(i.e. on the coupling constant of QED).

See http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-ph/9707423 for a more
detailed exposition. "A Q-ball is essentially a new 
universe in a nutshell." This is the sort of remark
that set me off. Q-balls may be an enabling technology
for the creation of baby universes. Alan Guth 
(co-discoverer of inflation) says somewhere (reference
not to hand, sorry) that it would only take a few Kg
of mass-energy to create a new region of inflation.
Of course, it needs to be concentrated into a *very*
small area, and to do that might require huge forces,
but do we really need to go as far as, say, stellar
collapse? Perhaps we can do it using massive Q-balls,
or mini black holes created through Bose-Einstein
condensation of asteroidal quantities of rubidium,
or some such thing.

Gregory Benford apparently has a new novel, _Cosm_,
in which there's a baby universe created; it will
be interesting to see what mechanism he proposes.

Something else we need: a map of the thousands of
superstring vacua - what sort of structures can
form in each, how difficult it is to get from one
such state to another. Such transitions have been
modelled, to a limited extent (hep-th/9504145).

Another tangent: Planck-scale computers. Perhaps
one could use Bekenstein-bound-saturating states (e.g.
"BPS saturated states") as info-processors with 
physically maximal storage density and 10^43 Hz speeds.
Greg Egan's "The Planck Dive" (Feb 98, "Asimov's
SF magazine", not yet seen by me) apparently describes
a related scenario.

4. Boundless energy and computational speedup from 
networks of baby universes. People have been hazily
aware of these ideas for a while, but I'm not aware
of any quantitative exploration, probably because there's
no exact theory available.

If Tipler can get a boundless energy yield from the
collapsing universe in his Omega Point theory,
surely we can do the same from a boundlessly
growing array of baby universes. [The nature of energy 
in GR still puzzles me; John Baez even says (in a recent 
post on sci.physics.research, 21/01/98 for those who want 
to look it up) it's not always conserved in GR!]

5. Conceptualizing and planning for "infinite futures".
For example:

One can imagine a very fast computer connected to
sensors and effectors throughout a baby universe.
The computer maintains a model of the state of the rest 
of the universe, constantly updated via the sensors.
There is always a particular finite range of actions
open to it through the effectors. What it does is to
model the effects of each possible action, some degree
into the future, and selects an action on the basis of
some criterion ('value system'?) applied to the various
projected outcomes.

Is such a system feasible? Is it desirable? I find it
plausible that some such system is a feature of all
infinite futures worth discussing, and that the 
interesting questions concern implementation and the
'value system' to be used.

6. Physics applets. I'd like to have pages where you
could go and see elementary physics in action. Imagine
applets implementing different physical models, for which
you could select initial conditions, and witness some of
the calculations involved. One might have each of the types 
of approximate model listed in _Nanosystems_, Table 1.4, and 
each candidate for fundamental theory from Newton through to 
QED (QCD might be intractable for a web browser). 

7. World models on the web. 

First, I'd like to see Club-of-Rome-style world models
on the web. They should be incredibly easy to do, say,
in Javascript, the problem lies in finding a model to use.
I suspect that the most valuable ones are either proprietary
or languish in dusty academic obscurity.

Then, I'd like to see models which factor in things like:
space colonzation and development, the existence of matter 
compilers, the growth of a new "humanly incomprehensible" 
sector of the economy, and so on.

9. Net as a single distributed computational system.

I think here of projects like www.distributed.net.
I hope that it will eventually become a standard thing for
a networked computer to be part of a number of distributed
processing systems, to which it will donate computational
power when idle.

I also want to see intelligent 'query engines', to which
one can pose a natural-language question, which the engine
would answer by consulting knowledge databases scattered
across the net. This could be helped along if there was
a knowledge-representation equivalent of HTML: a language
for the representation of facts, in a form suitable for
computer manipulation. CycL (www.cyc.com) might be a
candidate, others can be seen at
http://mnemosyne.itc.it:1024/ontology.html.

The QED Project (http://www.mcs.anl.gov:80/qed/) is an
attempt to do this sort of thing just within mathematics -
it could later be the nucleus of a more general-purpose
effort.

10. Quantum compiler. We need a way to turn programs
into something that can be run on a quantum computer.

11. Brain models. Data, maps, computational models.

12. What it's like to be 'auto-omniscient' (knowing
everything about oneself) and 'autopotent' (having 
the capacity to change any aspect of oneself - term 
due to Nick Bostrom).

It all sounds a little paranoid to me. On the other hand, I'm inclined
to believe it because of another recent incident that bit me ...


I'm a software guy: I don't care much about the underlying hardware as
long as it works. I spent many years messing with Macs, then switched back
to PCs running UNIX or Linux. About this time last year, I bought a PC
as a workstation. Pentium 133 processor, VX motherboard ... pretty vanilla
sounding, except for the 64Mb of RAM and the fast SCSI bus. (Why do
commercial PCs always have crap peripherals and too little memory?) Anyway,
this month it's due for its mid-life refit: I want to upgrade it to
128Mb of RAM (all I can put in it without ditching my old SIMMs or buying
a new motherboard) and a faster CPU. This should be straightforward, right?

Wrong.

Middle of last year, Intel introduced their MMX nonsense -- basically
games accelerators. No use to man, beast, nor Linux hacker. But it
turns out now (when I finally pay attention to the hardware market)
that the MMX Pentia are _not_ pin-compatible with the old ones; nor
do Intel make any non-MMX chips these days. No, I need a new motherboard --
also containing an Intel chipset!  (Or a second-hand 200Mhz Pentium 1, 
but they're as rare as hen's teeth.) Moreover, the new motherboards
only have 2 SIMM sockets (they're trying to move people forward to the
newer memory formats), so I wouldn't be able to upgrade my memory at
the same time. Or I could pay through the nose for an Intel overdrive
chip ...

Why do I feel as if I'm being whipsawed by Intel? Their CPUs are 
supposeduly instruction-set compatible all the way back to the 4004,
but in real terms they want the users on a continual upgrade treadmill
just as badly as Microsoft do.

Methinks I'm going in search of a second-hand pentium chip. And my
next PC will contain NO components made by Intel and NO software by
Microsoft.

Er ... to cross-fertilize with the Linux thread, I think you've just 
invented the seeds of the Free Hardware Foundation, which will be
dedicated to providing robust, GNU Copylefted blueprints for all the
tools and durables required for everyday life without dependency on
nasty proprietary icky private patented software.

I can just see where (by analogy with the free software movement)
this is going to go:

"The FHF is dedicated to providing a complete suite of all the hardware
any dedicated hacker needs in order to completely eschew the consumer
society. It will not contain consumer goods, but only items guaranteed
to outlast their owners and provide phenomenally high performance rather
than trashy user interfaces. (For example, the FHF's development work on
the Enhanced Mobility All-terrain Cargo Shifter (Emacs, for short)
resembles a nuclear-powered Hummvee; seats are optional and there's no
air conditioning, but it can carry up to six tons of cargo, has  six
multiply-redundant power transmission circuits, an auxilliary steam
engine, active suspension, and autonomous microsat launch capability
(you think we'd trust PROPRIETARY SOLUTIONS like NavStar or Glonass?!?).
It's the go-anywhere surface terrain vehicle of choice for alternative
technology geeks who aren't afraid of a little plutonium under the hood.
Besides, who needs air conditioning when you've got coolant, air
scrubber, and power interfaces for your space suit? (NB: degrees in
aerospace and nuclear engineering may be required to make full use of 
all facilities built in this vehicle. There is no warranty, but if it
doesn't out-last you by 200 years we haven't designed it right.)"

What is a high dose and what is long term?

I hate when reports don't specify amounts or ranges.  This is the
same with "moderate drinking."  What exactly is "moderate"?

I would guess the report does specify them, I posted just the
abstract. If you want to find out the ranges, take a look at the
article itself.

Yes, backward compatibility is a sham.  x86 chips are not compatible
with Pentium are not compatible with MMX, etc.  Macs have the same
problem.  The 86xxx motorola chips are not compatible with the PowerPC
chips.  MacOS won't be compatible with Rhapsody.  Windows is not
compatible with Windows 95 or Windows NT.  Backwards compatibility never
really works, in my experience

If something is "99.999%" compatible and executes thousands of
instructions per second, how long will it run before you hit that "rare"
incompatibility issue?

The stock market is jumpy, period.  Every day analysts try to pin the
net total of all world trading onto a single cause.  They say "fears
about Asian markets caused..." or "Good news from the XXX sector
caused..."  I think it is absurdly simplistic to try to attribute global
actions of millions of investors down to a single goal or reaction.  I
look at the numbers and predict broad trends, and always multiple trends
with multiple participants.  Anybody who gives a single cause for
everything, I simply ignore.  If the market were that simple, people
could better predict the market and never risk investment.

Smiley or not, try this thought-experiement on for size:  No, go ahead,
think of it as a *cow*, a "device" which experiences a great deal of
absolutely unecessary suffering so as to satisfy your unhealthy hankering
after the sensation of its "tang" on your tongue and its corpse rotting

The whole carnivorist mantra reminds me of nothing so much as the
transparent rationalizations for self-destructive and morally
indifferent behavior one finds tripping from the mouths of any substance
abuser you happen to meet.  And the same judgments apply, as far as I'm
concerned: Should be legal, morally shunned, and laughed at as stupid.

Thus spake under the greatest rhetorical error/intentional fraud the liberal
nuts can muster: that animals are sentient. If something cannot come up to me
and discuss the weather, its not sentient. My dog may have some degree of
minimal intelligence, and in my opinion may exist in a grey area that I am
willing to grant, which is why I don't eat dog (but then again, there are some
humans I've met who are dumber than a side of beef). Since your typical vegan
is also an atheist, or at best, a rational non-dietical buddhist, they cannot
claim the protections of the Natural Law doctrine, so they must then agree
that rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness only applies to
individuals who are willing to use force, or employ others to use force, to
attain and protect those rights for themselves, i.e. the Force Doctrine. Given
this, and that humans have demonstrated themselves to be the premier predator
on the planet, any herbivore which cannot or does not defend its own rights to
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, therefore has no rights,
intelligent or no. Again an animal like a dog, which when domesticated
considers itself a member of a human pack, is fully capable of defending
itself when it sees a threat. That it doens't often win against a human is
another issue entirely.

Cows have been bred for slaughter for thousands of years. If they were
sentient in any way, shape or form, they would either a) be making some sort
of group effort to communicate their wishes to not be et, or b) have developed
a culture/religion that has resigned them to accepting their place in the
cosmos, or c) attempt to defend their rights in some way shape or form, at
least on a frequent enough basis to be noticable by the general populace.

The whole vegan mantra reminds me of nothing so much as the transparent
rationalizations of self-involved, self-deluded and morally self-righteous
behavior one finds tripping from the mouths of any religious or political
fanatic, i.e. don't confuse me with the facts, my mind is made up. And the
same judgements apply, as far as I'm concerned. Should be illegal, morally
shunned, and laughed at as stupid.

If the human race becomes all herbivores, what species will then claim the job
of top carnivore???

I dunno. Given the possibilities for the singularity, I would daresay that a
large percentage of the human race will soom become a literal evolutionary
dead end. WOuld they prefer a quick end, or to live on as the pawns and
playthings of greater beings? I know what I think, but what about billy ray
and sally mae welfare check? Seems to me that the greater mass of humanity is
really only concerned with living by any means possible rather than standing
and possibly dying, on principle.

Who cares? Do we need the salary? :-)

Of course, in "Beyond Vegitarianism" I suggested that it might be a good
idea to become a posthuman autotroph (ergovore?).

I hear your challenge and raise you one Hellen Keller. Failing that, try
looking into the treatment of blind people back before Braile was invented,
or deaf-blind people for that matter. 

Human beings are sentient and can communicate. The organs of communication
are not essential for sentient existence. Ergo, here is an existence
proof for sentience in the absence of communication.

Of course, using this as an argument against eating cattle is highly
suspect; it can be taken to ridiculous extremes. ("Here's my pet rock, 
Elmer. Say hello to Elmer. Sorry he can't hear you, but I assure you he's 
pleased to meet you.") However, I'm deeply uneasy about arguments based
on the idea that anything that can't talk or write isn't worthy of some
consideration; and I suspect that if she could form grammatically correct
structures and communicate them my pet cat would agree with me.

(As an aside, however, I _do_ apply your communication/sentience argument
to the oxymoronic topic of "animal rights". Rights imply a contractual
arrangement; if I can enter into an agreement with another species, then,
well, I'll concede it has rights. If it can't enter into an agreement with
me, though, any concessions I make to it can't, by definition, be contractual 
rights.)

Eh?

You're assuming a rights-based transaction between humans and their prey.
But what's to stop the humans simply voluntarily conceding that they * will
not eat meat *, no matter what? Like, maybe, because they don't like the
taste? They need concede no rights whatsoever to the animals in order to
justify not eating them.

My cat is a carnivore. She 'thinks' anything that moves and is smaller
than her is food -- simple as that. (I have no _idea_ what she thinks I
am.) I am an omnivore, but I don't feel any urge to eat my cat, even though
I'm told cats are edible. Just to add to the picture, my girlfriend is
a vegan, _but_ when quizzed about it confesses to not knowing how she'd
react if anyone came up with a way of farming anencephalic cattle (which
opens another can of worms, as genetically engineered anencephalic frogs 
and mice are yesterday's headlines).

The species that have already got it. Remember, we're all food for the
prokaryotes in the end. (At least until we manage to develop uploading.
And even then, we might find there's something that eats human minds ...)

But the most important to our evolutive level (post-darwinian(*) ) is not
the _type_ of food itself...
but the correspondent _nutritional characteristics_ of it... no matter if
it is vegetal, mineral, animal or... "artificial"...

A few days ago, Ian Goddard posted on the Extropy
mailing list a short message encouraging people to
visit his web site concerning "zero mechanics".

That was fine; little bandwidth was used, and I
actually did visit his web site. While I had "mixed
feelings" about it, I wasn't sufficiently moved to
e-mail him, much less post a message to the Entropy
list.

However, more recently Ian continues to post the
contents of his web site to this list. I was
sufficiently annoyed to write a review of his web
site in which I point out the mathematical sloppiness
he and Frank Wiley employ to "prove" that infinity
equals zero, and comment on his preposterous theory
that gravity is due to thermal radiation, among other
things.

After writing it, I felt better, and in my less
emotional state, it occurred to me that my review
could also be construed as a waste of the Extropy
list's bandwidth. Therefore, rather than posting it
here, I provide the following link to it:

Isn't this one of the proposed methodoligies suggested by the Rio summit?

Consumer unions? I pay for a sub to _Consumer Reports_ (although I still
just use it as a starting point for my own product evaluations). I might
pay to subscribe to a Consumer watchdog org that specifically kept tabs on
stuff like this, and had the chops to get the word out so that
consumers/citizens could respond. Could that work? Or would such orgs just
be suborned by the companies that were doing the polluting?

For example, _Consumer Digest_ is an attempt to dilute the effect of _CR_.
Companies can buy space in _CD_ and can advertise that they're a "Consumer
Digest Best Buy", with the obvious goal of confusing consumers into
thinking that it's the highly-reputable _CR_ that's endorsing the product.

Using exceptions (i.e. disabled/mutated) to prove the rule is another typical
liberal bullshit rhetorical method. If a mutant cow that sudden developed
intelligence came up to me tomorrow and said, "howdy doo", does that mean that all
normal moron cows deserve my protection? I don't think so.

That disabled humans can be taught to communicate by other means than speech or

Essentially, but as a contest of rights. A prey that flees is contesting my right to
eat it. If I catch it, I've proven my fitness/right to do so. Classic natural
selection. A cow that contests nothing implies no contestation of right.

THis is entirely reasonable, and does not imply that animals have rights as a
natural state. That prey normally do not take offense at a predators use of force
outside of an instinctual flight reaction and do not defend others of their kind
(again with a few exceptional species which typically are thought to be in the
intelligence grey area anyways) indicates that concepts like rights do not exist in
the wild. If an animal cannot conceive the concept, then they cannot posess the
concept.

parasites? I'm thinking of predators that work for their meals. Perhaps as things
accelerate, we might develop human variants or other predators that will cull out
the weak. You'll notice how penal psychology refers to many criminals as
'predators'. If they are the predators, does this mean that psychology has already
abdicated our role for us and thinks of  well adjusted people as  'sheep'???

Interesting story! Checking out your site now. A question for you - How do
you think your technology would have fared in a market without any gov't
subsidies? Why wouldn't the short-sight human nature to buy cheapest now,
instead of cheapest long-term been even more strongly expressed?

You're right about city-based wheat farming being untenable - But don't
think grains - think produce. That's where people spend most of their food
$$$. Small-scale veg farming is quite attainable -m(b)illions do it all the
time.

I just realized what bothers me about this whole mess...

I don't care if Clinton had an affair.  I don't see the Moral Outrage as
being an important issue.  What is important (legally) is if he tampered
with a witness to lie about it.  That would be criminal, etc.

But if this is the case, and Clinton is guilty, what does this mean?  He
is guilty of tampering with the investigation of allegations.  It
totally ignores the original allegations or whether an original crime
was committed.

I would hate to see a President brought down as a result of his reaction
to an investigation, and not due to guilt involving the original
allegations that prompted the investigation.  This implies that a person
can be investigated and eventually found guilty because of the
investigation without any crime prior to the investigation being
required.  This vaguely reminds me of entrapment, whereby the person's
reaction to the police investigation is deemed criminal, and the person
is charged based on this and not based on any activity occurring prior
to the investigation.

I would not have cheated on my spouse or led on someone who
I should not take advantage of or lied about it or be a hypocrite
(e.g., Clinton supports all manner of laws which restrict sexual
contact between coworkers, yet it seems his personal policy 
that what is good for America can be set aside for him).  I see
nothing wrong with holding people to standards of honesty
and fidelity, or of condemning them when they not just fail but
make such failure into a modus vivendi.

BTW, Clinton did break the law if he advised Lewinski to lie
under oath.  That is conspiracy to committ a felony.

If he and Hillary had said from the start that they have an open
marriage and the Bill likes to fool around, fine.  But this is not
what he's done.  In fact, this goes against his professed
beliefs.  Thus, it does not require adherence to any
_antisexual_ moral code to see this as a character flaw.

I really tried to remain outside this debate!:/

Verily,

Daniel Ust

Could someone please give me some good examples of how private scientific
research is "better"(interpret that as you will) than public research.  I
am presently involved in a debate with my university peers and professors,
and I need some more ammunition.

The following e-mail is an example a response against my argument.  I am
arguing in  particular that private research is better, and that only
private universities should have tenure, since researchers at public
universities should be held accountable to the public.

Thanks a lot,

Geoff.

If anyone has pointed this out, I've missed it.  Area to support plants
is not the only limitation; sunlight, or energy, is equally important.
The Earth intercepts only so much sunlight.  A skyscraper won't change
that.  It casts an area in shadow, and piles up an equivalent area.  The
benefit is that you get climate control; the drawback is that you have
to build the building.  That's it.  Agri-Manhattan can't grow much more
than it could as a conventional farm.  What would the extra plants grow
on?

Unless you import energy for artificial light, of course.  Not a big
concern right now.

And, a la the power companies preferring to make consumers more
efficient than to build a new power plant, it might be better to raise
up and educate the masses of the Third World than to worry about how to
increase our population.

The ONLY violation of law they ever established even to the 
probable-cause level, that Nixon had actually done, was participating 
in a cover-up.  THAT is what brought Nixon down.

Clinton, if current reports bear up, is guilty of exactly the same 
thing and possibly to a greater degree.

No, entrapment per se is somewhat different.  What you are thinking 
of is cases where all charges against a person are dropped except 
"resisting arrest".  That is now not acceptable in court: if there 
isn't enough of a case to prosecute, then the arrest was not 
justified.

Arresting someone directly interferes with their freedom.  
Investigating them does not.

Entrapment is when (for example) an undercover police officer 
instigates a crime so that other participants can be arrested.  There 
is not compelling reason to believe that, absent police 
encouragement, a crime would have occurred.

Considering that in areas where there were no subsidies, all it took was
forward thinking building owners (Boeing, for example, even though Seattle City
Light & Power had run out of funding for the year, bought 1000 kits from us in
one order.) to make a sale. Usually building owners who are in the money
/finance business immediately saw that we were a great deal. I had a bank in
Texas that wanted to finance any customer of ours who wanted the kits, sight
unseen. Basically, our cost of conservation was less than 0.5 cents per
kilowatt hour saved, so not only were we the cheapest 'source' of power around,
but also 1/3 that of the average government run conservation program which
averaged around 1.5 cents per kwh saved.

We also fared better in the few areas where rebates were proportional to the
energy saved.

Before I had this business, I was a Republican through and through. You can now
see why I'm a libertarian. There is absolutely no idea or ideal in the world
that is so great that it can't be FUBARed by a government program.

Good question.

Why, precisely, WOULDN'T removing the greatest single obstacle to 
long-term planning decrease the tendency to engage in long-term 
planning?

Hm... I think I can figure out some possible reasons.

By the way, I don't see that much of a tendency to buy the cheapest 
now.  Most people seem to want a little better than they can afford.

Private research is inherently better in that it is not funded by 
wealth taken by force from people who think the research is 
undesirable, unnecessary, or even just not the best use of the wealth 
at that time.

And this relates how to any claim that coercively-funded research is

The public sector is inefficient at producing basic advances because 
it will tend to become clogged by scientific bureaucrats (some of 
whom might originally have been scientists) more interested in 
drawing out a project (job security) than in delivering results.

Duplication in research is essential to science.  It is, among other 
things, how you check the validity of results.  And just how much 
secrecy is there, really?  I seem to see a *lot* of medical-journal

Seems to me you've proved my point.  The parasite couldn't parasitise
because there is a functioning system of private property rights, and
people were willing to defend the *real* ownership of Linux, which I
think was also Warrl's point.  

The fact that the real owners and creators have chosen to make their
product freely available is not so important.  The fact of ownership is,
and that is the foundation of a capitalist system. Markets and money are
just one way (the most efficient way for people who are strangers and
not-necessarily-enthusiasts!) of doing economic exchanges. (But granted
pro-capitalists sometimes blur the distinction between the system of
private property rights and the system of market exchange.)

You are correct.  What we currently call "capitalism" is a engineered
way of 

making people be productive, and it should set libertarian
coercometers to overload.  However, when most people on this list talk
about "capitalism" they are talking of a system that measures a
persons worth rather than forcing equality, which I agree with.  In
this sense it could also be the lack of any system (i.e. natural
selection.)

At the moment you could probably live for quite a long time for free,
in the future that time will be longer, one day you may even be able
to stretch to immortality.

Well, Netscape thinks there isn't any money in clients, it thinks the
money is in servers.  They also think that this is what Microsoft
thinks, but they're wrong on both counts.  Servers will be short lived
(thanks, to the wonder of decentralisation) and Microsoft already knows.

Microsoft is actually in a money making frenzy, because they can see
the market is collapsing around them.  At the same time they're trying
to route themselves into the Web and whatever new economy it may
produce.

There will still be an 'economy' (in the sense that we will still be
able to apply economics to it, although a purpose built system of
trade may not exist.)  What people tend to forget is that the Web *is*
an economy in itself (at an early stage of creation.)  What this
economy will look like I'm not completely sure, any ideas?

I may be in error, but I certainly intend no fraud.  Look, my impression
is that while nonhuman animals cannot compose a sonnet on the subject of
their suffering, they manage to communicate pain and distress quite
compellingly.  One of the reasons that the industrial "processing" of
animal bodies into "food" takes place behind such insistently closed
doors.  From the point of view of a Power, it may well be that the noises
we make on the subject of, say, "the weather" do not qualify us as
sentient either.

Rights culture seems to me to be a spontaneous order which emerged over
history to secure better societies than existed under other ways of doing
justice. I see them underwritten by traditions, or fuzzy consensus more
like, rather than God or nature or foundations or what have you.  The leap
from this to your force doctrine seems suspiciously wide to me.  I can
easily imagine a rights culture held together by little more than the
sense that inflicting pain unecessarily is a bad thing.  As I said before,
I don't know how coherent it is to demand that we extend formal "rights" 
to nonhuman animals, but I am quite convinced that there should be
*ethical* injunctions against treating animals like objects.

I have a stake in a future politics that tries to ensure that the pawns
have a voice in that particular decision.  I am not quite as confident as
you seem to be about judging everyday people or nonhuman animals as
dispensible.  Oh, and since all this really is veering quickly away from the proper
extropian purview, how about this:
1. Vegetarianism is extropian because it is a healthy lifestyle.
2. Vegetarianism is extropian because it broadens and complicates our
ethical perception of the world.
3. Vegetarianism is extropian because it is an ethical laboratory in which
we can think about proper political and ethical relations between
radically different kinds of beings *before* a singularity-like-event
forces us to do so.

Hi!

Perhaps most of you already know this, but if you don't, I think it's
interesting. 

I couple of weeks ago, I believe it was Damien Broderick who claimed an
experiment where mice without telomerase were produced and appeared to
be fine by their fourth generation.

I took a look around to confirm this. I contacted Dr. Lee M. Silver at
Princeton, I contacted both scientists who immortalized cells with
telomerase, etc. The most important things I learned were: (1) By the
6th generation, the mice are infertile. (2) The mice's telomers do
shorten and almost disappear by the 5th generation. (3) The researchers
instigated cancer cells from the mice cells without telomerase and these
cancer cells -- who also don't have telomerase -- appear to be immortal
(more than 360 divisions). (4) Somatic cells on the 6th generation show
chromossome imbalance and other genetic errors, they also don't
proliferate normally. If you want to learn more about it, check out:

I pointed this out, but not as concisely. You only win if you use
a non-solar power source to generate artificial light. You can use
fossil fuels or nuclear power. This would be a horrible waste of
fossil fuels: there is likely to be a better way to convert them to
food. This leaves nuclear, which most people reject for emotional
reasons.

You can of course place your farms on top of the city and still capture
the city's area of sunlight, but the city would be a pretty gloomy
place if you did that.

The human body is really not designed to process a lot of meat with the 
high level of fat common in modern farm animals. The wild meat the 
cavemen were eating is nothing like the fat laden stuff you see in your 
local supermarket. It's pretty well established that a high fat diet is 
not good for you. Yes, there are bad high fat vegetarian foods, but 
limiting (or eliminating) your meat intake and eating low fat vegetarian 
fare seems to be a healthy way to go.

Frankly, I do not care what anyone on this list eats, but you do not 
need to eat meat.

However, I would question the idea (expressed by Max More) that we would 
have more food on the market if we didn't eat meat. There are three main 
reasons some people do not have enough to eat:
 
1. They don't have money to buy food
2. Political interference in agricultural production. 
3. War.

My food buying habits will change none of these factors. Just because I 
stop eating meat, it does not follow that more grain will now go to feed 
a starving child in Africa. Almost certainly, total grain production 
would just decrease in response to decreased demand.

You might also want to check out Terence Kealy's The Economic Laws of
Scientific Research, Macmillan, London, 1996. He's a libertarian and
occasional LA subscriber, although I haven't read it yet so don't know
precisely how relevant it is to your question.

Some related works would also be:
John Baker, Science & the Planned State, George allen & Unwin, London,
1942/Macmillan, London, 1945
The Freedom of Science, Arno Press, New York, 1975 (A compilation of the
previous title and another work).
Baker was a great classical liberal opponent of the Marxist "planned
science" movement of the 30s/40s.

Check out also:
Yale Brozen, "The Role of Government in Reserach & Development",
American Behavioural Scientist, 1962
John Jewkes, "How Much Science?", The Advancement of Science, No. 62,
September 1959 
Idem, et al, The Sources of Invention, Macmillan, London, 1958

There is a considerable literature in economics dealing with the
question of the virtues and alleged limits of privately funded research
versus state funded. Unfortunately I haven't yet inputted this into my
persoanl bibliographies. A good serach through the major economics
journals should turn up it up for you.

How about posting your findings to this group?

its just another addition to the "cows are unnecessary" list, as far as using

very good.  It'll only be a matter of time before you cannot tell the

My own pet theory is that the degree of overvaluation drives the
instabilities:

	100% value - market goes up, steadily
	110% value - market goes up, about 0.2% daily variation
	115% value - market goes up in about 0.2% vars, drops about 0.6%
			about 1 day in 5.
	120% value - market goes up in about 0.5% vars, drops about 1.5%
			about 1 day in 3
	125% value - jiggles about 1.5% daily, eventual 3% - 4% drop over a
			week or so eventually.

	IMHO these are mostly due to the trading sofware settings....

At the moment we are in the 110% - 115% range..

My point with my previous question about who the new carnivore will be that will
eat humans. If we are to strive for ecological stability, shoudn't we actively
support a viable population of cannibals to occupy the top rung in our food
chain??? It seems the environmentally ethical thing to do.....

Or you can hunt for your meat, and eat healthy protein, as well as be honest
and ethical about it, rather than depend on a guy in a slaughter house to
carry your karma for you.

Also : 4. Distribution inefficiencies. This is actually the biggest cause of
wasted food. Even the American system which is from what I've heard the most
efficient food distribution system in the world, waste and spoilage accounts
for up to 40% of all food 'consumption'.

Exactly, or because you dont eat meat, the price of meat will go down a
minute fraction, making it more affordable for others to buy more....

This could be a horrible obstacle to de-regulators.

But at least for now it would be good.  I'd like to add that each 
legislative NOTA would be assigned a proportionate number of 
committee and subcommittee memberships (and chairmanships -- which 
could be interesting) based on the number of consecutive terms that 
district had elected NOTA; and that NOTA would always be presumed to 
be present for purposes of establishing a quorum.

Eventually I'd like to see things reach a point where NOTA is 
frequently the only candidate in a legislative race, because the 
government -- local, state, or national -- is so unimportant that 
nobody in a district thinks it's worth their while.

I guess you didn't read it all the way through. Quoting:

social, or journalistic interest.  

As I said, interesting <TO ME is of course assumed> if it is what it

(a) He's trying to slip in the presupposition that private
research is goal-directed while public research is basic.  This
is simply false.  A large amount of basic researh is funded by
visionary companies and individuals, and a large factor in the
process of getting a government grant is the ability to show a
goal for one's research.  Indeed, the private sector can
speculate /more/ freely on research, because one only has to
justify the expense to a few investors rather than to all voters.
(b) The naked assertion that most fundamental advances came from
basic research rather than goal-directed research is simply false.
The transistor was invented on Bell Labs' dime by a goal-directed
project; packet-switched networking (the foundation of modern
communications, including the Internet) was a product of goal-
directed research at MIT.  Darwin worked unpaid aboard the
Beagle, and was supported by his father while he wrote.  Florey,
Chain, and Flemings development of penicillin, for which they
received the Nobel prize, was funded by the Rockefeller Founda-
tion.  Are these not the "fundament advances" he talks about?
If all he can offer is scattered anecdotes, then hit him back
with some of those.

(a) While non-directed research might be good at discovery, it's 
lousy at /development/, and undeveloped discoveries never go anywhere.
Edison never made any discoveries about electricity, but the fact
that he produced a practical application, and got electric lights
installed in millions of homes, made further research cheaper and
easier to do.
(b) The parenthetical here is pure speculation, and beneath the
dignity of honest debate.  Any practical invention such as the
laser will find itself being applied wherever a profit can be made
by either production by the inventor or licensing.  Companies
actually prefer licensing inventions, because it's less work than
production and distribution.  Duplication of research (not a bad
thing itself, really) only happens when the discoveries are not
well developed and well known, and the best way to develop and
spread anything is to make a profitable product.
(c) Patents are not part of the free market; they are government-
imposed restrictions.

and funding research for centuries.  Altruism is not industry's

people's lives, what better incentive to do that than that of
selling those things at a profit?  What incentive does some lab

      That really is _preposterous_.
      
      Nixon's presidencies were marked by a gross contempt for law and 
      ethics as well as every principle of a Constitutional Republic.  
      Never mind every decent principle of the Republican Party.
      
      "When the President does it, that means it isn't illegal.'  DUH...


      The most probable explanation of 'Watergate' is the one detailed 
      (and albeit denied by DCI Richard Helms -- whose autobiography is 
      imminent BTW) in John Ranelagh's magnificent history of CIA, 'The 
      Agency' [1988].  The Watergate complex was built on the site of 
      CIA's old Headquarters Building...  >:-}

      Briefly:  Howard Hunt, long-time senior CIA Covert Operations 
      practitioner (and novelist), set out to entrap Nixon, whose 
      Sauron-like attempts to concentrate the power of every branch and 
      Department and Agency of the Federal Government under the control of 
      servile Nixonite White House nominees was _completely intolerable_ 
      to anyone concerned to ensure the survival of a free Republic.  Only 
      CIA and NSA held out.  Hunt used to joke that -- in 20 years in CIA 
      -- there were only two kinds of people he'd never met: assassins; 
      and fellow-Republicans.  >:-}  CIA are world masters of bureaucratic 
      infighting -- it's our^H^H^H their _forte_.
      
      
      Nixon was a political soul-mate of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover (the 
      most evil man in the history of America).  Like Hoover, he avidly 
      collected seamy 'political intelligence' blackmail material on his 
      'enemies' (i.e. anyone who opposed his agenda).  So when a 
      'black-bag job' on the Democratic Party National Headquarters itself 
      was dangled in front of him, he found the temptation _irresistible_. 
      Using anti-Castro Cubans with a CIA background seemed smart, because 
      they could be trusted (or so it seemed); and because they looked 
      'deniable.'  And - best of all! -- CIA (which Nixon and Hoover hated 
      as 'liberal' and free-thinking) could be blamed if things  went 
      wrong!  "Let's pull a fast one on Joey!"  >:-}
      

      Hunt's plan duly scheduled (quite ambiguously) the 'accidental 
      discovery' and subsequent arrest of the 'Watergate' burglars _in 
      flagrante delicto_.  Anyone who believes that ordinary beat 
      policemen will usually arrest and charge active-service CIA 
      operatives within America itself _is_ living in a dream-world, and 
      will believe anything... >:-}


      Remember, _Hunt knew_ that _Nixon knew_ that he (Nixon) was guilty 
      _right from the start_.  So -- once events were set in motion -- 
      there was no way that Nixon could ever escape _actual_ complicity.  
      He'd 'signed off' on the project, remember.
      
      
      Nixon -- being wholly predictable -- could then be relied upon to 
      use every power of the Federal Government to attempt to get off the 
      hook.  All to no avail, because CIA _and_ NSA had the whole 
      operation _wired_, and could neatly 'blow' any Nixonite maoeuvre 
      with perfect timing and precision.  Any slowing of the action, and 
      tit-bits of information culd go to Woodward and Bernstein to keep 
      the pot boiling.
      
      So -- like a giant buzz-saw -- the 'Watergate' game inexorably cut a 
      chasm right through the edifice of power which Nixon had created, 
      exposing all the horrors of his political abuses of power.

      
      As in a good Greek tragedy (Howard Hunt was very literate -- CIA 
      employs more Doctorates and post-grads than any other Agency) Nixon 
      and his gang were doomed from the outset.  There was no way out. 
      Even when Nixon fired half of the entire CIA Covert Action 
      Directorate -- 400 people -- in vicious retaliation, this only 
      worsened matters, as they could then all say and do whatever they 
      damn well liked, all over 'official' Washington.


      America owes a great deal to CIA and NSA -- more than the American 
      people will ever know.

Well, just this month a very small company, Geron Corporation, found a ,  
perhaps the, key to cellular aging. Last year another small company found a 
way to clone mammals.

The breakthrough on High Temperature superconductors was made by IBM at their  
Zurich laboratory, Muller and Bednorz, both IBM employees received Nobel 
prizes. The very same IBM lab also made what is unquestionably the single 
most important advance in Nanotechnology up to this point, The Scanning 
Tunneling Microscope and earned  another Nobel prize for IBM employees Binnig 
and Rohrer. IBM is also where the  newer Atomic Force Microscope and Magnetic 
Resonance Microscope were invented. They used these machines to make the 
smallest possible logo, spelling out the name "IBM" atom by atom a few years 
ago. 

IBM didn't do everything, the first laser was made in May 1960 at the private
Hughes Research Laboratory by Harold Maimam. 60 years ago Bell Labs discovered  
that some radio waves come from space and built the world's first radio 
telescope, more recently Bell Labs revolutionized Cosmology by detecting the 
3 degree Kelvin black body background radiation from The BIG BANG  and got 
a Nobel Prize for it. Bell Labs also invented the transistor and got another 
Nobel Prize  for that. Texas Instruments invented the integrated circuit, 
INTEL invented the microprocessor to fulfill a contract from a Japanese 
calculator company.

A lot of good work comes from private universities. MIT was started in 1845 
by Erastus Bigelow, using the vast fortune he made in the power loom 
manufacturing business. CAL TECH is also a privet institution, so is Harvard, 
so is Yale, so is Princeton, so is Carnegie Mellon, so is The Institute For
Advanced Study, so is Stanford. Speaking of Standford,  Calvin Quate of that 
privet university used an Atomic Force Microscope invented at IBM to make the 
worlds smallest transistor. He was able to make  lines less than 100 
nanometers wide. 

Most of the world's great telescopes were built with private funds donated by 
rich men, including the largest of all, the 394 inch Keck on Mauna Kea, 
a second private instrument of equal size recently became operational just 
a few  hundred feet away. I think it's interesting that one of the biggest 
contributors to Big Science, Charles Yerkes, made much of his money by 
building street car lines, until government put him out of business when 
they decided they could  run them much, much better. None of the men who 
gave money for these things expected their telescope to make a profit. 
If government wasn't around to steal a large pat of their money people like 
this would give even more. 
  
I don't want to oversell my case, there is no doubt that some good science 
has come from government funded research, and that's not surprising 
considering that government has trillions of dollars at it's disposal. Even a 
monkey throwing around that kind of money would occasionally do some good.

It's true as stated.

Nixon's presidencies were marked by a great many people other than 
Nixon.

We know for a fact that Nixon did not break into the Watergate hotel, 
or into the offices of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist.  Those were 
the fundamental acts behind the whole scandal.  Nixon *may* have been 
involved in planning either or both of those crimes; there is 
evidence clearly pointing to the possibility, but NOT sufficient to 
prove it.

A great many illegal things went on in the executive branch during 
the Nixon administration -- many of them with the consent of Congress 
but that's a different argument.  Most of them were *not* related to 
the Watergate mess and either were not investigated at all or were 
not tied to Nixon himself at all.

Several crimes occurred that related to the Watergate mess, but in 
most cases it can be positively shown that Nixon did not commit them 
and in many cases there is substantial doubt.  

There is little doubt that he conspired to obstruct justice, 
obstructed justice, and destroyed evidence.  These were (in my 
opinion) sufficient to impeach him on and sufficient to justify his 
resignation (as if someone needed justification to resign).  But 
of all the other offensive acts that can be clearly pinned on Nixon, 
none that I am aware of are illegal.

And those crimes Nixon was shown to be guilty of, were part of the 
cover-up, NOT part of the original scandal.

  IAN: Well, hemp will grow in the worst soils, 
  and it will even raise the level of nitrogen.
  Hemp seed is second only to the soy bean in
  protein, and unlike the soy bean is not known
  to be an allergen. Hemp seed oil is also high
  in the varieties of fat that increase the
  good cholesterol and decrease the bad, LDL.

  As I understand, it takes 9 pounds of gain 
  consumed by a cow to yield one pound of meat.
  Of course the meat may have a higher concen-
  tration of protein than most grains, yet soy
  and hemp are sufficiently protein rich to 
  meet and exceed human protein needs. 

  I did a report back in high school calculating
  how much more food we would have if the food 
  that livestock ate was not devoted to feeding
  animals born to be killed for human consumption.
  I'd have to dig up that report to get the exact 
  numbers, but I recall that the amount of food 
  in the world would increase about 4X or more.
  If I recall, almost 70% of grains grown go to 
  the feeding of livestock to support the 
  system of meat-eating mass murder.

  I've been a vegetarian for 19 years without 
  any health related problems, and probably 
  many health related benefits, although it's
  impossible to determine the bad health you've
  avoided since you cannot be both the subject 
  and the control of your own experiment. But
  studies suggest that a vegetarian diet is
  far healthier than nonvegatarian diets.
  And anything that is more healty and
  more ethical is more extropian.

And making wildly inflated sweeping over-generalizations with enough holes

bozo method.

Please can we cut the ad hominem shit and try to hold a rational discussion?

Can you please state what your criteria for sentience are? In other words,
how do you determine this state? (Can you prove that _I_ am sentient? Let
me argue for the sake of playing devil's advocate that I'm actually a
monstrously powerful Chinese Room a la Searle. C'mon, now. What do you say
to that?)

And why is sentience your criterion for eating or not eating something?

Thanks. You've just come up with an argument for eating or euthanising
people in persistent vegetative states.

Please explain why eating mentally defective humans is bad but eating
cows is good. Or state _why_ the forgoing question strikes you as being
a red herring.

That's not a rights-based system as I understand it. Rights as a concept
are derived from this odd eighteenth-century rationalist theory about
social contracts, which in turn were derived as an answer to the
question of how to run a society without a king (or other
divinely-mandated source of authority). The idea is that there exists an
implicit contract between the citizen and their peers -- all of them are
to observe the terms of the contract, under threat of sanction, but they
benefit from it as well because the terms include things like "thou shalt
not rape, murder, and eat thy neighbours", so being part of a community
that observes such a contract means you're reasonably safe from being
raped, murdered, and eaten by your neighbour. 

What you're suggesting is simply a contest of strength. Say you're the
hunter and I am the cow; there's no opportunity for me to say "this is an
invalid contract!". 

It's not even classic natural selection -- go read Darwin's Dangerous Idea
by Daniel Dennett, or The Extended Phenotype by Richard Dawkins, then get
back to me.

(Clue: I live with a vegan. _I_ eat meat regularly. I'm not arguing with
you because you've tweaked my fanaticism bone, I'm arguing with you because
I think your arguments against vegetarianism don't survive scrutiny.)

Bacteria don't work for their meals?

Sorry, what you seem to mean is something furry and warm blooded with teeth
and fangs that can run faster than you can. This is _not_ an efficient
predator. (Compare the carrying capacity of a chunk of land in lions per
hectare with it's carrying capacity of deer per hectare and you might 
eventually figure out why lions are rare.) In fact, anything high up the
food chain is at risk -- over-specialised, needs to eat only a comparatively
rare food-stuff, vulnerable to population crashes among its prey.

This whole paragraph is phrased on the basis of the assumption that
human phenotypic behaviour is inherited. Human phenotypic behaviour is
NOT inherited, it's largely ACQUIRED. (What do you think a meme is?) Our
extended phenotype -- the expression of our genes -- is a virtual
machine for running memes on. As such, we're really the first species on
our planet to achieve the breakthrough to a Lamarckian evolutionary
perspective, hence the astounding rate of change over the past five
hundred centuries. This isn't my crank theory; it belongs to Richard
Dawkins, but I happen to think it more or less fits the facts.

Basing your arguments for the next century, and for how life will look
in an uploaded universe, on a Victorial view of events of a million
years ago is Not Rational.

BZZZT. 

The human body is really not "designed".

Please delete the teleological creationist propaganda from your posting

Eating human meat is a lot more dangerous to your health than eating 
(for example) cow meat because of all the possible diseases one might get
from a fellow human. That's why cannibalism is bad. Also, eating other
people might damage the sense of security in a society, certainly if
practiced at random. The consumption of cow meat is a lot safer in health
terms, and is considerably less (if at all) damaging to the sense of well-being
within a contract group (society). Besides, well-prepared meat is D-LICIOUS! 
Mmmmmm! Yummy!

P.s: I would never eat a cow I know personally ;-)

Vegetarianism is extropian since it means we place our personal

Well, the Earth did not have an environmental conflict with the human
species until a large percentage started evolving, (genetically or
memetically does not matter) toward an herbivore lifestyle. It has since
pushed out and occupied most of the most ecologically viable land area in
the world, and is making a good attempt at exterminating the rest within
the nexx half century. If humans had remained hunter gatherers, the earth
would not be in the environmental fix it is in. While it is now making an
attempt at stabilizing its current environmental damages, it is not making
any attempt at limiting the population growth, which is the main problem.
Any ecologist will tell you that the way to stabilize a large population
of herbivores is to introduce and support a population of predators, and
if that is not viable, then to use such measures as hunting to manage the
herd. If this is the case with other herbivores, why are environmentalists
not applying the same standard to humans?, why do environmentalists
typically take the exact opposite stand with humans when such culling
activities like war and sickness are involved? Charlie Stross, in another
message, contests my standard of not eating intelligent beings, which is
where environmentalists seem to also be setting their hypocritical line in
the sand, yet he cannot recognise the blinders that he is wearing.

Granted, I don't like the idea, I'm just demanding that people with
certain stands demonstrate consistency and integrity with their policies.
I demand the same from myself. I personally like eating meat, as do other
members of my family. We also are honest enough that we take part in
hunting activities to manage wild herds of herbivores. We also have an
current average life expectancy of my grandparents generation that is up
in the 90's, so given better health current care technology, I'll easily
expect to live over 100 without any new fangled life extension techniques,
while still living a carnivorous lifestyle.

If people are going to be vegan AND be such ardent environmentalists, then
they honestly must recognise that since humanity is mostly drifting toward
an herbivorous lifestyle, then for environmental stability's sake, there
must be a predator(s) to occupy the top spot in our food chain to manage
the herd.

This is wrong at least in part. Radar was developed in a wartime crash
program. Its first major application was anti-aircraft gun aiming 
systems. Those old funky wooden buildings on the MIT campus (are they 
still there? They were when I was a stoont) were thrown up during the 
early years of WWII to house the Research Lab. for Electronics (RLE) in 
which a lot of the radar work happened. Norbert Weiner solved the 
control problem and opened up the whole field of real-time control 
systems (thanks, Norbert! Working on real-time OS at DG was one of the 
best times of my checkered career).

And what, pray tell, was behind the development of ICs besides the need 
to miniaturize and standardize circuits? I don't think that was a good 
example of pure research that found later application, either, although 
examples do abound. And because they do, commercial entities do 
sponsor quite a lot of "pure" research, which is probably part of the 
refutation you're looking for. IBM, Bellcore, and a few other large 
corporate labs have a lot of people doing "pure" research, while 
universities in general, including public ones, have a lot of 
professors who choose their research areas carefully to maximize useful 
patents.

MIT was founded in 1865 by Willam Barton Rogers. Erastus Bigelow was
on the original chartering commission (OK, he may well have been the
main official sugardaddy, I haven't seen the list of subscribers, but
it was Rogers who got his name in monumental capitals on the Dome).

Actually, that's exactly the kind I prefer to eat. Of course, I prefer to
eat the ones I don't get along with (when I was growing up, my bro and I
noticed that it was always the troublemaker steer that Dad decided we'd
keep for the family's freezer (he always denied this, of course ;) ).

Compared to what I am presented with in the grocer's, the livestock we
raised was better treated, the meat was leaner, more flavorful and healthy,
and I had a more direct experience of, and respect for, the eternal cycle
of life and death.

And I guess that tells you where I stand on the omnivorous scale...

Putting aside for a minute whether or not I agree with your thoughts on the
matter of omnivorousness/vegetarianism, I'll point out that you misused the
word "sentient". It means "capable of feeling or perception", which a cow
or a dog most certainly is. Perhaps you instead meant "sapient", which
means "capable of rational thought".

Untrue. I have never encountered, nor have I ever heard of anyone who has
encountered, a valid 680x0 (not 86xxx, btw) instruction that did not run
correctly on a PPC chip (albeit in emulation).

As to your assertions re Rhapsody - the "Blue Box" layer of Rhapsody is a
fully-implemented MacOS layer. "Yellow Box" provides a similar
implementation layer for Windows 95 and NT. Note that these are fully
native implementations, not emulation layers. That means that a machine
running Rhapsody OS can run MacOS native apps, Windows NT apps and Rhapsody
apps, all at the same time.

Rhapsody is being developed in versions that run on both PPC and Intel
chipsets (and perhaps some others as well...). Rhapsody coded apps should
be fully portable between processors - everything I've seen so far leads me
to believe that Apple can accomplish this and will do so ontime or darn
near to it.

 I'd go on but a) this topic isn't really salient to this list, and b) I'm
under NDA and really shouldn't get too enthusiastic about sharing what I've
been working with til it's released.

Anyone interested in Rhaposody should check out
http://www.apple.com/macos/rhapsody/ for starters.

Depends. If an instruction that can cause an error is rarely called, then
it may be years or never at all. It's not like a computer executes every
possible instruction just for yucks.

Entrapment is a criminal defense. Where in U.S. civil law do you find
such a thing?

"Preponderance of the evidence" is merely the burden of persuasion on
Clinton to establish the entrapment defense. This matters only insofar
as a jury instruction will issue concerning entrapment when the burden
is met. The prosecution must rebut. 

Note that the prosecution (nearly) always has to prove its case beyond a
reasonable doubt. The defense need not assert its defenses beyond a
reasonable doubt. Sometimes merely "some evidence" suffices to switch
the burden of proof to the prosecution (this varies). Usually, the
defense must assert its defenses by a "preponderance of the evidence."

Caveat:

I'm talking only about *affirmative defenses* which are issues raised
first by the defense and which tend to prove the defendant's innocence.
Such defenses include insanity, entrapment, self-defense, etc. This does
not affect the fact that rebuttal of prosecutorial evidence need only
establish a reasonable doubt.

Don't conflate "defense" with "affirmative defense." The former is a
procedural event in which the defendant presents his case. The latter is
a particular issue raised first by the defense (and answered by the
prosecution) that tends to prove the defendants innocence.

Depending on what Clinton's "defense" is doing at a particular moment,
the burden of persuasion varies.

"[E]ven if the defendant denies one or more elements of the crime, he is
entitled to an entrapment instruction whenever there is sufficient
evidence from which a reasonable jury could find entrapment."_Mathews v.
U.S._ 485 U.S. 58, 108 S.Ct. 883, 99 L.Ed.2d 54 (1988) (Rhenquist, C.J.)

MY NOTE: This means that a defendant can deny that he committed the
crime, and then claim that the reason he committed it was because he was
entrapped.

I'm talking only about criminal trials here. You're free to argue that a
President convicted of obstruction would not be impeached. I would
suggest without any evidence at all to back me up that even a Democratic
Congress would be hard-pressed to find a reason to keep a convict in
office. I may be wrong.

Aksherly, there's quite a bit of developmental evidence that the whole
reason hemp produces THC and related compounds is because ungulents
(like cows) _hate_ the stuff.

On the other hand, hemp is farmed in the EU; it's not hard to breed a
strain of cannabis sativa that produces no intoxicating substances
whatsoever. (Although the cops tend to keep a close eye on farmers who
have a license to grow the stuff, just to make sure it's an approved
strain ...)

100 grams of stewed rabbit contains 10.1 grams of fat (plus or minus
0.04 grams).  This comes from my book _Nutirents_Catalog_ page 376.  In
order of fattiness, stewed rabbit falls between a ham and cheese
sandwich and stewed light meat chicken with skin which have about the
same ratio of fat.

Radar, as the name implies, was developed for rangefinding and
targetting in this program but the first principles upon which it is
based were not.  Radio experiments in the 20s and 30s discovered that
radio waves bounced off of storm fronts.  It was weather research and
a cool new toy called radio, not a need to track aricraft, which
brought us radar.

Ah, here's my cue to spew my microbiology reading: Brock and Madigan,
_Biology of Microorganisms_.  The ruminants are, in a sense, not
vegetarians.  They eat grass, but that goes to the rumen, which is
basicually a fermentation vat for bacteria.  The latter turn the grass
into various chemicals (fatty acids) and more bacteria.  Some of the
former are absorbed directly.  Many of the latter ride the cud back into
the stomach.  So in a sense a cow is a bacteriovore, not an herbivore;
the grass is just feedstock for the germs.

Rabbits are not ruminamts.  They do host a large population of bacteria,
but it's on the wrong end of their digestive tract.  Thus the recycling,
and the comment about kosherness.

The book said horses have the same problem, but AFAIK they do not have
the same solution.  I think horses can live wholly on grass, so I'm not
sure what's going on there.  Help would be welcome.

I've heard that you can die of fat starvation if your diet consists
wholly of wild jackrabbit and other low-fat foods.  Even if true, I
doubt that would apply to domestic rabbit, which does not spend most of
its life as a solid running muscle.

Actually, there's no need at all to resort to such circumlocutions.
While sworn testimony must be consistent, pleadings need not come
even close.  The standard lawyer's joke in this regard is "Your
honor, our claims are that (1) the plaintiff's injuries were not
the result of a dog bite, (2) it couldn't have been my dog that bit
him because it was tied up, (3) if my dog did bite him, it was because
the plaintiff provoked him when passing my yard, and (4) I don't
have a dog."

Actually, this is from Nick's wife, Myra. Although I wasn't asked, I'll
venture my opinion.

I grew up near DC, and the only food I ate for my first 18 years was fruits
and vegetables grown in the garden in my parents back yard. Occasionally we
had animal flesh from a grocery store, but no vegetables nor breads were
store bought. Almost all veggies consumed were either raw or steamed. A
favorite was fresh soybeans, which is impossible to purchase almost
anywhere and is incredibly delicious.

You can probably imagine what happened when I left home for college and my
diet became full of preservatives (institutional food, fast food,
restaurant food). Yes, for almost two years I was unable to keep most food
in my system and became a target for every flu and cold imaginable. A
lesson I've never forgotten.

The point being, we are poisioning ourselves with all the crap added to our
food, be it vegetable or meat and we deserve all the unhealthiness we have
because we've let it happen and have not demanded otherwise. As for beef
(who, for the most part graze on government lands, anyway) I don't see any
major business taking the time or money to replace that ca$h crop with
something else.

Myra

PS If we all put in gardens and ate what we grew, we'd be a lot healthier,
too. The only way to effect change in America's (by far the worst) eating
habits is to let the unhealthy ones die as an example to society. Will that
ever happen? Not likely.

I don't think it was the preservatives. It sounds rather like a big
shift in food habits from a diet you were very used to to another diet
which was significantly different plus an environmental shift to an
environment where you presumably experienced a lot of stress and
infections from other people. 

I think the dangers of preservatives are somewhat overstated. Sure,
there are unhealthy preservatives, but they are nothing compared to
the natural poisons in the plants we eat. Of course, this is heresy to
many :-)

I do not agree with the focus of the discussion on this mailing list revolving
around capitalism, communism, and the future.  Most of the ideas I have seen
seem to arise more from political and ideological motivations than sincere
attempts to speculate what the future holds for these socio-economic systems.

Capitalism, socialism (and its more extreme cousin communism, and most other
socio-economic systems that dot the ideological landscape all arise from one
central "fact of life" in the human experience since antiquity: scarcity of
resources.  I define "scarcity" as a condition where the sum demand for
resources of a given population exceeds the available supply of those
resources.  This is the classic "supply and demand" mechanism which drives any
market.  I find that the distinguishing characteristic between socialism and
capitalism is the degree to which this "supply and demand" mechanism is allowed
to determine who gets what they want and who does not.  "Resources" are defined
as essentially anything that someone wants (for whatever reason).  For capitalis
m, to the extent that a resource is scarce it has a value which is determined
by the dynamics of supply and demand.  For socialism, the supply and demand
dynamics are suppressed as much as possible to ensure an equanimity how many
resources each individual person has.  Both systems allege to be achieve the
optimal allocation of resources among a society, i.e. maximizing happiness or
utlity.  Whether either does better than the other in this regard is a subject
for the political scientists and the economists to debate.

Scarcity in an MNT Future

Several people have stated that they believe that capitalism will go the way of
the do-do in the future.  Often a fully realized molecular nanotechnology (MNT)
is cited as a reason for this predicted death of capitalism.  I do not think we
should dismiss capitalism in such a simple fashion.  A MNT future where
production is virtually free and the supply for such resources is virtually
limitless is beguiling.  I can understand why people, even using my definition
of "scarcity" above, could assert that such scarcity would no longer exist
since demand could easily exceed supply.  I submit that the one commodity
(scarce resource) in a MNT future would be MNT itself.  The only real
"object"/"process" with value would be the ability to produce with MNT.  The
crucial question becomes would the supply of MNT exceed the demand for it?

MNT Monopolies?

The supply of MNT would be extremely vulnerable to manipulation.  MNT supply
could be virtually limitless and definitely in excess of demand.  However, MNT
could be controlled in some fashion and its supply regulated similar to the
DeBeers/diamonds and OPEC/crude oil situations of the present.  MNT would be so
hard to contain, since if even a few assemblers "got out" they could render any
MNT monopoly obsolete in a matter of week, that if a MNT monopoly ever existed
it would probably be the most absolute institution in terms of power and
control to exist in history.  It would have to be to control the supply of MNT.

Drexler warned of the dangers of "stumbling into" the MNT age.  The threat of
MNT monopoly would be scary indeed not only for individuals but also for
governments who realized they would not be a part of it.  Maybe we can hope
that in attempts to ensure it was never subjected to such absolute control, a
scrupulous government or corporation would make MNT freely available long
enough for it to proliferate.

Scarity in an Age of Autarky?

If the supply of MNT did exceed demand, each individual would essentially be
self-sufficient.  Speculations on the technologies emerging out of MNT hint at
the possibilities of ancient institutions in the human experience being
rendered obsolete such as : the necessity of mates for reproduction (marriage),
death, limitations of the human experience in general (intelligence, insight,
physical limits, etc.).  What would be considered scarce in such a future?
Scarcity may arise from limitations so basic and fundamental that vast
technologies beyond even MNT would be required to eliminate them.  (note: I
find the same confrontation with fundamental scarcity arising in a future where
superintelligent artifical life-forms [assuming they are competitive] race at e
xponential speeds to usurp one another)  Aspects of the universe such as time,
energy, mass, heat (a derivative of time), etc. would become the fundamental
limits that (trans)humans in an MNT future would confront.  The vast
technologies needed to eliminate them?  Tapping into additional supplies of
these resources which I can only determine would be possible by accessing other
universes (this assuming the multiverse speculations of Lee Smolin et. al. are
true).  Is there some resource more fundamental (and immune to the machinations
of life) than time, etc,?  I can not imagine what it would be.

Your anecdote gives me exactly the opposite conclusion; your immune
system was underdeveloped because your early diet was insufficiently
diverse.  Your body only had to deal with the microbes in your yard,
so it never developed antobodies for other common bacteria in food.
When you encountered many such foods all at once, naturally you
became sick.

Our health would not be improved by similarly limiting our diets to
what we grew (nor would the financial disadvantage of such a wasteful
practice be without health consequences).  /Your/ health would have
been much more robust if your diet had been more varied as a child.
Children who travel a lot, in particular, have strong immune systems
from having experienced the marvellous variety of bugs our planet
has to offer.

When I lived in rural Nebraska from '85-'87 "ditchweed" (as it was indeed
called) was as abundant as ever.  What I found really interesting was that
none of the locals collected or smoked it despite the fact that it grew
absolutely everywhere.  However, people from the East and West coast would
frequently come out and harvest it, occasionally getting busted for their
effort.

So why do you think it was the preservatives?  The consumption of 
preservatives has soared in this century but the rate of colds and flu
have remained constant.  The highest rates of flu in the world are
from South China, where preservates are few.  Flus and colds have
many causes, but preservatives aren't one of them.

Epidemiologists have been trying to link health problems to 
preservative consumption for decades and all they've come up with 
is that eating preservatives appears to *reduce* the chance of stomach 
cancer.  This was thought probably a fluke for many years, but now
that Heliobacter pylori has been linked to stomach cancer it's 
thought that preservatives work through the rather prosaic method
of killing the main cause of cancer in your stomach.

	You are right, in that it is not likely.  I suppose there will
always be people eating food from gardens, but as more and more 
preservatives are being added to our food, artificial selection will favor
those with the higher tolerances for such additives.  Those who are less
able to survive such chemicals will set a darwinian example, so to speak.

Maybe mercury will actually be pretty tasty in five hundred years.

"Despite rapid and radical advances in medicine, why are more people
sick?  Emphasis on prompt detection of certain symptoms is supposed to
prevent serious illness.  With everyone listening for internal gurgles,
feeling for lumps, and pondering each pain, hypersensitivity cannot be
avoided.  Does a consuming concern for diet and exercise make for
healthier living than sitting in the car gobbling Big Macs?  Which takes a
greater toll -- fear of the effects of preservatives, chemical-pumped
chicken, mercury-saturated fish -- or the foods themselves?" 

I'm not going to attribute that quote to the author, but if someone here
knows where that is from, then I would love to continue a private email
discussion on the matter. (because it is not very relevant to the
Extropians list)

While I have never to my knowledge seen hemp growing wild alongside 
the road, I have seen a great many other things growing there.

Things growing in the ditch tend to grow close together, which in the 
case of cannabis plants makes them grow tall and gangly.  A lot of 
stem, not much leaf.

Those who know even a little about cannabis cultivation, read that 
as "a lot of fiber for paper or cloth, but not much pot and 
that of low quality". 

In addition to which, being alongside the road it tends to pick up 
all sorts of interesting chemicals from traffic going by.

Many countries want American US $ and don't care too much about these silly
cloning bans or other regulations.  These include tropical islands that are
sovereign like the Bahamas, Cayman Islands and also many Central American
countries like Guatemala.  None of the above countries are not that far away.  Any
of them are probably closer to the US border than Maine is to California or Texas
is from Alaska or Hawaii).

Sure, that's why we have canines, right?

They are probably correct that our distant ancestors *did* live on a 
primarily fruit diet for a long time.  Some primates still do.  But 
all the great apes -- our closest kin -- are omnivores, even the ones 
that live mostly on fruit.

I frequently annoy certain veggiefanatics who say "if you ever saw an 
animal butchered, you'd never eat meat again."

Because I look at them square in the face and say "I have personally 
taken cute furry little bunnies from the pen where they were being 
raised to the slaughter room, butchered them, hauled them up to the 
kitchen, cooked them, and helped eat them."

  ------------------

It works on the flip side too.  If  I had any doubt about the 
atrocities the federal government committed a few years ago at Waco, 
the story that they were using tape recordings of rabbits being 
"slaughtered" for psychological warfare would totally remove those 
doubts.

I know exactly what slaughtering a rabbit sounds like.  It's almost 
silent.

I also know what a screaming rabbit sounds like.  THAT would be a 
good psychological warfare tool.  But in order to make rabbits 
scream, you need to torture them (or at least make them think they 
are being tortured).  And torturing is not part of a competent 
slaughtering operation.  In fact it degrades the quality of the meat 
(adrenaline or something changes the taste).

The federal government was playing tapes of someone TORTURING 
rabbits.

Lawyers frequently argue in the alternative.  One excellent example 
(I don't know if it's real or not) involved a person being sued for 
borrowing an item and then returning it badly damaged.

The defense was (a) the defendant never borrowed the item, (b) the 
defendant returned the item in perfect condition, and (c) the item 
was already damaged when the defendant borrowed it.

If the defense could convince the court that any *one* of these 
things was true, the court should find for the defendant.

This doesn't matter because there is one resource that will always be 
in short supply, that MNT can't do a thing about.

That resource is creativity.

And to pay for creativity, another resource which can already be 
produced in very large quantities with essentially no resource input 
but which, it appears, we will also never have enough of:

respect.

Yes, there are bad preservatives, nitrites for example.  But many are potent
antioxidants, some may be good for you.  The BHA/BHT question is definitly a
subject for more research.  But the primary value of their use is to minimize
the oxidation of the oils.  Rancid oils are life shortening.   Rather than the
preservatives, I worry more about the pesticide residues, and their possible
hormone activities.  It is better to grow or buy direct from farmers (fresh).
It tastes better!  
When we eat diverse plants, some containing carcinogens (or some other toxin)
, we also consume anticarcinogens (Carotenoids, vit C and E, the brocolli
stuff...)
Our systems and defenses have evolved to work best with a mix of plant
chemicals.  Longevity may select, evolving as grandparents increased the
survival probability  in more complex societies.
Does this thread belong on the Extropy list?  Yes I think so.  The topic may
be of interest to the lifextensionist color of Extropianism.  Lifextension and
damage minimization (increased qualilty of life) is a fine Extropian idea
until powerful  nanomolecular methods are available, alone or in conjunction
with cryonics.

Some years ago James Hogan wrote a novel which addressed this concept.  I was
greatly impressed by it and think it has significant bearing on a MNT future.
If memory serves it was entitle "Voyage to Tommorow" or something similar. 

The "currency" was respect and the commodity was creativity.

Interesting.   Amazon doesn't list that title but they do list 
"Voyage from Yesteryear".

I had never previously, as far as I am aware, 
encountered these two things put together in a single work  (I had 
encountered creativity as the ultimate scarce resource, and respect 
as the ultimate payment, each seperately, more than once) .

But we can certainly find examples of it.

HOW do the members of the Linux community recognise needs for certain 
software and do good jobs of providing that software?

Creativity.

WHY do they choose to circulate that software, mostly for free?

Respect and reciprocity.

starship transits to Alpha Centurai from earth....the only "life" it carries
is germ plasm....prior to planet fall the "clones" are activated and raised by
the computer...a society is established on the planetary surface...robot
factories (robotipia?) meet every physical need...the only thing that
computers and robots CANNOT supply is creativity...

In that society a person innovates...or creates...and his creations can be
endlessly duplicated by the robot factories..and given away for the
asking....that person is "paid" ...given respect...by the "popularity" of his
creations...(be it poetry,novel..,automobile,...or rocking chair)..the more
who people avail themselves of it...the higher his esteem...

There is of course more... a lot more...to the novel...but that's what
impressed me the most...and I think it has some relevance to a MNT Future.

I agree.  I have seen big and small companies that had money, management,
and popularity.  I have seen brilliant programmers who could make computers
do the impossible.  I have seen engineers that could turn any paper design
into reality.  But without creativity, without the ideas of what to do,
these companies and people are useless.  They continue, business as usual,
and fail to produce anything new, anything exciting, anything worthwhile.

Of course, this makes one wonder, given the predelictions of mass murderers
like Jeffery Dahmer toward animal torture, what sort of people we have
running the government....where did they get those tapes? Did they make
them under government contract? Were they made by someone in the office one
day? Or was it a home based hobby?  The fact that the press simply took
their claims at face value, that the sounds were the sournds of slaugtering
rabbits, shows you the competence and gullibility of the establishment
media to parrot the government line.

I am no expert, Johnny, so I may be way off base, but it seems 
to me that cookies can be used for monitoring all sorts of 
Internet browsing behavior.  Whether or not it is possible to 
program a cookie to send its data into the number-crunchers is 
unknown to me, but I suspect that they could.

In view of that, the most likely scenario I could think of, 
barring the one proposed by McCandlish, is that cookies are 
distributed to visitors in order to gauge their overall Web 
habits, and to formulate a psy-op targeting this group in order 
to convince them that Goddard is all wrong, that the truth will 
never be known, or that it just isn't worth the effort to try to 
figure it out - whatever it takes to neutralize the group with 
regard to that topic.

Make sense to you?

     Thanks for your forward on internet privacy.  Living here in the DC
area it has become quite clear to me that the web is a creation of the
intelligence community arising from the very secret Command, Control and
Communications (C-3) initiatives of the Reagan administration.  It would
be foolish to think that such a technology is somehow immune from
government and other snooping.

     I have felt for some time that what we need is a law assuring
internet privacy for users similar to that provided to telephone users,
which would require court orders for government snooping.  To be
effective such a law should carry stiff criminal penalties for
violations (its the only thing that curbs the behavior of government
agents).  If you are concerned about these issues please advocate this
legislation at the federal level.   Dan Alcorn dalcorn@erols.com

 Mr. Pompei, Thank you for your valued input. As you point out, it is
just as easy for the Navy to use "cookies" to "gauge threats, or to
gather dirt" as it is for you. However, the implications of the Armed
Forces checking up on the activities of US citizens are far more
ominous and alarming than if you did it. As to your admonition to "be
a little careful about our conspiracy theories"; I agree, but let's
also be careful about our state of denial and complacency. Yesterday's
"conspiracy theories" are fast becoming todays news, as newly
declassified documents are released which support the "wild claims"
made by "conspiracy theorists" of the 60's & 70's. As Federal Judge
Sporkin said in his recent ruling on Navy computer snooping: "In these
days of 'Big Brother' ".Indeed!  Thank you, and have a happy Eternity,

Primate canines are apparently primarily for male-male sexual dominance
displays.  The size of canines in primate is very closely correlated with
how often males fight for females.  Monogamous species have small canines
and harem species have big ones.

But, yes, many primates eat mostly fruit, including some putative ancestors,
and I think it is reflected in the teeth somehow.

Why not? When you find a person, computer, animal or machine that operates 
exceptionally well and is very good at coming up with new ideas, have your 
Nano robots take it apart atom by atom and record the position and velocity 
of every particle. With this information you can make as many persons, 
computers, animals or machines as you like, and all of them will have the
intelligence, experience, and understanding of the world that you admired so 
much in the original. Creativity would be a commodity you could crank out by 
the ton.      


        >it appears, we will also never have enough of: respect.


Respect is just a matter of altering a mental state, we've been doing 
that sort of thing in a crude way for thousands of years even without 
Nanotechnology, all we needed was a little alcohol. Think my ideas are 
dreadful if not comically stupid? No problem! In an age of Nanotechnology  
you can always change your mind, and I do mean, CHANGE YOUR MIND. 
Now you think my ideas are wonderful and look at me with awe.

Turkey is an excellent example of this.  Only a biologist would recognize
the wild bird as belonging to the same species as the bloated turkey found
on turkey farms.  They are so radically different in appearance and
composition.

  IAN: In fact hemp seed used to be a staple
  food product for livestock. Some activists
  in my area raised chickens on hemp seed,
  which was legally acquired from China. They
  did a video on it called "Refer Rosters."

  The chickens ignored all other feed and 
  ran over each other to get the hemp seed. 
  In the video they show the feed trough with
  hemp on one side and the regular feed on 
  the other side. All the chickens go only for 
  the hemp, and go crazy for it. (You can find 
  hemp seed in some bird food at pet shops.)

  The chickens grew almost twice as large as 
  normal chickens and their meat was graded by 
  a USDA inspector as the best he's ever seen.
  Hemp seed is simply unparalleled in quality.

  The funniest thing was that they took the 
  "refer rosters" to a local police picnic.
  The police where really chowing down on 
  the refer rosters when they learned what
  the chickens were raised on. But, don't
  worry, as I'll explain, the police were
  spared any experience of euphoric bliss.

  IAN: Most hemp has very-low THC, and I've heard 
  that in Japan there is a variety with no THC. :^(

  However, the seeds of all varieties of cannabis 
  sativa and cannabis indica are 100% THC free. 
  THC is only produced on the outer surface of 
  the plant's leaves and flowering tops, found in
  a clear sticky liquid exuding from leaf pours 
  and along and on top of small hairs where the 
  liquid builds up into little crystal-ball-like 
  "dew drops" called tricomes. This occurs most 
  significantly around the flowering tops, even
  on the brackets that hold the seeds, but the 
  seeds themselves are 100% THC free as are all
  interior parts of the plant, contrary to pop-
  ular misconception. 

  People who smoke cannabis for getting high can 
  know it the pot is good by a simple visual in-
  spection: if it has lots of the little crystal 
  tricomes appearing like salt on the surface of 
  the buds, it's good stuff, if not, it's weak.

  The theory is that the plant uses the tricomes 
  as an insect and animal repellent, as they are 
  also high in terpinoids that give off a strong
  smell and are toxic to insects, but not humans.
  The tricomes are most prolific on the outer sur-
  face of the flowering tops containing the most 
  important part of the plant, the reproductives.

  One way that hashish is produced is having 
  people wearing leather clothing run through 
  fields of cannabis. The sticky tricomes on 
  the outer surface of the plants will stick 
  to the clothing and build up over time until
  it can be scrapped off and rolled up into 
  balls of hashish, which is simply a mash of 
  almost pure tricomes, which is why it's so 
  much more psychoactive than the dried plant, 
  since only the tricomes on the outer surface 
  of the plant contain THC and the plant tissue 
  contains no THC. I did a report on cannabis 
  in high school is why I know a lot about it.

If you're not buying and selling lots of the same product, you don't
even need a currency.  If 
everything that exists is free, then only thing you could possibly
want is something that does not 
exist.  Thus, by adding a little creativity into the mix it's more
likely to get invented - the 
commodity is the currency.

  IAN: When I traveled through Nebraska on a bus
  I was looking out the window and noticed to my 
  amazement that the gullies running between huge
  wheat fields that ran up to the road were filled
  with cannabis... large cannabis plants with huge
  leaves. These cannabis patches would even run 
  alongside the road, patches of pure cannabis. 
  There had to be miles and miles of it in all. 

  I pointed this out to some people I'd got to 
  know on the bus and soon everyone was looking 
  for it, but, since the bus was traveling pretty 
  fast, nobody else was able to catch it visually.
  Just another one of those experiences where I'm
  the only one who can see something... he's crazy!

  But I asked a local during a stop the bus took 
  about this and the guy said, "Ya that's ditch 
  weed, it grows all over but it's no good." 

  It occurred to me that the locals there could 
  deploy one of many methods for removing the 
  tricomes from the flowering tops of the fe-
  male plants to produce Nebraska Hash. But
  of course, that would be illegal.

Yet the chimpanzee, contrary to the claims of liberally blindered researchers,
have been shown to prefer meat as a food source. Even Dr. Goodall has confirmed
this. Since chimps are our closest existing relatives, I think that what some
fruit sucking lemur does is a little less relevant. Better yet is what
paleontologists find out about our ancestors like Home Heidelbergensis, Homo
Antecessor,, or Proto-Homo Sapiens preferred for a diet.

Fortunately, they don't have the manpower to process all that info, even with
filters etc. There's just too many people sending too much stuff...right?

This causes my bullshit alarm to ring loudly.
1)The bandwidth of "all e-mail, telephone and fax communications" in Europe
would be quite high--higher than any feasible satellite channel.
2) Where are the signals intercepted by NSA? nearly all are land-line
only, with no radio component, so physical taps would be necessary. This would
certainly require colusion of the European PTTs, which are mostly run by
European governments. Why would they permit NSA to do this?
3) With serious compression, a phone call can be squeezed to an average of
perhaps 500bytes/sec. There are probably an average of at least one million
simulatneous phone calls in europe at any time. This is 500 megabytes (4 gigabits)
per second, requiring 43.2 terabytes of storage per day. the compression would
require roughly one million very competent DSPs. automatic keyword recognition
equipment would require at least an additional 2 miooion DSPs.

I might believe that NSA attempts to intercept as much military microwave voice
as they possibly can in Russia, and that they used to do a lot more of that in
eastern Europe, but modern commercial landlines are a different story entirely.

Cannabioids are interesting chemicals, although I think they have very
limited transhuman applications. The known receptors are found mainly
in the basal ganglia, the cerebellum and especially the
hippocampus. It seems that the cannabioids have an overall inhibitory
effect on the hippocampus, leading to memory impairments (Drew et al
1980). In fact, an antagonist has shown nootropic effects by improving
memory (Terranova 1996). This, coupled with the decrease in motivation
(a serotonin inhibition effect?) doesn't suggest them as very useful
for a transhuman other than as chemical entertainment.

<Neuroscientist speculation mode on> It is interesting to speculate
that the feelings of meaningfulness and profound insights are related
to the temporal lobe epilepsy syndrome. And also the model that
hippocampal region CA1 does novelty/familiarity detection of
experiences (see for example "Encoding and Retrieval of Episodic
Memories: Role of Cholinergic and GABAergic Modulation in the
Huippocampus" by Michael E. Hasselmo, Bradley P. Wyble and Gene
V. Wallenstein in Hippocampus 6:693-708 (1996)). Is marijuana use
linked to feelings of Deja vu or its opposite? If this holds, it could
mess up the familiarity/novelty detection systems, making the user
think that a new experience was familiar or an old experience fresh
and new.  <Neuroscientist speculation mode on>


Effects of hippocampal brain damage on auditory and visual recent
memory: comparison with marijuana-intoxicated subjects.

Biol Psychiatry 1980 Dec;15(6):841-858 
Drew WG, Weet CR, De Rossett SE, Batt JR

A battery of tests clinically employed for the estimation of auditory
and visual recent memory dysfunction was administered to eight
subjects having circumscribed damage to the temporal lobe.  It was
hypothesized that the performance of subjects with temporal lobe
lesions would qualitatively resemble that of subjects intoxicated with
marijuana. Where comparisons could be made, the performance of these
"temporal lobe" patients paralleled the performance of subjects
acutely intoxicated with known doses of delta 9-THC. Results are
discussed in terms of cannabinoid actions on hippocampal functioning
and, in general, support the hypothesis that the action of marijuana
in the brain may focus in the hippocampal region and produce
behavioral changes similar to that resulting from traumatic injury or
removal of the region.




Improvement of memory in rodents by the selective CB1
cannabinoid receptor antagonist, SR 141716.

Psychopharmacology (Berl) 1996 Jul;126(2):165-172 

Terranova JP, Storme JJ, Lafon N, Perio A, Rinaldi-Carmona M, Le Fur
G, Soubrie P

Social short-term memory in rodents is based on the recognition of a
juvenile by an adult conspecific when the juvenile is presented on two
successive occasions. Cannabimimetics are claimed to induce memory
deficits in both humans and animals. In the brain, they mainly bind to
CB1 receptors for which anandamide is a purported endogenous
ligand. SR 141716, a specific antagonist of CB1 receptors,
dose-dependently reverses biochemical and pharmacological effects of
cannabimimetics. More particularly, it antagonizes the inhibition of
hippocampal long-term potentiation induced by WIN 55,212-2 and
anandamide, and it increases arousal when given alone. The present
experiments study the ability of SR 141716 (from 0.03 to 3 mg/kg SC)
to facilitate short-term olfactory memory in the social recognition
test in rodents. SR 141716 improved social recognition in a long
intertrial paradigm with a threshold dose of 0.1 mg/kg SC. At 1 mg/kg,
it antagonized the memory disturbance elicited by retroactive
inhibition. Scopolamine (0.06 mg/kg IP) partially reversed its
memory-enhancing effect. Moreover, SR 141716 reduced memory deficit in
aged rats (0.03-0.1 mg/kg) and mice (0.3-1 mg/kg). As SR 141716 is not
known to exhibit any pharmacological activity which is not mediated by
CB1 receptors, the results strongly support the concept that blockade
of CB1 receptors plays an important role in consolidation of
short-term memory in rodents and suggest there may be a role for an
endogenous cannabinoid agonist tone (anandaminergic) in forgetting.

>From what I saw in the story, they have some sort of filter that automatically tags
traffic that can be classified as 'target information' that only mentions, say,
certain technologies, or certain groups, or activities, like attacking political
figures, etc..  Having a number of these sort of filter taps in main switching
centers, with forwarding to the mentioned center in England for transmission to the US
is entirely within the known current capability of the NSA. It is already used by US
based law enforcement when the appropriate court orders are issued, and generally for
such threats as that to the president's life. For example, my typing here the phrase
(NOTE TO THE NSA:  this is a test, not a real threat) 'kill the president' will set
off certain triggers in the filters that oversee email traffic. Currently here in the
US, this is done via the FCC. Those of you using Netscape 3.02 will notice when you
send email messages that in the bottom bar of the mail window there will be displayed
a message of the current status of transmission. If you are fast, and you have a
particularly slow computer, you'll notice that a message will flash quickly saying
that your message was posted to the FCC. From what I've seen, the message duplications
go to the FCC for a filtering. Those that contain no 'target information' are tossed.
SInce only messages containing 'target information' is saved, the actual archiving
requirements are far far less than thought by the previous poster, and this operation
could be managed by a few good Alpha servers, maybe a Cray or two.

Yeah, and rats will starve themselves to death given a choice between an
endless supply of cocaine or food.

To maximize your chance of making it to the singularity, the
transcension, or whatever, you really shouldn't eat meat. Not only is
the fat bad for you, but the amino acid composition of meat is unhealthy
( e.g. too much methionine, which increases plasma homocysteine levels,
a risk factor for heart attack).

Practically nobody with a blood cholesterol level below 140 ng/dl ever
gets cardiovascular disease, the number one killer in the western world.
The only way to reach this low level for most people is to consume _no_
cholesterol in the diet. This means eating _no_ animal products. Such a
diet also greatly reduces your chances of developing a lot of cancers,
the number two killer in the western world.

A bit like sheep, who enjoys eating newly hatched birds in
ground-level nests if they can find them (according to what I heard,
they need the calcium in their bones). Nature is full of opportunists
- no point in ignoring an available food source.

I find it amusing that many vegitarians rely on the myth that it is
natural to eat only plants, when they should acknowledge the
unnaturalness of their eating style with heads held high - they are
overcoming genes in favor of their own memes.

Have you ever seen the NSA building?  Or how much fiber they have running
into it?  I've heard that an excessive amount - which I thought would be
used to spy on Americans - not until now did I ever think that perhaps the
economic situation in Europe would warrant such attention by the NSA.
Maybe it should be called the ISA...

It seems that like a lot of scientists, there is one variable which may
escape you. Experience. What experience do you have using this drug? You
can speculate about its possible effects on the brain, but it seems that
when you guess at something like this and remove personal experience from
the mix, there's little substance left.

I'm a long time smoker of hemp and find its effects very productive and
useful. I use it as a catalyst to encourage the sort of "flow" and
intuition that is at the root of my very best artwork. In fact, I can
speak for a large portion of the fine arts community and certainly an even
bigger segment of the music community that hemp is a powerful creative
catalyst.

How does that fit into your estimation of its function on the brain??

I'll tell you why I'd like to think of hemp as a (pardon the clich)
transhuman tool because at the root of my personal transition are the
creative ideas which forge and inspire my visions of a future culture. As
a technology artist, the cultural and technological speculation I make
about our world could eventually inspire its evolutionary direction. (not
that my ideas are changing the world, but look at philip k dick or other
visionary futurists) I'm not saying their process or mine depends on hemp,
but I'm sure that if you were to investigate why artists use hemp, they'd
have a similar opinion.

I think on another level, its true that a drug like hemp, can create a
powerful apathetic response in some people.  But to generalize is always
dangerous. I'm a very driven person and I don't let 'drugs' derail success
by tampering with my drive..  I'm managing to fill my world with
technology, remain self employed and live in one of the most expensive
cities in the U.S.

Ok.. my ranting ends..

I think the fears that the NSA monitors everything are somewhat
overstated. 

First, the line-eater (the system storing all emails containing "hot"
words) is an old myth (there are line-eater annoying sigfiles filled
with hot words dating back to the early days of the net). The problem
with it is that it is too unselective, you get far too much junk which
has to be eyeball-scanned (imagine just wading through alt.conspiracy
daily) - it is not cost effective even with a lot of personell. And
the real terrorists and subversives of course do not email their
master plans over the net in plaintext (how many terorrist groups rely
on postcards for internal communication?). It is trivial to use
another phrase ("Let's greet the king with the blue bolts") or
encryption (not even strong encryption is needed against a
line-eater).

Second, large scale trawling is as far as I know an inefficient way of
finding the ones you are looking for, it is a brute force
search. There are better ways, which the net *does* make easy. There
is great interest in finding out who communicates with whom, since
this is usually much more useful to know than what they
say. Clustering algorithms can easily derive your social network by
checking your mail headers. A little intelligence goes a long way - if
you know a suspicious person, check his network and mail, and use that
information to trace further.This is apparently how the Swedish secret
police SAPO tried to track down Kurdish terrorists, although that was
by checking phone calls.

As for Netscape sending data to the FCC, that is most certainly a myth
too. Likely it is a mix up between FCC the organisation and FCC the
protocol. If there was such a routine in the program, it would be
trivial to dig it up and make public (remember the Microsoft trick?)
and it would definitely not display what it was doing :-)
 
When it comes to NSA access to european phone networks, that is an
interesting matter. I seem to recall that in the aftermath of WW II
the US was given extremely far-reaching authority to intercept phone
calls in the Bundesrepublik. How much of that access remains is a good
question. When it comes to France it seems more unlikely that its
government would ever allow NSA access (remember that DSDG (or
whatever it is called) have been quite active when it comes to
counter-espinage against the US, especially in the areas of industrial
espionage). As for the rest of the continent, I think the likeliehood
of outside access varies just as much (I read some semi-paranoid texts
a few years back about the backdoors in BTs telephone systems; much of
it seemed possible to do like the peacetime use of military routing to
eavesdrop). The problem is that it is not a homogenous system, with
far too many competing interests, to be consistently
eavesdropped. Personally I don't worry as much about NSA as I worry
about all the *other* groups who are likely trying to exploit the
systems.

Paranoia can be useful. But only if it is combined with critical thinking. 

[neuropsychology theory of the day: paranoia is caused by insufficient
inhibition of little supported but threatening scenarios. Scenariosare
generated all the time, but normally only the realistic ones remain to
be acted on. However, if the realism-inhibitioon is weak, the scenario
has a high threat value and if it can provide support for itself (even
if this is through circular reasoning) it will become more active and
reach the conscious level where it will cause the person to seek
evidence for it, leading to paranoia. Even lover levels of inhibition
will make even non-threatening scenarios more active, causing
delusions. Hmm, I wonder how this fits with the models of spreading

I have no intention of discussing this in the abstract.

Set and setting may play a very large role in exactly what is inhibited and
how it is interpreted or employed. I have little doubt that I could tailor
an experiment to produce those results, and I am aware that they are part
of the lore of hemp use. But I know people whose results differ. I think it
has to do with where and how you practice placement of your attention. 

As another point, is catalytic use of cannabinoids to trigger healing of
psychological wounds something you would define as "chemical
entertainment"? :) When does hedonics not equal transcendence? :)

Actually, such a mode of partially inducing "beginner's mind" has its uses
too, but more in synthesis and pattern-breaking (an element of what we
sometimes call creativity). This is again predicated on the intention on
creating, rather than just sitting around saying "wow" a lot.

Have you read Lakeoff's _Women, Fire and Dangerous Things_? It's about the
function and failure of categories. I found it a compelling read, except
for the cases at the very end (which were dry academic props for the
material that had gone before).

 Complicating our perception doesn't sound like an extropian goal.
I only accept complexity when it's an unavoidable consequence of
my other goals.

 A good argument for thinking about it, but with no obvious relevance
to what we eat.

 I generally do care whether people on this list die unnecessarily.
