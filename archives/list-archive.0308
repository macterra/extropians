It depends on why it sucks.

To summarize the post, I showed that genocide, as a proposed solution to any
problem, was going to be entirely unsatisfactory, based on the extropian
principles. Further, I talked about the damage to this group, both in terms
of cohesion and PR, from its continued discussion. I asserted that it sucked
(to add a bit of heat to the light) based on the preceding.

That's not genocide though, it's about war, something entirely different.

Well, it was trading off current vs future human lives, without an explicit
valuation, on an unsupported premise (that destroying countries x, y and z
will increase extropy).

Sure, yes, I agree. That's a natural disaster. God's the genocidal maniac in
that story, we're just picking up the pieces as usual.

True, because it's not.

Fine, but these will likely be in response to desperate situations, where it
is demostrable that the alternative is worse. Unlike your example.

I don't think it's the same issue. When you discuss such a thing, it must be
in the context that the needs of the many have been clearly identified and
supported. NEO impact, killer disease outbreak vs containment, these are
relatively unambiguous. Blowing up entire countries on suspicion of
harbouring terrorists, that's something else entirely; it's genocide.

btw, I couldn't find anything about the PBS program you linked to; is the
link too old?

[samantha] I think you know full well this isn't a very good argument.
That a small 
amount of money was required for an act of terrorism resulting in N
deaths 
does not say that M times that amount will result in M*N deaths.

Thanks for the pointer to Dan's list, I'll look into that. I have to say
it's become increasingly clear that nobody has informed you that the only
reason I was invited to this elegant affair is because I saved Rose.

Mike, please correct me if I am wrong. From your text I infer that the majority of issues that you consider really important, are those related to whether or not you can carry a gun.
I did not change the title because I do not want to start a new gun thread, but I find difficult to understand why you and many others make a big issue of this.
If I had to spend time in a really dangerous place, and if no other kind of protection is in place, of course I would wish to carry a gun, perhaps even if this is not allowed by the law. But the meaning I attribute to this sentence is not different from the meaning I attribute to "If I had to spend time in a place where it is raining, and if no other kind of protection is in place, of course I would wish to carry a umbrella, perhaps even if this is not allowed by the law". I do not consider umbrellas and guns as defining aspects of my worldview.

Umbrellas, like some other objects, are tools that provide imperfect
protection in certain relatively uncommon situations.  Wouldn't it
seem awfully peculiar to live in a place where umbrellas were not
allowed unless one had a permit to carry one?  In the case that
virtually all umbrella uses were to keep the rain off oneself, would
it not appear that any umbrella-ban is going to have the primary
effect of causing people to be wet who would otherwise have been dry?

I'm not sure umbrellas are defining parts of Mike's worldview either,
except insofar as the act of banning them suggests that someone wants
him to get wet.

I don't actually speak for Mike, of course, but that's my view. :)

       I'm all for transparency in theory, but just how transparent should we 
make things?
Is there anyone on the list that would willingly display every facet of their 
life to the rest of the world ?
Would you really like your Mother, Boss or neighbours to be able to watch 
while you improve your prostate health (as described in a recent post) ?

How much privacy do we need or want? and when does transparency for the good 
of the whole become a violation of personal rights?

Personally, I could happily live in a world where everyone has access to my 
finacial details, employment record and even my genetic code. When it comes to 
bedroom and bathroom activities, that's my business.

In an 'ideal' transparent world where access to information about anyone and 
anything, anywhere is available. Where do we set the level for personal 
privacy? if at all.

I feel far less safe than ever before, and no amount of heavy weaponry

I have been following this in the last few days, and find it very, very interesting. But I am not sure I understand it well yet.
Of course I can see that idea futures markets with a large user base can distill what users view as the most probable outcomes on the basis of the information available, better than a single expert. It is a way of analysing available information by filtering personal biases out of the brainwork of many people who, since they were betting cash or reputation, have been thinking hard of the issue at hand.
But "available information" seems to me an important keyword. How can the system work when there is no information available? That is a definition of covert preparation, for example of terrorist attack: very little or no information is available to the external world. So why should an idea futures market work better than my, or your, blind guesswork?
Assuming that the system would work, we have here an idea that someone at DARPA has considered worth spending millions on, on the basis of operational considerations, then has been dropped on the basis of ethical and PC considerations. So this looks like a terrific business opportunity for the private sector, as the BBC author says. It would be interesting taking a look at the DARPA project documentation, that has disappeared from the DARPA website, does anyone have copies?
How could such a business be developed? Terrorism aside, how would a profit making version of Foresight Exchange work? The only possibilities that I can see are: - working with real cash and keeping a small fraction for system maintenance and development - selling advertising space on the website - selling analyses and results to buyers (e.g. selling the DoD the estimate of the system to terrorism in the Middle East). All three possibilities would become viable only after developing a very, very large user base.
I am sure this had been already discussed extensively, any pointers?

Well, in life not everything is a supported premise.  The military
has to say if we take this hill we may be successful while if we take
that hill we may not.  The doctor has to say if we sacrifice the time,
or blood, or other supplies required to save one patient we may
be able to save these other two.

Its all about judgement calls.

Ah, but in my premise we have a choice to do something or not to
do something that would allow us to effectively be genocidal maniacs
*now* or even greater genocidal maniacs later.

It is a "pick your poison" problem -- just as is choosing to do or
not do things with respect to say global hunger, AIDS, war in
various nations, etc. are.

How "desperate" a situation is is a matter of perception.
I *did* give you the body counts.  I believe that only
Anders attempted to address the "present value" of human
life issue (anyone, pls. correct me if I am wrong).

I thought the needs were clear -- the value of future lives vs. the
value of current lives.  Perhaps I should have made that clearer.

### I wouldn't be surprised if the Pentagon went ahead with a covert futures
market, open to FBI/Homeland Security?CIA/NSA/OtherUnheardOfSpyAgency
employees, so as to allow aggregation of data among persons most likely to
have data in the first place, with a big "Top Secret" stamp on it and some
deniability (perhaps as in a tolerated semi-informal betting market to be
ditched if the sanctimonious crowd gets wind of it). Almost all the benefits
of PAM, none of the exposure to idiots.

This is actually another way of exploring the FP. The enforcement
system has to be able to stop replicators before they get out of
hand, and we can start constraining them by theory and maybe even 
start looking for them. 

Imagine "antibodies" spread evenly in the galaxy, detecting the
signature of a replicator seed. They immediately launch a
lightspeed attack on the seed; this will work only if the seed has
not arrived at the target system, so the antibody has to be inside
the future lightcone of the launch event and the past lightcone of
the arrival event. Now, let the density is rho antibodies/ly^3,
the average distance between stars are D ly and seeds travel at v. 
The spatial volume of the lightcone intersection is a somewhat
troublesome intersection between an expanding and a contracting
sphere (there is a formula at
http://www.princeton.edu/~apr/articles/pre2cut/node10.html). As a
rough approximation, the spatial volume where antibodies can act
is ~(pi/4) D^3 (1+c/v)^2 There has to be at least one antibody per
such volume. For the somewhat plausible v=0.3c and D=4.3 ly the
volume is ~1000 ly^3. So the density has to be ~1e-3/ly^3 or more,
or replicators would be able to get to other systems, disasseble
them and launch absurd amounts of replicators elsewhere,
overwhelming the antibodies. 

This is likely a sizeable installation, since it should be able to
detect a small replicator seed (a nanoprobe launched with an
interplanetary railgun?), pinpoint its trajectory and launch an
attack that is effective over many lightyears. Sounds somewhat
implausible, which suggests more antibodies instead. I don't know
the effective range of lasers or similar beam weapons in
interstellar space (something for the SDI/ABM people to think of),
but it seems likely it is not that long compared to the distances
between stars.  Hence we should expect antibodies with an average
distance corresponding to the effective range of their weapon
rather than being relativistically limited - and this makes them
much more likely to be detected. In fact, it may even be
reasonable for the galactic club to make them relatively visible
to interplanetary civilisations, since that way emerging civs
might get the hint and abstain from doing something stupid. 

On the other hand, if weapons can be powerful broadsides a la
supernovae or GRBs (like the Chenzeme of Nagata's books) then you
only need a few of them and will likely get the civilization that
launched them too. And it makes sense to put the antibodies in or
near the solar systems (and brown dwarves), since that is where
launches are likely. Hmm, my argument needs more analysis than I
have time for...

Anyway, considering enforcement methods over interstellar 
distances might give us a new angle to deal with the paradox.

As an addendum to Damiens excellent post, I just found this in the
latest PNAS:


PNAS | July 22, 2003 | vol. 100 | no. 15 | 9085-9089

Resolving the question of color naming universals 

Paul Kay    and Terry Regier   ¶ 

The existence of cross-linguistic universals in color naming is
currently contested.  Early empirical studies, based principally on
languages of industrialized societies, suggested that all languages may
draw on a universally shared repertoire of color categories. Recent
work, in contrast, based on languages from nonindustrialized societies,
has suggested that color categories may not be universal. No
comprehensive objective tests have yet been conducted to resolve this
issue. We conduct such tests on color naming data from languages of both
industrialized and nonindustrialized societies and show that strong
universal tendencies in color naming exist across both sorts of
language. 


Another fun paper in same issue, slightly related:

Foreign-language experience in infancy: Effects of short-term exposure 
and social interaction on phonetic learning 

Patricia K. Kuhl *, Feng-Ming Tsao and Huei-Mei Liu  


Infants acquire language with remarkable speed, although little is known 
about the mechanisms that underlie the acquisition process. Studies of 
the phonetic units of language have shown that early in life, infants 
are capable of discerning differences among the phonetic units of all 
languages, including native- and foreign-language sounds. Between 6 and 
12 mo of age, the ability to discriminate foreign-language phonetic 
units sharply declines. In two studies, we investigate the necessary and 
sufficient conditions for reversing this decline in foreign-language 
phonetic perception. In Experiment 1, 9-mo-old American infants were 
exposed to native Mandarin Chinese speakers in 12 laboratory sessions. A 
control group also participated in 12 language sessions but heard only 
English. Subsequent tests of Mandarin speech perception demonstrated 
that exposure to Mandarin reversed the decline seen in the English 
control group. In Experiment 2, infants were exposed to the same 
foreign-language speakers and materials via audiovisual or audio-only 
recordings. The results demonstrated that exposure to recorded Mandarin, 
without interpersonal interaction, had no effect. Between 9 and 10 mo of 
age, infants show phonetic learning from live, but not prerecorded, 
exposure to a foreign language, suggesting a learning process that does 
not require long-term listening and is enhanced by social interaction.

Just a quick note about my recent absence. I spent a lovely week in Novi 
Sad, Serbia at a summer university lecturing in their new technologies 
course about the big picture, radical technologies, scenario planning 
and of course some transhumanism. A very stimulating experience, since 
the students (mainly from the Balkans and Denmark) and I had 
useful and broad discussions about everything from transhumanist welfare 
states to how the image of nature is changed by ubiquitious computing. I 
also learned interesting things about cyborg theory and film 
interpretation from Gert Balling and had a wonderful brainstorm session 
with Milan Cirkovic.

I think the most important experience was seeing the huge potential in
the Balkans. It is a splintered, poor corner of Europe. But cellphones
are widespread, there are intellectuals in the governments and a great 
deal of dynamics in the culture - one should not count out isolationist 
nationalism, but it is not an unopposed force. We often overlook that it 
is places like this truly new projects can be started.

> Now, my proposal was not in any way based on race or culture.

You presented an article on North Korea and concluded on the basis of
apparent cultural differences that it would be best to destroy them.

Your exact question was,

"How do extropians/transhumanists deal with very strong cultures with very
non-western priorities?"

Your solution was *destroying the culture in question*.  That is genocide.

You keep making recourse to triage.  So let's ask the unfortunate question,
"How does genocide differ from triage?"  The argument I put forward in a
previous post, which you may not have seen, is simply that triage is
strongly situated, whereas your proposal (genocide) is not.  For example, on
the battle field a doctor may have to choose who to treat first, this
requires a decision on the basis of the *relative* value of two or more
human lives.  In the example you give of a NEO striking Earth, decisions
have to made based on *relative* valuations of the lives of thousands.  In
your proposal, however, the situation isn't so clear.  What is the situation
(or, more specifically, the threat) and how to do we establish relative
value between one human life and another?  You introduce this rather awkward
idea of "potential life" to establish the threat: the threat is against the
creation of more life.  An immediate problem is how open ended this is:
Isn't it always the case that "potential (more) life" is under threat?
Isn't this situation too vague, too general?  Wouldn't we be doing this
"triage" all the time?  At the very least, the situation is not clearly
delineated.  Secondly, how do we establish relative value between one life
and another?  This is where I think the real problem lies.  You're not
establishing value between one life and another, you're establishing it
between life and *more* life.  To me, this just seems like an awkward way of
asking, "What is the *absolute* value of human life?"  And this is where you
step outside triage, because there is no situation, there is no relative
valuation of human life, there's just this un-situated, absolute value.

So, if we've established that this is *not* triage, there's still the open
question of what, precisely, is wrong with ascribing an absolute value to
life.  I agree with you on two points: (1) the question you're asking *is*
"extropic," inasmuch as extropy seems to embrace an idea of life
(complexity, extropy) as an absolute Good and strives for its increase and
proliferation; and (2) simply invoking a base morality in response to the
question doesn't quite cut it.  My own position on this is simply that the
extropian affirmation of life/complexity/extropy is incoherent.  Complexity,
I would argue, is the very definition of something that is purely relative,
complexity is observed by complexity, observable complexity is probably
directly correlated to the complexity of the observer.  And all this needs
to carry the disclaimer that I don't propose to know precisely what I mean
by "complexity" but have a general idea (I mean, of course,
life/complexity/extropy, that object of our affirmation, rather than, say,
algorithmic complexity, which might have something to do with it but is
clearly not the whole picture).  Your mileage may vary.

No change.

I feel much safer now.  Back then, I was living with the quasi-certainty
that WWIII would eventually happen, and even if it had turned out
to be only a limited nuclear conflict--the USA really wouldn't have
risked their annihilation over a piece of European real estate,
would they?--I would have lived right on the primary battlefield.

Currently, traffic accidents.  Twenty years down the road cardiovascular
disease and cancer will start catching up fast, unless we see some
major medical advances in the meantime.  In the long term, the
statist and anti-technology forces in the western world are a direct
threat to my personal survival.

On a very personal, identity-threatening level, I'm also increasingly
worried about mental hardening and mental faculties rapidly diminishing
with age.  Relatedly, I'm increasingly suffering the impression
that social progress is directly related to the old dying away.

Terrorism is a very distant background threat, in line with rare
kinds of accidents and diseases.  If you want something to worry
about, go and read medical journals.  This will awaken the latent
hypochondriac in most people.

And a good many people have no qualms openly stating that this is
a good thing and that you should die.  And this is unlikely to
change until they are dead.

Well, (and I do not think my question contained any 
discourtesy), there is a danger in adhering to highly
ambitious schemes having to do with highly complex
systems.

Imagine St. Petersburg in 1917, put yourself back there.
Given all the evil and corruption in the Czar's
regime, it would have seemed to many that a worker's
paradise could be established if only the idealists
could seize power.  The remarkable thing was that 
some people were living at the time who knew better,
or at least sensed it.

The problem *was* Lenin and his complete revolution.
(That he himself developed in the early 20's into a
Stalin and was succeeded by a Stalin is easily
predictable (just study the course of the French
revolution).

One hell of a lot more without those revolutionary wreckers!
In 1914, Russia had the most advanced steel mills in all
Europe, capitalism was firmly rooted, and its science and
engineering were absolutely first rate.

Japan did it in even less time.

In the seven years between 1921 and 1928, the U.S. economy
grew by forty-nine percent.  And it was solid growth, based
on trade and massively greater productivity.  The Russian
economy during the same period fell further and further
behind their 1914 levels.

The book "Power and Prosperity" by Mancur Olsen is absolutely
necessary reading if you want to understand the economic
successes of Stalin compared to his subsequent replacements
as heads of the Soviet Union.  He extracted the maximum amount
of work out of the people by making sure that they didn't 
"collude" in any way to improve their lives.  This was accomplished
by incessant purges, which his replacements perhaps just didn't
have the stomach for.

Rafal asks

By no means.  Here in America, I find them to be in error in
just about every other election year!  ;-)

Joking aside, and trying to look at it from an objective historical
perspective, we find that although indeed they err, the representatives
elected by the majority err less over the long run than do the those
exercising power in other forms of government.  At least some *class*
of citizens should elect officials, that much seems to be clear.

But more germane is, where do we go from here?  Back tracking to
despotic forms of government, or various kinds of oligarchy,
seems sure to retard progress.  (Recall Winston Churchill's
famous dictum about all this.)

I am arguing nothing.  I am painting a picture that either
will appeal to you more than does a volume containing dead
and inert matter, or it will not.  Apparently it does not.

One can only hope that you are indeed joking, because if the solar
system is indeed better off without a Jupiter sized mass of cussedness,
then it might well be better off more locally without an Earth sized
mass similarly distasteful.

I highly recommend reading Roman history.  Consider the finest century
of the Republic that you can find, and if that doesn't make you proud of
what humanity has accomplished since, nothing will.

Now how likely is that?  We haven't met any other thinking
entities in the universe, and it would come across as pretty
suspicious as an excuse for waging war.  ("Oh, sorry---I didn't
know you were alive.")

I know that this was not Card's intent, but in retrospect it was
a coolly told story to at least get Ender to save the Queen.
(I remember that much, though maybe Card only added that in
the insipid sequel to this great book.)  It worked, and she
was not killed.

So frustrated at the syrupy story "Speaker for the Dead" did
I become, that I began fervently hoping as I read it that the
Queen would roar back at first chance, and exterminate the
whole stupid human race. It would serve Ender and the rest
of the idiots right.

Emlyn writes about his very logical attack on genocide:

It was not.  I myself wrote an email to this list last
year explaining why racism is harmful and actually
unrealistic.  It's important to elucidate the reasons
that go along with our feelings, and form themselves
into an integral whole.

> Genocide sucks.

This is the sort of dumb phrase that does *not* advance
understanding.  Worse, had you not just written a clear
and eloquent (even if overstated in a couple of places)
rational analysis, then one would conclude from the
sound bite that perhaps such rational analysis was not
ready to hand, or perhaps not even possible.

As for me, everything you said denouncing genocide
denounces murder just as well.  Genocide is a species
of mass murder, and that's all.  I very much deny that
it is somehow worse than other forms of mass murder,
because that is in effect suggesting that properties
of mass murder exist that aren't so bad after all.

What I simply do not understand is how threatened you
sound and feel.  We *do* have convincing and thoughtful
arguments rejecting a great many bad things, and we should
not feel put upon to demonstrate from time to time.  
Some doubter may ask over and over why evolution works,
and it would be a big mistake to say that enunciating
the reasons was a waste of time.

(Well, about the third time I would feel bored, I admit,
but I would never feel threatened.)

I would have to say that I feel "more safe".
For a couple of years prior to 911 I had been concerned that something of
this magnitude would occur soon. I would say we were due for it, but that is
only from the viewpoint of an outsider looking in. Now that it has happened,
it has created an awareness on the part of the Stupids which reduces the
likelhood of similar events occurring.

Granted, I can't come up with with a statistical model to show the reduced
likelyhood, but maybe some kind of fuzzy math occurs in my subconscious
allowing me to feel a certain "intuition". Either way, I "feel" safer now
than before.

I do not believe Bryan that I made that assertion.  And if I implied
it I would retract it.  If I were arguing on a "cultural" basis
then it might make sense to eliminate North Korea, South Korea,
Japan, China, perhaps Russia, the Middle East... (I would not know
where to stop).

The specific and precise problem with North Korea is that they
are not a member of the international community and do not appear
to want to be other than with respect to how they can black-mail
the members for their direct benefit.

They *also* appear to have a political community (a significant
fraction of 22 million people) who have been brainwashed into
thinking that their system works.  [Doesn't matter that their people
are starving to death -- they are a potential nuclear power and
one with the ability to hurl nuclear weapons at "western" nations
(e.g. South Korea or Japan) the impact of which could have serious
economic consequences for the U.S. (even ignoring the impact on
nearby Asian countries).  The trickle down effects are more unemployment
in the U.S., less money to combat AIDS in Africa or India, etc.

Please do the comparison -- 22 million lives at risk in North Korea
or hundreds of millions of lives at risk in Africa and other parts
of Asia.  Real lives -- people living *now* [so significantly less
present value analysis required].

What I was trying to get at was that (a) these people have *very*
different belief systems (I think Anders saw that).  He also pointed
out how there may be deficits in the Extropian Principles that do
not make it clear *how* to deal with such problems (you are talking
about fundamental programming that may be either wrong or highly
biased); and (b) the fact that the costs may be high if we don't
deal with it (whether it be hundreds of millions of lives now or
or 100 trillion lives per second later).

Yes, this I believe is an accurate statement.

Granted -- given some discussion as to whether a large number
of brain-washed individuals can be legitimately called a "culture".
"Cultures" can evolve -- that does not appear to be the current
situation in North Korea.

> "How does genocide differ from triage?"

Ok, good -- someone engages in the question.

Reasonable.  So the question becomes one of "immediacy" (and/or the
question reverts to the value of various current or future human
lives).

I believe there is probably a complete set of military "action points"
with regard to North Korea.  The U.S. is currently inactive in
this area because most if not all of them would probably not
yield pretty results.  That has been the case for between one and
four decades.

So the question I propose is "*HOW* much have the U.S. and South
Korea spent over the last 10-40 years "containing" the problem
of North Korea?"  And the followup question is "*What* is the
quantity of lives that could have been saved by investing those
resources elsewhere?".

Re: "potential life", "future life" valuations.

Yep, and I was in part posing the problem to see where we could
get with it.  Please note that I'm dealing with a complex perspective
which on one side has real down-to-earth impacts on the other side
is a theoretical debate.

> Isn't it always the case that "potential (more) life" is under threat?

Yep, and a recent paper by Steven Dick [USNO] deals with this as
have some posted papers to the list and it is I believe a topic that
Nick Bostrom and Milan Circovic are working on.

> Isn't this situation too vague, too general?  Wouldn't we be doing this
> "triage" all the time?

Perhaps.  But I suspect with regard to doing "triage" all the time the
answer is "we are".  The problem is to acknowledge it and detail what
the best parameters might be.

Agreed.

Yes, it was an abstract proposal.

Yes, as I proposed the problem it could be viewed this way.
The question becomes *how* to turn it into something other than that.
That becomes a question that I do not believe that bioethicists have
dealt with but one that raises many issues.  The questions one could
offer to the list involve how do standard bioethical evaluation
considerations compare with "standard" extropic evaluation
considerations.

> So, if we've established that this is *not* triage,

Granted -- but really only because we have some incomplete definitions
with regard to what requires "immediate" attention, what a "culture"
may be, the difficulty with assigning "values" to human lives (both
present and future), etc.

That is in part how I view it -- I'm willing to look at interesting
arguments that such a position may be incorrect.  Leon Kass presents
some such counterpoints but in my opinion they do not win the debate.

[snip]

Re. complexity

I would be inclined to agree.  Though complexity has reasonably good
definitions from a computer science standpoint.  Where it may lack
is in subjective areas with respect to (a) complexity that will
generate further complexity; (b) complexity that may generate more
or less complexity per unit time; (c) complexity that is "good"
(i.e. will not destroy humanity, the universe, etc.);

So I acknowledge your comments for presenting some thought
provoking areas even if you may not have liked my initiating
thoughts.

Just for the record, according to the CIA world fact book,
the North Korean "Military expenditures percent of GDP"
  were 31%
Contrast this with the U.S. (3.2%), the U.K. (2.3%) or
AU (2%).

So I would like to ask people on the list -- "Just what part
of the North Korean perspective isn't clear to you?"

You can argue that the NK GDP (Gross Domestinc Product) is so
low that the military expenditures are "inflated".  But can
you argue an order of magnitude of difference?

This gets back to the discussion of *when* you see a "Hitler"
arising and what one does about that.

So what I would ask is "how many sacrificed lives does one
allow before one says that is "too much" from an extropic
perspective?"

Or in other terms -- "How far does one let North Korea
(with a large population of "programmed" drones) go?"

And this is not too different from related questions
I might pose about other countries.

Robert

Depends on the forum.  I like this list being transparent, and I'm more 
inclined to promote a transparent culture.  Conversely, I am a very private 
person and don't like people knowing my personal business unless I share it.

The problem is the gossip and assumption factors.  If we don't tell 
everything, people make assumptions.  If I lived in a society that was more 
compassionate and reasonable, I wouldn't mind it being much more 
transparent - and that goes for my personal life.  Because of this, on a 
scale of 1 - 10, my personal privacy is at 10.

Popular diets: The good, the fad and the iffy

A calorie is a calorie, no matter where it comes from. Most weight-loss diets
help you to restrict calories in one way or another. Ideally the new routine
gets you to eat less, eat healthier and exercise more. Seems simple, right?
It is, in theory. 

Your weight remains stable when you eat the same number of calories you use
up. So, in theory, if you eat well and exercise  and in the process burn more
calories than you consume  you lose weight. 

But in practice it's easy to run into roadblocks. Adopting healthy eating and
exercise habits can be difficult. It takes time and effort to work physical
activity into your daily routine. A good diet can be your road map to safe and
effective weight management. Conversely, a poor diet can leave you spinning your
wheels  or, even worse, pose serious health problems.

Components of an effective weight-loss program must include:

A healthy diet that helps you select, prepare and eat healthy foods. 
An exercise plan that helps you increase your activity throughout the day as
well as incorporate a more rigorous exercise period several times every week. 

Weight-loss programs come in many forms today. Some prey on the desire for a
quick fix, and some of these diets do help you lose weight quickly  at least
for a while. But maintaining a healthy weight isn't something that most people
can manage quickly and maintain over the long haul. It's a process, and it can
be tough, but it's not impossible. If you're ready to commit to lifestyle
changes  eating healthier and being more physically active  then you're well
on your way to achieving a healthier weight. 

Weigh the facts  avoid the fads

Problem: the market attracts intel from people who
would not normally otherwise give intel.  "Hmm.  Big
brother Mufasa said he's gonna blow up that 'Merican
base tomorrow.  I don't care for 'em either, but I
can get fifty bucks by betting that base will be
attacked within a week.  That's a lot (to the
extremely poor masses that happen to exist - and
produce a lot of the terrorist front line - in
countries that produce terrorists, whether or not
there is any actual causality)!  Hmm...yeah, sure I'll
place a bet.  Go get 'em, big bro, so I can eat for a
month!"

Yes, the smart ones would know there's a connection.
Even assuming they'd care enough to forego their own
monetary gain, "smart" implies "smarter than average
for the given populace", and we's only need a few of
the remainder to get greedy.

That sounds like progress, although an amendment should be
passed saying that it is okay to hate *certain* groups.

For example, is the prime minister of Canada an "identifiable
group"?  Here in the U.S., many people hate George Bush, and
while this is lamentable, I would be opposed to hate legislation
so sweeping that this emotion would be forbidden.

It's probably also wise to have a hate list, that is, a list
of groups (perhaps mostly non-existent) that it's okay to
hate.  I'm thinking of Nazis, eugenicists, or the KKK or 
something; parliament there (and Congress here) should decide
on which groups make the list.

Also as per the hating of individuals---I hope that this does
not become a crime.  Because in some cases of personal injury
(for example, someone commits murder against a close family
member), not only do I think that the relative of the victim
should be allowed to hate the perpetrator, the relative should
not even be required to undergo therapy.

What about other emotions?  Perhaps in future years the idea
should be considered about regulating other negative emotions.

And here's another view, from physicist/gadfly Robert Park; the interesting

WHAT'S NEW   Robert L. Park   Friday, 1 Aug 03   Washington, DC


1. THE POINDEXTER FILE: WOULD ANYONE CARE TO BET ON HIS FUTURE? 
An $8M Pentagon plan to set up a futures market in Middle Eastern
developments was hastily scrapped when it was met with derision
and revulsion.  Called the Policy Analysis Market, the plan was
to base intelligence judgements on betting patterns.  Uh fellas,
the alleged predictive value of futures activity is merely a sign
of illegal insider trading.  Anyway, the person in charge of this
fiasco, Adm. John Poindexter, has already been banished.  That's
good, but here's an insider trading tip: John Poindexter has been
banished before.  National Security Advisor to President Reagan
(WN 6 Dec 85), Poindexter devised a "disinformation" plan to
mislead Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi (WN 3 Oct 86).  There's no
indication that Gadhafi was misled, but American newspapers were. 
Then, the infamous "Poindexter Memorandum" sought to extend
government control over unclassified private databases (WN 14 Nov
86).  A central figure in the Iran-contra scandal, his conviction
for lying to Congress was later set aside on the grounds that
immunized testimony had been used against him.  He disappeared
from public view for several years, only to reappear with Bush II
as head of the DARPA office responsible for Total Information
Awareness (WN 20 Dec 02).  Yesterday it was announced that
Poindexter is leaving the Pentagon   we hope for good.

30% of what is the critical question being glossed over.  The US 3.2% amounts

If the fired one nuke at some other country I would have no great problem with 
a very strong response, possibly in kind.   But I won't for a second consider

In one of Martin Gardner's books, he talks about multilingual authors
who have written multilingual books.  The authors must find something
confining in the normal restriction of a book to one language.

I used the word "extropians" in a serious discussion recently and once again
was reminded that extropians sound like goofy cultists.
Not being able to find out why they were thinking that, or have them forward
me a link where one serious extropian sound like they say, I had to imagine
the problem they might have that makes their opinion. So here it is,
formulated as a question accordingly to the 7th extropian principle wich
invites constructive criticism :

What would be the best answer to someone who would say that the primo body
and mind uploading  are allegoric figures that transhumanists and extropians
are offering that permits to fantasm a body removed from it's attaches with
the present, the here and now, impossible bodies, wich makes them promoter
of an ascetic ideal, who hates the body and the flesh (and are possibly even
worse than christians at it,  with their angels without  nose or phallus)
and consequently alienation (alienation is to be understood here as "being
estranged to oneself").

I have a working answer but I would like to hear what others think about
this.

Thank you in advance

An interesting looking pop sci book I've just started reading is EMOTIONS
REVEALED: Understanding Faces and Feelings, by Professor Paul Ekman, who
has researched an adjacent field for some 40 years. He started with a
routine belief in social construction of emotions, and was shocked by his
cross-cultural studies into accepting that emotions are human
universals--although, a key point, their *public expression* often varies
strikingly due to culturally contingent `display rules'.

Yes, it wasn't in the short story. However...

Interestingly (as an afterword to the short story version in his collection
MAPS IN A MIRROR reveals), writing that novel (not story) *preceded* the
novel ENDER'S GAME. In its development, he came to understand that he
needed to extend the original tale into a novel that would provide an
appropriate backstory to SPEAKER. However, he does come close to admitting
that his moves at the end of the revision/extension were a storytelling
mistake (because for Card, as a Mormon propagandist writer, the reader is
always right):

`..few readers could understand why there were still so many pages left
when the story was clearly over. Even this flaw didn't bother me. I had a
Master's degree in English by now, so I knew how to excuse it in literary
terms. I was making the reader go through the same kind of revision of the
meaning of the story's past that Ender went through. Ah, how the tools of
criticism allow us to justify the lapses of our art!' (668).

I believe that it was *not* a lapse, but an instance of the form of sf
storytelling known as `cognitive breakthrough' (which encyclopeadist Peter
Nicholls places near the core of the mode), and I believe that Card himself
must secretly agree since his current revisionist extension of the Ender
sequence--which follows Bean and other uber-children--does just this,
repeatedly (and, alas, rather mechanically if virtuosically by now).

This is a good question and one often raised by intelligent opponents of
the transhumanist project. Good responses are required.

A glib answer might be to ask why it does not apply with equal force to
anyone who has work done on their decayed teeth, takes vitamin and other
nutritional supplements, antibiotics and perhaps mood-altering prescription
pharmaceutics, or (if old and ill) is fitted with an artificial hip or
heart pace maker? 

All these modifications of the natural body are endured or embraced for the
*life-enhancing benefits* they provide us as human beings (evolved
conscious animals) in a world where the ordinary experiences of life tend
over time to wear down and diminish our physical and mental health.

It is especially ironic that transhumanists are often accused of being
`flesh-hating' body deniers on the one hand, and attacked as narcissistic
and self-obsessed with fitness and healthy longevity on the other. (True,
some extropians fit more readily into one category or the other.)

I would happily, *happily* do so if everyone else would,
or, in other words, I would contribute towards the development
of technology that would enable any of us to spy all the time
on any of us.

I have overcome, at great cost and difficulty, the
notion that I am or would be especially interesting
for people to observe.

I even go so far as to imagine that neither my mother
nor my boss would lack for better things to do than
monitor or spy on me.  I have already reached the
point that all I would feel is pity for those who
would waste their time penetrating my paltry secrets
and following the boring details of my life.  ;-)

Alex, let's just let it all hang out.  (Or do I give
my generational allegiance away?)

But perhaps if there were 6x10^9 other people you would have
to compete with for attention, then you'd feel (properly)
neglected.

This touches on the key point to me.  It's never the *knowledge*
of what I or anyone else is up to that is crucial, it's the
*power* to do something about it.  I think that if we survey
the literature that addresses totalitarian oppression, from
the Spanish Inquisition to Nineteen-Eighty-Four, then we find
that it's not at all the surveillance that is the problem, but
rather the ability of the authorities to *do* something about
it.  Solzhenitsyn uses an entire chapter to describe "The Arrest".

If we are safe in our persons and property, then let's not
care what is known about us.

There are certainly transhumanists who partially share these beliefs (I 
would call them cybergnostics); like any good criticism it has some 
truth.

But I think the key mistake made in the criticism is that it cannot
imagine the other side: that we want better bodies to more fully enjoy
life. The ascetic ideal is well represented in our culture, but the idea
of hedonic engineering or sensual technology is not.  With T1000-style
liquid bodies we could make Freud blush about "polymorphous perversity", 
and the descriptions of limited omniscience from a few threads back 
really have a deep sensual in-the-world quality. But relatively few 
authors describe this, and of course most of us transhumanists do not 
really start out our spiels by pointing it out (we usually start by 
complaining about death and taxes, and showing how they will be swept 
away). Maybe the best start of any transhumanist presentation is "Life 
is wonderful! I want more of it for everyone!"

My point was that the idea is so useless that we really need not consider
it, or at least can put it right down near the bottom of a prioritised list
of things to ponder. I also think that football sucks and is useless, and
relegate it to the same scrap heap of dumb ideas that I don't need.

Sometimes it takes a bit of heat under the collar to motivate writing a post
like that one. Maybe I'm just human after all. Emotions will creep in at all
kinds of inconvenient times, the pesky things.

I was pretty angry at the time. I have this hazy idea that genocide is at
the extreme edge of a package of very nasty memes that are gaining currency
nowadays in western geopolitics, a package that includes xenophobia,
intolerance and self righteousness. Fear of the unknown, and ignorant petty
selfishness, qualities which seem to be encouraged more strongly as time
wears on, really will bring down the dreams of all transhumanists.

That's because extropians do sound like goofy cultists. That doesn't
mean extropians *are* goofy cultists. Most vaguely extropian discussion
will operate several future shock levels above what 'normal' 'outsiders'
are used to.

Every human pursuit has a scale of shock levels, jargon from some level
of which will invoke responses from the general public such as "Yeah,
whatever...", "Uh, right... <backs away slowly>", "You're crazy", "What
the hell are you talking about?", and so on. A discussion between
experts in any field has the potential to look like ridiculous word soup
to laymen, but unfortunately it's hard to tell the difference between
complex discourse and genuine cultist insanity.

By James M. Pethokoukis 

Posted: July 30, 2003


The Big Ideas of Robin Hanson

In the background of the Pentagon's controversial-and now defunct-plan
to create a futures market to predict terrorist strikes is a
little-known George Mason University economist named Robin Hanson.
Little known, that is, among those who view economists as little more
than number crunchers whose main job it is to provide those usually
dodgy estimates of what the economy's growth or unemployment rate is
likely to be in some future quarter. 

But for those who have an interest in what life might be like if we
lived in a Matrix-like computer simulation or how superintelligent
computers could someday affect economic growth, Hanson is as hot as they
come. His work on information markets-markets where "investors" make
bets on the likelihood of certain future events-was critical to the
development of the terrorism futures market, formally called the Policy
Analysis Market, which was funded by the Pentagon's Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency. 

Although Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz described the effort as
"too imaginative," it really pales by comparison to some of the other
creative thoughts bouncing around Hanson's noggin-which shouldn't be
surprising for a guy who says he'd "love to specialize in the economics
of science fiction." Among the treats on his home page are his "14 Wild
Ideas." Hanson says up to a third of them may actually be true-though,
maddeningly, he doesn't specify which ones. Here are a few:

By 2100, the vast majority of "people" will be immortal computers
running brain simulations. "Simulated brains are potentially immortal,
just as all computer data is. And the ability to cheaply simulate brains
will revolutionize labor economics; wages should fall to near the cost
of making brain simulators. The population of such 'uploads' should
expand very rapidly, allowing huge increases in both economic growth
rates and inequality."

If medicine were taxed so much that people only bought half as much,
they would be just as healthy. "In the 1970s, the Rand Health Insurance
Experiment randomly assigned 5,000 adults to free or full-price
healthcare over 3-5 years. Free-care folks got more eyeglasses and teeth
filled, and spent about 30 percent more, but were otherwise no
healthier. . . . I'm willing to extrapolate from this 30 percent change
to a 50 percent cut."

There's a chance that Hanson himself lives in a "future" computer
simulation. "Some uploads [people who have uploaded their brains into
computers] could have robot bodies, while others could live in simulated
computer worlds. Our descendants may place some of them in historical
simulations, with simulated people who do not realize that they are
simulated. How sure can I be now that I do not live in a future
historical simulation?"

Visitors to Hanson's Web site will find plenty of academic papers
supporting these and other notions, including his belief that all major
government policies should be determined by betting markets such as the
Policy Analysis Market.

Now given Hanson's areas of interest, I thought he would be the perfect
guy to comment on a prediction that's been crawling around the Web in
recent days. Marshall Brain, the founder of HowStuffWorks, recently
published an essay in which he predicts that advances in artificial
intelligence and robotics will result in smart machines taking half the
jobs in the United States by 2050. Hanson's take on the forecast?

"His predictions about future progress in robotic technology are not
crazy, even if they are not assured. He ignores the software
problem-even if robots have more computing power than the brain, it may
take a while for software to be good enough. But it is not crazy to
think the software problem might be solved within a decade or two of
when we have enough hardware. His social predictions are more of a mixed
bag. . . . For example, he doesn't consider that people who leave some
jobs might find others. Automation has taken away most farming jobs, but
that hasn't made most people unemployed; people now do other things that
they do better than machines. . . . However, a closer examination does,
I think, suggest that eventually machines will become mostly substitutes
for, rather than complements of, human labor."

As Hanson continues to creatively cogitate, I'll let you know what he
comes up with.

Dave Eggers offers up an interesting point with respect
to the need to support "service" within our communities.
(Sounds extropic to me.)

"Muting the Call to Service" (2 Aug 2003)

Interesting how it seems to get so little attention from
the politicians (e.g. writing to them might make a difference).

You have to like math a lot (and I do) and also have 
some other characteristic (which I do not) to appreciate
Anders' analysis involving ratios of volumes of spheres.

But I greatly enjoy:

It would only be "stupid" in the sense of calling down
upon oneself severe punishment.  Cattle are so dumb that
they cannot read the signs "please remain in the enclosure"
and so barbed-wire needed to be invented.

But for some reason that eludes me, we always assume that
the members of the galactic club are really mean and
ferocious (like in "The Day the Earth Stood Still") and
have no compunctions at all about destroying the Earth
and it's six billion inhabitants.

Animal rights activist would be rightly upset if no effort
whatsoever were made to keep squirrels or raccoons off one's
premises by fences or other expedients, and instead all 
animals wandering in to a certain area were just immediately
shot by radar-controlled automatic systems.

So the big mystery to me is, why do we always assume the
aliens to be such mean dudes?

YES!  For sure there would be WARNING SIGNS in huge capital
letters from the galactic club saying "STAY HOME".  But all
we hear is total silence.

Well, consider me a potential convert!

http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demarchy

I would always wish to go about things gingerly and slowly,
and with the utmost reflection and care.

(That includes radical plans to save lives by initiating
atomic attacks on worrisome nations.)  I think that demarchy
needs to be looked at by an open mind by the various free
people's of the world, and probably tried out here and there.

Your right we don't have to assume they are mean, and some versions in the
literature don't. I suggested a while back a possible mechanism for this
under the subject heading "Invasion of the meme snatchers". The idea is that
advanced aliens could have nanobots running around on earth whose sole
mission is to destroy any evidence of the galactic civilization. For
example, if SETI researchers were to pick up a signal from some distant
planet it would be the mission of the meme snatching nanobots to destroy the
information. They would wipe the computer memories and get inside of the
researcher's heads and destroy the appropriate engrams. We can even imagine
junkets of space travelers visiting earth all the time. Perhaps we have all
met aliens at one time or another as they walk down our streets led by some
alien tour guide, but then--of course--the nanobots keep wiping out our
memories. Perhaps even some human scientists have discovered evidence of
these nanobots at work but then--of course--have had their memories
completely erased. Everything we know is consistent with this possibility,
surely the nanobots assigned to this task would think they had a relatively
cushy assignment. Possible? Yes. Probable? No. Or at least that is what the
aliens would like you to believe. ; )

The meme snatchers would also be subjected to the same problem as the
interstellar antibodies: they would have to be placed so that they could
fix things before the information got out of hand. 

A guess is that the limit is around an hour; after an hour the
researcher might have told his fellow researchers at the observatory and
called the media (OK, that is not the proper IAU protocol, but you don't
design systems like this based on the assumption that the humans are
always following rules) and the information leak would require too much
work to fix easily (here I assume roughly nanotech capabilities - no
instant matter editing by remote or anything). So we need devices that 
can keep track of every human and some relevant hardware too. Just like 
the interstellar scenario it might make sense to just put a device on or 
in each human being, monitoring what is happening. 

However, the problem here is that an invisible microbot also has
somewhat limited sensory abilities. If we assume the need for
human-level sight and hearing, it likely has to be reasonably large (to
catch vibrations and avoid diffraction). A likelier approach would be to
connect it to the brain directly - that way it could fix bad engrams
too. So what we are looking for is something spread across the brain,
with links to the sensory systems and memory systems, that actually is
our guardians. Hmm, the noradrenergic nucleus locus ceruleus starts to
look suspicious.  But then again, it is found in all mammals. But what
about the thalamic interstitial nuclei? Broad projections, hard to
distinguish, nobody really understands them. Hidden within what looks 
like such a nucleus a little nanodevice sits, listening to things. 

Hmm, what was I thinking about? I just forgot it. Ah, better get back to 
my work.

Well, ironically enough, I had just decided to post a demur
to one of my own points!  Then I log on and see that you
are agreeing with all my points :-(  Maybe I'm just not
comfortable ever agreeing with you, only in this case, it
was achieved by telepathy.

At

http://www.corante.com/brainwaves/20030701.shtml#46081

it says

    Cognitive liberty: the right of a person to liberty, autonomy and
    privacy over his or her own intellect is situated at the core of
    what it means to be a free person.  This principle is what gives
    life to some of our most well-established and cherished human and
    constitutional rights. Today, as new drugs, technologies and
    techniques are being developed for augmenting, enhancing, or
    conversely, surveilling and controlling human thought, the CCLE
    produces original research and analysis, and engages in legal
    advocacy aimed at protecting cognitive liberty and the full
    potential of the human intellect.

It was especially remiss of us as Extropians not to think of this
angle!

I will have to give it some thought as to whether the "complete
openness" principle that I was speaking in favor of should be
this inclusive.  What do you think, (perhaps in a few years I
need not ask!)

The legislation refers to "identifiable groups" in those words and it
lists groups identified by ethnicity, race, religion and colour as
examples. But it does not say this is an exhaustive list of protected
groups. Nor does it say that there are identifiable groups which cannot be
targeted with hate messages. For example, it does not say we cannot by law
hate serial murderers. The Acts also protect free speech by saying that
fair comment in the context of political-religious discussion is allowed.

Overall, it seems the PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE prevail in these Acts. For
example, even though garden gnomes and other vertically challenged people
are not given explicit protection by the Acts, a campaign of hate and
targeting for destruction against the vertically challenged in Canada
could be prosecuted under this legislation; or the current campaign of
hate which the present BC Government has targeted on poor people. This
list does not want to hear our local political-judicial issues but we may
have proof by Olympics 2010 that the Campbell Government has killed more
innocent citizens than any serial killer in North American history. It
will then receive the attention of the world.

Just follow the links from Campbell's Olympic Gold for Serial Murder on
POC's home page. The proof will be in the facts which we have by 2010.

I think that the emotions should be there *all* the time, 
and that your essay was a wonderful example of how to 
integrate them into one's rational exposition.  As I said
before, one should only be semi-confident of one's conjectures
when both one's thought and feelings are in alignment.

> I was pretty angry at the time.

Yes, but no one could tell, which is the *important* part.
And again, I commend you for it.

So what else is new?

Not at all!  What decade do you suggest exhibited fewer such
qualities or in which they were less pronounced?  (I actually
entertain almost exactly the opposite dread: xenophobia and
intolerance evolved for a reason, and a hand-over-fist abandonment
of those impulses will simply result in the abandoners to be
replaced over time by those less high-minded.)

Things have been getting better for so long that *complacency*
is also something I worry about.

Lee

P.S.  As for your question about how safe one feels, I was
thinking that I felt safer than ever---until someone pointed
out that the West really is indeed more vulnerable to terrorist
attacks than we thought before.  I think that my own sense of
increased safety simply comes from my repeated acquaintance
with the fact that I am just one person (in the U.S.) out of
2.8x10^8 targets, and that despite the way the newspapers
always dwell on the negative, people who are aware should
be more and more comfortable with the fact that the negative
incidents are truly the exception.

Mm-hmm.  I was trying to show why limiting it to said
group would limit or negate the practical value of the
market, by showing where the real value (or, at least,
a good part of it) would in fact come from if open.

### But he is actually talking about *tax-paid* services (improperly
referred to as "volunteering" - which should be reserved to rendering unpaid
services). Since such programs divert resources from true volunteer tasks by
depriving the would-be volunteers of their income through taxation, they are
destructive to the community spirit and charity.

http://www.cnn.com/2003/HEALTH/08/01/nutrients.reut/index.html

In a study that shows more than ever you are what you eat, scientists 
said on Friday they had changed the coat colors of baby mice simply by 
altering their mothers' diets. 

Basically what they show is that by giving vitamins the expression of 
the agouit gene is turned down. Maternal diet also affects other gene 
expression, which is interesting. I may have mentioned earlier that 
maternal choline appears to improve spatial memory in mice.

This opens up an interesting issue (and a rhetorical "trick"): is it
acceptable for mothers to tailor their diets to help or affect their
child? Many of the standard anti-genetic arguments seem to say no, which
would imply that mothers should not be allowed to deliberately eat food
rich in (say) choline, which makes for a good rhetorical reductio ad
absurdum. But if we accept that mothers may eat chocolate (rich in 
lecithine, which turns into choline) to improve their children but not 
any genetic interventions, what is the fundamental difference? Is it 
just gene expression changes that are OK? Again, it seems nature is not 
obliging us with any other answer than that a lot of effects during 
early development can affect the child profoundly; what we do with them 
and how we handle them ethically is up to us. There are no ready-made 
boundaries.

Mark's post about our being under constant surveillance from THEM
so that we don't find out about the galactic civilization has the
obvious qualities of paranoia, though, in his last words, he makes
it abundantly clear that he was joking:

> Possible? Yes. Probable? No. Or at least that is what the
> aliens would like you to believe. ; )

Listen, probably no one here enjoys---for the sheer fun of it---
conjectures like "Is Senator Simpson really a space alien?" more
than I do.  There is *no* doubt about it, if he gave a press
conference, the one question I definitely would ask first is,
"Is it true Senator Simpson, that you are a space alien?"   :-)

And here is more of the same great fun I was giggling at last night:

http://www.dailywonklists.com/CongressmanSenatorAlien.htm

and even better

http://textfiles.fisher.hu/conspiracy/senators.txt

wherein it is revealed that no fewer than twelve members
of the U.S. Senate have admitted that they are from outer
space.  One is actually from Remulak itself!  No kidding,
see

http://www.skepticfiles.org/misctext/aliensgo.htm

But, ahem....

I still cannot account for why on the otherwise quite *serious*
extropians list, so many are eager to begin fantasizing along
such puerile lines.  Evidently, there must be a strong "urge to
believe" out there!

So Anders writes a somewhat equivalent, equally imaginative, post,
and after several serious sounding paragraphs ends with the words

> ...hidden within what looks like such a nucleus a
> little nanodevice sits, listening to things. 

> Hmm, what was I thinking about? I just forgot it. Ah, better get
> back to my work. 

Okay, so it is just the *allure* of playing with the ideas of some
kind of Galactic Club Prime Directive, or what, that accounts for
otherwise sensible people on this list not accepting the obvious
"Because We Are Alone, duh!"?

### Oh. Well, as I said before, this covert PAM would be possibly somewhat
less sensitive, by being denied direct access to enemy information sources,
but at least it would aggregate data already available to government agents.
As we know, various members of the FBI did have enough data to raise a lot
of red flags and possibly prevent 9/11, but they literally didn't get their
(separate) acts together. With PAM they would stand a better chance (and
personally make a buck or two, which is a good thing). The loss of
sensitivity would be rather small, I think, since terrorists would be wary
of playing the game anyway, with their justifiably high level of
suspiciousness and separation from the society.

There are at least two stages under which prosecution could proceed under
Sections 318 and 319 against Premier Gordon Campbell and his accomplices
in government. The first stage is the "anti-hate stage". Chief
Ahenakew of Saskatchewan has been charged according to this provision. He
certainly did not have the means to carry out an action which would have
annihilated the entire identifiable group (Jews) but his words are
arguably those which would incite hate and destructive action toward that
identifiable group and on a probability basis, that could cost lives.

Thus the first part of the argument against Campbell et al before the
Citizens' Court of Justice would be that they are inciting hatred toward
an identifiable group, ie poor people. After all, what could be more
hateful than saying the lives of these people are not worth so much as a
crumb from the table at government expense, after April 1/04? What if
Ahenakew from any social position had said that about Jews or any other
identifiable group? That would certainly be added to his list of hate
comments. And remember that Campbell is saying this from a position of
power. Moreover, HE IS ACTING ON THIS POLICY with programs which will take
effect soon. So he is far more advanced in his hate campaign than
Ahenakew.

On BC Rants we could ask Fred if his calling a member of the targeted
group, Marcus MacGregor an "arsehole" and otherwise saying the life of a
Marcus is not worth spit, is fostered in part by Campbell's genocidal
policies and programs. BTW, Marcus is at a dangerous point in his hunger
strike, past the 20 day mark when some organs like kidneys can start to
fail. Is Marcus an early victim of Campbell's genocide? Certainly his life
is at risk as Bobby Sands died after 40 days of a hunger strike.

> So if anybody has details of such deaths, would they kindly give them

The second stage of the argument before the Citizens' Court of Justice is
that Campbell et al are acting in such a way which could reasonably be
expected to cost lives on a probability basis. You have heard the argument
that Campbell et al are inflicting a MEDICALLY DIAGNOSABLE ILLNESS in the
identifiable group, ie Adjustment Disorder (DSM). If you doubt that, ask
for other expert opinions. Ask Mayor Dr. Larry "I will do anything to save
a life" Campbell. Ask the BC Medical Association.

Like other serious illnesses, if you have a large enough identifiable
group and enough time, you will get fatalities: for AD as well as Hep C or
SARS or what have you. Have there been such fatalites? Maybe. But who is
making an effort to find out? MHR is doing its Exit Surveys for the
opposite purpose, ie to COVER UP the crime. They locate 1/3 of the
"exiters" (from welfare) and crow about how well they are doing. But
"high end" exiters have always done well. MHR is making no concerted
effort to find the 2/3 who are "missing persons" in their books. If MHR
were concerned, they would give police a random sample from the 2/3 and
say, We are concerned that these might be missing persons like the dozens
of women still missing who are thought to have been additional victims of
the the accused serial murderer, Pickton.

Do we know if some of the 2/3 are on police missing persons records? No
...and so far nobody has tried to find out how successful Campbell has
been at targeting an identifiable group which just by coincidence voted
"the wrong way" in 2001. How many has this serial murderer premier
successfully murdered so far? If none, then just give him and the Fascist
Freds enough time.

Oh, by no means.  The never ending task of identifying which
groups cannot be hated is one of the primary responsibilities
of enlightened governments everywhere.

Ah, thanks for the clarification.  Of course, were serial murderers
to organize into a voting bloc or rights group, naturally that would
be different.  But it makes perfect sense that mere collections of 
people, e.g., "white persons" should not be conflated with actual
pressure groups or identifiable ethnic groups united by genuine
solidarity due to oppression, discrimination, racial consciousness,
etc.

I am afraid that you are confusing genocide with campaigns of hatred,
which are not always the same thing.

Well, there can be little doubt from the link on your page, 

http://www.geocities.com/campbellsserialmurderolympicgold/

    Campbell's Genocide is a cleverly pre-planned, pre-meditated
    attack on an "identifiable group" of known political-cultural
    enemies, ie a population which has a long record of voting
    against his political party and political interests.  Common
    sense tells us that his calculated policies and programs will
    take many lives according to the "odds" or statistics.  What
    he has underway is COLD BLOODED MURDER, more sinister for that
    reason than the murders by the Port Coquitlam Pig Farmer. This
    premier is a murderous psychopath. There is no "time clock" on
    prosecution for genocide. In time, Campbell, Plant and their
    accomplices will be brought to justice.

and, more sinister by far, the missing persons!  Extropians have
just responded to a plea to those who know of direct victims of
terrorism, and the call should probably go out to those who are
aware of Canadian missing persons.  Speak up!

    Since 2001, several "Exit Surveys" of persons who have left
    MHR rolls have been used to cover up the missing persons of
    MHR. Only about 1/3 of those surveyed have been interviewed. 

    The question has to do with the 2/3 and the missing persons
    implications. The Campbell Government has cleverly focused
    attention on the 1/3, falsely asserting that this proves
    success for their policies and programs.  They distract
    attention from the 2/3 missing to MHR.

Ah, but it would be well to remember that these figures can have
relevance only against the normal background frequency of those
abducted by aliens.  The actual figures could be far less, because
abductions by flying saucer also target the same group:  the poor,
the defenseless, those least likely to be missed!

But my main point is that such programs of extermination do *not*
necessarily have to be characterized by hate.  It is true that
historically, most pogroms have indeed been spawned by the hatred
of groups convinced of their own racial or class superiority, but
in this day and age, remember that such campaigns could be carried
out by cold-blooded people like those you expose merely for short-
term political advantage---no real hate involved.  Likewise, a lot
of the hate prohibited by the enlightened Canadian legislation
does not affect groups whose hatred (e.g. of the Campbellites)
would in turn lead to pogroms or genocide.

It was about general geopolitical trends in the Mideast,
such as whether the US pulling its troops out of Saudi

in Saudi Arabia.

Yo!, Anders,

It's just past mid-summer in Sweden, no?  The flowers

"Knowledge is power," someone very bright once said, but I think that power 
has several faces and not all of them substantively alert.  Someone else 
said, "Information is power," in reference to the Information Age, but is 
narrower in scope than knowledge.

A Pollyanna approach to an important issue.  Are we ever, ever really 
safe?  The most obvious case is death.  Why would we think we are safe in 
our person and property if we cannot protect ourselves from the ultimate 
injury -- death.

You don't have to assume they are "mean".  You might just
assume convergent evolution -- "join the galactic club or else".

Why?  Because anyone with a long term view (i.e. a species that
has trumped the galactic hazard function) is going to take the
viewpoint that "its either my hydrogen or its your hydrogen --
and I would prefer it be mine".

Caca.  The cost of eliminating a species that attempts to step
"over the line" is *zero*.  They made the investment in nanorobots
years ago, they sent them out, they are possibly here and the
minute we go "over the edge" they will take us out.  They are
not going to send us "warning messages".  We have to figure it
out for ourselves (otherwise -- from a "galactic club" perspective
we are better off dead).

Re: "Invasion of the meme snatchers".

Entirely possible.  More work should be done on its possible
abilities and limits.  And more thought should be given to how
we might detect this (e.g. you can fool some of the people some
of the time but you can't fool all of the people all of the time.)

No, the real reason that they are supposed to exterminate
minor races first reaching towards the stars is because it
would be consistent with the fairy tale that they're out there.

> Why?  Because anyone with a long term view (i.e. a species that

Of course.  That is exactly what you'd think from evolutionary
considerations.  The Europeans had the notion, not too surprisingly,
that Africa and the Americas were theirs for the taking.  Strange
it would have been, indeed, if they'd just posted signs at Gibraltar
saying "STAY OUT".  Even totally unaccountably stranger still would
be if they had just remained completely hidden, but should any 
canoe approach from the tropics, just silently and relentlessly
commit a genocide against the adventurous tribe.

Yet this is the fantasy that those who still hope for aliens
expect us to believe.

Wrong.  The cost in missed opportunities is enormous.
They have to remain hogtied in everything they do for
fear of making any noise, or letting any of their
potential victims get any hint of their existence.
Preposterous.

Meanwhile, all that wonderful nanotech could be reforming
planets, stars, and galaxies galore---but then they'd let
us *know* that they were around, and oh my, we can't have
that!

No one has ever advanced even a slightly persuasive reason
why it would be in their interest to remain mysterious and
secretive.  No, it's a story just to advance the fairy tale,
so that people can continue to harbor their alluring and
intriguing fantasies about "aliens".

We should bring the cosmos to life.  And bring life to the cosmos.

Yes, just like the rest of us.  In Robin's metaphor, the meta-foxes
eat the same things as the foxes.

> I'm not sure they could find 'here' these things.

I fear that they would!  In less than a thousand years, the Earth
will probably be at the center of a civilization expanding at
the speed of light.  By the same token, if there ever are
aliens in the skies of Earth, they will be from a civilization
(when they left it) about a thousand years ahead of ours.

We could be so low on the scale of evolution when it gets
here, that it brushes us aside as microbes, using the energy
and resources of the solar system for its own lifeburst.

The odds of this happening so close to our own lifeburst
are miniscule, however.

It would be hoped that they would act the same way as we
will if we (by a fantantic chance) happen to encounter
a billion light years from here (a billion years from now)
a civilization on the verge of galactic conquest.  We 
should (with our thousand year head start) regard them
as little brothers who'll join us in bringing life to 
the cosmos---and that would also include treasuring their
archeological and cultural past.

(I don't believe I've made the following point to the list
before but my sent-mail logs are a bit confused on the point.
Please excuse if redundant.)
-------


Interestingly, Milan Circovic, Amara and I have been having
an offline discussion about the "temperature" of the galaxy.

Marvin Minsky suggested to Dyson ~30+ years ago at one of
the U.S.-USSR SETI conferences that advanced civilizations
would seek to approach the coolest temperature possible --
ideally the background temperature of the universe (~3 deg. K) [1].
This is because thermodynamically it is the most efficient.

As I've discussed in papers and on the list -- as Matrioshka
Brains "grow" the outer layers become cooler and cooler.  But
as Milan and Amara have pointed out to me, one *cannot* get
to 3 deg. K. within a galaxy.  The background temperatures
from stellar radiation and other radiation sources probably
keeps one above ~100 deg. K.  (I still have to read some
of the documentation they have provided to get a more exact
"galactic" temperature limit but you get the idea.)

The implication of this is that advanced civilizations --
if they want to produce the most advanced computational
architectures -- have to *leave* the galaxy to seek the lowest
temperature (inter-galactic) environment.

So one answer for the Fermi Paradox is the fact that we
(or any other "developing" civilization) simply live in
a "bad" neighborhood.  Advanced civilizations would gather
up sufficient materials and exit from galaxies entirely.
This makes sense from the additional perspective of avoiding
galactic hazard functions (esp. Gamma Ray Bursters,
wandering black holes, etc.).

Robert

1. "MINSKY:  Since radiation at any temperature above 3 deg. K is
wasteful and a squandering of natural resources, the higher the
civilization, the lower the infrared radiation.  We should look
for extended sources of 4 deg. K radiation.  There should be
very few natural such sources."  -- "Communication with Extraterrestrial
Intelligence", C. Sagen (ed.) MIT Press 1973.

When this was announced a few days ago I was curious, so I downloaded both
papers of Lynds are read them. Perhaps I did not understand anything of what
he is trying to say, but I was not impressed. It seems to me that he is
assuming from the very beginning what he wants to prove, and that he is not
explaining why the standard view of these things (that we learn in first
year calculus) is wrong.

I have generally tended to agree with Lee's previous statement that we 
are alone and there are no aliens out there waiting to pounce on us.

But there is another alternative that I don't remember anyone 
mentioning. Look around you. Old folk with a good pension or a pile of 
assets don't do much. Sitting on your porch in a rocking chair seems 
like a good deal to them. It is the young who haven't made their pile 
who rush around 'doing' things.

Now if you add together increased lifespans, reducing birthrates, the 
need to be 'safe' (to protect your vastly increased lifespan) then the 
outcome seems clear.

An OLD population with very few (or even none) young entities won't 
actually 'do' very much. You might think now that you will want to do 
lots of exciting research, world-shaping projects, etc., but the future 
reality will be very different. It's rather like a self-confident young 
man stating with supreme assurance that 'marriage and kids won't change 
me in the slightest'.

There might well be thousands of alien civilizations out there, but they 
are all doing the vastly advanced equivalent of sitting on their front 
porch in their rocking chairs watching the universe go by.

Just as we will.

I'd love to revive people, if I was sure they wanted it. I'd gladly
spend time (especially if I was not mortal anymore!) and resources on
it. I think it would be so much fun to see their face once they're
back!

Must be even better than bringing a smile on a sad face---which
already makes me happy.

JDP a écrit (29.7.2003/19:50) :

Here goes:

Next (and last within France) possible move is "recours en cassation"
at the "Conseil d'Etat".

This involves special habilitated lawyers. There is a limited number
of them (a quantity controlled by the State). Hence, Giulio's
suggestion of offering much money (in case it was made available) to
get a super lawyer doesn't seem to be practical.

Conseil d'Etat doesn't re-judge the case; it just says whether the
decision is lawful or not. In particular, the facts are not examined
again (no witness).

I learned all that through the help of a law post-grad (assistant
professor in Paris, but not specialized in administrative law). He
agreed with me that defending the freedom of burial was doomed, and
that arguing that the court MAY kill the Martinot by ordering their
burial was the way to go. (As you might guess, the administration is
not supposed to kill people for no reason.)

Also, Conseil d'Etat already rendered a decision (negative) on a
similar situation last year (in which freedom of burial was argued).

I made a web page with everything I know on the situation, and I will
update it with anything new. It's at

http://dtext.com/transition/martinot/

I don't have the time to do an English language version for now
(anyone who'd agree to do it please contact me, I think it would be
useful), hence the quick summary above.

As long as people, indiividually or in political groups, have the desire and 
power to control and force others to their idea of "what is right", full 
transparency will be equivalent to full oversight and control.   Also, "full" 
is not so full as long as there is no real way to force the powers that be 
into such transparency.  All government groups to date do not agree that 
their operations and proceedings should be transparent.  Again, full 
oversight and control of the citizens by the government becomes the price of 
transparancey.  Again, No, Thank You.

Such trivial irrelevancies in the face of potentially creating a complete Big

Well, lets face it.  Our bodies as they are today are not exactly a source of 
unmitigated joy.  Any intelligent person would desire to make them less 
troublesome wherever possible.   Some might desire to design new bodies from 
sscratch.  Exactly how is this imminently sane appraisal and thinking outside 
the "box" supposed to be a sign of some self-hatred, alienation or 
cultishness?   The very question seems to use words in a meaningless manner.

Well, I will suggest that Damien is right and that there
is a VERY GOOD REASON that you did not understand anything.
It is a joke.  And a poster to slashdot didn't get it either.

Moreover, it demonstrates again just how dependent all of
us really are on the scientific community. It would be easy
to collect a stack of the most impressive looking books and
documents, all of which would defy any of the contributors
to this list in the sense that (unless we depended on the
scientific community as a whole) we would have no way of
refuting, but which, nonetheless would have been written
by crackpots.

Well, who can blame most of us for being taken in?  One reads
so many incredible things, say by Hawking or David Deutsch,
which, though eminently respectable in the long run, produce
the same feelings at first of incomprehension.

(It's also important not to overreact in the other direction,
and to assume that any new theory seemingly at odds with what
we know must automatically be wrong, of course.)

Ah, yes, but as I've pointed out many many times, we
use our intuitions of having to *move* rather than 
*copy* and then project this limitation onto our future
selves and onto advanced technologies themselves!

There is no need to *move*.  The advanced entities
and civilizations simply *copy* themselves to wherever
they get the most run time per nickel.  Moving would
be damned hard anyway.  I can just see (not!) our
picking up and moving every single bit of life here
on Earth to somewhere where it gets to run better
and faster!

Not at all. That's almost analogous to saying that all 
humans who live in Siberia will just pick up and move
to more temperate surroundings now that know what they
are missing.  (Really, though, I sincerely wonder what
does keep everyone in the U.S. from moving to California.
The reasons that people need all that ice and snow aren't
clear to me, but the reasons do exist.)

Advanced civilizations will simply *spread* outward,
and if the papers you are studying make it really
advantageous to run outside galaxies, then eventually
despite the fewer resources, the matter dominated
areas inside galaxies would very gradually fall
behind.  That is, all tentacles of civilization that
reach beyond a galaxy will by definition lag 20,000
years behind to begin with.  It will take a *long time*
to catch up and surpass their parents.

The urge to avoid the obvious runs deep indeed.

When this was announced a few days ago I was curious, so I downloaded
both papers of Lynds are read them. Perhaps I did not understand
anything of what he is trying to say, but I was not impressed. It seems
to me that he is assuming from the very beginning what he wants to

I'm sorry that I missed your email.&nbsp; I read some of the replies and
thought I should reply myself.&nbsp; I hope that some of my thoughts

mistaken and if we simply clarify this, the rest will be very easy to
answer.<br><br>
First, you (or those who you are talking to) have mistaken Primo with
some otherly-type-of-concept.&nbsp; Primo is a prototype future body

biology and technology.&nbsp; <br><br>
[RANT:&nbsp; Second, transhumanists are extropians (why do many people

Damien Broderick and a few others who used the term in different ways and
for different purposes.) ]<br><br>
Third, (Now, back to Primo), Primo is not an &quot;impossible&quot;
body.&nbsp; It is certainly a concept that has high potentiality for
being produced in design shops.&nbsp; Industrial design and product

Primo-type body parts.&nbsp; As I write this, I am looking at 4 posters

Lee, this is a fundamental flaw in the consideration of the
behavior of advanced civilizations -- particularly if they
are "tightly integrated" as an "uploaded" civilization might
be.  The problems are that (a) you have access to the entire
knowledge base of the civilization at vary high bandwidth
(so this is a "wealth" of knowledge).; and (b) it looks like
a solar system can contain something like 2^50 bits of
information -- this can get even more complex if one "overloads"
terms.

I have yet to see anyone propose a reasonable scheme for
sending 2^50 bits across interstellar distances.  I just
don't think it is going to be easy -- and if it is "easy"
it seems likely that it is going to be expensive (in terms
of energy, mass, etc.)

Copying a megabyte of information between floppies is cheap
to us now.  But copying a civilization's entire information
base seems problematic.  So it seems likely that if one does
it one may do it rarely when the cost is lowest.  If instead
one decides to "go it alone" one is sacrificing a huge knowledge
base.  I don't think people of our culture can easily understand
what that means (it is probably much worse than the situation
experienced by colonizers of a few centuries ago).  Look at how
"emplaced" Google has become and multiply the sacrifice of that
by many orders of magnitude.  It could be argued that colonization
would in effect require the loss of ones "identity".

Thought question: "How much of yourself (mental, physical, etc.)
would you sacrifice colonize a new star system?".

And before you answer, read a little bit about the misadventures
of the Donner Party.

Some of us actually *left* California, in large part due
to the hazard function presented by earthquakes.

And besides you can't do ice-fishing in CA (generally
speaking)...  :-)

Yep, being in a galaxy puts you in the "stupid" part of
the universe.  (But hey, you didn't know before now
so you can't really be faulted for it...).

But it doesn't matter.  Alligators cannot live where
lions live and lions cannot live where alligators live.
We live in the hazardous (stupid) part of the universe
and those more advanced than us live elsewhere.

Granted -- but MBrains and other civilizations most likely
*have* a "long time".  A sol-type star, properly star-lifted,
has a lifetime of trillion(s) of years, or one could always migrate
to a sufficiently small star with a similar lifetime.  So one has a
"long time" significantly exceeding how long the universe has existed
thus far (perhaps 100+ times longer).  That is a *long* time
to figure out "Plan B".

How would you outline the progress you anticipate (that is, 
if you're simply not full of despondency over our prospects)?

How does our "desire" ever diminish to the point that groups
and individuals *never* initiate the use of force (except in
the defense of private property)?  On first reading, one might
think that you were calling for a spontaneous change in human
nature.

I don't understand.  Why would you be unwilling to pay
this price?  I think that we should indeed aim for government
to be *fully* transparent first.

The two may have to go hand in hand.  The western
governments will (rightly) refuse to be transparent
so long as formidable enemy societies have huge
nuclear arsenals aimed at them, or so long as 
terrorists and criminals can strike fear into the
hearts of millions.  (The U.S. appears to have made
great progress on the issue of the former.)

When the U.S. is just a bit more powerful, perhaps
it can be persuaded to become completely open at the
same moment that universal surveillance is possible.
So, yes, Ashcroft is watching all of us to see who
is building basement nukes, but we are all watching
him to make sure that there are no non-public midnight
arrests.

Oh for God's sake.  You always surrender to some internal urge
to harp about something.  One of the issues (recall Natasha's
input) has always been---in this thread---how one would *feel*
about complete transparency.

Bleh, sent this early by accident...

>From what I gathered solely from that web page,
he's arguing that calculus is the equivalent of broken,

digitization as well.  He's basically stating that comparing
any two objects in motion is pointless, since at best, we
are comparing an avg rather than an instant in time.  

Its a practicality argument, more than anything else.
Anybody who tries to apply calculus to events already
runs into these problems and approximates.  He's saying
the equivalent of "the map is not the territory"; just because
we think its been discretized properly does not mean it has

assumes that there is no fundamental slice in time....

When this was announced a few days ago I was curious, so I downloaded
both papers of Lynds are read them. Perhaps I did not understand
anything of what he is trying to say, but I was not impressed. It seems
to me that he is assuming from the very beginning what he wants to
prove, and that he is not explaining why the standard view of these
things (that we learn in first year calculus) is wrong.

I think it's most likely there are "old folk" out there who's activities are
inscruitable and invisible to us, but rather than existing sedately I expect
they're experiencing life at a level of complexity and meaning beyond our
current comprehension.

Similarly it amazes me when people talk about vastly extending their
capabilities and longevity but then imagine that they would then pursue
their current hedonistic goals (or maybe just one copy to this).  Even the
idea of boundless physical expansion, while possessing a certain
mathematical symmetry, I think is based on our evolved drive for procreation
and won't match posthuman values.

I think that it's extremely important for us to question
the inevitability of senescence and death.

NOTHING is more important than uprooting the notions
that we must die.  I would urge you to check out in
more detail the writings of Max More, and Mike Perry
---the latter in his great book "Forever For All".

More specifically, exactly *why*, we must ask, are
those old people sitting around in their rocking
chairs?  Are they making an aesthetic statement of
some kind?  No.  The infirmities of old age are
directly traceable to degeneration of the nervous
system and wearing out of other body parts.  THIS
IS POTENTIALLY CORRECTABLE.

No.

1. The "increased lifespans" must be and will be
   accompanied by increased vitality and increased
   ambition.

2. "Reduced birthrate"????? 

   Never! The whole cosmos beckons to us to bring
   life to it, and whether by copying, or by Von
   Neumann probes, by or old fashioned colonization,
   that we must do.

3. "Safety".  Yes, that is high on the agenda of
   anyone who wants to keep on living.  But in this
   regard we must emulate nature, who guarantees
   life extension by flooding all available niches
   with ever more life.  Earth must become the source
   of trillions of spoors carrying copies of us and
   lifeforms of all of the most advanced kinds that
   we can engineer to the very ends of our infinite
   universe.

Sadly, the reality for me and perhaps for you will probably
be just as you say.  We may have probably been born too soon.
But that is *no* reason to adopt a defeatist philosophy!

Anyway, I *will* want to continue to delight in understanding,
and, were I only able to muster the intelligence, the knowledge,
and the energy, then I also *would* be among those doing research
and exploring the galaxies.

Well, why not?  What is physically impossible about *me* having
unlimited energy?  It's just a matter of the application of
intelligence, and the sun at present supplies vastly more
energy than would be required.  All I need to do is live
long enough, and somehow survive this century.

The word "all" should have tipped you off to your error.
Some humans will become immortal.  Some thinking entities
will colonize (and as Tipler says "engulf") the universe.

We need at every turn to spread and support memes to
foster this ambition within ourselves.  It's why I
am an Extropian.

Hello everyone,

Physical Immortality is a new magazine being produced by The Society for Venturism.  Our goal is to get it distributed throughout the United States and beyond.  Through this and other initiatives we aim to change public attitudes about extreme life extension and to even save lives.  

I have been appointed the managing editor and I hope to do all I can to advance this important project.  And so I ask everyone on the list to consider subscribing.   

To give some incentive to everyone, I will even send a free sample copy to those who request it.  Please just remember that this is our first issue and we definitely plan to improve the appearance as time goes on.  But this is not to say I am not proud of what we have so far accomplished.

We are also looking for submissions and I would ask anyone interested to try their hand at it.  

My life has definitely taken some amazing turns since leaving Alaska for Arizona!

very best wishes,

John Grigg

Physical Immortality Managing Editor
Blah, Blah, Blah!! : )


             The Society for Venturism
                11255 S.S.R. 69
               Mayer, Arizona 86333 
               www.venturist.org/

It is time for all people who wish to live in a better world which readily accepts life extension research and cryonics to band together and work to make this a concrete reality.  The Society for Venturism is raising up its banners to share with the world our exciting message which aims for the achievement of physical immortality.  Our initial plans are to help our members be interviewed in the mass media, develop a major new magazine, and to have the membership advantage of sharing our beliefs from the forum of an organization that does not profit when someone gets suspended.  

We will do the first aim by engaging radio and TV talk shows and offer up Venturist members to be interviewed - long and often.  We hope to flood the talk shows and news shows with interviews of reasonable Venturist members who are willing to persuade others to "take the venture to the future."   If you remember, we chose the word "Venturist" because a "venture" is an adventure with some risk.  That is what cryonics is about.

We will spread the cryonics message by building the Venturist Magazine into a publication that can be sold in news stands and will be attractive and informative.  Starting with the July 1st issue the Venturist magazine will come out every month.  

Our unique organization lets others do suspensions and storage, while we concentrate on getting our message out to the world.  This is so there is no perceived financial gain for us as cryonics grows.  The benefits of our work will go to others.

So far we have discussed building the membership, doing radio and TV talk shows, and building the magazine and trying to get it up to standards where it can be sold in news stands.  After we have progressed in this direction we can implement other benefits to immortalists like:  Personal trusts to take it ($) with you;  a back-up rescue option in case the patient's primary storage company gets in trouble;  meetings and seminars here at the Creekside Preserve.

And in time Ventureville, our cryonics community planned for development in Mayer, will become a reality as our numbers grow.  This will not happen overnight, but in time we will have houses, apartments and a lodge center to be a beacon to cryonicists everywhere who want to gather together to work on Venturist goals and also to look after each other.  

People who use reason to seek their own advantage and do so without harming others, and in fact help others in the process they select to obtain those advantages, are the most noble and honorable.  And that is what you will be doing with other fine people when you join the society for Venturism.  Each time the Venturists help motivate another person to sign up for cryonics, the existing cryonics population is strengthened by adding more members and the new person is helped by having the personal protection of being signed up for cryonics.  Therefore, every time you help someone else through cryonics you are also helping those who are already signed up and those who are already in suspension.  Working to increase membership in the cryonics movement is truly a win-win situation.

By becoming a member you will be taking part in a great undertaking which will change for the better the world we live in.  Come embark on the adventure!

This post will sound harsh but fair; I think it's the best way to show you
all my appreciation.

I think this community can be percieved negatively because of that "having
visions that are shocking to the social consensus" thing; these visions
being at the fringe of conjectures and actual trends, it can be frustrating
for people who don't want to miss on the evolutionary advantages this tribe
might have yet don't want to bet on duds.
This situation saddens me because I find myself "shot by both sides" :
extropianism and the majority of people are either at best lacking the
historical culture to know these ideas are old hat or at worst voluntarly
omitting this knowledge by sheer vanity.

The visions and methodology of Extropianism hardly makes it a new
philosophy.

Charles Fourier, great historian of the future, philosopher of glorious
musical tomorrows of harmonious bodies, way after civilizations, when the
flesh will be invested of ideal qualities , who was appreciated by Marx and
Engels, was proposing an harmonian revolution.
Here's some traduction of passages from Oeuvre complètes tome VIII and
Bulletin de Lyon, 1804:
"humanity will wake itself to the materialist ameliorations it's body is
suceptible to."
He was forecasting living on other planets since at this point the earth
would be too small.
"New and useful properties gained by earthlings living in these new celestal
countries: amphiby, night vision, perpetual growth of hairs and teeths,
indolorism , whitening to the sun etc"
Forecasting genetic manipulations:
"from their torso a new appendice would grow: used either as a powerful
weapon, to prevent falls, a superb ornament with infinite force and
dexterity. Habitants of suns, lactées and ringed planets like saturn are
amphibious, by the effect of an ouverture in the casing of their heart, and
have a fifth member common to both sex: the archiarm who can kill an animal
in one shot, be used as a whirling parachute, a motor for fake wings, a rope
ladder, a swim-aid that gives man the velocity of a fish and thousand ohter
possibilities either on earth or in the seas. The archiarm triples
productivity of the industry and bring the body at it's ultimate degree of
biological perfection."

(He too, as I said in another post, could be a promoter of impossible
bodies, but that's another story...)

That ought to be enough for the vision part. A bit frivolous and funny but
not much more than saying that in the future our children will be few and
immensely valued, huanity will have to deal with hypermaturity  etc.

On the methodological front, I present you Condorcet who concludes his
_Esquisse d'un tableau historique des progrès de l'esprit humain_  by
predicting the end of stupidity, hypocrisy and the emergence of a new body
made possible by technological, scientific and medical progress.
Sounds cutting edge? It was written in 1795.
 Death is percieved as a hypothesis to be reserved to exceptional cases like
accidents or rare probabilities. The lenght of life, considerably augmented
"get close to for ever (...) an unlimited lenght".
So it is : a body who escaped the laws of nature and entropy ...

Genuine ignorance or vanity, it doesn't matter to me: as a group,
extropians/transhumanists are a bit too eager to misread their predecesor in
order to make room for themselves...
Also, using the structure of an "institute" / "school of philosophy" is a
massive philosophical regression, sad, a system of terror, with the
pretention of making something new but is a king-sized povrety.
 I think we have great dreams but extropians don't go at it the right way.
Don't even think of calling Fourier and Condorcet  proto extropians, please,
that would be disingenious for the other way around woud be more logical
since they are already accepted in the academic network, humanity's common
cultural heritage and they had more historical influence than their current
poor unsuccessful incarnation: extropianism is just a materialism and
realizing it by droping the usless brand name would be the mature thing to
do for it would help in getting credibility and real life traction to our
common dreams.
Rejoice! You are not an extropian, you are a materialist ! :-)
You are part of a tradition and your ideas are accepted more easily.
Do I think this post will change anything to the established order?  I know
people who are branded extropians or transhumanists won't budge, I wrote
this for people  who will get interested in these problems of our time, so
they won't needlessly cripple their game.
May our dreams be reality!

UK's main news and sports network, "BBC Radio 5Live" just completed a 
snapshot interview with Nick Bostrom and myself for a news program on the 
future human.

Interview focus was on man becoming 1/2 cyborg, with a reference to 
"Terminator 3" movie, and comparing it to "Primo" transhumanist design concept.

I'll write about it and other design issues for the upcoming ExI Exponent 
Newsletter.

Hello Sébastien,

> I used the word "extropians" in a serious discussion recently and once again
> was reminded that extropians sound like goofy cultists.

Are SETI enthusiasts (i.e. the people who dedicate their spare
computing time to SETI@HOME -- *not* people who believe in UFOs)
"cultists"?  [One could ask the question about many other distributed
computing projects with the possible exception of GIMPS -- we all
*know* Spike is a cultist... :-?]

I think one of the key questions to pose is "Does this have a reasonable
chance of working?".  Followed by "Yes, I *know* it has never been done
before -- but look at the history of development of literally *everything*
difficult -- the automobile, the airplane, the VCR, the heart transplant,
the defeat of communism -- *all* of them have *never* been done before.

> Not being able to find out why they were thinking that,

Because a "reasonable" reaction to something "never done before" is
to believe that it cannot be done.  One has to make a reasonable case
otherwise.

> or have them forward me a link where one serious extropian sound
> like they say,

I try to "sound like I say" (though a few familiar with my comments
over the last 5 years might object to several cases).

It is *very* simple for me.  "More information is better than less
information" -- or perhaps "Complexity is good" (though this gets
a bit more problematic if short term complexity reduces long term
complexity).

I believe one can derive most extropian principles (and perhaps a
complete moral philosophy of extropianism and transhumanism from
such a starting point).

[I disagree slightly with Natasha with regard to the specific
differences between extropianism, transhumanism and posthumanism
["the 3"] as I believe some fairly reasonable differences were outlined
recently at the World Transhumanis Association conference, esp.
during its introduction seminar.  But these differences tend
to be *very* minor compared with the gap between "the 3" and most
other religions, philosophies, political or moral systems, etc.]

> What would be the best answer to someone who would say that the primo body
> and mind uploading are allegoric figures that transhumanists and extropians
> are offering that permits to fantasm a body removed from it's attaches with
> the present, the here and now, impossible bodies,

If I understand this statement correctly, esp. "allegoric" and "fantasm",
the answer for me is that we are *not* proposing allegorical or fantasy
bodies.  We *REALLY* intend to do it (or we think humanity will do it).
Although a "primo body" or a disembodied upload state are "impossible"
now -- that is no proof that they are forever impossible.

> wich makes them promoter of an ascetic ideal, who hates the body and
> the flesh (and are possibly even worse than christians at it,

In some sense, at least for extropianism, there is the promotion of
an "ascetic ideal" (e.g. more information is better than less information).
It is not that one "hates" the body, it is just that one can recognize
there are potentially improvements (from bodies to other forms)
that can contain more information (or may allow a more creative
exploration of the "form" space).

> (alienation is to be understood here as "being estranged to oneself").

One does not have to be in any way "estranged".  We could not be here
without having gone through the entire journey that evolution previously
laid down for us.  It is simple to respect and value that.  But that
does not prevent us from believing there may be better ways (as in
improved bodies, cyborgs, uploads, etc) with which the future may be
explored and complexity increased to a greater extent than current
bodies allow.

(at least those are my opinions -- I cannot speak for other extropians)
Robert

On Sun Aug 03, 2003 01:25 pm Lee Corbin argued:

> I think that it's extremely important for us to question
> the inevitability of senescence and death.

I agree. My poetical image of 'sitting in a rocking chair on the porch' 
was not intended to be taken too literally or to imply senescence.
Older people who do not have to worry about income (because they have a 
good pension or are wealthy) and already have much experience of the 
world are not as 'driven' as the young turks. Some are old crocks, but 
many play golf, tour the world, take drugs (prescribed - of course!), 
etc. Age, experience and relative wealth does change your outlook on life.

The European nations are just beginning to grapple with the problems of 
an aging population, because the young folk don't want kids anymore. If 
they do have children, they only have one, which is not enough to stop 
the aging population problem.

Now, Lee claims that when our science makes us relatively immortal, we 
will still want to produce loads of offspring. I think that all the 
evidence so far points in the opposite direction. Give people a good 
standard of living, a bit of education and only ten extra years and they 
already stop having children.

The only way round this is to assume that as well as immortality, we 
also get unlimited resources, so we can support lots of offspring.
But, Will we want to? is the big question.

A recent analysis of the lives of famous scientists claimed that after 
they got married and had kids, their contribution to research was 
finished. You may not like the idea at present, but I am pretty sure 
that when you are immortal and independently wealthy, you won't want to 
work 9 to 5 hunched over a computer in a cubicle, or heating exotic 
substances in a test tube.

Again, I don't disagree. I'll let you have all these things. :)
But when you've got them, you won't be the old Lee with a few 
superpowers. You will be a completely different being who will laugh at 
the pre-singularity ambitions of the old Lee.

There probably will be a tiny window of time when we are in the process 
of changing, when many different and dangerous things will be going on. 
But assuming we survive, we will come out the other end as very 
different beings.

I do not see it as a defeatist philosophy that a wise, immortal being 
sees no need to conquer galaxies. When the nano world is available to us 
a molecule floating in space could be a universe for each of us.

Alienation doesn't necessarily follow from asceticism, 
which in turn doesn't necessarily equal 
self-mortification.
Ideas about uploading a human mind or radically modified 
human bodies express a hoped-for ideal, not a rejection of 
the actual. Perhaps few extropes or transhumanists strive 
for an idealized human body through diet or exercise, but 
that makes such people (like me) lazy and wishful at 
worst.

As for "primo body" or uploading serving as 
allegories--well, of course they do. Any actual radical 
transformation lies pretty far in the future, and might 
have significant drawbacks not currently imagined or even 
imaginable.

People do take small steps toward rebuilt bodies and 
uploading. It's a slippery slope from cosmetics and wigs, 
past eyeglasses and contact lenses to prosthetics and 
beyond--but it's a continuous curve. A similar progression 
exists from wristwatches, possibly the first physically 
intimate mental assistant since pocket-sized notebooks, to 
portable cameras and audio recorders, to cell phones, 
PDAs, and wearable computers. 

If you need an example of a purely asethetic bodily 
improvement, and plastic surgery won't serve, here's one.
I'd like to have a better sense of hearing to improve my 
ability to appreciate music. I'd like to have absolute 
pitch. I'd like to have the ability to discriminate 
absolute loudness, instead of about seven relative levels. 
I can't imagine what current music would sound like if I 
could hear volume as finely as pitch, much less imagine 
music composed by people with that ability.

Hope this helps--you might also look at Kurzweil's "Human 
Body 2.0". Please let the list know if your discussions 
profit.

Yes, there are plenty of antecedents to transhumanism. It would be a 
mistake to assume that it all started with Max More or FM 2020. The FAQ 
contains a partial list of forerunners 
(http://www.transhumanism.org/resources/faq.html#View). It mentions 
Condorcet but not Fourier. 

Do we need to be a new philosophy? No, just as we do not need to be an 
old philosophy. We just need to be a good philosophy that works. This is 
maybe where transhumanism

So in what way are we misreading predecessors? You do not give any
examples, just suggestive quotes that they "had the same ideas" (or
rather, have ideas similar to the ones we develop in the light of
current knowledge and ideas).

A school of philosophy is just a group of people sharing many views, 
which may or may not form a well-defined philosophical system. Aren't 
you aiming at the issue of whether transhumanism can be viewed as a true 
philosophical system (with parts such as metaphysics, epistemology, 
ethics and politics) rather than the structure of transhumanist 
organisations?

But what kind of materialist? Marxist materialist? Epicurean 
materialist? Reductive or eliminative materialist? That I am a 
materialist does not tell much about my ethics, my ideas of what 
constitutes the good life, my ideas of how knowledge can be acquired and 
applied. Saying extropianism is just materialism is like saying it is 
just optimism - it takes a part (which is not even essential, since 
there are Christian extropians who presumably are not materialists) and 
says it is all.

The truth about polygraphs

A National Academy of Sciences study validates long-held doubts about 
the reliability of polygraphs. So why does the government still rely on 
them to screen applicants for jobs?

By Charles P. Pierce, Globe Staff, 8/3/2003

< http://www.boston.com/globe/magazine/2003/0803/coverstory_entire.htm >

WAS HE SWEATING?

Of course he was sweating.

But he didn't want to be sweating, and he didn't want his heart to race 
this way, because he knew what that did to his blood pressure, and he 
knew that he was in a situation here in the Boston office of the Drug 
Enforcement Administration.

Everybody there knew him from the days when he'd been the 
law-enforcement equivalent of a phenom pitcher straight out of the 
minors. So they knew why he was standing there, and he knew why he was 
standing there, and they knew that he knew. He was standing there 
because there was a man behind a closed door with a machine that 
claimed to know the truth of him better than he did. And he wasn't sure 
what the machine knew about him that he didn't know. He knew this 
situation well. He'd been trained to put suspects in this kind of a box.

Once, when he was 16 and at a party, he'd smoked a little weed. The 
joint came by -- maybe once, maybe twice -- and he'd taken a puff. 
Maybe two. It was a long time ago and hard to remember, but it was long 
before he'd become interested in law enforcement and long before he'd 
become so good at it. It was long before he'd graduated from 
Northeastern University summa cum laude with his degree in criminal 
justice and long before the co-op job with the DEA. He'd planned on 
entering the DEA upon graduation but was tripped up by the budget 
shutdown of the mid-'90s.

It was long before he'd gone to work for that antidrug task force down 
on Cape Cod, long before he'd grown his hair long and his beard out to 
go undercover to chase the speed labs and the dope-running boats, and 
it was long before someone had waved the gun at him in the crack house 
in New Bedford. It was long before he'd gotten a pilot's license 
because he'd heard the DEA had an air wing, and he thought he might 
like to be part of that, too. It was long before the awards and the 
citations, and it was long before he'd applied for the full-time job at 
DEA when the government reopened for business.

Tribe is not a term that transhumanists use.  The only group of futurists I 
know who believe they are a "tribe" is a group who are into the singularity 
(not Eli).

So, please don't use "tribe" because the connotations are inappropriate here.

Another false assumption on your part.  First, drop the "ism" from extropy

No, because you use a hotmail account rather than communicate in a more

Sorry, but you need to rethink this Robert.  Extropy Institute prefers not 
to use "ism" for the extropian philosophy.  Extropians are transhumanits 
and I never mentioned posthuman in my post.

Precisely.  Each philosophy or cultural movement has antecedents.  (By the 
way, it's 2030 :-).)  Ideas change according to the times and we rework 
already established ideas.  We take ideas and add to them and subtract from 
them to fit the specific needs of the time in which we live.

That does sound good.  Except for the point that political winds shift and 
change.  What today is a perfectly cool situation could easily tomorrow have 
those who would oppress much of what you believe the most in.  If they have 
total surveillance and the willingness to enforce their views then there 
would be no way to oppose them or simply go one's own way.  

For this reason, at this time, I think it is dangerous, even irresponsibly so,

As I see it it doesn't have anything per se to do with terrorism at all.  It 
is a way of measuring/approximating dynamically the relative confidence or 
lack of it in various aspects of various troublesome parts of the world.   
That seems like a very good thing to have around.

I cannot believe what I am reading here.  Does anyone remember that the vast 
majority of human beings on this planet do not think at all like we do and 
would consider many of our thoughts, much less acting on any of them, 
extremely and even pathologically dangerous?  What exactly are we counting on 
to still have any room to effect extropian change at all when everyone and 
anyone can not only examine all our actions but all of our thoughts as well?  
Are we expecting the vast majority to somehow become enlightened and 
tolerant?    If not, then exactly what kind of game are we playing?   As I 
see it the ability to see everything, including thought would result in the 
worst kind of dystopia given the current nature of human beings and our 
institutions.   If you see some good airtight reason this would not be so 
then please share it.

Why spontaneous?  It will certainly take time.  At some point there might well 
be some less problematic entity or entities that did have that level of 
ability to observe us and head of problems.  I just don't believe that humans 
are at the stage that any one or group of them should have this power.

I don't understand why anyone even would ask this question who has observed 
governments in action all their lives.  Do you believe, for instance, that 
having a government that promotes the "War on Drugs", would legislate what 
people do in their bedrooms, talks about taking away citizenship without due 
process and so on should have the power of complete observation over every 
aspect of your live?  Exactly what would I conceivably gain that would be 
worth the very real danger to my own live and freedom?

The western governments are not exactly angelic entities themselves.  I could 
make the same argument for myself.  As long as there are people out there who 
would interfere with many aspects of my life and what I believe it is 
essential to accomplish if humanity is to have a future, it is right that I 
should refuse to be fully transparent.    

No society except Russia has "huge nuclear arsenals" at this time.   What of 
the government goons and terrorist that can strike fear into free people into 
the hearts of millions?

I do not believe that complete transparency is even desirable.  Why?  Because 
there will always be legitimate disagreements among individuals and groups.  
There will always be competing projects and efforts.   Only an entity with no 
interest in the competing efforts could have complete oversight without 
unfair advantage.  If all could see all then nothing would ever get done 
without the agreement of a substantial number of observers.  Given that the 
number of rational, bright and good hearted people is a small minority I 
don't see how full transparency/accountablity/feedback of all to all could 
help but have a leving and stagnating affect at best.

It is a matter of perspective.  Giving unlimited information to those who are 
very likely to abuse it is a much more serious matter than whether someone 
can see a few "naughties".     The subject is too serious to not address at 
its most serious levels.   My I am flattered the master harpist would notice 
my poor harping.  :-)

Actually, I have never been all that good at
manipulation of symbols as such.  I was really
terrible at trying to prove the limit theorems in
honors calculus, for example, and I have great
difficulty even remembering purely symbolic material. 
For example, it is a absolutely horrendus task for me
to memorize a poem, altho I can recall the meaning,
tone, implications, etc., quite well, indeed.  There
are songs I play fifty or a hundred times as workout
tapes, and I couldn't tell you the lyrics for the life
of me, but I CAN whistle or hum them and be dead on.  

However, although I have a lousy symbolic memory, I
can hold a kind of kinesthetic model of statements in
my mind, and work with that model intuitively to yield
proofs.  The formal logic that I could handle so well
in college involved statements and their
relationships.  I am really good at detecting failures
of implication, which is also how I scored so high on
the SAT's GRE's etc...  Just eliminate the
non-answers...  What's left has to be true - or what
the testors want to see selected.

>Paul Grant (shade999@optonline.net)

As an aside; doctors have come up with a "disorder"
for people who excel at symbolic manipulations...
they're calling it hyperlexia. Personally I think
they're correct (insofar as the description and
general consequences), but incorrect in ascribing to
it a disorder status. How much is genetic vs
environmental is another issue...I do believe though,
that there are people who are inherently better symbol
manipulators than others. >

That's it: since these ideas have been around I think it's not productive to
go through the motion of selling them again as "new" by grouping them under
a new brand; doing so sounds like a sleazy marketing move. Even if the only
contribution of extropianism to these ideas would have been an update in the
light of current knowledge, I'd say might as well also pick-up the old name
to do it and to improve on it. It is the honest thing to do and it is
usually the way philosophical views are thoroughly included into the
academic culture network, wich would be the best thing to do since they
would be diffused at least as much as other philosohers who addressed the
question of technology like Ellul, Heidegger, Latour, Marcuse, Dewey,
Ortega, Mumford etc and shine to their full potential.

Making-up a word like "extropian" doesn't tell anything to anyone: it's much
worse! :-)
So our intellectual contribution should go to specifying what we mean by
materialism, I don't see the need to make it a "double-whammy" but for those
who do, I suggest immortalist materialist (would it be presumptuous of me to
suggest my own interest, hedonist materialist wich is also an immortalism?
Probably since this list is PG-13 isn'it? :-). I'll go further (out of my
league): one who understands matter is very likely to be an immortalist so
simply claiming to be a materialist is enough to tell about one's ethics etc
Anders, I'll get 'round the rest of your interesting answer later.

Evolution takes into account all "bad" decisions.  People
such as the present non-Moslem Europeans will simply be
demographically replaced by people who do decide to have
children. In North America the native population was
replaced by the immigrants because the immigrants could
and did support more children.  The tribes failed to grow
exponentially because they did not have the resources to.

It is definitely *not* the case that in some obscure fashion
the Indian tribes choose not to have as many children, for it
would take only one (1) tribe to happen by chance upon a
different philosophy and numerically take over the continent!
The *only* reason that this did not happen was that their
manner of lifestyle did not support such population growth.

In the very same way, some of our descendents will choose to
proliferate, and some will not.  Those who choose (or can)
proliferate will predominate.  You can't get away from this
tautological fact.

Listen, as hard as it will be---I admit---to broadcast
information, that pales in comparison to the difficulty
of moving it. You aren't making any sense, are you?

Yes, so (as we agree in the subsequent part of your email),
eventually the "stay at homes" could fall behind technologically.

Their story is old hat.  Why does anything need to be
sacrificed: what stays here stays here, and I transmit
as much as possible (copying, *not* moving) of myself
to the least amount of matter than we have to send to
constitute a receiver.

But you have not explained why creatures more advanced
than we are could not be living right here.  Yes, suppose
that 5 billion light years ago and 4 billion ly away, a
colonization began, and that outside our galaxy reside
the most advance portion of that diaspora.  Still, *here*,
there is plenty of energy going to waste!  Some parts of
them would be here, and using that energy, even if it was
not up to the speeds achievable outside the galaxy.

All things can be concurrently achieved once you give up having to
be in only one place at a time. (Yes, some of my current hedonistic
activities I'd replace with more refined means of gratification.)

Yes, perhaps there is some sort of instinct to "breed abundantly
in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply on the earth" that
evolved. But why should that be inimical to our posthuman values?

For one thing, is not appealing to bring life to the outer reaches
of the universe?  Why should matter not be rescued from its currently
dead state almost everywhere?

But an even stronger argument is this: it takes only *one* posthuman
civilization---or perhaps only one sufficiently advanced posthuman---
to colonize the rest of the universe.  Why is it so alluring to so
many people to imagine that somehow all posthuman value systems will
universally turn up their noses at this?  Especially when the ends
are so noble?

So where *does* it get archived when stuff falls into a black hole? (Stuck
on an event horizon surface `membrane'?) Or does this support Lee Corbin's
conjecture that such holes have no physical reality?

Natasha has made this lexical point repeatedly of late. It reminds me of my
own irritation when most people use `sci fi' for what I and almost everyone
inside the science fiction community have always called `sf' or `SF'; or
when I hear `deconstructionism' instead of `deconstruction'. These
distinctions strike outsiders as utterly inconsequential, and insisting on
them as laughable, but I can't help myself. Still--

In the case of `extropy', I find it hard to see how this recently coined
noun has any special claim to group-membership status. The usual patterns
in German (I think) suggest that the equivalent term for extropy theory in
that language would be `extropismus', akin to `extropism' in English--as
indeed it does seem to be used in Europe--and I admit that's rather ugly.
Most people here are extropians, not extropists, although some are
exhibitionists. But I suppose the point isn't the *word* as such, it's the
automatic implication of group-think that goes with any -ism. At least
nobody has yet suggest Extropianity. :)

That would be my guess too. Adding "ism" seems to
be a way of caricaturising a set of ideas thereby making
it easier to attack. But it's one thing to be caricaturised
by those who one would naturally expect opposition
from and another to have one's confederates encourage
such caricaturisation by adopting their language.

Actually, I think Robert was simply continuing to use
the term used by Sebastian Chikara.
 
Alas, I think we have not seen the last of such 'own
goal' terminology as extropes talking of extropianism,
or critical thinkers professing their 'beliefs'.

As for using sci fi instead of SF, at least one head is 
now metaphorically hanging in shame ;-)

I remember before I knew to use the SF reference, I was really slammed for 
saying "Sci Fi".  Understandably so because there is a big difference 
between the SF reference/knowledge/understanding and Sci Fi reference/lack 
of knowledge/consciousness.  Although the Sci-Fi channel on TV is pretty 
funny at times.

Hahah a ha  ahaha...  I'll take extropanity over insanity any day! (The "i" 
intentionally omitted.)

And yes, you are correct.  The "ism" is so clickish, don't you think.  I 
mean, I'd rather like to think as ExI being a business oriented 
multi-disciplinary think-tank concerning prescient issues of technology and 
the future, rather than a group-think ism.  Group-think is the opposite of 
constant expansion, by its very nature.

And yes, I am intentionally stressing this point.

Good point. 

But Natasha's point is also still good imo. Time for an ExI
Principles 4.0, or at least a 3.something, I think. 

Perhaps we can also take out some of the 'believing' 
baggage which is inconsistent at best and misleading 
terminology at worst.

I'm not sure I understand your point here, unless you are suggesting that
this might account for various god myths, based on assumed interaction
between highly advanced "space intelligences" and ancient humans. I don't
see any need to hypothesize God(s), whether as "space intelligence" or
otherwise.

Perhaps I should add this to my reading list.  Thanks.  I haven't read
Moravec, but Greg Egan has certainly been a strong influence on my thinking.

It seems to me that the technological development of civilizations would
tend to the following pattern:

(1)  Evolutionary progess to a level of capability similar to ours
currently, (radio, electrical power, geo-scale construction, limited space
travel) where some artifacts would become visible outside their planetary
system,

soon followed by

(2) converging and accelerating knowledge base leading to either
self-destruction or (optimistically) a new and relatively stable plateau
constrained by the difficulties of dealing with intrasteller mass and
distance.  In the optimistic scenario, the civilization would work within
these physical constraints, and free of the instinctual drive to expand
simply for the sake of expansion, would make highly efficient use of local
mass and energy, and focus on local development (exploring all conceivable
forms of knowledge and interaction) leading to a very small observable
signature on the galactic scale.

followed eventually by (crystal ball now vanishingly unreliable)

(3) expansion on the level of stellar engineering and greater.

I suspect that the key to understanding the Fermi "paradox" is that most or
all civilizations are at the level 2 plateau, and thus virtually
undetectable for a long period of time.  Given the relatively young universe
in which we find ourselves, isn't it likely that no one as far as we can
tell has yet made it to level 3? What is our best informed estimate of the
duration of level 2?

The Probability That a Real-Estate Agent Is Cheating You (and Other Riddles of
Modern Life) 

August 3, 2003 By STEPHEN J. DUBNER 

The most brilliant young economist in America -- the one so deemed, at least, by
a jury of his elders -- brakes to a stop at a traffic light on Chicago's south
side. It is a sunny day in mid-June. He drives an aging green Chevy Cavalier
with a dusty dashboard and a window that doesn't quite shut, producing a dull
roar at highway speeds. 

But the car is quiet for now, as are the noontime streets: gas stations,
boundless concrete, brick buildings with plywood windows. 

An elderly homeless man approaches. It says he is homeless right on his sign,
which also asks for money. He wears a torn jacket, too heavy for the warm day,
and a grimy red baseball cap. 

The economist doesn't lock his doors or inch the car forward. Nor does he go
scrounging for spare change. He just watches, as if through one-way glass. After
a while, the homeless man moves along. 

''He had nice headphones,'' says the economist, still watching in the rearview
mirror. ''Well, nicer than the ones I have. Otherwise, it doesn't look like he
has many assets.'' 


Steven Levitt tends to see things differently than the average person.
Differently, too, than the average economist. This is either a wonderful trait
or a troubling one, depending on how you feel about economists. The average
economist is known to wax oracularly about any and all monetary issues. But if
you were to ask Levitt his opinion of some standard economic matter, he would
probably swipe the hair from his eyes and plead ignorance. ''I gave up a long
time ago pretending that I knew stuff I didn't know,'' he says. ''I mean, I just
-- I just don't know very much about the field of economics. I'm not good at
math, I don't know a lot of econometrics, and I also don't know how to do
theory. If you ask me about whether the stock market's going to go up or down,
if you ask me whether the economy's going to grow or shrink, if you ask me
whether deflation's good or bad, if you ask me about taxes -- I mean, it would
be total fakery if I said I knew anything about any of those things.'' 

In Levitt's view, economics is a science with excellent tools for gaining
answers but a serious shortage of interesting questions. His particular gift is
the ability to ask such questions. For instance: If drug dealers make so much
money, why do they still live with their mothers? Which is more dangerous, a gun
or a swimming pool? What really caused crime rates to plunge during the past
decade? Do real-estate agents have their clients' best interests at heart? Why
do black parents give their children names that may hurt their career prospects?
Do schoolteachers cheat to meet high-stakes testing standards? Is sumo wrestling
corrupt? 

And how does a homeless man afford $50 headphones? 

Many people -- including a fair number of his peers -- might not recognize
Levitt's work as economics at all. But he has merely distilled the so-called
dismal science down to its most primal aim: explaining how people get what they
want, or need. Unlike most academics, he is unafraid of using personal
observations and curiosities (though he does fear calculus). He is an
intuitionist. He sifts through a pile of data to find a story that no one else
had found. He devises a way to measure an effect that veteran economists had
declared unmeasurable. His abiding interests -- though he says he has never
trafficked in them himself -- are cheating, corruption and crime. 

His interest in the homeless man's headphones, meanwhile, didn't last long.
''Maybe,'' he said later, ''it was just testimony to the fact I'm too
disorganized to buy a set of headphones that I myself covet.'' 

Levitt is the first to say that some of his topics border on the trivial. But he
has proved to be such an ingenious researcher and clear-eyed thinker that
instead of being consigned to the fringe of his field, the opposite has
happened: he has shown other economists just how well their tools can make sense
of the real world. 

''Levitt is considered a demigod, one of the most creative people in economics
and maybe in all social science,'' says Colin Camerer, an economist at the
California Institute of Technology. ''He represents something that everyone
thinks they will be when they go to grad school in econ, but usually they have
the creative spark bored out of them by endless math -- namely, a kind of
intellectual detective trying to figure stuff out.'' 

Levitt is a populist in a field that is undergoing a bout of popularization.
Undergraduates are swarming the economics departments of elite universities.
Economics is seen as the ideal blend of intellectual prestige (it does offer a
Nobel, after all) and practical training for a high-flying finance career
(unless, like Levitt, you choose to stay in academia). At the same time,
economics is ever more visible in the real world, thanks to the continuing
fetishization of the stock market and the continuing fixation with Alan
Greenspan. 

The greatest change, however, is within the scholarly ranks. Microeconomists are
gaining on the macro crowd, empiricists gaining on the theorists. Behavioral
economists have called into doubt the very notion of ''homo economicus,'' the
supposedly rational decision-maker in each of us. Young economists of every
stripe are more inclined to work on real-world subjects and dip into bordering
disciplines -- psychology, criminology, sociology, even neurology -- with the
intent of rescuing their science from its slavish dependence upon mathematical
models. 

Levitt fits everywhere and nowhere. He is a noetic butterfly that no one has
pinned down -- he was once offered a job on the Clinton economic team, and the
Bush campaign approached him about being a crime adviser -- but who is widely
appreciated. 

''Steve isn't really a behavioral economist, but they'd be happy to have him,''
says Austan Goolsbee, who teaches economics at the University of Chicago's
Graduate School of Business. ''He's not really an old price-theory guy, but
these Chicago guys are happy to claim him. He's not really a Cambridge guy'' --
although Levitt went to Harvard and then M.I.T. -- ''but they'd love him to come
back.'' 

He has critics, to be sure. Daniel Hamermesh, a prominent labor economist at the
University of Texas, has taught Levitt's paper ''The Impact of Legalized
Abortion on Crime'' to his undergraduates. ''I've gone over this paper in draft,
in its printed version, at great length, and for the life of me I can't see
anything wrong with it,'' Hamermesh says. ''On the other hand, I don't believe a
word of it. And his stuff on sumo wrestlers -- well, this is not exactly
fundamental, unless you're Japanese and weigh 500 pounds.'' 

But at 36, Levitt is a full professor in the University of Chicago's economics
department, the most legendary program in the country. (He received tenure after
only two years.) He is an editor of The Journal of Political Economy, a leading
journal in the field. And the American Economic Association recently awarded him
its John Bates Clark Medal, given biennially to the country's best economist
under 40. 


He is a prolific and diverse writer. But his paper linking a rise in abortion to
a drop in crime has made more noise than the rest combined. Levitt and his
co-author, John Donohue of Stanford Law School, argued that as much as 50
percent of the huge drop in crime since the early 1990's can be traced to Roe v.
Wade. Their thinking goes like this: the women most likely to seek an abortion
-- poor, single, black or teenage mothers -- were the very women whose children,
if born, have been shown most likely to become criminals. But since those
children weren't born, crime began to decrease during the years they would have
entered their criminal prime. In conversation, Levitt reduces the theory to a
tidy syllogism: ''Unwantedness leads to high crime; abortion leads to less
unwantedness; abortion leads to less crime.'' 

Levitt had already published widely about crime and punishment. One paper he
wrote as a graduate student is still regularly cited. His question was
disarmingly simple: Do more police translate into less crime? The answer would
seem obvious -- yes -- but had never been proved: since the number of police
officers tends to rise along with the number of crimes, the effectiveness of the
police was tricky to measure. 

Levitt needed a mechanism that would unlink the crime rate from police hiring.
He found it within politics. He noticed that mayors and governors running for
re-election often hire more police officers. By measuring those police increases
against crime rates, he was able to determine that additional officers do indeed
bring down violent crime. 

That paper was later disputed -- another graduate student found a serious
mathematical mistake in it -- but Levitt's ingenuity was obvious. He began to be
acknowledged as a master of the simple, clever solution. He was the guy who, in
the slapstick scene, sees all the engineers futzing with a broken machine -- and
then realizes that no one has thought to plug it in. 

Arguing that the police help deter crime didn't make Levitt any enemies. Arguing
that abortion deterred crime was another matter. 

In the abortion paper, published in 2001, he and Donohue warned that their
findings should not be seen ''as either an endorsement of abortion or a call for
intervention by the state in the fertility decisions of women.'' They suggested
that crime might just as easily be curbed by ''providing better environments for
those children at greatest risk for future crime.'' 

Still, the very topic managed to offend nearly everyone. Conservatives were
enraged that abortion could be construed as a crime-fighting tool. Liberals were
aghast that poor and black women were singled out. Economists grumbled that
Levitt's methodology was not sound. A syllogism, after all, can be a magic
trick: All cats die; Socrates died; therefore Socrates was a cat. 

''I think he's enormously clever in so many areas, focusing very much on the
issue of reverse causality,'' says Ted Joyce, an economist at Baruch College who
has written a critical response to the abortion paper. ''But in this case I
think he ignored it, or didn't tend to it well enough.'' 

As the news media gorged on the abortion-crime story, Levitt came under direct
assault. He was called an ideologue (by conservatives and liberals alike), a
eugenicist, a racist and downright evil. 

In reality, he seems to be very much none of those. He has little taste for
politics and less for moralizing. He is genial, low-key and unflappable,
confident but not cocky. He is a respected teacher and colleague; he is a
sought-after collaborator who, because of the breadth of his curiosities, often
works with scholars outside his field -- another rarity for an economist. 

''I hesitate to use these words, but Steve is a con man, in the best sense,''
says Sudhir Venkatesh, a sociologist at Columbia University. ''He's the
Shakespearean jester. He'll make you believe his ideas were yours.'' Venkatesh
was Levitt's co-author on ''An Economic Analysis of a Drug-Selling Gang's
Finances,'' which found that the average street dealer lives with his mother
because the take-home pay is, frankly, terrible. The paper analyzed one crack
gang's financial activities as if it were any corporation. (It was Venkatesh who
procured the data, from a former gang member.) Such a thing had never been
tried. ''This lack of focus,'' Levitt deadpanned in one version of the paper,
''is perhaps partly attributable to the fact that few economists have been
involved in the study of gangs.'' 

Levitt speaks with a boyish lisp. His appearance is High Nerd: a plaid
button-down shirt, nondescript khakis and a braided belt, sensible shoes. His
pocket calendar is branded with the National Bureau of Economic Research logo.
''I wish he would get more than three haircuts a year,'' his wife, Jeannette,
says, ''and that he wasn't still wearing the same glasses he got 15 years ago,
which weren't even in fashion then.'' He was a good golfer in high school but
has so physically atrophied that he calls himself ''the weakest human being
alive'' and asks Jeannette to open jars around the house. 

There is nothing in his appearance or manner, in other words, that suggests a
flamethrower. He will tell you that all he does is sit at his desk, day and
night, wrestling with some strange mountain of data. He will tell you that he
would do it free (his salary is reportedly more than $200,000), and you tend to
believe him. He may be an accidental provocateur, but he is a provocateur
nonetheless. 

He takes particular delight in catching wrongdoers. In one paper, he devised a
set of algorithms that could identify teachers in the Chicago public-school
system who were cheating. ''Cheating classrooms will systematically differ from
other classrooms along a number of dimensions,'' he and his co-author, Brian
Jacob of the Kennedy School of Government, wrote in ''Catching Cheating
Teachers.'' ''For instance, students in cheating classrooms are likely to
experience unusually large test-score gains in the year of the cheating,
followed by unusually small gains or even declines in the following year when
the boost attributable to cheating disappears.'' 

Levitt used test-score data from the Chicago schools that had long been
available to other researchers. There were a number of ways, he realized, that a
teacher could cheat. If she were particularly brazen (and stupid), she might
give students the correct answers. Or, after the test, she might actually erase
students' wrong answers and fill in correct ones. A sophisticated cheater would
be careful to avoid conspicuous blocks of identical answers. But Levitt was more
sophisticated. ''The first step in analyzing suspicious strings is to estimate
the probability each child would give a particular answer on each question,'' he
wrote. ''This estimation is done using a multinomial logit framework with past
test scores, demographics and socioeconomic characteristics as explanatory
variables.'' 

So by measuring any number of factors -- the difficulty of a particular
question, the frequency with which students got hard questions right and easy
ones wrong, the degree to which certain answers were highly correlated in one
classroom -- Levitt identified which teachers he thought were cheating. (Perhaps
just as valuable, he was also able to identify the good teachers.) The Chicago
school system, rather than disputing Levitt's findings, invited him into the
schools for retesting. As a result, the cheaters were fired. 

Then there is his coming ''Understanding Why Crime Fell in the 1990's: Four
Factors That Explain the Decline and Seven That Do Not.'' The entire drop in
crime, Levitt says, was due to more police officers, more prisoners, the waning
crack epidemic and Roe v. Wade. 

One factor that probably didn't make a difference, he argues, was the innovative
policing strategy trumpeted in New York by Rudolph Giuliani and William Bratton. 

''I think,'' Levitt says, ''I'm pretty much alone in saying that.'' 

He comes from a Minneapolis family of high, if unusual, achievers. His father, a
medical researcher, is considered a leading authority on intestinal gas. (He
bills himself as ''The Man Who Gave Status to Flatus and Class to Gas.'') One of
Levitt's great uncles, Robert May, wrote ''Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer'' --
the book, that is; another great uncle, Johnny Marks, later wrote the song. 

At Harvard, Levitt wrote his senior thesis on thoroughbred breeding and
graduated summa cum laude. (He is still obsessed with horse racing. He says he
believes it is corrupt and has designed a betting system -- the details of which
he will not share -- to take advantage of the corruption.) He worked for two
years as a management consultant before enrolling at M.I.T. for a doctorate in
economics. The M.I.T. program was famous for its mathematical intensity. Levitt
had taken exactly one math course as an undergraduate and had forgotten even
that. During his first graduate class, he asked the student next to him about a
formula on the board: Is there any difference between the derivative sign that's
straight up-and-down and the curly one? ''You are in so much trouble,'' he was
told. 

''People wrote him off,'' recalls Austan Goolsbee, the Chicago economist who was
then a classmate. ''They'd say, 'That guy has no future.''' 

Levitt set his own course. Other grad students stayed up all night working on
problem sets, trying to make good grades. He stayed up researching and writing.
''My view was that the way you succeed in this profession is you write great
papers,'' he says. ''So I just started.'' 

Sometimes he would begin with a question. Sometimes it was a set of data that
caught his eye. He spent one entire summer typing into his computer the results
of years' worth of Congressional elections. (Today, with so much information so
easily available on the Internet, Levitt complains that he can't get his
students to input data at all.) All he had was a vague curiosity about why
incumbents were so often re-elected. 

Then he happened upon a political-science book whose authors claimed that money
wins elections, period. ''They were trying to explain election outcomes as a
function of campaign expenditures,'' he recalls, ''completely ignoring the fact
that contributors will only give money to challengers when they have a realistic
chance of winning, and incumbents only spend a lot when they have a chance of
losing. They convinced themselves this was the causal story even though it's so
obvious in retrospect that it's a spurious effect.'' 

Obvious, at least, to Levitt. Within five minutes, he had a vision of the paper
he would write. ''It came to me,'' he says, ''in full bloom.'' 

The problem was that his data couldn't tell him who was a good candidate and who
wasn't. It was therefore impossible to tease out the effect of the money. As
with the police/crime rate puzzle, he had to trick the data. 

Because he himself had typed in the data, he had noticed something: often, the
same two candidates faced each other multiple times. By analyzing the data from
only those elections, Levitt was able to find a true result. His conclusion:
campaign money has about one-tenth the impact as was commonly accepted. 

An unknown graduate student, he sent his paper to The Journal of Political
Economy -- one professor told him he was crazy for even trying -- where it was
published. He completed his Ph.D. in three years, but because of his priorities,
he says, he was ''invisible'' to the faculty, ''a real zero.'' Then he stumbled
upon what he now calls the turning point in his career. 

He had an interview for the Society of Fellows, the venerable intellectual
Harvard clubhouse that pays young scholars to do their own work, for three
years, with no commitments. Levitt felt he didn't stand a chance. For starters,
he didn't consider himself an intellectual. He would be interviewed over dinner
by the senior fellows, a collection of world-renowned philosophers, scientists
and historians. He worried he wouldn't have enough conversation for even the
first course. 

Instead, he was on fire. Whatever subject came up -- the brain, ants, philosophy
-- he just happened to remember something pithy he'd read. His wit crackled as
it had never crackled before. When he told them about the two summers he spent
betting the horses back in Minnesota, they ate it up! 


Finally -- disquietingly -- one of them said: ''I'm having a hard time seeing
the unifying theme of your work. Could you explain it?'' 

Levitt was stymied. He had no idea what his unifying theme was, or if he even
had one. 

Amartya Sen, the future Nobel-winning economist, jumped in and neatly summarized
what he saw as Levitt's theme. 

Yes, Levitt said eagerly, that's my theme. 

Another fellow then offered another theme. 

You're right, Levitt said, that's my theme. 

And so it went, like dogs tugging at a bone, until the philosopher Robert Nozick
interrupted. If Levitt could have been said to have an intellectual hero, it
would be Nozick. 

''How old are you, Steve?'' he asked. 

''Twenty-six.'' 


Nozick turned to the other fellows: ''He's 26 years old. Why does he need to
have a unifying theme? Maybe he's going to be one of those people who's so
talented he doesn't need one. He'll take a question and he'll just answer it,
and it'll be fine.'' 

The University of Chicago's economics department had a famous unifying theme --
the Gospel of Free Markets, with a conservative twist -- and would therefore not
have seemed the most likely fit for Levitt. As he sees it, Chicago is about
theory, deep thinking and big ideas, while he is about empiricism, clever
thinking and ''cute but ultimately insubstantial ideas.'' 

But Chicago also had Gary Becker. To Levitt, Becker is the most influential
economist of the past 50 years. Long before it was fashionable, Becker brought
microeconomic theory to offbeat topics, the family and crime in particular. For
years, Becker was demonized -- a single phrase like ''the price of children''
would set off untold alarms. ''I took a lot of heat over my career from people
who thought my work was silly or irrelevant or not economics,'' Becker says. But
Chicago supported him; he persevered, winning the Nobel Prize in 1992; and he
became Steven Levitt's role model. 

Becker told Levitt that Chicago would be a great environment for him. ''Not
everybody agrees with all your results,'' he said, ''but we agree what you're
doing is very interesting work, and we'll support you in that.'' 

Levitt soon found that the support at Chicago went beyond the scholarly. The
year after he was hired, his wife gave birth to their first child, Andrew. One
day, just after Andrew turned a year old, he came down with a slight fever. The
doctor diagnosed an ear infection. When he started vomiting the next morning,
his parents took him to the hospital. A few days later he was dead of
pneumococcal meningitis. 

Amid the shock and grief, Levitt had an undergraduate class that needed
teaching. It was Gary Becker -- a Nobel laureate nearing his 70th birthday --
who sat in for him. Another colleague, D. Gale Johnson, sent a condolence card
that Levitt still quotes from memory. 

Levitt and Johnson, an agricultural economist in his 80's, began speaking
regularly. Levitt learned that Johnson's daughter was one of the first Americans
to adopt a daughter from China. Soon the Levitts adopted a daughter of their
own, whom they named Amanda. In addition to Amanda, they have since had a
daughter, now almost 3, and a son. But Andrew's death has played on, in various
ways. They have become close friends with the family of the little girl to whom
they donated Andrew's liver. (They also donated his heart, but that baby died.)
And not surprisingly for a scholar who pursues real-life subjects, the death
also informed Levitt's work. 

He and Jeannette joined a support group for grieving parents. Levitt was struck
by how many children had drowned in swimming pools. They were the kinds of
deaths that don't make the newspaper -- unlike, for instance, a child who dies
while playing with a gun. 

Levitt was curious and went looking for numbers that would tell the story. He
wrote up the results as an op-ed article for The Chicago Sun-Times. It featured
the sort of plangent counterintuition for which he has become famous: ''If you
own a gun and have a swimming pool in the yard, the swimming pool is almost 100
times more likely to kill a child than the gun is.'' 

Trying to get his mind off death, Levitt took up a hobby: rehabbing and selling
old houses in Oak Park, where he lives. This experience has led to yet another
paper, about the real-estate market. It is his most Chicago-style paper yet, a
romp in price theory, a sign that the university's influence on him is perhaps
as strong as his influence on it. But Levitt being Levitt, it also deals with
corruption. 


While negotiating to buy old houses, he found that the seller's agent often
encouraged him, albeit cagily, to underbid. This seemed odd: didn't the agent
represent the seller's best interest? Then he thought more about the agent's
role. Like many other ''experts'' (auto mechanics and stockbrokers come to
mind), a real-estate agent is thought to know his field far better than a lay
person. A homeowner is encouraged to trust the agent's information. So if the
agent brings in a low offer and says it might just be the best the homeowner can
expect, the homeowner tends to believe him. But the key, Levitt determined, lay
in the fact that agents ''receive only a small share of the incremental profit
when a house sells for a higher value.'' Like a stockbroker churning commissions
or a bookie grabbing his vig, an agent was simply looking to make a deal, any
deal. So he would push homeowners to sell too fast and too cheap. 

Now if Levitt could only measure this effect. Once again, he found a clever
mechanism. Using data from more than 
50,000 home sales in Cook County, Ill., he compared the figures for homes owned
by real-estate agents with those for homes for which they acted only as agents.
The agents' homes stayed on the market about 10 days longer and sold for 2
percent more. 


Late on a summer afternoon, Levitt is in his office, deep inside one of the
university's Gothic behemoths. The ceiling is stained, the plaster around the
window crumbling. He is just back from sabbatical at Stanford, and his desk is a
holy mess: stacks of books and journals, a green sippy cup and a little orange
squeeze hippo. 

This is his afternoon to meet with students. Levitt drinks a Mountain Dew and
talks softly. Some students come for research assignments, some for advice. One
has just written her undergraduate thesis: ''The Labor Market Consequence of
Graduating College in a Bad Economy.'' For a thesis, Levitt tells her, it's very
good. But now she wants to have it published. 

''You write like a college student, and that's a problem,'' he says. ''The thing
is, you're telling a story. There's foreshadowing going on, all those tricks.
You want the reader going down a particular path so when they get the results,
they understand them and believe them. But you also want to be honest about your
weaknesses. People are much less harsh on weaknesses that are clear than
weaknesses that are hidden -- as they should be.'' 

Be honest about your weaknesses. Has there ever been a prize-winning scholar as
honest about his weaknesses as Steven Levitt? He doesn't understand economics,
he claims, or math. He's a little thinker in a world of big thinkers. He can't
even open a jar of spaghetti sauce at home, poor guy. 

Friends say that Levitt's self-deprecation is as calculated as it is genuine.
Within academia, economists take pride in being the most cutthroat of a
cutthroat breed. Anyone who writes papers on ''Weakest Link'' (contestants
discriminate against Latino and elderly peers, Levitt concluded, but not blacks
or women) and sumo (to best manage their tournament rankings, wrestlers often
conspire to throw matches) had better not also be arrogant. 

Or maybe it is not self-deprecation at all. Maybe it is self-flagellation. Maybe
what Steven Levitt really wants is to graduate from his ''silly'' and
''trivial'' and ''shallow'' topics. 

He thinks he's onto something with a new paper about black names. He wanted to
know if someone with a distinctly black name suffers an economic penalty. His
answer -- contrary to other recent research -- is no. But now he has a bigger
question: Is black culture a cause of racial inequality or

Well, you and Harvey N. are on the same footing

Carumba!  I recall one fifty step formal proof that

Were these statements formal?  I.e., p->q  etc.?

Well, perhaps the only reason (there is at least one) to 
oppose complete transparency---including that one's thoughts
are public---is courtesy and politeness.  These evolved
refinements are so far *crucial* for people getting along
(e.g., the slow realization on this list that Crocker's Rules
don't work out very well).  Complete transparency might be
extremely problematic.

But Samantha does not like the whole idea AT ALL:

Okay, so what do I care if they think our thoughts are dangerous
and pathological?  They can already sip at this list and get a
taste.  So what.  Remember: it's the ability to *do* something
to someone else that is dangerous.

Okay: I am sure that the more they learn about us (or, in the

the world learn about the West), the better.  Openness rules.

Yes point taken. Perhaps the philosophy will yet evolve
beyond such unfortunate minor 'toe shootings', perhaps
not.

But there is a reason for the version numbering, its to
indicate that the principles are not a matter of dogma
and that constructive criticism is welcome.

There is also a reason for branding and I am not speaking
on behalf of ExI now just stating my own opinion. Brands,
like flags, serve as rallying points around which likeminded
individuals may gather. When likeminded individuals wish
to influence policy and the lawmaking process that will
crystalise particular futures from a range of possible ones
it helps to have some set of principles around which to
gather. Branding is therefore not merely about novelty for
novelty sake it is about utility. Personally I would rather
explain the simple principle of extropy as opposed to that
of entropy (which is pretty widely understood) and point
that someone in the direction of this mailing list and the ExI
principles then to have to wrestle with that someones
perception and possible misunderstanding of a variety of
other viewpoints and philosophers that may or may not
have contributed to the principles that are espoused now.

A relatively new brand, like ExI, has the opportunity, at
least for a while, to manage and minimise the baggage it
carries. But against this minimisation of negative historic
associations there is the burden of establishing a recognition
of the brand in its own right.

I just don't know.  Robert Freitas has made documented
arguments on the advantages to sending probes rather
than radio signals.  [And when Robert F. talks I tend
to try and listen closely.]  I've thought about the
"broadcast" perspective -- you have to setup a very
large "grid" of parallel high power laser transmitters
then on the receiving side you need an even larger grid
of receiving telescopes.  And that is even to get some
small fraction of the information content of a system.

So whether one sends information densely packed into
a "probe" or whether one sends information via radio
(really silly), light, or UV I don't know -- I just
strongly suspect the amount that can be sent is very
very small relative to the amount available.

So my assertion would be that advanced stellar civilizations
are in effect "isolated".  Its kind of like being at a
party -- you can see virtually everyone as you gaze around
the room but you can't speak with any of them.

Yes, but you seem to be assuming that there are no technological
limits.  I've read a fair amount of literature on the physics of
computation, nanotechnology, etc. and there *are* limits.  (The
paper that Anders published in JET several years ago documents
a number of these.)

It currently looks to me like any reasonably advanced technological
civilization hits the limits so quickly (hundreds to thousands of
years) that anything after that doesn't really matter.

But *why* would you create Lee II when Lee II cannot significantly
benefit Lee I and Lee II (and Lee II's offspring) could potentially
be competing against you for resources when they start getting scarce
in the universe?

You have to create an "enslaved" Lee II that is permanently
loyal to Lee I which means that its usefullness is limited
because you have to limit its freedom to evolve.

Would Great Britian or Spain have allowed the colonization of
the U.S. if they could have anticipated the creation of a nation
that would defeat them in various wars?

> But you have not explained why creatures more advanced
> than we are could not be living right here.

Hmmm... I thought I had.  The local environment is inhospitable
to the creation of optimal computing structures (at least of
one type that I have envisioned).  You simply *cannot* do
it "here" without disassembling the galaxy.  Even if that
were feasible, in the universe, as it is currently structured,
it is much cheaper to simply leave a galaxy.

But I will grant completely that "aliens" in the form of a
distributed nanoscale intelligence could be living all around
us.  I would also likely grant other types of intelligences
living within our solar system unnoticed by us (e.g. Clarke's
obelisk, etc.).  But the only reasons I can come up with
for such efforts would be (a) entertainment value or (b)
regulation value (should we at some point present a threat
to the galactic club).

Energy, at this stage of the development of the Universe, is
*not* in short supply.  One can star-lift normal stars, harvest
brown dwarfs for hydrogen, graze on molecular clouds, etc.

What may be of more interest from a longer term perspective are
safety and security.  You are still thinking from a "natural"
evolution point of view -- i.e. "I have to replicate (copy)
myself".  You have not made the transition to the "directed"
evolution point of view -- i.e. "What is best for my long term
self-preservation and/or development?"  I believe that all
advanced civilizations will make that transition.

Robert

So where *does* it [quantum information] get

That is still unsolved. And unsolved is the other
question 'what happens to the other entangled particle 
when a particle of a singlet falls into a black hole'.
Quantoists and relativists are very different sects!

I believe Kardashev outlined *what* a level 2 civilization was, but
not precisely how detectable or undetectable they would be.  See:

If the lifetime of the transmission of broadcast signals is less than 100
years (we *are* moving to cable and directed broadcast by satellite and
will presumably get the "last mile" problem solved at some point), then
the broadcast "window" of civilizations may be very short-lived (it *is*
wasteful of energy resources).  If so then the probability that we could
detect any of them in our local neighborhood ("now") seems very small.

What if you were an extropian but not a materialist?

Consider Hegel's self-realization of the Absolute Notion as a the final 
perfection of personhood in its infinite form.

That is to say, if there's anything to like about extropian(ism) is 
that, inasmuch as it is philosophy, it is a pragmatism, not a 
materialism.  This whirling around the philosophical wheel doesn't get 
you anything but poor philosophy and eternity-less life.  The idea of 
an institute should be more likened to Salk's Institute or The City of 
Hope instead of some kind of odd cultish need to attach oneself to this 
or that old-saw of philosophy which tends to be more about alienation 
than forward-thinking anyway.

Best,

R

I don't agree the ends are so noble.  They may well be a simplistic extension 
of our current drives and understanding.    Since it is nearly inconceivable 
that we are the *only* planet with intelligent life in the entire universe, 
and since there are no apparent colonization efforts here,  we are left with 
the less impossible thing being that some/all existing posthuman 
civilizations do not have this goal and that either we are uninteresting, 
espensive to consume or protected from any posthuman civs that are that 
exansionistic.

Huh?  They already have more than sufficient ability to "do something to 
someone" and it is already used much to often and to deadly affect.   Would 
you really prefer that every infraction of every law that you are bound to 
commit just by being alive be duly recorded for the use of anyone at any time 
who wants to stop you and whatever works is yours dead in its tracks?  

We live in a time when it is obvious great irralitionality is matched up with 
great power over our lives and futures.   The only chance we have if we 
cannot stem the tide of irrationality to a large enough degree and cannot 
sufficiently defuse the power is to be able to be at least partially covert 
in plans and activities.    I don't see what is particularly difficult to 
comprehend about that.

See above.  It is not "what we have to hide" but what is not anyone's business 
but our own.  We do not have to justify private thoughts and private actions.  
Or are we so far down the totalitarian road that the desire to simply be left 
alone to one's own devices and voluntary assocations is now automatically 
suspicious and requiring public justification?

Let's see.  Today government attempts to shut down all "cloning".  Tomorrow 
they attempt to hamstring and make nearly illegal most types of nanotech and 
several varieties of AI.   Exactly what in the current shape of the world 
makes you believe such things are impossible or even unlikely?  With perfect 
oversight of all our activities and associations there is no way any of us 
will be able to proceed on such lines.    There is certainly no way we will 
be able to be covert long enough to successfully oppose or escape a society 
gone this mad.   End of story, very sad.

I think I saw people on this list affected by terrorism. I think 
I saw rational intelligent people retreat in the face of hard 
choices to polemic positions that I would have thought and 
hoped that they would not do. 

I saw it become nearly impossible to have a discourse on
foreign policy, international law or the lack of it and the 
state of its emergence as poeple for the most part 
*seemed* to retreat to emotional prejudices.

This is a good stock taking question. 

Ten and twenty years ago I was 26 and 16 respectively.
I then knew considerably less than I know now but had
more time than I have now to learn and to try and find ways
to as Voltaire said cultivate our garden, using humanism or
variants of it as an applied philosophy.

I think my level of personal optimism peaked around 
1999/2000 when Dolly was cloned, the human genome
was racing along, Thomson and Gearheart had isolated 
human embryonic stem cells. I was aware that books
like Damien Brodericks Last Mortal generation were
seeping into the social and cultural groundwater and 
I was discovering to my delight the power of the internet
and the range of kindred spirits or thinkers of likemind
exploring such issues as cryonics, uploading, biotechnology,
ethics etc. It seemed then that the world had grown up
and the time and opportunity for serious change had never
been better.

Then Bush won the presidency and put embryonic stem
cell research (which we need for basic understanding of life)
in concrete and did his best to sink it. Bush then went on to
attack that weak emerging thing that was international law, 
not because in my view he is an evil man, but because in my
view he is an idiot elected by a complacent electorate that
took its eye off the ball and forgot that great damage could
be done to a great country by putting so much power in the
hands of such a nitwit.

In short Bush was never capable of competently flying the 
plane that is the United States of America. I think he has
through incompetence rather than malice sold the US best
interests down the river. He has planted the seeds of
terrorism at the same time as he professed to be trying to
crack down on it.

I have also learned how little we actually know. The human
genome project is important and empowering stuff. But we
are only just beginning to get that it is not genomics but
epigenomics that matters and epigenomics is to a substantial
degree hamstrung by policies that make it incredibly difficult
to conduct the sort of basic research that is needed to
understand human embryology.

On the patents front, biotech has raced into a quagmire from
which it will no doubt emerge but not before considerable
time and effort is wasted getting policies straight that in my
naivety I would have hoped could have been straighten out 
much more quickly.

I have learned somewhat saddly that things take far longer 
than I imagined that they would need to and that the reason 
that this is so is that we are far less wise in the areas that 
matter than we often give ourselves credit for. 

I have also learnt that we know far less about the human 
nervous system that I thought that we did and that as a 
consequence progress on the cybernetics front, on AI 
and on uploading and the plausibility of cryonics is likely
to take longer than I would have hoped.

Perhaps for me one of the biggest disappointments was
that politicians like Bush and Blair and Howard could 
bullshit so categorically to their own electorates and the
own electorates for the most part would swallow
without chewing. There was plenty of opportunity before
hand for smarter constituents to hold their elected leaders
to account and yet they failed to do so. I feel like I have
witnessed first hand vast numbers of intelligent people
buy a line of BS that is little more sophisticated that that
peddled in such Hollywood movies as "Wag the dog" 
and then even when as was the case with Australian Prime
Minister Howard people came to the view that they had 
been either intentionally mislead (around 37%) or un-
intentionally mislead (around a third -by Howard doing 
to little thinking and too much believing) these same
constituents thought so little of the crock that was 
perpetrated in a so called representative democracy that
they said they'd probably go ahead and vote for him
again anyway. 

I am not a religious person, but on the matter of the
Iraq war, it is my feeling that the quality of debate and 
the lack of critical thinking that prevailed even in circles
where I though critical thinking was estemed, was of 
such a low standard that I began to wonder if this generation
was too stupid to deserve to be the last mortal generation.

In 10 years. We will I hope have substantially increased 
our understanding of human developmental processses, 
of epigenetics, and we will be able (if we are very lucky 
or far more politically astute) to produce far better maps
of the human neural system which in turn will prompt better
research and development in cybernetics make cryonics
and uploading considertably lesser leaps of faith than 
they are now. In 10 years Bush will be gone but will the
damage he did the UN and the cause of international
law have been undone? I don't know. I doubt it.

In 10 years the issues of intellectual property will have
largely been sorted out. The public policy aspects are
not that complicated. It should be able to reconfigure
systems such that in order to have flow through benefits
of technologies to end users it is not necessary to negotiate
 with a myriad of stake holder all of whom can bog down
the process and set themselves up as toll gate holders on
the road to progress.

In 10 years we will be seeing whether through ham fisted
idiotic approaches to foreign policy the Bush government
may have freed the US from having to play nice with such
regimes as the Saudis.

And in 10 years an entire new batch of medicines will have
made their way through clinical trials and be available on 
the market.

Important questions such as what is the nature and moral 
weighting of  a person will still be being discussed but they
will be being discussed by nearly everyone. That much, that
that conversation *will* take place stands as an achievement
of note. And the Kass's and the Fukayamas will find 
themselves arguing increasingly bizaree esoteric points with a
new generation of thinkers who will have come to maturity 
in a world where the inevitability of death or at least the
possibility of radically extended life will not have been radical
but will have been common place. And this new generalition
will, I suspect eat the specious deathist arguments of such
crusty old farts as Kass for breakfast. 

Self interest and clear thinking will, baring some major 
policy fuck ups of Bushesque proportions (and he only 
gets one more go at the presidency at worst) bring this
new generation of thinkers hard onto the fallacies and 
specious arguments of Kass etc.

Ironically, the last few years, especially the experience of 
watching societies reaction to their elected leaders statements
around the Iraq war has left me with a sense that is heavily
reminiscent of the bible story of the Israelites in the desert.
They were too jaded to get to see the promised land
themselves. But their children born in the desert and having 
never known the constraints of slavery were able to push
forward and conquer the promised land. I suspect it may
be so with us. I hope it is not so. I still hope that we may
lift our game.

I hope this generation, my generation, can lift its game, 
because currently we are getting the cruddly leadership
(Bush, Blair, Howard) that we deserve.

And I think we are in serious danger of 'believing' 
ourselves uncritically to death.

I remember similar discussion a couple of yeras ago among German
transhumanists how to translate the extropy related terms. "Extropismus"
would indeed be a possible solution, but I believe almost every native
German speaker would feel that this sounds a bit indecent or at least
ridiculous, since the stress is not on "ex" but on the syllable "pis" and
this does not sound soft but rather like "piss".

I guess, back then we agreed on

extropian = Extropianer
extropian principles = extropische Grundsätze
extropianism = Extropianismus

So, what is the "old name"? It certainly isn't materialism, and I doubt 
it would make sense to say that we are Fourierians or Mirandolans. 

I think you obsess too much about the label of the ideas. I care far 
more about where we are taking the ideas and how they might be 
developed; the spread of the ideas of the transhumanist stream does not 
primarily hinge on what we call the stream.

But what about the transhumanists who are not materialists (like my
friend the christian transhumanist), or do not find immortalism to be
the key point (like Freeman Dyson)? Hedonist materialism sounds fun and 
has its strong adherents like Dave Pearce, but not all transhumanists 
are hedonists to the same extent. I think you will find that any label 
you care to set up will not cover the range of thought among the stream 
of thought, so why not make one up to cover it? Or define transhumanism 
as a particular form of humanism.

Huh? Why should one become an immortalist by understanding matter. 
Epicuros was the quintessential (hedonic) materialist, but he was not an 
immortalist by any stretch.

Unfortunately, I don't have time to read all these posts. We all have our
positions on the old FP. It's hard to get around the nanoprobe absence and
the probability that we are only about a sixth of the way towards the big
ceiling up there (spiking up).

I doubt Bill's assertion about sitting on the porch for amortal sentients,
self-evolving or otherwise. Dancing on the porch, hey. Porch one day,
lookout tower the next, as well.

Personally, I think in two dozen years the Earth will be at the local centre
of a civilization that has instantaneous travel to any open section anywhere
in our universe, and aliens will be cruising around here and there (they're
certainly not doing it right now). Nothing currently scientific about such
assertions of course, although for me they flow from the Fermi stuff.

Still, in principle such instanteous travel for those who like to get places
quickly would be the best possible concept, just as controlled statis or
extropy are great options. (As opposed to say time travel, which in
principle is not great where it results in non-consensually altered
neurological systems.)

I agree. From an historical and interpretative point of view, it is
necessary to gather data on non-combatants killed violently including
through deliberative deprivation of resources (e.g. the kulaks etc. starved
in the Ukraine during the Soviet era) and ANY civilians killed in warfare
including by the West (e.g. in firestorms or by napalm). There are websites
such as http://www.genocidewatch.org/genocidetable.htm
for detailed information on numbers at present. Places like Sudan and the DR
of Congo have and are experiencing mixtures of war and genocide.

It might contribute, but there are other factors too: lack of education,
a less information dense society, communications problems (when you
cannot communicate swiftly and exactly, the other part seems stupid) and
the wrong context. The last part is important: people show a great deal
of intelligence and ability in their native context, but get rather
"stupid" in an unfamiliar context where they cannot rely as much on
their learned world knowledge. 

Improving maternal diet is a good thing in general, and if we also
figure out what aspects of it produce the best results on the child we
might be able to do a lot of low-tech enhancement in a very acceptable
way. The gain in human intelligence and eventual ability of a good
maternal feeding program might be far greater than many adult
intelligence enhancement programs.

In Swedish we say "extropian" (pronounced like "indian"), which works
but sounds like a weird native group somewhere (the unusual rites of the
extropian tribes of the California archipelago? :-).  Extropianism is
also identical, but feels rahter heavy. The extropian principles becomes
"de extropiska principerna". Transhumanism also works as a direct
borrowing. 

The real problem has always been what to translate "transhuman" into. 
"Transmänniska" sounds very much like a transexual, "mermänniska" is a
rather literal overman and has the same vibes. Some use the term
transhuman, but it does not work well. Posthuman is usually said as
"postmänniska" and works, although it does give the feeling that they
work for the postal office.

Well said Brett.  In the business world, branding is so understood that it 
seems philistine to question the reasons for branding.  The fact that 
extropy is the opposite of entropy is the key to ExI.

I believe that Leonid Gavrilov speculated in a recent JAAM article
that some of the extension in longevity we are observing may be
due to better maternal nutrition and/or nutrition during early
development.  It makes sense if one postulates that it may lead
to an increase in the pool of available stem cells that one
can utilize later in life.

So there may be both intelligence and longevity gains from better
nutrition.

As pointed out in my recent post to the Fermi Paradox
thread "aliens" might have to leave galaxies to get
the greatest computational efficiency.

Recent analysis of where the dark matter is would seem
to support this.

You're forgetting that Lee doesn't care about benefit to Lee I
in particular, but about benefit to all the instances of Lee
collectively.  That is, creating Lee II is a way to get more
run time for Lee I.

I don't happen to agree with that, but losing track of what's
been said before is exceptionally unproductive in these threads.

If they had started with the assumption that GB or Spain would
eventually be defeated by *someone*, they might very well have
chosen to deliberately create the next set of winners.  You can't
prevent North America (or the intergalactic space) from being
colonized, but you can try to choose what sort do the colonization.

[Having had the benefit of your comments I thought
I take another look at this thread in light of some of
the claims Warwick makes in his book ]

Alex, Warwick did a simpler experiment in 1998 where
all he did do was implant a small transmitter in his arm
(without connecting it any way to the median nerve) and
walk about with it, activating appliances in a computerised
house, almost, as you aptly put it, as though it was in his
pocket. Yet, in this book written in August 2002, he does
actually get an electrode array surgically implanted into 
the medial nerve of his left wrist for three months. I wonder
if it is possible that you have heard of the earlier work and
are mixing it up with the later 2002 experiment? Certainly
Warwick is claiming he achieved direct interfacing (albeit
in a limited way) with this set of 2002 experiments.

"A micro electrode array consisting of 100 individual 
electrodes (only 20 of which were active due to manu-
facturer delivery time constraints) was implanted in the
median nerve (lower left arm above the wrist). The radius
of each electrode tip was 1-3 mm, the active region being
50-80mm long."

"The technique (provided) selective recording and
stimulation of sensory and/or motor neurons within the 
nerve fascicles."

"The main difference between the 1998 implant and the
new experiment was the connection that would be made
with the nervous system, ... using the Utah array. The
main body of  the implant (was) a radio transmitter/
receiver (used) to send signals from (his) nervous system
by radio to the computer and to receive signals sent, 
again by radio, from the computer and play them on 
(his) nervous system via the median nerve in his arm."
 
Amongst the achievements that Warwick would claim
in the 2002 experiments would be the following:

In a first set of experiments in April 2002 Warwick 
showed how signals from his brain could be used to 
control robots, operate in a limited way an articulated
robotic hand, and to manipulate the local environment
(the network in the cybernetics building). 

In a second set of experiments Warwick controlled the
robot hand via moving his fingers and sending a neural 
signal to a computer then across the Atlantic, via the 
internet. He verified that he could receive a signal back
to his nervous system (a small shock to his median nerve
closing his left index finger) over the internet and 
demonstrated a sort of bat like extra sense. To do this
he wore an ultrasonic hat with sender and receiver
antenna both wired from a wearable hat into his median
nerve via the array such that he could judge the proximity
of approaching or retreating objects with his eyes closed.

Warwick argues these are true cyborg powers because
sensing over the internet and having a sonar sense like
a crude form of bat sonar is above and beyond the senses
of normal humans.

Warwick also managed to drive a wheelchair using the
signals sent from his median nerve when he opened and
closed his hand and managed to set up a crude sort
of Morse code whereby he and his partner (that had a
single electrode implanted) could send each other simple
messages (essentially something or nothing - so a kind
of Morse code).  This for Warwick was *the* very big
deal as he saw it as the first direct nervous system to
nervous system communication. Albeit in a simple form.

All good points and Warwick would agree with these
too.

[Mez continues:]

Here I think I must disagree. Whilst Warwicks successes
are mainly proof in principle they do imo achieve successes
*as* proofs in principle. That Warwick was able to get his 
experimental protocols through ethics committees and get
his finding on the record should make it substantially easier
for others to do follow up research.  Warwicks research 
shows that given a sufficiently detailed understanding of the
nervous system (which we are seriously lacking because its
so hard to get permission to do the experiments) it would be 
possible to give amputees "bridges" over damaged nerves 
and to get direct nervous system control over wheelchairs 
etc. He also puts on the record that the brain can quickly 
adopt and accommodate new sensory input without any
apparent side effects over a three month period.

By doing what he did scientifically, in the way he did it, as
a self promoting publicity machine Warwick pushed the
peanut forward substantially in my view. He deliberately
courted the media and managed to make his relationship
with them a symbiotic one. In this I think his story, like the
story of Michael West in Merchant's of Immortality is 
a story worth aspiring extropic entrepreneurs taking on
board.

To Warwicks credit he does not minimise the seriousness
of artificial limbs, cochlea implants etc or the utility of 
wearables. All these things are seen as good. He is however
interested in improving the functionality and range of such
artificial limbs and he is not averse, indeed he savours the
idea of not just replacing what is lost of normal human 
function but positively adding too human capabilities as 
a matter of choice.

and cybernetics:]

>From a number of standpoints the precise definition of cyborg
may be arbitrary. Warwick sees some merit in preserving the
term not for wearables (though he doesn't diminish their importance)
but for "something that is part-animal, part-machine and whose
capabilities are extended *beyond* normal limits. This is much
more general than other definitions and includes creatures other 
than humans. It allows for mental upgrades as well as physical
upgrades and allows the extension to go beyond the normal
limits of either the animal or the machine." Warwick distinguishes
wearables as part of a "cybernetic system".

Steve Mann certainly gets a favourable plug in the book. 

My interest Samantha was to try and find out what sorts of
products and what the state of the art (or near state of the
art) in cyborg or cyborg-like technologies was. On the whole
I think the book gives a pretty good summary in retrospect.

I agree that from a practical point of view, at least in the
short term there is a lot to be said for being able to put on
and take off  clothing having the sort of extra capabilities
that one might have as a cyborg. However what intrigued me 
about the book was the argument that eventually the forms of 
interpersonal communication people use with each other
will come to seem hopelessly inadequate in comparison
with the sort of tech enable telepathy that may become
available. I was also on the lookout for work that might
indicate to me how much is actually able to be done in
terms of cutting into the bodies of volunteers who want
to experiment in an informed way with memory enhancements
and uploads in the future. What struck me was that we
actually know so little not just about the brain but about
the nervous system generally, and that this is a logical 
consequence of our aversion to do research on living 
humans (including volunteers and ourselves).

[ Samantha again:]

> Manfred Clynes described the need for humans to
> artificially enhance biological functions in order to

This theme of the need to become cyborgs, to join
with the machines or be displaced by them is an 
underlying one throughout the book. Warwick like
Moravec sees humans qua humans eventually becoming
a subspecies.
---------

Thanks for the thoughts folks. In hindsight I reckon the
book is a reasonably good read but as I said originally
it is like looking over the shoulder of a researcher and 
I imagine a ghost writer or several editors had to do a
lot of work to turn Warwicks notes into a readable
but not very indexed book.

Removing one's attachments to the present does not in any way signify
either a hater of the body and flesh or in any way alienation from
their bodies. Instead, we simply seek to make our bodies more useful,
more capable, so that future people will NOT reach a conclusion that
their bodies are a detriment to progress. Remaining satisfied with a
body with proven physical limits, limits which impede our ability to
function in the real world of today, not to mention tomorrow, is a
romanticist/mystical fantasy that idealizes the past over the present
or the future. Insisting that others remain unimproved is an imposition
of corporeal fascism upon the body of the individual, a very ultimate
sort of totalitarianism that recognises no limits on the ability of the
community to impose it's will on the individual, even into the mind and
body. It is luddism at its worst.

Not!  As I said a Extro 3 to survive over the long term one
needs a "distributed replicated intelligence" -- *BUT*
"distribution" of ones intelligence across a solar system
sized object (a Matrioshka Brain) does a pretty good job of this
(asteroids, commets, small black holes become "minor" concerns).

But distributing ones intelligence across light years makes it
essentially "impossible" for Lee to function as a connected
intelligence.  So you seem to be suggesting that "Lee" is
a socialist or a communist and that he is colonizing for the
"good" of the very loosely connected collective.

No, the point I have been trying to make (it seems like over
and over again) is that Lee II *cannot* provide any "return
on investment" to Lee I.  The only reason that Lee I would
create Lee II is out of some desire to propagate and Lee I
would know that propagation eventually has negative consequences.

Perhaps.  Most people do not act out of a desire to produce their
replacements.  Sure you can have evolutionary drives but
any advanced civilization will have regulated those drives
(witness the declining populations in Japan and Europe).
Now one might produce "offspring" if it were clear that they
were not going to compete with you (i.e. the children of
advanced civilizations exit from the galaxy due to the
temperature and thermodynamics reasons I have suggested).

Bill Frantz, who used to work at my company, once
famously quipped, "never underestimate the bandwidth
of a 747 loaded with mag tape".  Yes, I can understand
that when you send matter, you send a hell of a lot of
bits.  Is this what is meant?

All right.  Well, I think that my argument works
either way.  No one will move.  One may send a lot
of data (including algorithms/programs) either
physically or by transmission.  Some of this data
may constitute part of the identity of the sender.
No one will move because---as you imply---no one

So you are suggesting that intra-galactic civilizations quickly
reach limits, and inter-galactic civilizations quickly reach limits,
it's just that the latter are more advanced than the former.

(My own intuitions have not caught up to this: it still seems to
me that lots of good old fashioned atoms, e.g., the kind you find
inside galaxies in droves, are very handy for computation.)

Well, IMO those resources are going to be used by *somebody*.
If it's not a Lee II then it will be a Robert II, or, shudder,
a Samantha II.  I anticipate that I'll probably get along
better with Lee II's than with future versions of other people,
or, more seriously, future versions of ambitious *aliens*.

Enslavement at such a remove is either ridiculous or impossible.

Actually, in hindsight, the creation of a country in North
America quite similar culturally to England was a very wise
move.  The Americans rescued English bacon from the 1700's
through the present.  (Okay, there was a minor tiff in 1812.)
France and Germany can well regret that they were not active
in the colonization business, and Sweden can only lament that
they did not build a great and powerful Swedish colony all
thoughout North America as they could easily have done in
the 1600s. Then the world would probably be speaking Swedish.

Ha! Classic mis-communication.  I mean to assert only that *we*
presently have not reached any maximum.  M-brains or Jupiter
brains, as you uniquely well know, could be vastly vastly VASTLY
more intelligent than we are.  I do not see any reason why this
local region of space won't host such creatures in 3000 A.D.

I think that I have appreciated how evolution will become
self-directed.  Logically, there is (1) safety in numbers, (2)
safety in high rates of reproduction.  This definitely
includes directed evolution.  If singularity-type structures
(or even M-brains) get going in the solar system, they'll
definitely want to send spoors to nearby stars---or some of
them will (and, I repeat, it only takes one).  As millions
of spoors take off from here and from other nearby stars, 
evolution kicks in and those that replicate best and at
the most advanced level predominate.  It's all Darwinian.

Frankly, a little objective research changes lots of minds from your
side of the pond.

That was not my conclusion. My conclusion was that the very REAL
threats and risks of terrorism (and the damage it does, counting in the
thousands of lives and many hundreds of billions of dollars) are a
better insurance for the ruling parties to retain leadership than the
Soviet Union ever was. Who wants to risk voting in some unknown freaky
third party candidate when we have a 'war' to run?

So there is a vested interest in maintaining the sort of conditions
that give rise to anti-US organizations of militant or non-militant
bent, just as the anti-Catholic groups in northern Ireland have a
vested interest in maintaining repression of Catholics that help
recruiting for the IRA, the anti-nuke groups have a vested interest in
fighting against resolution of the nuclear waste issue via either
breeder reactors or long term storage facilities, etc.

Similarly, many other nations ruling parties have a vested interest in
using an anti-US position and anti-US propaganda to maintain their own
grips on power.

Zero-sum games are not yet obsolete, despite the claims of many on this
list. While they don't work well in economics, they are quite fine in
politics, where you can't quantify things so well, so it's much easier
to smoke over an issue with lies and deflection.

I cannot agree with this statement as a generalisation, as
there are some classes of pre-emptive action made on 
the basis of genuinely held, earnestly reasoned (note I 
am not touching *belief* here) views that would require
action in my view. Indeed sometimes there would be
a moral impetus towards action (even pre-emptive 
action). We cannot *know* for certain the actions of
others and we cannot always prudently wait for them
to do their worst before we respond. In the end it is
to our own judgement of the total risks that we must
hold true and then on that judgement we must act 
(including in *some* cases pre-emptively).

First the status of morality and the rationality of ethics is
pretty widely regarded at least so far as I am aware in 
philosophical circles as being almost a matter of opinion.
(eg. Bertrand Russell. History of Western Philosophy).

I find this conclusion powerful, dangerous and deeply 
unsatisfying so I am keen to have at it. Let's be clear I may
fail but if I'm going down like Don Quixote, then I'm going
down "having at" one of the larger uglier philosophical 
windmills. 

Ok. Now here's my point. Unless a moral code can
arise form a set of universals such as a propensity to
reason and a predispositon to sociability then there is
not likely to be much genuine agreement between 
subjective individuals on moral codes. Further those
who do not know endeavour to understand themselves,
what manner of creature they are, are not going to be
in a position to know what the most optimal compromises
for them are when compromises need to be made. A person
that deludes themselves that they are a different sort of 
creature with different sets of drivers and needs than they
actually have is precluded from sitting down at table
to negotiate for their own best interests because they do
not know their own best interests. A person that deludes
themselves willingly can hardly be a person that others
would want to engage in a moral compacts with. 

Within the context of the time available I think individuals
ought to use pan critical rationalism in their approach to
understanding their own nature and then pursuing the
optimal outcome for them in accordance with their nature.
This optimal outcome will necessarily involve compromise
because others whose cooperation is needed will not if they
are enlightened and empowered (and likely to be good 
allies as a consequence) strike bad bargains.

I reckon to the extent one is self deluded one will be screwed
at the negotiating table because perceptive others will recognize
you as having a lower sentience quotient and the only one to
blame for this if you are self deluding will be yourself.

Of course you do. A person that you know was intending
to steal from you yesterday but did not for lack of an 
opportunity is likely to be filed as such and regarded as
such. If not you'd be suckered far more often than the 
norm.

They certainly are that. And a persons future actions, their
motives, their reputation are surely part of practical moral
deliberations on your part.

I am trying to establish the validity of the statement to 
thine ownself be true. You, I think, are trying to make me
make the case or to refute it.  I am not interested in a simple
moral system I am interested in a rational, teachable and 
extensible one. If I can teach a moral system that has high 
utility to those I teach it too, like teaching the principle of tit 
for tat, then I can be confident that the world will be that
much more pleasant and predictable for me as a result.

In almost all negotiations, and most moral matters between
persons involve a quid quo pro, the best possible outcome
for the individuals involved depends on them recognizing the
best possible outcome for them (without their being deluded
as to what they want or need) and then most closely
approximating it.

Absolutely not. That is pure fantasy land. The best we can
hope to achieve is a reasonable compromise where all sit
down in good faith and recognizing that all are compromising
but all are gaining in the aggregate all act in accordance with
the agreement.

I wouldn't limit one's self understanding and ones understanding
of ones needs and desires to the mere physical. I think there
are social needs in most people that are very deep seeded
and go beyond the need for physical contact.

I am not sure what your point is here. Sociopaths are also
good readers of patterns. They just don't empathise. But
I would argue that sociopathy is dysfunction. And real
sociopaths would possible grin at me and say who needs
that sentimental bullshit anyway. And I'd say you do here's
why ..etc.

Sure but there is a baseline. The human infant is born in a 
state whereby it cannot support the weight of its own head. 
Humans are designed (selected by evolution) from the outset
to be social. The big brain that is useful later would otherwise
by a lethal liability shortly after birth.

Only after some initial basic social assistance has been rendered.

Many infants get suboptimal social assistance and the outcomes
are often dysfunctional people. But they are not dysfunctional 
by choice.

Belief has nothing to do with it. I have learned and observed human
infants I know that physiologically they cannot survive without 
assistance - that they wish to survive - that they suckle if they can
and cry if they can't is not a matter of mere belief.  

> But not all.

Not all to the same degree. But there is no person alive at
present (to the best of my knowledge) with the power to stay 
alive without cooperating with others. It is not necessary that
social be about niceness it is better, more funcitonal, if it is
about an enlightened understanding of frailty and the benefits
of cooperation. I would argue that tyrants that aim for the short
glorious life of Archilles in 2003 are short changing themselves.
They are sub-optimally selfish. With a tweak of their value
systems they may be able to satisfy more of their needs and
desires by cooperating. But many of them would have to 
re-learn and I'd expect few of them to change what has worked
for them if they could not be presented with a compelling
argument. If there is no compelling argument that can be made
to their self interest then I would say that no real moral argument
is being put to them at all.

That is exactly right. In the end the individual must decide moral
policy for themselves. The intelligent individual will take into
account existing social mores and laws but in the end they will not
shirk the responsibility of the moral decision. They cannot. To
shirk is the allow defaults to go into play.

No my moral code would tell me if this person is reasonable
I can point out that their aspiration to munch on my spleen
is well recognized by me and that that is not a circumstance
that I can permit to prevail. Either we reason out a conclusion
together or we fight to the death now. I then invite them to 
do their calculations of cooperation vs competition and 
consider how the agreement if it is to be cooperation will be
effectively honored. If at any stage I feel that my appeals to
their reasoning is hopeless then I fall back on trying to kill
them before they kill me.

Yes. According to a system I'm offering up for consideration
because I think there is some consistency and utility in it
and because if I am right and it is teachable I will benefit
by shifting the cooperate compete decision more towards
cooperation (just as if I had taught the principle of tit for tat).

Depends what you mean by belief. Belief is a problem word
for me because a lot of people who are doing more than
mere believing use the word belief to indicate a sort of less
than certain knowledge. The problem is that some people that
use the word belief may have done no personal processing
on the issue at hand at all but may have simply adopted 
wholesale something that they were indoctrinated with. 

If you are implying that my proposed moral system is flawed
or inconsistent or unclear then, yes, I am willing to accept that
that could be in fact a valid criticism but I'd ask you to point
out where because as I've said trying to find means of 
increasing cooperation and putting morality and ethics on a 
more rational footing is a worthwhile task.

Many use it like this. I don't like it because I spend a lot
of time considering the politics of language and communication.

I think that if an extrope is debating with a flat earther in front
of an open minded audience and the audience is only partly
paying attention and they hear the extrope talking of beliefs
on the one hand and the flat earther talking of beliefs on the
other the audience may be seduced into thinking one belief may
be just as good as the other. I think it is in our interests to 
get some probability and quantifiability into the discussion. Belief
is language which serves the preservation of the status quo.

My point is that when you speak in a political forum you do
your own thought process which is based on considerably 
more than mere indoctrination by another (I hope) a disservice
when you use the word belief instead of another word. (This
is because not everyone who hears you use the word belief
knows that you will have done more processing. It seems to
me that many extropes fail to realise that the audience, the rest
of the world doesn't give away free credibility points for one
wacky belief over another.

Yes, but again I'd go back to pan critical rationalism.

Without ever getting absolute certainty there are techniques
which we can learn which give us a much higher probability
of getting a correct (a useful) answer.

As indeed in practice most of us have. If I am right and a 
better more universal ethical system can be derived I would
expect that in most peoples cases there would be very little
observable differences in how they'd behave. But then on the
other hand when one starts to routinely reason as oppose
to believing one is in a position to converse mind to mind
with other reasoning beings. Beliefs can very easily become
entrenched positions. I think to reason when reason is 
available is more social and because I think humans are
social (their interests are best served by cooperation) to 
reason is moral to believe is not.

Nor do I. I consider gun ownership to be a decisive litmus test of any
political jurisdiction's dedication to individual liberty and trust of
the individual. Either you trust your fellow citizen with the power of
life and death or you don't. If you do trust them, then you trust them
with all other sorts of political rights. If you don't, then you don't
really trust your fellow man, do you? All the other "rights" are really
priviledges that may be disallowed based on future events or
prejudices, simply because if the state is the only entity with
weapons, then it can impose whatever it wants on its serfs, er, I mean
"citizens".

Trust IS the defining aspect of my worldview, and that of a number of
other extropians. I trust those that trust me. I don't trust those that
don't trust me. I therefore separate the world into two types of
people, groups, and governments: those that trust me and those that do
not. Those that do not trust me are enemies, opponents, adversaries who
I am implacably against, or else ininformed, uneducated, ignorant
innocents who may become informed, educated, and aware allies of mine.

As it happens, I live in a very safe place today. New Hampshire has one
of the lowest crime rates in the entire world, and the lowest in the
entire US. It also has one of the highest rates of gun ownership, if
not the highest rate in the world, and is one of the freest in allowing
its citizens to carry and use their firearms.

I know that the reason NH enjoys the former situation is specifically
because it guarantees the latter situation. 

ANY society has a choice to make with its laws: either impose a police
state, or allow the citizens to police themselves to some greater or
lesser degree. It has been conclusively demonstrated that the more
citizens can police themselves, via CCW laws or other mechanisms, the
lower crime rates are (not just violent crime).

While there are many other nations besides the US that have lower
violent crime rates (nor is the US homogenous legally, most crime here
is in low-trust areas) such nations typically enjoy a far greater
degree of ethnic homogeneity. None of these nations, however, has a
lower property crime rate than the US. Instead, many prosecute property
owners for defending themselves and their property against criminals.

European nations do not allow the populace to police itself. Weapons
ownership is banned or highly restricted, and yet there is much illegal
weapons based crime. Individuals are restricted from protecting their
property, consequently property crime is generally five times higher
than in the US.

An individual person in the world today is at far greater risk of being
victimized by crime, and more likely property crime, than terrorism.
For this reason, I feel safe today, here in NH.

Here in New Hampshire, both our violent AND property crime rates are
lower than any european nation. I feel very safe here.

Why do you think you have a 2nd Amendment right? Because it is to
provide you with a defense, last ditch, against loss of civil
liberties, big government, etc.

You can defend yourself against these threats, but only if you are
actually willing to do so. Many people lack the frame of mind necessary
to self defense, especially against abstract threats. The bad guys
don't need to be shooting at you to have already initiated force
against you. When the opposition outlaws your existence, they have
loosed the dogs of war, for they have authorized the use of the state
police apparatus to use force against you. The only rational response
to such an initiation of force is to respond with force.

Mike,
       The post that you were referring to did seem more confusing than 
usual.  But, I think he is saying that he has the right to switch to his private 
theory of law and disregard the long standing procedures that you quoted because 
his theory positions him to criticize what ever our country and our

       On the other hand if existing law is accepted his criticism is 
groundless.
       Past that he seems to have a tendency to adopt what I call "the rabbit

that in the end he leads you down every rabbit trail in the briar patch,

By "collectively", I meant "summed over all entities with Leeness".
Note that I'm sure that Lee can defend his own point of view better
than I can, and I only mentioned it as an example of how these
discussions seem to go off track. :)  It appears that I shouldn't
have used the term "collectively", since it's so close to the
term "collectivist", which isn't what I intended.  Nor was it the
case that I believe that Lee is interested (in this case) in
distributing intelligence across lightyears.

The thing you're missing here, Robert, is that Lee I doesn't care
(totally, at least) about ROI to Lee I, but about benefit to any
person who is Lee, anywhere.  Or, hey, maybe I misunderstood Lee,
and you're right. :)  Only The Corbin can say.

It doesn't matter that propagation eventually has negative
consequences, *unless* you can prevent all propagation
by anyone, anywhere.  If anyone propagates, they will be
disproportionately the ones that get to deal with the
resulting problem.

A civilization that successfully regulates its own growth, but
not that of others, if any, will not be highly represented at
a given late date.  Even if humans are the only existing
intelligences (and I would guess that we are), I see no reason
why there wouldn't be escapees.

It seems clear to me that as a civilization advances and increases its
available computing power a larger and larger portion of that available
power is used in simulation. Simulation of physics, of environments, of
creatures and yes of detailed and functional creatures in environments.
Creatures such as ourselves?
=20
As computer power increases over time so too must the frequency and
capability of those simulations. Given a simple statistical evaluation
of the process it is nearly inescapable that we must in fact be resident
in such a simulation (even if it is not detectable as such to us). In
fact these simulated creatures must so substantially outweigh any "real"
creatures that most often any thinking and introspective being is most
likely in such a simulation.
=20
Such a simulation would explain many aspects of the questions discussed
on this list. Why are there no visiting aliens? why they're not present
in our simulation....etc etc etc
=20
The real question becomes then if one is resident in a simulation how to
"discover" this fact? how to communicate with the "runner" of the
simulation (which may in fact be many levels deep as a sufficiently
detailed simulation would in fact run their own simulations) and what
benefit may be derived from doing so? (it may in fact be futile and best
ignored. Shall we then behave and believe that we are in fact real?)
=20
Ultimately this may be a futile question with no answer but it may in
fact be the only question worth answering. Python had it wrong...the
earth isn't a massive computer designed to answer some obscure
question...the whole universe is...

I maintain only that the event horizons of this object and
other black holes have not *yet* formed, and there are as
yet *no* singularities over which to worry.

It's just a frozen star, as all the Russian scientists in
the 1950's would have told you.

But then along came Wheeler, and absolutely everyone who
reads Wheeler falls in love with his style, his ingeniousness,
and his imagination.  The following is written in attempted
emulation of his unforgettable style:

1. Focus not on the Schwarzchild coordinates which 
   produce apparent singularities at r = 2M (the
   radius at which exists the event horizon), where
   t goes to infinity.

2. Instead, focus on the real physics of the falling
   astronaut by whose own clock time does not slow
   at all.

3. By mathematically transforming coordinates---which
   one knows has no effect on true singularities but
   which can remove apparent ones caused not by nature
   but by poor choice of coordinate systems---conclude
   that the falling astronaut's physics remain just as
   do ours as he crosses the event horizon at a finite
   time by the reading of his watch.

4. Conclude that the apparent difficulty in the S
   coordinates represents nothing physical at R = 2M
   and that there exists a true singularity at
   R = 0, which characteristically CANNOT be removed
   by mathematical transformations, it being intrinsic
   to reality itself.

And speaking like this, though with vastly more eloquence,
with vastly more authority, and bolstered by extremely
imaginative and profound mathematical analysis, Wheeler
evidently brainwashed an entire generation of physicists,
apparently even including the Russians.

A physicist---I claim---will admit to you that there is
no latest time at which a photon from the astronaut could
be received by us, and that photon trajectories into and out
of black holes are symmetric.  And yet that same physicist,
still under the thrall of Wheeler, will maintain that
event horizons "exist" and at the center of the black holes
singularities "exist" (they deliberately choose the present
tense).

Moreover, if Hawking radiation from a black hole exists,
and that they eventually evaporate, then a quantum of
radiation will be the last emitted from the black hole
at some unimaginable but finite period of time in the
future (say after 10^200 years).  But this time is less
than the time that an idealized photon from an infalling
astronaut could be received on the outside, and so there
is a direct contradiction between the infinite time that
it would take an infalling astronaut to reach the event
horizon (in outside coordinates), and the finite time
(in outside coordinates) that the black hole emits its
last dying photon.

Surely there're have been other people who see through all
this besides just me.

That's very good.  Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, especially
those who are at all ideological---whether of the left or the
right---take a good hard look at all these numbers, and 
understand well two things:

ONE: Atrocities are not merely confined to one's political
     adversaries or their allies

TWO: It's still going on, and our voices must be added to 
     those who are in advance of us, and who are already
     demanding that it stop.

Right.  This is happening *now*.

As I've mentioned before on this list, the coolest heat sink available
is not intergalactic space, but black holes. The implication is that
advanced civilizations should live near black holes. See
http://www.weidai.com/black-holes.txt.

I would like to hear more about why you believe all advanced
civilizations will move out of evolutionary regimes. And also why, once
they do, they won't be able to find a way to ensure the friendliness of
their offspring. I asked this question about a year ago (see
http://www.extropy.org/exi-lists/archive/0205/106121.html), but you
never answered.

You mention the fact that the Europeans and the Japanese are having
falling fertility rates. Why is this happening?  Is it an accident
unique to the human species that richer societies do less reproduction,
or can we expect the same of other intelligent beings?

By the way, speaking of terrorism, let's all practice
what we will say the day that the first terrorist nuke
goes off in the U.S., probably in 2005:

Hubert:   Man's inhumanity to man reaches unacceptable
          heights---but the Americans did ask for it.
Damien:   This terrible tragedy compels everyone to
          root for the Americans (today).
Mikey:    We should have enforced Patriot II, but now
          hopefully all the wheedling naysayers and
          fainthearts will finally get a clue and we
          can start taking *action*.
Samantha: Morals around the world are in an incredibly
          sad state and we simply must do better to
          raise everyone's understanding, consciousness,
          compassion, and acceptance of each other.
Robert:   I calculate that with 4x10^4 ten-megaton weapons
          2x10^9 people can be killed, and with a prob-
          ability of .8, 7.2x10^13 present and future
          people's lives will be saved.
Lee:      I told you so.

So you are implying that the Bush administration (and other
administrations) have an incentive to make progress in the
war against terrorism---so that they'll be re-elected---
but not *too* much progress, or else the "ruling leadership"
won't be able to retain power?

But what if a chance to pass up capturing Osama Bin Laden
eventuated in a traceable terrorist attack the A-bombing
of Philadelphia?  Unless the "ruling leadership" was absolutely
certain that their easing up on terrorists was untraceable, 
then they'd be taking a terrible risk.

Oh, now I recall.  President Clinton *did* pass up a chance
to get Osama, and no one is complaining too much.  But what
would happen if a Republican were to miss a chance to corral
a well known terrorist?  If it were at all traceable, all
hell would break loose!

But I think that this depends on the fundamental constituency
of the nation in question.  Yes, in Germany or France, one
certainly does not want to appear to be less anti-US than
the opposition, so there you are right.  But what about
Australia or Poland?

You see, it is sometimes more easily explained conventionally
by such cynical interpretations.

Because, *if* the Galactic Club is "extropic" (and I really really
hope that they are because if they aren't, most of the discussions
on this list are pointless) -- then a developing civilization *may*
be very useful for the initiation of a unique evolutionary vector
in the phase space of ideas (be them anything from nanotech part
designs to principles of physics).  [Perhaps related to the ideas
that it is the "young people" that make the really significant
contributions to science.]

So long as we don't misbehave we are more valuable (from an extropic
standpoint) alive than dead.  If we behave properly (not sending
self-replicating probes out to "rape" the galaxy) then humanity can be
viewed as a positive asset rather than a negative asset.

And we *will* be able to "see the line".  Due to the observational
capabilities of any advanced civilization we will know what is
out there (with the limits of the time delays imposed by the
speed-of-light).  If there *is* a "Galactic Club" (and Steven
Dick has recently argued it may be billions of years old) then
unless their science allows them to escape from the universe
it is highly probable we will be able to see them.

Would you (as a pilgrim for example) have attempted to colonize
the United States if you knew the native american population
were armed with nuclear weapons to defend themselves?

The space beyond 50 AU from the sun could have thousands of weapons
primed and ready to bomb the solar system with small black holes
generated "on demand"; or hurl neutronium into the sun to
turn it into a supernova; or make up your favorite sci-fi
destruction scenario.   If there is even a *remote* possibility
that there are civilizations out there billions of years older
than we are it makes sense to make sure whatever we intend to
do is ok with them before we engage in activity that might even
slightly piss them off.  To not do so, I believe as the British
might put it, would make you a "bloody fool".

Wow.  The entire 2001 genocides don't add up to one day's planetary 
casualties.  By comparison with any of the past genocides listed, or, 
probably, *any* earlier period in *all* human history, this is downright 
amazing.

When I went to that site, I was expecting much, much worse.  It was as 
recently as 1994 that 800,000 Tutsi died in Rwanda.  I don't remember 
hearing it on the news at the time, but I was young.  Do you all, I 
wonder, recall any fuss about it?  I can only imagine the outcry if that 
many deaths had occurred to people who were American, or British, or 
German, or, well, to be blunt about it, white.

Now all we have to do is halt the fifty-five million annual non-genocide 
casualties, and we'll have made some real progress.

Wei Dei commented on my comments re: Marvin Minsky's comments to

He cited:

I apologize -- I do not recall seeing this earlier or the post you cite:
  http://www.extropy.org/exi-lists/archive/0205/106121.html
(which raises a number of issues, some of which I'm going to have
to reflect upon).

*But*, just dealing with the physics aspect of a Dyson Shell/MBrain
constructed around a black hole -- it is very interesting.  It
is not to far from the "externally powerer MBrain" concepts that
I had in mind in the original MBrain paper but solves the cooling
problem in a very very interesting way.

It is going to create a very interesting tradeoff -- if you want
the greatest computing capacity one is going to want a black hole
with a small mass (smaller event horizon).  This is going to increase
the production of Hawking radiation and will decrease the lifetime
of the black hole.  So you may be able to compute "more" but you
will do so for a shorter period of time before your means to do so
fails you.  (This may be related to computational civilizations
hurling themselves into black holes (or engaging in otherwise
self-destructive "terminal" activities) that I believe that Anders
and I have discussed, perhaps onlist, in the quest of "ultimate"
computations.)

But the concept of MBrains with the stars (or fusion reactors)
on the outside and a black hole on the inside and the radiators
facing inwards instead of outwards certainly deserves a greater
amount of study.  Respectful nods on my part.

To be honest I do not know.  In part I think it may be a decline on
the part of non-agricultural parents to need more children (to bring
in the harvest, etc.).  In part I think it may be because parents
(once they have control over reproductive processes) may choose to
focus limited resources on fewer children.  It may be a shift from
"I want 'more' children" to "I want 'better' children".  But those
would only be guesses on my part.  Though if the last hypothesis is
correct the development of inexpensive genetic testing and greater
knowledge of how genes influence capabilities would suggest that the
trends will continue.

Somehow I can't imagine an Australian saying that in quite
that way. :)  Perhaps, "...compels everyone to stop saying
'root the Americans' (today)."  Or not.

Quite right.  Robert and many others have made it clear
that that's impossible.  Besides, given how slow light
travels, I have always thought that an integrated intelligence
probably can't be more than kilometers in size anyway
(depends on the kind of problems that it enjoys and the
gratification algorithms it executes).

No---whether it is a Lee II or a Randall II or a Samantha II
or even a FriendlyAlien II, all the true copies of me wish
them well, and want to live in peace with them.  Hell, I even
want to live in peace with Osama, but he's got other ideas.

You're absolutely right, Randall.  It's a *big* priority
with me that the other Lee's get a lot of run time, even
if this unit (or we) have been out of contact with them
for eons.  But we must not lose sight of the fact that I
would like matter everywhere to be sentient, alive, and to
be enjoying life, even if I have no common history with it.

Yeah, what is it about this aspect of evolutionary theory
(that evolution tautologically causes the predominance of
those who reproduce most) that is so hard for many to 
internalize?  As you and I keep saying, it only takes one.

Maybe your prose will succeed, Randall, where mine has failed.
We must be running up against very deeply held biases or very
deep emotions of some kind.

Of course not!  Remember that the universe is infinite.  There are
even infinitely many worlds with me writing this to you.  (As Randall
has just pointed out, why do we need to repeat so much on this list?
Didn't you read the Tegmark threads at all?)

The question is, what is the chance that there is any life within
a billion lightyears of here, given that we have seen no sign?
I say---exactly because we have seen no sign---that it is very
high (like .999).  What do you think the chance is---within 10^9
lightyears?

Yes, so you've said.  Just why you prefer Jupiter in its present
state to it being an abode for trillions of happy people/entities
you have *not* explained.

But you have also not explained why since it would take only one
person/entity/civilization to bring life to the cosmos, NOT ONE
of them within a billion lightyears has done so (since the last
1/14 of the age of the universe).

Yes, indeed, simulations of us too.  However, it is in my opinion
rather complicated.  Let me explain (summarizing many past posts).

In the first place, our infinite universe at levels 1, 2, and 3
(see Tegmark) runs infinitely many copies of us.  Therefore our
current experience---as you explain---is not only being simulated
infinitely many times, but actually *occurs* in physical space
infinitely many times.

In order to keep the word "infinitely" from making the text less
comprehensible, allow me to confine this discussion to a suitably
large, but finite space on level 1, say one trillion light years.

Now whenever we use the words "this solar system", the word
"this" does not have the unambiguous meaning that one may at
first suppose.  After all, in our sphere of a trillion light
year there could be many simulated versions of me or you in
identical states saying "this", and a few real versions too.

So it is proper to identify with *all* your copies who at this
moment within the trillion light year sphere who are saying
"this".

Now, we may choose to *mean* this here in the sense of "this
here physical" solar system, thus confining attention to only
the real physical processes.  Remember, all the simulations
and physical processes are completely identical, so therefore,
I claim, WE MIGHT AS WELL BE REFERRING TO THE PHYSICALLY REAL
ONE.

(It does so simplify the language, as does dropping "infinitely
many" from each sentence did.  Besides, the simulations have many
aspects to them that are true but which are unavailable to us,
and they come in many varieties, as I will now show.)

In the second place, let us for the moment allow "this" to
point to one of the simulations.  In this case, we have to
ask how many of us are in this simulation.  Only the people
reading this list?  Or all six billion humans?  Or just you?
Or just me?

Now if it is all humans---which is the usual default assumption
when people start going on about simulations---then note that
our simulators are cruel indeed.  The bastards have bothered
to simulate the collapse of the World Trade Center, the 
Cambodian holocaust, and even the people rotting in Castro's
jails.  Why?  What on Earth would motivate them TO *DO* THIS?
One does not have to go as far as Samantha and several others
do to assume that advanced races are vastly nicer than we are;
if they attain only our *present* level of morality they will
abstain from reenactments of Gettysburg, World War II, or even
a day in the life of some poor soul in the U.S. who is suffering
from depression.

It seems both pointless and immoral to run simulations that
are in any sense correct emulations of our present world.

Therefore, granting that the simulations do occur in great
numbers, as you, X9987ghy7Q say, then it is most likely the
case that no real suffering is happening, and we only have
the *memories* of having suffered.  And those whose entire
lives are never ending bouts of schizophrenia and misery
aren't being emulated at all, but are only being portrayed.

So the whole ensemble of simulations dribbles off into 
imponderable semi-simulations of unknown characteristics.

Hell why not indeed?

It seems to me that you adduce further evidence that
"this" is not a simulation at all or is a simulation
that does not include life elsewhere within a sphere
of a billion light years.

Absolutely yes, we ought to suppose at all times
that our pointer "this" is pointing to the real
instances.  There is utterly no payoff to focus
on the instances of the pointer "*this" that 
refer to the interior of simulations.

I very much doubt it, X9, (may I call you "X9" for
short?  :-)     A better question might be, shall
we run simulations when we have the ability, and
what shall we run?

Yes!  Now that *could* be!  But it ought to be saved
for another thread, another time, and another email.

"Vatican says GM food is a blessing"

http://www.wwrn.org/parse.php?idd=9340

Hmm, gotta be more to this. Maybe Monsanto made a big donation. I like
the part where is says, "the future of humanity is at stake and there is
no room for the ideological arguments." Hard to believe this is the same
outfit that gets all indignant when governments distribute condoms. Now
if we can just get them to see the light on stem cell research, sex
education, birth control, homosexuality, women's rights...

>Lee
>P.S.  So you are not an example of what Paul was talking about
"hyperlexia"?

I'm hyperlexic, but I found discrete mathematics to be quite a pain to
pickup;
mind you I excelled at geometric proofs.  Anyways, long story short, it
turned
out that discrete mathematics (as its taught generally) was too abstract
for me
(ergo too many directions to go in for a "short" proof sans need)... I
got discrete math
when I studied the subject (theory of computation) that it was intended
to
be used in.  Prior to actually seeing the end results (the end use of a
theorem),
I found it difficult to divine what was the intended result of the
theorem and ergo
a particular pathway to the end result (formal proof) in the alotted
time...

I picked up discrete mathematics trivially, once I had found the key to
organize
it around (in this case turing machines/automata/grammers).  I
*understand* calculus
(the foundation, thought processes) intuitively though.  Same goes for
geometry and
algebra.  It was very clear to both me and my professor though that I
didn't "learn"
discrete math the same way other people did... It took a fundamentally
different
approach... 

Another really interesting portion is that the symbolic processing
extends into my
kinesthetic system (its got a different name now, but I don't remember
it off the
top of my head).  I have extremely good sense recall when it comes to my
skeletal
muscular system, including the direction of said muscles when it comes
to acquiring
new skills.  I have the equivalent of a shorthand grammer; I tell my
muscles what I
want them to do and they do it.

anyways, i think its fascinating, although to be quite honest, I wasn'
particularly
happy that they chose to classify it as a disorder... I'm a big fan of
the DSM-4;
if it doesn't bother you, it shouldn't be a disorder... They seem to
have left that portion
out of the literature.. I think because they're targeting it towards
parents coping
with their kids (and the tendency towards antisocial behavior)...

anyway,
just thought I'ld share (at least my perspective)...

I believe that Leonid Gavrilov speculated in a recent JAAM article that
some of the extension in longevity we are observing may be due to better
maternal nutrition and/or nutrition during early development.  It makes
sense if one postulates that it may lead to an increase in the pool of
available stem cells that one can utilize later in life.

So there may be both intelligence and longevity gains from better
nutrition.

This is not so an unfair characterization of my charge as I
had thought.  "Bullying" can include (1) cruelty (2) lording
power over others.  I certainly was not accusing you of that.

But I have learned that in many instances the term need not
connote that, so as long as neither of these is meant, then
yes, that is my accusation.  But a much better description
is that scolding in high dudgeon and moral rage/self-
righteousness, though it can be an honest reaction, is
not at all helpful.  We all really  should make an effort
to---however angry we are---restrain ourselves to rational
communication.

Because as I said before, one of the components in angry
attacks on posters is:  Be Afraid.

Because not only are one's ideas being criticized, but so
is one's very character itself.  

Now of course, inferences about someone's character are
always bound to be made, and no one can really stop
himself or herself from doing so privately.  For example,
to some for a person to admit to atheism necessarily
reveals a personal character defect of no small proportion.
To others, for someone to advocate adult/child sex or
blatant child molestation will reflect very negatively
on the advocate's character.

But this is quite different from attempting to *intimidate*
the advocates of atheism or child molestation, or uploading,
or whatever else is the criticized project or activity, by
attacking the speaker's moral virtue.  Let their advocacy
of an idea speak for itself!  Please allow them to be condemned
---if that is what it is to be in your mind and the minds of
others---by their own words.

Speakers on a forum such as this, where the currency is in
ideas, ought not to have to suffer personal attacks, or have
their character besmirched for advocating capital punishment,
communism, genocide, pornography, infanticide, preemptive
nuclear attack, total personal responsibility, eugenics,
spirituality, Jew baiting, liberalism, or any other sin that
you can think of---even including listening to Pat Roberson.

The basic message behind attacks written in visible anger
is "SHUT UP" and "WE do not wish to hear about such things".
An even more sinister component is "you'll be sorry for
saying that" and "we will get you", which are conveyed to
the target at the subconscious level, and is meant to
instill fear.

I myself have suffered such personal abuse for daring to
admit that if I lived in a free country---i.e., one with
strong Constitutional protections of liberty, but one
in which people were free to do whatever they wanted so
long as it didn't literally violate the constitution
and freely enacted local laws---I would suggest to a
the people of my own small community that the laws
interfering in family matters be abolished, with the
consequence that polygamy or infanticide would be judged
not to be the business of the community at large.

For this, I was raked over the coals, and every manner
of exhortation was made to silence me.  (I do regret that
it makes some people sick to hear of such ideas, and for
them, reading an idea-based forum such as this is probably
not healthful.)

Damien continues, and here I think we get to the heart of 
the matter:

I agree.  Reports such as Robert's should not be submitted
without due deference to traditional wisdom.  He ought to
include a little respect for the memes that make us civilized.
But he tends not to, and that is why to some he comes across
as without normal human emotion, or without mercy.

Very well, and very good, so long, as I say, it does not
stoop to intimidation or name calling, which in several

"As if they were not extreme and stylistic", I would have
written instead. They *can* be rational (e.g., the atomic
bombing of Hiroshima, which I think most thoughtful persons
admit probably saved many, many lives).  They can also,
obviously, be quite human.  To characterize them as either
inhuman or "mad" gains none of the advantages of rational
criticism, and has all the defects that I described before.

"Dangerous", you mean as in, for example, "Darwin's Dangerous
Idea?".  Let's not descend to calling ideas 'dangerous' please.
And calling them odious achieves exactly what?  (Even if to
many of us they are indeed odious.)

How do you know what the effects would be of being labeled "autistic"
and worse, or to have people scream at you?  You might be right in
Robert's particular case (after all, he does know you personally)
but wrong in general.  Don't you think that you'd be affected in a
powerful way to really, really be afraid of mentioning your own
rational views around some people?

Wrong: I *do* understand that entirely.  It may seem detestable to you 
or to me.  Quite different is the effect, however, is the *communication*
our feelings.  Nothing is intrinsically or provably "detestable".

No, of course not.  Not for a moment did I think that you were
proposing either one.  It seemed to me that you just didn't realize
the effects of denouncing people's ideas in the terms you and 
others did.  As I say, they can be scolded by accusing them of
"hyperrationality", of failing to pay heed to tradition and 
moderation, and many similar things.  We must stop short of
calling them insulting names, however, or yelling at them.

Yes!  I agree totally with that!  Because here you use the

outset.

I think this is very good news, and I am not too surprised. The Church has a
long long history as a political organization, and would not have survived
that long without adapting to changing times. They are realistic and
pragmatic enough to understand that if something is coming anyway regardless
of their approval, they better adapt to it and adopt it as if it had been
their idea from the beginning, I think sooner or later the Vatican, if they
want to survive, may endorse stem cell research, sex education, birth
control, homosexuality, women's rights.

The Vatican does endorse *adult* stem cell research its
the human embryonic stem cell research they don't endorse
because human embryonic stem cells are obtained by harvesting
them from the inner cell mass of a 4-5 day old blastocyst in
what is necessarily a terminating event for the embryo.

Giulio, I think that's far too grudging an approval.  Maybe they're just 
ordinary humans who want to do the nice thing and, by golly, got it right 
regardless of our own stereotyped preconceptions?  Can't we just 
congratulate them on that?

Getting good at geometry proofs doesn't fit with the
rest of your narrative.  How old were you when you 
got good, or were able to get good, at geometry proofs?

Well, according to http://www.hyperlexia.org/ my guess
is that you are/were only very mildly hyperlexic.  Did
you show many of the symptoms listed there?

Have you ever read books like "The Number Sense" or "The
Math Gene"?  They describe how most people evidently have
from a very young age an almost concrete number line built
in.  It's much as if a little measuring rod were right there
in the head, and one can kind of directly compare numbers
like one and two to it.  Babies appear to have it too.

It's as though you had to hack up in software a number line
or something that others had built into their hardware.
There is a certain form of verbal reasoning that I'm no
good at, and have always felt that I had to "hack up" a
substitute for what came naturally to others.  Or maybe
I just don't trust my native reasoning ability in addition.

Again, it makes me think you have no number "feel" at
all, because otherwise the feature you are mentioning
would map right onto it, and you'd be very good with
numbers.

BTW, I'm currently playing with the fictional idea of a star made from Xons
or X-particles, the unification-energy entities proposed by GUTs. If anyone
here with the relevant expertise cares to play, I'd be interested to hear
some estimates of the maximum radius we'd expect of such a body before it
closed off its local spacetime by gravity. An X is thought to be 10^15 or
10^16 GeV, compared with a nucleon of some .93 GeV. My rough and ready
calculation suggests an approximately Solar-mass body of Xon matter might
fit inside a sphere 20 centimeters across. But I'm terrible at this sort of
thing. (A neutron star's about 20 km across.) I think Walker in the above
paper suggests it'd only be 10-3 centimeters.

<brett> I cannot agree with this statement as a generalisation, as there

are some classes of pre-emptive action made on 
the basis of genuinely held, earnestly reasoned (note I 
am not touching *belief* here) views that would require
action in my view. 

<me> trying to justify a pre-emptive measure on the notion
that is "genuinely held" or "earnestly reasoned" is a rationalization
in my opinion, generally to excuse the type of behavior you
are engaging in... the limit on this line of reasoning though,
is in the duration of the act.... for instance, say you were prescient,
and saw a man who was going to mug you (with a knife) 10 minutes 
from now, and hit him over a head; than you would be acting morally
(given ur prescience).  Lets say you are not prescient, and you hit
him over the head on the possibility that he might mug you; than you
are acting immorally.  Lets say you are not prescient, and he is mugging
someone else (as it is apparent to you from your vantage point), and you
intervene by hitting him over the head... Then you're actions may or may
not be immoral, on the basis that he may not be the one doing the
mugging,
but rather, may be the muggee.  The point being that you have to
consider
the granularity of the event, the knowledge you had as an autonomous
agent,
the environment you're in, and the action chosen, and the outcome of
that action... 
All those are invariably what people choose to judge you over [from a
historical
perspective].... and since I am not particularly concerned about
morality within
a persons own framework, but rather, a cooperative sort of morality that
effectively
incorporates even the most base of people intuitions, that is the scope
my statement
is meant to be evaluated in.  If you can find a *single* (reasonable,
defined as a person
who's views of reality are generally accurate) person (within your
collective)
who judges your actions immoral on the basis of your premptive action,
than you 
have violated the precepts of a good moral system.  Ergo don't go around

bonking people on the head until you are sure of the situation you are
in, 
and then react only as needed.  Incidentally, this is the equivalent to
a 
code of laws system.

<brett> Indeed sometimes there would be
a moral impetus towards action (even pre-emptive 
action). We cannot *know* for certain the actions of
others and we cannot always prudently wait for them
to do their worst before we respond. In the end it is
to our own judgement of the total risks that we must
hold true and then on that judgement we must act 
(including in *some* cases pre-emptively). 

<me>I'll agree that you can *feel* you're actions are morally motivated.
I would say however, that if you were to examine you're actions
rationally,
you will always find a probability or pathway (excluding a continious
action like a knife stabbing towards you, ergo a certain level of
granularity)
that will lead to your "preemptive action" being immoral.  Of course you
could always say (arbitrarily) that I was reacting to the best of my
abilities
to the best of my knowledge ergo my action was moral by my system of 
morals/ethics.... But I tend to think of that as a cop-out.

<brett> First the status of morality and the rationality of ethics is 
pretty widely regarded at least so far as I am aware in 
philosophical circles as being almost a matter of opinion.
(eg. Bertrand Russell. History of Western Philosophy).


<me> I'm sure it is; until you run into an event that requires 
faith or belief outside of rationality.  Ergo if I'm marooned
on a desert island for 60 years, does it really make a damned
difference if I hallucinate marilyn monroe on the island with me
in order to remain sane?  I tend towards a function and 
dysfunctional definition of sanity; if its dysfunctional, then you
are not being ethical.  if its functional, you are being ethical.
and since functionality is related to the environment you are
operating in, ergo my comment about self-delusion not really
having anything to do with morality... I definately think everyone
is engaged in it to some degree (self-delusion), and to the extent
that it helps you, its ethical....

<brett> I find this conclusion powerful, dangerous and deeply 
unsatisfying so I am keen to have at it. Let's be clear 
I may fail but if I'm going down like Don Quixote, 
then I'm going down "having at" one of the larger 
uglier philosophical  windmills. 

<me> I was just telling my little sister yesterday about one
of the classical issues in my life (at one point during
my younger years); at what point does being too intelligent
start to harm you (the classic form being, if you could trade
intelligence for gauranteed happiness, would you do it)...
most intelligent people say no; I think the really intelligent
people though, when they consider it, say yes.  This is of 
course, assumes that people intuitively seek to maximize their
utilities, and said maximazation of utility defines a state
of happiness [which is, I think, reasonable]... Ergo self-delusion
is only dangerous if you can't discard the delusion when
it becomes detrimental to your pursuit of happiness.  This
is the hallmark of a creative intellect, insofar as it requires
both the vision to see the possibilities, and the ability to maintain
seperate versions independant of each other {and process
them for fitness subconsciously}.

<brett> Ok. Now here's my point. Unless a moral code can
arise form a set of universals such as a propensity to
reason and a predispositon to sociability then there is
not likely to be much genuine agreement between 
subjective individuals on moral codes

<me>Oh I'll *agree* that it is absolutely necessary
to have something to that effect; I think the inclusion of
a predisposition to sociability is where your moral system
will fail, as in a fair amount of people are not (at some point
in their lives) sociable.... Any moral system you build on that
premise is doomed to fail because it does not take into account
actions by that subpopulation of people (antisocial individuals
who are operating on a different ethical system).  I would
state that ur assumption that there is a propensity to
reason is a reasonable one in that it is necessary for
the ability to recognize other autonomous agents actions
for what they are; expressions of their own moral/ethical systems..

<brett> Further those
who do not know endeavour to understand themselves,
what manner of creature they are, are not going to be
in a position to know what the most optimal compromises
for them are when compromises need to be made. 

<me> I've met several people who are extremely intuitively,
but unable to verbalize (form coherent sentences) expressing
their viewpoints...they just know what is right for them, and
what is not... how does your system encompass them?

<brett> A person
that deludes themselves that they are a different sort of 
creature with different sets of drivers and needs than 
they actually have is precluded from sitting down at table 
to negotiate for their own best interests because they do not 
know their own best interests. A person that deludes themselves 
willingly can hardly be a person that others would want to 
engage in a moral compacts with. 

<me> according to you :) to me its fine :) In fact, i rather
like space cadets :)  They tend to have a rather fascinating
imagination, and are very suggestible...

<me> I should give you a friendly warning at this point;
I am generally where people's morals systems (day-2-day)
break; they invariable adopt (when dealing with me) mine
as it is impossible to force me to adopt theirs, and generally
speaking, I am a fairly productive person (and very difficult
to avoid if your moral system ends up conflicting with mine).
I say this of course, in a friendly manner, because it will
give you an insight to my fundamental objection to your
system....that it, it is not sufficiently broad enough to 
encompass all useful people (non-functional insanity excluded).

<brett> Within the context of the time available I think 
individuals ought to use pan critical rationalism in 
their approach to understanding their own nature and 
then pursuing the optimal outcome for them in accordance 
with their nature. 

<me>....which may end up not being rational (to outside
examination)....

<brett> This optimal outcome will necessarily 
involve compromise because others whose cooperation 
is needed will not if they are enlightened and empowered 
(and likely to be good allies as a consequence) strike 
bad bargains.  

<me> I would agree with this sentence :) compromise
is often called for amongst people if they hope to culture
friendships that will be substantial in trade.

<brett> I reckon to the extent one is self deluded one will be 
screwed at the negotiating table because perceptive others 
will recognize you as having a lower sentience quotient and 
the only one to blame for this if you are self deluding will 
be yourself.

<me> depends on how intelligent they are.  some forms of 
self-delusion are bad, some are good.  some are bad generally,
but useful in achieving short-term goals...

<me> fundamentally though, I think you're exclusion of
people who are self-deluded though, would end up eliminating
all of humanity... and ergo ur proposed moral system would
fail in that it would not encompass anyone... and if there
was a completely rational person (at some point), than they 
would probably end up suicidal..  Of course this is conjecture
on my part (assuming everyone is self-delusional to a degree)
but I think it is bourne out by the nature of being human.

<brett> So far I've been using morality and ethics without
distinguishing them particularly. 

<me> yeah I noticed :) I was trying to disinguish the two 
for the purposes of this dialogue :)

<brett> Of course you do. A person that you know was intending
to steal from you yesterday but did not for lack of an 
opportunity is likely to be filed as such and regarded as
such. If not you'd be suckered far more often than the 
norm.

<me> "an honest man is just a thief without opportunity" :)

<brett> They certainly are that. And a persons future actions
, their motives, their reputation are surely part of practical 
moral deliberations on your part. 

<me> nope.  I deal on a tit-for-tat basis.  Either people adhere
to a basic set of standards, or they disappear from any sort of
significant interactions (if I itch, I scratch).  There's generally
a ramp-up period of re-training.  They are free to interact with
others, however they wish. I do not interfere unless called upon
by another (involved) party.  I am *always* fair.

<brett> I am trying to establish the validity of the statement to 
thine ownself be true. You, I think, are trying to make me
make the case or to refute it.  I am not interested in a simple moral
system 
I am interested in a rational, teachable and extensible one. 

<me> Its rational, teachable and extensible.  In fact, its more
teachable
than a complicated one....  There are no gray areas.

<brett>If I can teach a moral system that has high 
utility to those I teach it too, like teaching the principle of tit 
for tat, then I can be confident that the world will be that much more
pleasant and predictable for me as a result.

<me> evaluate my suggestion within the context of whether or not such 
a system would be fit ur standards and offer high utility... I would
suggest, humbly, that it does...

<brett> In almost all negotiations, and most moral matters 
between persons involve a quid quo pro, the best possible 
outcome for the individuals involved depends on them 
recognizing the best possible outcome for them (without 
their being deluded as to what they want or need) and 
then most closely approximating it.

<me> I think perhaps, we mean two things by being deluded..
You are referring to a final state of utility reached
by a rational deduction of what your particular utility table
is... I am referring to it as a person who has already determined
their utility table, but reached it through a non-rational pathway.
Ergo for you, someone who is self-deluding themselves is incapable
of understanding what their true utility tables are... whereas for me,
a person who is self-deluding themselves is a person who is mapping
their stimuli (internal & external) to alter an unpleasant situation to
a state of utility...where said mapping may not be based either on
a rational inference chain (thinking), or even by rational examination
of ones self... What do you think? Can you clarify exactly what you
mean by self-delusion?

<brett> Absolutely not. That is pure fantasy land. The best we can
hope to achieve is a reasonable compromise where all sit
down in good faith and recognizing that all are compromising 
but all are gaining in the aggregate all act in accordance with 
the agreement.

<me> in other words, someplace where everyones needs
are met...to the best of the collectives ability?

<brett> I wouldn't limit one's self understanding and ones understanding
 of ones needs and desires to the mere physical. 

<me> I certainly wouldn't extend it to the metaphysical :) Brain
processing
is a physical process.  Its influenced directly by physical processes..
Including meta-thoughts (working on ur concepts directly with a higher
level grammer).

<brett> I think there are social needs in most people that are very deep
seeded 
and go beyond the need for physical contact.

<me> I wasn't referring to that :) I was referring to altering the
reality you're
living in (cognitively) by biofeedback, but on an subconscious level.
Something
akin to the Siberian train conductors lowering their metabolism, based
on when
the train was going to pull into the station [arrive].. but more
sophisticated..

<brett> I am not sure what your point is here. Sociopaths are also
good readers of patterns. They just don't empathise. But
I would argue that sociopathy is dysfunction. 

<me> Depends on whether or not sociopaths can manage to
contain their more destructive impulses (or rather, get away
with it).  There's a subpopulation of sociopaths who are 
quite successful, who manage to sustain their needs by
twisting the letter of the law to suit their need.  Its not
necessarily a dysfunction. + on top of it, it depends on whether
or not a sociopath is bothered by prison.  Who knows?

<brett> And real  sociopaths would possible grin at me 
and say who needs that sentimental bullshit anyway. 
And I'd say you do here's why ..etc.

<me> I think I can say very fairly that sociopaths do not
think like normal people; especially (or rather, primarily)
when it comes to their utility tables...  There's no basis
for comparison :) Ergo why I brought them into the
conversation...

<brett> Only after some initial basic social assistance has been
rendered.

<me> We're dealing with [dynamic] adults here, no? You don't intend
to limit your morality to only those who are currently social?

<brett> Many infants get suboptimal social assistance and the 
outcomes are often dysfunctional people. But they are not 
dysfunctional  by choice. 

<me> but they're still dysfunctional, at least, according to what
currently
passes for a majority of society.

<brett> Belief has nothing to do with it. I have learned and observed
human infants I know that physiologically they cannot survive without 
assistance - that they wish to survive - that they suckle if they can 
and cry if they can't is not a matter of mere belief.  

<me> I'll agree with ur assessment on babies... now whats the relevance
to your moral system?

> But not all.

<brett> Not all to the same degree. But there is no person alive at
present 
(to the best of my knowledge) with the power to stay alive without 
cooperating with others. 

<me> but you acknowledge that it is a possibility?

<brett> It is not necessary that social be about niceness it is better,
more funcitonal, if it is about an enlightened understanding of frailty
and the benefits of cooperation. I would argue that tyrants that aim for
the short glorious life of Archilles in 2003 are short changing
themselves. They are sub-optimally selfish. With a tweak of their value
systems they may be able to satisfy more of their needs and desires by
cooperating. But many of them would have to re-learn and I'd expect few
of them to change what has worked for them if they could not be
presented with a compelling argument. If there is no compelling argument
that can be made to their self interest then I would say that no real
moral argument is being put to them at all.  

<me> ....except to say that they have presumeably successfuly satisfied
their own utility tables....

<brett> That is exactly right. In the end the individual must decide 
moral policy for themselves. The intelligent individual will take into 
account existing social mores and laws but in the end they 
will not shirk the responsibility of the moral decision. They cannot. 
To shirk is the allow defaults to go into play.  

<me> yes but ur system implies a judging of that moral code
(at the end of the day) by other members of that society...
so individual morality is irrelevant if the rest of the group
does not consent to that action as being moral...

<me>my overall point is that saying you're action (by your own
moral standard) is moral is trivially easy to do; convincing
others is far more difficult.

<brett> No my moral code would tell me if this person is reasonable
I can point out that their aspiration to munch on my spleen
is well recognized by me and that that is not a circumstance
that I can permit to prevail. Either we reason out a conclusion 
together or we fight to the death now. I then invite them to 
do their calculations of cooperation vs competition and 
consider how the agreement if it is to be cooperation will 
be effectively honored. If at any stage I feel that my appeals 
to their reasoning is hopeless then I fall back on trying to kill 
them before they kill me. 

<me> what, you offer them half ur spleen? you're moral code has
just failed to offer a suitable compromise to another rational
autonomous agent... whereas his morality disregards yours, yours
fails to achieve its basic premise... that of being attractive to 
others rational beings...

<brett> Yes. According to a system I'm offering up 
for consideration because I think there is some consistency 
and utility in it and because if I am right and it is teachable 
I will benefit by shifting the cooperate compete decision 
more towards cooperation (just as if I had taught the principle 
of tit for tat). 

<me> .. but is it the optimal solution?
 
> [Paul]

<brett> Depends what you mean by belief. Belief is a problem word
for me because a lot of people who are doing more than
mere believing use the word belief to indicate a sort of 
less than certain knowledge. The problem is that some people 
that use the word belief may have done no personal processing 
on the issue at hand at all but may have simply adopted 
wholesale something that they were indoctrinated with.

<me> the latter part of that paragraph is what I'm implying;
that any rational person who has (without resort to emotion,
or any rationalization or justification) examined the
concept of acting pre-emptively (sans sufficient proof or
knowledge of the current environment) is reasoning falsely.
 

<brett> If you are implying that my proposed moral system is flawed
or inconsistent or unclear then, yes, I am willing to accept that that 
could be in fact a valid criticism but I'd ask you to point out where 
because as I've said trying to find means of increasing cooperation 
and putting morality and ethics on a more rational footing is a 
worthwhile task.

<me> three points really; 
a) it doesn't make a difference how you arrive at an API, it is only 
important to establish one (rational or otherwise).  There is no reason
that an emotional or intuitive based person cannot maximize their own
utility while being consistent from an external point of view of their
behaviors.
Ergo, consistency is key {even more so than cooperation, becaue if you
really want somebodies cooperation, you will invariably have that
already
incorporated in ur utility table [by virtue of it being a necessity to
fulfill
some other greater utility] and ergo you will have something to offer in
trade}.

people

loners[antisocial],
and even those that aren't rational [non-functionally insane]

c) the API should be predicteable...having a code of laws where no-one
can
predict whether or not they are in compliance is pointless.  It doesn't
make
a difference whether or not they agree with the fundamental reasonings,
they should be able to follow the statements out to their (hopefully
logical)
consequences or in barring that, have a simple intuitive model to guide
them.

<brett> Many use it like this. I don't like it because I spend a lot
of time considering the politics of language and communication.

<me> I don't; I use a word sans negative or positive connotations.
Descriptive, accurate and precise. The sentence is where I pass
judgement on the thought, not the word.

<brett> I think that if an extrope is debating with a flat earther in
 front of an open minded audience and the audience is only partly 
paying attention and they hear the extrope talking of beliefs on the 
one hand and the flat earther talking of beliefs on the other the 
audience may be seduced into thinking one belief may be just as 
good as the other. I think it is in our interests to get some
probability 
and quantifiability into the discussion. Belief is language which 
serves the preservation of the status quo. 

<me> I agree; if you are ambigious on how I am using a word,
just ask for clarification.. vice versa on my end, assumed, of course.

<me> disagree.  more important than persuading other
people is establishing a way of communicating clearly
and unambigiously, preferably with some training
into how to accurately convey your thought processes
to another, and how to detect (and request clarification)
when others are using a word to convey a different
semantic construct.  Ergo I never argue persuasively,
only defensively :)  Lawyers argue persuasively, and
just about everybody I know (excluding lawyers) hates
dealing with them [ergo a necessary evil]....

<brett> My point is that when you speak in a political forum you 
do your own thought process which is based on considerably 
more than mere indoctrination by another (I hope) a disservice 
when you use the word belief instead of another word. 

<me> I see; you're making a broader point than are discussion :)

<brett>(This is because not everyone who hears you use the word 
belief knows that you will have done more processing. 
It seems to me that many extropes fail to realise that the audience, 
the rest of the world doesn't give away free credibility points 
for one wacky belief over another.  

<me> for me, personally, in day-to-day interactions, people always
quickly realize that any thought I express has been well-thought out.
I have not, of course, attempted to communicate in a traditional public
forum {press, tv, etc} other than internet-based forums (list-servs and 
usenet).  Incidentally, mostly because I'm not really trying to persuade

anybody of anything outside of my scope of interaction.  I'm primarily
interested in getting my viewpoints out, to confirm whether or not there
are any flaws in my thinking that I have missed, or to flesh out an idea
by gathering other people's inputs on the subject, generally through 
anecdotal experiences... The scientifically-based stuff I get through
journals and books.

<brett> Yes, but again I'd go back to pan critical rationalism.

<brett> Without ever getting absolute certainty there are techniques 
which we can learn which give us a much higher probability of 
getting a correct (a useful) answer.

<me> until you discover that extreme you didn't consider..
I'm an engineer (mentality-wise), so for the most part, I 
always have to  build/plan for the worst case scenario..
Theoretically, that means I have a smaller margin for error
before I'm willing to sweep it under the rug as not worth
planning for.

<brett> As indeed in practice most of us have. If I am right and a 
better more universal ethical system can be derived I would expect 
that in most peoples cases there would be very little observable 
differences in how they'd behave. But then on the other hand 
when one starts to routinely reason as oppose to believing one is 
in a position to converse mind to mind with other reasoning beings.
Beliefs can very easily become entrenched positions. 
I think to reason when reason is  available is more social 
and because I think humans are social (their interests are best 
served by cooperation) to  reason is moral to believe is not.

<me> I agree with everything but ur last statement :) as I said,
give me an simple, robust API anyday.  It doesn't matter to me
if there is a one-to-one mapping between it and some derived,
generic ethical system, or there is a many-to-one mapping.  I
generally prefer rationally based systems in that the API happens
to conform to reality [generally the other requirement, don't
want to end up getting killed or maimed for my API]...

I dunno, overall, I have some fairly big problems with your API.

I think more than anything else though, its that social requirment
thing... :)  Then again, I've been described by several people
in my life as a human computer...

I am not a researcher but I spent a large chunk of last

behalf of industry (the stem cell co's) and patient
advocacy groups in Australia.

A strict reading of these rules would suggest that it is okay for me to 
advocate the assassination of Robert Bradbury, but not to insult him. 
This is actually a logically possible interpretation of what you said, 
i.e., it is okay to calmly and politely call for a fellow list member's 
assassination and then debate the idea, but not to insult someone or call 
them names.  Would you agree with this?  (Lest anyone mistake me, I am 
emphatically not calling for the assassination of Robert Bradbury or 
anyone else.  I won't say that killing *never* solves anything, but its 
power to improve the human condition is far less than commonly thought.)

It seems to me that you're calling for total openness, and yet 
simultaneously placing a restriction on speech.  Personally I would hope 
that someday, people will be free to say anything they damn well please, 
and people will also be free to be offended and say so in no uncertain 
terms, and, yes, besmirch the character of the person they dislike.  If 
you enjoy, on mailing lists, that form of local politeness which calls for 
not posting offended reactions, why is that particular custom okay, but 
not that alternate form of politeness which calls for not advocating 
genocide?  Are they not both restrictions on speech?  On SL4 I don't 
hesitate to impose both restrictions, in the name of preserving the 
glorious Signal and triumphing over Noise.

And how do you distinguish between frozen stars and black holes? Your 
complaint seems to be against the existence (in whatever tempus) of 
singularities, and to a lesser degree the existence of event horizons. 

But the singularity is not necessary to have a black hole, e.g. some 
quantum gravity theories propose that local inflation creates a baby 
universe with a different but finite topology. The black hole picture is 
really about the outside and "surface" characteristics of the structure; 
the interior is just theory playground (until we get the chance to drop 
wormholes into it). 

Event horizons appear naturally even in classical physics if you view 
them as the effect of superluminal escape velocities. Even in GR they 
are no "real" objects but rather the spacetime hypersurfaces with 
limit light rays.

The Schwarzschild solution is rather inescapable for any spherically 
symmetric static object, and perturbations don't seem to alter the 
essential characteristics. Do you disagree with GR altogether, or assume 
that some other effect causes the interior to behave wildly different (a 
la the baby universe example above or some weird force preventing 
collapse)?

(seems a bit too popular to me. Maybe the best way of finding out is 
simply to make a model of a classical black hole with a slowly 
decreasing mass and follow where the geodesics go)

I just have a sidenote here.

Branding works best for products with no real differentiating factors.

Ie. if there are 2 brands of coke that taste more or less the same. Then 
you choose the one with the known brand.

But in the case of Transhumanism the brand should be more of a "meta value".

Ie. If Volvo says that they have a new airbag, and so are safer to drive 
in, it only works until all the other cars also has an airbag.

Instead Volvo says that they are constantly focusing on safety using the 
latest technology.

That is what makes Volvo a brand with a "safe car" meta value.

So what is the meta value of Transhumanism?

I am not shure, but something in the line of:

"Constantly being aware of changing the human condition in response to 
new technology, and using new technology to better the human condition."

How should a utilitarian live, given Nick Bostrom's Simulation
Argument? Nick has a paper [1] on how a utilitarian should live. But in
it, he for some reason completely ignores the simulation argument that
he himself developed, and implicitly assumes that we are not living in
a simulation. His main conclusion is: "the lesson for utilitarians is
[that we should maximize] the probability that colonization will
eventually occur."

On the other hand, we have Robin Hanson's paper [2], titled "How To
Live In A Simulation". His conclusions are:

If you might be living in a simulation then all else equal you should 
care less about others, live more for today, make your world look more 
likely to become rich, expect to and try more to participate in pivotal 
events, be more entertaining and praiseworthy, and keep the famous 
people around you happier and more interested in you.

So we have one prominent extropian telling us to live for today, and
another one telling us to live for the far future. Who is right? It
occurs to me that we should take a probability-weighted average of the
two positions. If the simulation argument is correct, there is a tiny
probability that we live in root reality and what we do today affects
an astronomical number of potential future individuals (including all
future simulated individuals), and a near 1 probability that we live in
a simulation and our actions affect relatively few people. We need to
take both possibilities into account when making decisions. When we do,
I think the two positions cancel out somewhat and we can live a more
"normal" life.

Ulysses sees Galactic Dust on the rise

Since early 1992 Ulysses has been monitoring the stream of stardust flowing
through our Solar System. The stardust is embedded in the local galactic cloud
through which the Sun is moving at a speed of 26 kilometres every second. As a
result of this relative motion, a single dust grain takes twenty years to
traverse the Solar System. Observations by the DUST experiment on board Ulysses
have shown that the stream of stardust is highly affected by the Suns magnetic
field.

In the 1990s, this field, which is drawn out deep into space by the out-flowing
solar wind, kept most of the stardust out. The most recent data, 
collected up to
the end of 2002, shows that this magnetic shield has lost its protective power
during the recent solar maximum. In an upcoming publication in the Journal of
Geophysical Research ESA scientist Markus Landgraf and his co-workers from the
Max-Planck-Institute in Heidelberg report that about three times more stardust
is now able to enter the Solar System.

The reason for the weakening of the Suns magnetic shield is the increased solar
activity, which leads to a highly disordered field configuration. In the
mid-1990s, during the last solar minimum, the Suns magnetic field resembled a
dipole field with well-defined magnetic poles (North positive, South negative),
very much like the Earth. Unlike Earth, however, the Sun reverses its magnetic
polarity every 11 years. The reversal always occurs during solar maximum. Thats
when the magnetic field is highly disordered, allowing more 
interstellar dust to
enter the Solar System. It is interesting to note that in the reversed
configuration after the recent solar maximum (North negative, South positive),
the interstellar dust is even channelled more efficiently towards the inner
Solar System. So we can expect even more interstellar dust from 2005 onwards,
once the changes become fully effective.

While grains of stardust are very small, about one hundredth the diameter of a
human hair, they do not directly influence the planets of the Solar System.
However, the dust particles move very fast, and produce large numbers of
fragments when they impact asteroids or comets. It is therefore 
conceivable that
an increase in the amount of interstellar dust in the Solar System will create
more cosmic dust by collisions with asteroids and comets. We know from the
measurements by high-flying aircraft that 40,000 tonnes dust from asteroids and
comets enters the Earths atmosphere each year. It is possible that the increase
of stardust in the Solar System will influence the amount of extraterrestrial
material that rains down to Earth.

Yikes, I thought my memory was bad... If you follow the link you quote you

A big unknown here is whether future SIs will have secure property rights.
If they don't have to worry about predation, then there is no reason to
trade total computational capacity for speed. They can just take their
time and maximize the total amount of computation they do over the entire
history of the universe.  If they do have to worry about it then they will
have to sacrifice long term computation for short term computation in
order to defend themselves. These two potential scenarios imply very
different things about the optimal computing architecture of the future.

These are reasonable proximate causes for declining fertility rates in
rich societies, but I'm more interested in the ultimate (i.e.,
evolutionary) causes. Are we just lucky that unlike every other species on
Earth we are not all in a malthusian struggle for existence, or is there a
reason to expect this of most intelligent species? The former would be
better news than the latter, since it implies that the demographic
transition is part of the Great Filter, and that we're already past the
step.

Not too bad an interpretation of what I might feel then, maye with the
extension:
". . .But now let's forget all the quarrels and ideological gulfs and get
our asses over there to help"

But, well, I hope we never know.
As long as your scenario is still a fiction, let me add another reaction
from two list members:

Paul Grant / Brett Paatsch (on page 2385 of their mutually written manifesto
that is published only three months after the event, they say): "Before we
get into the details of the DNA strand of terrorist no.13., let us swiftly
repeat the implications of the insights from chapter 134 until chapter 256
of this little paper..."

"Ah. Hear the tamagochis of the night. Vat music zey make."

"This device is not powered... by batteries."

Sorry, couldn't resist.

Seriously, it is an expected and useful development. I still think 
it will not be good for fast slimming, but powering implants is 
nothing to sneeze at.

The Vatican knows very well that their founder has already performed
the food manipulation trick 2000 years ago. Until now it was known as
"the feeding of the 5000" and it was nothing more than a devout tale of
Jesus' miracles. Maybe the trustees of his deeds are eager now to get into
the details of repeating it in real time and real life. Wouldn't be the
worst of news.

If one places a hot "inverted Dyson sphere" around the event horizon 
at temperature T around a black hole of mass M, the total amount of 
blackbody radiation one can send is 16 pi G^2 T^4 M^2/ c^4. So the 
efficiency of dumping waste heat into the hole goes up with the mass 
and temperature. This twists the design of inverted M-brains half a 
turn further: the black hole cooling unit itself is going to be a 
hot object, which cools surrounding cool computronium. Hmm, this way 
the M-brain is going to look more like a dense ball surrounding the 
black hole core, in turn surrounded with some cooling versus the 
surrounding cosmic heat bath and outside that some energy producing 
systems (black hole total conversion mini-dysons?) with "classical" 
M-brain like systems that collect the energy and power the main 
system.

Assume there are n people living within the average sim (perhaps 
around 10^10 or so) and N people living in the root reality. Root 
reality runs X sims, making the total amount of lives in it N+nX. 
The probability of living in a sim (if you are randomly selected) is 
nX/(N+nX). So if you don't know where you live, the expected number 
of people to be utilitarian about (all people in the "universe" 
you can reach) is n^2 X/(N+nX) + N^2 /(N+nX).

If X is small the second term will dominate, as well as if 
n sqrt(X) << N. In this case we will likely live in root reality and 
should act that way. If we have reason to believe that n sqrt(X) >> 
N, then we should act more like sims. 

Can we estimate N and X? A basic (and minimal) guess of the future
superciv would be something on the order of an M-brain. Robert 
calculated that it could do an ancestor sim in 1e-5 cpu seconds, 
which presumably has n=10^11 or so. It could likely sustain around 
1e16 human-level entities, so N=1e16 if all activity is used for 
beings. If the fraction f of resources is used for sims, we get 
N=(1-f)10^16 and X=f 10^5. But these are numbers per second; if we 
assume T repetitions of this we get X = f T 10^5, N=(1-f)10^16 
(since the entities are likely immortal and do not depend on T). T 
is on the order of trillions of years, so we set T=1e19

We get
10^27 f T /((1-f)10^16+f T 10^16) + (1-f)^2 10^32 /(10^16(1-f+fT))
= 10^11 fT/(1-f+fT) + (1-f)^2 10^16/(1-f+fT)
= 1e30 f/(1-f+f1e19) + (1-f)^2 1e16 /(1-f+f1e19)
~= 1e11 + 1e-3 (assuming f >> 1e-19)

So the answer seems to be that we should behave like sims. But this 
is largely based on the idea that the M-brain inhabitants (N) are 
just immortal - if they have generations shifting, then they also

Has anyone any insight on this? I didn't think about inverting the
process, mostly because I have no idea on how to do it, but the concept
seems really interesting - just stick your fingers into the outlet each
morning and you're fine for the day!

OK, I think I can have a go at this one.
Basically, your tautological thesis is simply not true.
i.e. it is not what happens in the world as we know it.

First, a primer on the two population types:-

There are two basic strategies for populations, r-Strategists and
K-Strategists.

r-strategists

The r-strategists approach to continued survival is through rapid
reproduction, i.e., a high value of r. In fact, if we consider an
organism a pest, it is probably an r-strategist.

In general r-strategists share a number of features:

1. They are usually found in disturbed and/or transitory habitats.
2. They have short life spans. The house mouse, with a maximum life span
of 3 years, is an r-strategist.
3. They begin breeding early in life.
4. They usually have short generation times; that is, they have short
gestation periods and are soon ready to produce another crop of young.
The housefly can produce 7 generations each year (each of about 120 young).
5. They produce large numbers of offspring. The American oyster,
releasing a million eggs in one season, is an r-strategist. Most of its
offspring will die, but the sheer size of its output increases the
likelihood that some offspring will disperse to new habitats.
6. They take little care of their offspring, and infant mortality is
huge. Although humans are not r-strategists, the higher reproductive
rate in countries like India may well be a response to the higher rates
of infant mortality.
7. They have efficient means of dispersal to new habitats.

For r-strategists, alleles that enhance any of the traits listed above
will be favored by natural selection.



K-strategists

When a habitat becomes filled with a diverse collection of creatures
competing with one another for the necessities of life, the advantage
shifts to K-strategists. K-strategists have stable populations that are
close to K (the maximum population an environment can support). There is
nothing to be gained from a high r. The species will benefit most by a
close adaptation to the conditions of its environment.
Typically, K-strategists share these qualities:

1. They are usually found in stable habitats. Most of the species in a
mature forest will be K-strategists.
2. They have long life spans. The elephant and the tortoise are
K-strategists.
3. They begin breeding later in life.
4. They usually have long generation times. It takes 9 months to produce
a human baby.
5. Most produce small numbers of offspring. Birds are K-strategists,
most species producing fewer than a dozen young each year.
6. They take good care of their young. Infant mortality tends to be low.
7. K-strategists typically have evolved in such a way that they become
increasingly efficient at exploiting an ever-narrower slice of their
environment. Thus it is not surprising that many endangered species are
K-strategists.

For K-strategists, alleles that enhance their ability to exploit the
resources of their habitat; that is, to increase the carrying capacity,
K, of their environment, will be favored by natural selection.



Right, read all that?  Pay attention at the back!


It seems probable to me that an advanced civilization will be a
K-strategy, monoculture population with no need or desire for rapid
reproduction. (They may send out probes for curiosity's sake, but no
expansion).

However, Lee may well claim that all bets are off and an advanced
civilization can have whatever reproduction rate that Lee likes. What
Lee wants is an r-strategy reproduction rate linked to an advanced
K-strategy civilization. Very unlikely, in my opinion.

So, here is a more general discussion on why K-strategy advanced
civilizations will not do rapid expansion.

If everything was perfect for a population and all the individuals in
the population survived and reproduced at the maximum rate, that growth
rate is called the biotic potential. For example, when fish are
introduced into a lake where there is plenty of food and space and there
are no predators, the fish can reproduce at their biotic potential, but
not for a long time. This is exponential growth, until a limit is
reached. This is the perfect growth case that Lee believes will apply to
at least one advanced civilization which will take over the universe and
seed it with millions of Lee impressionists.
(I'm the real Lee! - No, I am .....  No, It's me really ........:)

The possible limiting factors to population growth are many and
exponential growth must successfully defeat every one of them.
Note 1:  Perfect reproduction assumes perfection all the way down.


Here are some of the possible limiting factors to population growth:
(Not all of which will necessarily apply to a post-singularity civilization)


Birth Rate. Assuming advanced civilizations have complete control of
reproduction, then choice is the limiting factor here.
How many factories do we want to build, churning out mini-Lees?
Why would I allow him to do this, when mini-Bills are obviously much to
be preferred? ;)
You must also assume that mini-Lees are instantly self-supporting or
your time and resources will be spent supporting them (and limiting your
reproduction to what you can support).
Why reproduce if the existing population is not dying?
How will it benefit the existing population? (rather than being a drain
on resources).
Spreading the population around as security against disasters could be
thought of as a benefit. But an immortal civilization with total control
of the environment probably deals with any problems as a triviality.
Try to think of reasons that might appeal to a very advanced immortal
civilization (rather than just procreating to spread my genes around).

Unlimited resources or life energy. A given supply of food and water
might be enough for a small population density. However, that same
supply might not be enough for a high-density population, and
competition among the individuals of the population would develop.
Competition is a force for evolution to occur. An advanced civilization
will only evolve by choice.
Note 2:   Unlimited resources means no competition, no competition means
no natural evolution.
Note 3:   Unlimited reproduction will eat the universe.

Stress.  Many species need lots of territory to breed, like the mountain
lion. If there is no room, an organism can become stressed and have
lower birth rates.
Note 4:   Unlimited reproduction means unlimited expansion and physical
movement between stars.

Pollution. Population affects the environment. So you have to devote
time and energy to cleaning up the mess.
Population growth is the primary source of environmental damage.
Jacques Cousteau.

Space. This is an obvious limiting factor, especially if you think of
fish in a lake. If you assume the universe is unlimited, then you can
keep on expanding, eating as you go. Although as the universe seems to
be expanding faster and faster, there may be a limit to what you can reach.

Predators. Higher densities of a prey population attract more predators
and as the number of prey increases, so does the number of predators. On
the other hand, if the number of prey decreases, so does the number of
predators. Unlimited growth assumes that you won't meet any predators.
Are the Blue Meanies waiting to pounce?

Other exponential growth populations. You might meet aliens coming the
other way as you expand. If you meet yourself, then you've proved that
it is a closed universe. ;)

Diseases. Diseases can certainly have an impact on birth rate and thus
affect growth rate. Since many diseases are contagious, they are
therefore dependent on density. This could include mental infections
which could cause population restrictions.

Parasitism. Parasitism is a relationship where one organism (the
parasite) feeds on the tissues or body fluids of another organism (the
host). In this type of relationship the parasite benefits and the host
is harmed, sometimes to the point of killing the host. Like diseases,
since parasites spread easier in a high-density host, their impact
depends on the density.

The Universe. Natural disasters, meteor strikes, novae, black holes -
It's dangerous out there!


Ooooh! To frightening for me. I'm going back to my rocking chair now :)

Clearly we need more than energy to function. We need nutrients to
build new protein and lipids for various functions, replacements for
lost molecules and of course lots of water. We lose plenty of
molecules and atoms because of the way we are evolved; it is easier
to get replacements than recycle.

A device that took ADP and phosphoric acid to ATP would need to be
intracellular, since ATP is so quickly burned. A device that
converted carbon dioxide and water to glucose would be more easily
integrated, although it would have some cooling issues
(energetically uphill, thermodynamic losses, likely at least a few
tens of watts for normal metabolism). It would need to keep track of 
insulin levels in order not to cause type II diabetes.

Using such a device in everyday life would be troublesome, since we 
can too easily get enough glucose anyway. The device might detect it 
and turn off (and even go into glucose burning mode), but it would 
not be much of an help. In an emergency it could provide energy, but 
there remains a need for protein, fats and some other essentials, 
and when you eat them you can just as easy get the calories.

So in the end the device might be less useful than it seems. If it 
nanofactures other nutrients, e.g. from recycled waste, then it 
would be more useful.

### I wonder what would happen if you tried to take into account the
inflationary model of our universe's creation - say, if there is a
continuous front of inflation producing a bubble, then the volume of space
freshly produced would be much higher than the volume of space produced a
longer time ago. The amount of fresh galaxies, with root reality-dwelling
civilizations and no sims would be possibly higher than the volume of space
with older races and simulations, for any point in time since the initiation
of the inflation.

If you add to it the uncertainties about the amount of resources that are
going to be used for simulation rather than root-reality experience (to give
an answer here you need an advanced course in posthuman psychology, maybe
even applied theology), the number of orders of magnitude we have to take
into account in trying to answer the reality/simulation question becomes
totally unmanageable.

To some people, this is undoubtedly true, but any new idea or set of ideas
may sound goofy when it's new.  (I'll address whether extropianism is "new,"
a matter you question in another post, in the other thread you started.)
 Only time will tell whether an idea that is considered "goofy" when it
is new will become less so over time.

This isn't a new allegation against transhumanist ideas, and one that I
think has been answered well by others both in years past and in response
to this post.  My short answer is that there are a number of assumptions
in the proposed indictment, each of which have to be addressed separately,
and none of which stand up to close scrutiny.  The first and most important
is whether the projections of possible "future bodies" transhumanists talk
about are "impossible."  Of course, there is wide range of such projects,
from the simplest and most straightforward kinds of augmentation with near-term
technology (already achieved, really, by nascent cyborgs such as people
in wheelchairs, people who use various existing prosthetics, etc), to more
radical genetic and biochemical and biomechanical augmentation, through
conceptions such as more or less complete uploads.  All of these things
seem "possible" to me, although WHEN they may be possible is open to question
and discussion.  So the first reply is that the "bodies" we discuss aren't
impossible -- they just aren't possible YET.

The second point is whether there's some kind of "denial of the flesh" going
on in transhumanism and extropianism.  I would certainly say not, although
there is a definite strain of "mentalism" in some of the discussion of the
more advanced kinds of uploading that one could read a kind of "anticarnic"
(to coin a term) desire into.  Speaking for myself, it's precisely because
I DO enjoy the pleasures that flesh and mind together offer that I consider
myself an extropian and a transhumanist.  I like life and want more of it
for a longer period of time.  

Question: When a person who happens to be a quadriplegic works to restore
the functioning of his limbs, is he in some kind of "denial of his flesh?"
 In a sense, yes: He's in denial of his flesh AS IT IS.  He wants BETTER
FLESH.  The thing that defines transhumanism and extropian thought is the
rejection of the "natural human" as the limit on what we can be, just as
the quadriplegic rejects his immobile state as a limit.

I -- and many other transhumanists and extropians I know are far from "promoters
of an ascetic ideal:" We like to have fun with our bodies and want to have
more fun with better bodies and better minds.

Far, far too long to post here, but here are a couple of choice 
quotes:

"'I am a 6 foot, 185 pound, 40 year-old, well-educated, married 
white male American, with two children. I have a wife Peggy, and 
sons Tommy and Andy,' announces Hanson on his personal home page. 
All well and good so far, although you might be wondering why we 
needed to know his exact weight. Or that he's white. Both those 
details, and the fact that he's 'well-educated' are pretty 
superfluous in Extropian circles, where the disciples are uniformly 
white and well educated. We're not sure if they all weigh 185 
pounds, but they're certainly very, very rich."

[...]

"Extropianism, we were told, expoused 'extremely advanced 
technology' and displayed 'dedicated, immovable optimism'. The hated 
gubberment got it particularly hard from these wealthy uberkinder, 
for whom the State was 'regarded as one of the major restrictive 
forces in the Milky Way galaxy.'"

Long article, but well worth reading.

Sounds like extropy to me :-), and its emphasis on critical thinking and 
practical optimism.

I like the idea of a metal value of transhumanism.

### I think I already had this discussion before on this list, with Eugen
Leitl and you, but maybe we talked only about action transparency, not about
thought transparency.

All the arguments I have in favor of action transparency are valid for
thought transparency. Basically, it's too good for economic efficiency to be
in the long run rejected. I believe that whether you/I/we want it or not,
sooner or later there will be a fully transparent society (assuming that
it's technologically possible), and it will out-think, out-produce and
out-fight all competition. This has little to do with extropy,
enlightenment, tolerance, and could be a total dystopia, but our opinion
about this possibility will not change much.

Most likely though it will not be so bad. Read "The Truth Machine" by James
Halperin.

One can accept it now, and think about improving one's chances of long-term
survival based on this assumption, or reject it. I choose the former
approach. Future will tell which one is correct.

While I agree with all of those things I doubt I would say most of them the 
same day.  I might more likely say (after expressing horror, disgust, anger, 
fear, condolences and so on):

"Lets find who was responsible and bring them to justice.  But we should not 
lose our own freedoms in the process or pick entire countries to war with 
preemptively.  Doing so leads to nothing but more of the same for us and hell 
for however many of them we choose."

Dunno if he was implying that but I believe that is certainly true.  It is a 
historical fact that the use of terrorism on American soil to promote 
policies of the day has been considered during at least some administrations.

If someone gets to close to the truth then their career is ruined and the 
evidence is ruled critical to "national security" and never sees enough 
daylight to bring the guilty to justice.   The machinery to protect those in 
power is in place and well maintained.

Are you kidding?  Clinton was grilled publicly for years over a sexual 
indiscretion.  Bush and company shut down investigations, refuse 
Congressional subpoenas,  lie to the people to justify a war,  rewrite or 
throw out treaties, eviscerate FOIA, ask for and receive powers to gut 
whatever freedoms they want including revoking citizenship and the sheeple 
say almost nothing at all.   Now which side is benefitting from a double 
standard?

### No, I do not think I would be fool, much less a bloody one, for applying
common sense to this issue - if you allow yourself to make arbitrary
assumptions about reality (e.g. there are civs ready to kill, but not
willing to warn, but not willing to kill preventatively, more advanced yet
dependent on our scientific contributions, invisible but omnipresent,
capable of preventing self-replicating rape of galaxies from their sources,
but afraid of our billions-of-years-behind von Neumann probes, etc.), you
can justify any arbitrary course of action. So, making arbitrary assumptions
about reality is not the way to make good decisions.

This is why we believe only what reality forces us to believe in, and act
accordingly. I believe my chair has legs because I see them and I can
painfully bump against them. In other words, the inborn priors (evolved
structure of brain) and data acquired over my lifetime converge, through a
process of recursive, self-referential Bayesian network inference, on the
belief that my chair has legs. There is no sufficient, convergent body of
theory and sensory data allowing similar degree of confidence in matters of
interstellar politics. No visible galactic civs, no warnings, no contact,
means we can go and take what we want, until reality tells us otherwise.
Just like a child who *has* to bump against things to acquire the correct
representation of chairs and other things.

I read all that (really!) and I don't think it matters,
because, essentially, the universe at large is not the
world as we know it.  The current evolutionary space is
incredibly limited in comparison to even our galaxy, and
all the strategy differences are for environments which
are already full of competing organisms.

Those arguments will be great for explaining why not every
solar group sends out colonization groups when the visible
universe is full of life.  It doesn't at all provide an
explanation of why a single solar group wouldn't bother to
colonize any of the astronomically greater resources
available and visible to it.

Taking out Osama, or capturing him, will not end the threat. When I
speak of progress that solves the problem I am talking about helping to
democratize the muslim world, and to civilize it with republican
protections of individual liberties.

The polish people are very pro-US for very good reason, so the rulers
there don't need anti-US attitudes. What I am talking about are
countries which are repressive and use an anti-US stance, either in
their government controlled media, in the educational system, or in
their actual pronouncements, to maintain some measure of popular support.

You don't get it. GM food prevents starvation in an overpopulated
world. Sex ed, birth control, homosexuality, and womens rights all
reduce birth rates. The Church is a business. Their customer is God,
and their product is souls. Their job is to produce as many souls for
God (and as few against Him) as possible. GM food helps this goal.

What is so funny about this article, as well as that on the US News
that labelled Robin "economist for Starfleet", is that, while the
writers are trying to be mocking and dismissive, there is a significant
percent of the population that sees a sort of credibility in such
labels. Among the trekkie generation, if the major media labels you
"Chief Economist of Starfleet Command", you are going to be listened to
more closely by anyone with a future-oriented mindset.

I predict that the Pentagon, after all of this blows over, will quietly
hire Robin for a lot more work... there is no such thing as bad publicity...

### This is a neat story. But, there is no quantified difference between the
two strategists, all the differences are given in qualitative terms (long,
short, large, small). If you only change the scale a bit, you can no longer
decide whether a given organism is a k- or r-strategist. Say, E.coli, once
the nutrients are scarce, starts changing its metabolism, no longer produces
a lot of offspring, waits long to breed, is more efficient at using
resources...etc, compared to the log-phase cell. A human family placed in
Pleistocene America starts breeding at a crazy rate, overrunning the
continent in a few hundred years, in stark contrast to the slow growth of
human lineages with established competition.

Basically, an r-strategist is a k-strategist in optimal circumstances, with
no competition. A k-strategist is an r-strategist in lean times.

No basis for assuming any strategy as universal among space-capable civs.

Am surprised that Banks didn't predict such technology for the Culture.
Considering the mods they get done, it shouldn't be hard (no pun
intended) to embed a vibratory device powered by blood in one's sexual
organs....

Then again, I can also forsee a new SF myth: that vampires are
posthumans who have too many embedded devices for their own bone marrow
to supply, and so must harvest blood from others...

On the contrary, since your entire blood supply will power a 100 watt
light bulb, imagine being a luminous technicolor cowboy on the rave
dance floor, strobing and blinking your pounds away...

What would be needed would be a fuel cell that can burn fatty acids instead.

I'll try to keep this from being a spoiler.  In the series, of course, 
there is widespread galactic civilization, with much contact and 
conflict between family groups.  In the earlier books, the older 
civilizations are known, but not much in evidence.  In the final (so 
far) book, we actually get to mingle with the older civilizations, and 
go on a grand tour.  The very oldest civilizations seem to 
predominantly be clustered in retirement communities around black 
holes.  To say more about their goals or what brings them there would 
be to give too much away.

It seems to be an exclusively web based publication, though it does
behave much like any other British tabloid journalist rag in hating
anybody on the upswing, and doing their best to drag them back down in
the muck. Note that their mascot is the vulture.

INteresting quote from the above article:


>>>>

Both those details, and the fact that he's "well-educated" are pretty 
superfluous in Extropian circles, where the disciples are uniformly white and 
well educated. We're not sure if they all weigh 185 pounds, but they're 
certainly very, very rich. 

How did it start? 

A few years ago a bunch of extremely wealthy Californians met, liked the look 
of each other a lot, and formed a group called Extropians. Revealed to the 
world in a Wired article in 1994 as "a philosophy of boundless expansion, of 
upward - and outwardness, of fantastic superabundance," their greeting was 
described in some quite painful detail, for us, thus: 
>>>>>




Extremely wealthy, huh? Naw, I doubt it...maybe greg burch, the law firm 
partner, but as for the other extropians often quoted in the media?  Hmmmm....

 I have to wonder how this wealth attribute came to be associated with 
extropians. A lot of extropians are grad students....not exactly a breeding 
ground for extreme wealth, that. Even recently graduated PHD are seldom 
wealthy....unless they inherited it.  Which doesn't exactly say much...or 
does it?

For some decisions this might cancel but for others it would not.
As you've presented it, you'd give less weight to 25 years from now,
replaced both by today and by a million years from now.

I noted that they are involved in using distributed computing
for SETI and chasing cancer cures etc. I guessed they were
pretty small beer but I don't really know. 

Free speech seems overpriced on occasion. I wouldn't
worry though. I don't know you that well and the nature 
of the piece doesn't exactly come across as balanced. 

You've lots of room for deniability if you want it. The 
piece states you don't consider yourself an Extropian
but your followers are :-)

Play this write and it can spin to your favour imo.

The Register is a well respected and irreverent hardcore technology and 
politics internet publication.  However, it has a pretty large readership. 
It's articles are often quoted and referenced in online blogs.  I would not 
be surprised if this article gets some exposure in online blogs such as 
metafilter or plastic. From there a couple of print outlets may pick up this 
article. 

The vicious tone of the article will prevent it from being picked up by more 
mainstream publications. 

However, given the mediagenicity of this terrorism market story, as evidenced 
by the degree of exposure we have seen for it recently, combined with 
the "sexy" tie-in to extropianism and cryonics (Hanson is signed up) I would 
expect that one or more major print outlets will soon do a followup, and 
cleaned up, article based on tying together the terror market and 
extropianism and cryonics.  Triple threat mediagenicity, there.  Batten down 
the hatches, etc.

I must say that some of the earlier media exposure and websites published by 
the extropians leave them (and us cryos) wide open for articles like the 
Register piece.  For example, the handshake referenced in the article, plus 
the "Best do it so" stuff.  Talk about exposing your flank....

Would you say this issue sums up to whether there is DIRECT INTERFACE WITH
THE NERVOUS SYSTEM or not? If so, that creates a special kind of cyborg, a
"neurobot" if you will. Anybody with a heart implant is a cyborg, but
Warwick may have been the first neurobot.

for Public Policy..."

PENTAGON SCRAPS INFORMATION MARKET

Even those who understandably scorned the Pentagon's recently 
cancelled Policy Analysis Market (PAM) -- a.k.a. the terrorism 
futures market, as some detractors called it -- should admit that it 
was innovative in a badly needed way.

In proposing a virtual market to help predict contingencies in the 
Middle East and elsewhere, PAM set out to achieve what years of 
pseudo-reform of U.S. military and intelligence agencies had failed 
even to attempt -- to bypass the hierarchical bureaucracy that has 
led to numerous deadly intelligence failures.

By making use of the knowledge of thousands of people willing to put 
their money on the line (maximum bet: $100), PAM was based on the 
insight that markets, driven by economic actors with powerful 
incentives to guess correctly, often know better than a handful of 
professional prognosticators. This point has been well illustrated by 
the web-based Iowa Political Stock Market, a virtual market that has 
consistently predicted election outcomes more accurately than 
pollsters.

Because PAM was controversial for more than one reason, it should not 
be surprising that it was misrepresented by politicians and the media.

"Contrary to impressions in the media, the primary purpose of the PAM 
was not to predict individual events of terrorism but rather to 
predict inputs into terrorism such as the economic growth rates of 
countries in the Middle East, political instability, and military 
activity," write Alexander Tabarrok, research director of the 
Independent Institute, and Robin Hanson, the principal architect of 
the Policy Analysis Market, in a new op-ed.

Rather, write Tabarrok and Hanson, PAM was to help answer such 
questions as "What would happen to unrest in the Middle East if the 
US withdrew its troops in Saudi Arabia" and "How would Jordan fare 
politically if the 'roadmap' were successfully implemented?"

Recent history suggests that traditional approaches to such 
questions, even if well-informed, can become ignored or politicized.

"The yes-man phenomena means that information doesn't rise from the 
field to the decision-makers," write Tabarrok and Hanson. "And 
sometimes the bosses don't want to hear what the field has to say. 
Remember the CIA and FBI analysts who repeatedly tried to signal 
their worries about terrorism to their superiors but were rebuffed? 
In contrast, a PAM would produce a public and easily understood 
number that would be difficult to ignore."

Fortunately, the future of such "information markets," "prediction 
aggregators," or "idea futures" doesn't rest on government funding 
and would be managed better without it. A few visionary institutions, 
such as Hewlett-Packard, have already used them to aid in 
decision-making, and many more will be adopted. But as with so many 
innovations, don't expect the government to employ them effectively 
for a long, long time.

Hanson (8/4/03)

By including the word 'generally' above aren't you in

In the real world, where our moral judgement is supposed 
to assist us, (or at least that is my contention) we are 
*never* fully prescient and so there is always *some* 
chance the suspected or likely mugger may not in fact
mug us. Assuming one values oneself, how can we do
otherwise than weigh up the chances as best we can?
My answer - we can't. Therefore the point becomes 
how best we can. 

At this point I think its worth distinguishing between 
a moral code, which may be a preconsidered 
framework that one uses to help reach a particular 
moral judgement and moral judgements per se. 

There are *no* moral codes that provide definitive
answers to all the moral dilemmas that arise just as
there are no maps on a scale of 1:1, therefore whenever
a particular moral judgement is required there is no
dodging that the subjective individual must make it
which or without the benefit of a more or less 
sophisticated moral code.

Actually I'd say in the circumstances you describe 
the person *has* acted morally, but with poor 
judgement, so poor in fact that they may be found
to have acted illegally. 

> The point being that you have to consider the

Sure. But the "you" in this case is a subjective individual
using their own judgement, when such judgement may 
or may not be particularly good. So it also behooves us to 
consider the granularity of the *moral code* that is taken 
by many of us into situations where it can guide particular
moral judgements. 

If one is running around in 2003 holding that the 10 
commandments are all the moral code that is needed 
one is going to come up against some particularly 
curly challenges in interpreting how to operationalise
the directive that though shalt not kill. Even this simple
edict is subject to interpretation. Life in 2003 is known
to take place on more than the organismic level. Cells
are alive. And human cancer cells are human life. 
Clearly it is absurb to argue that a cancer cell or a 
multiples of them are of moral weight with a person
dying of cancer. Yet this is not much of an exaggeration
beyond the proposition that say all embryos are a form of
human life when by human life what is obviously meant
is personhood.

Before laws can be set that codify legally what may and
may not be done it is prudent to have a moral disucssion
where the words we use do not obfuscate the reals 
issues at hand. Issues such as how does a civil society
weight the rights or potential persons (embryos, fetus etc
at different stages). When we do not decide or address
these questions public policy continues to be made on
the basis of outdated moral and legal codes. And persons
suffer needlessly.

Really? I think the key word here is 'tend'. How could you
put a moral obligation on someone to act better than the
best of their abilities and knowledge?  

Do you think there is a moral sphere separate from the 
legal sphere? Some apparently don't. I think the legal sphere
is smaller than the morals sphere.

Actually I think BR would hold the line even in the face of
your example. But BR overlooked a few things as Godel
pointed out. Maybe he abandoned the search for a rational
ethics too early.

Legally no. Morally? Depends. By the code I've been arguing it
*would* make a difference if there was some net difference in 
utility to you. ie. If you really *could* make the decision to 
hallucinate to preserve your sanity (or not) then I'd argue the
moral choice is the one that you *think* will result in the best
outcome for you. 

Whether it would in fact yeild the best outcome for you is not
the point as the facts of the outcome are not knowable to you
at the time you decide. 

Now thats the moral code. The reason for the moral code is
that usually judgements will be required in real life which one 
cannot anticipate and the better, the more sophisticated your
moral code the better, (the more enlightened) your judgement
of your own best interests will be. 

In this particular case I don't think there is much latitude for
immoral action as you really would be alone on the desert
island in the situation you stipulate. Of course the situation
you stipulate could not arise. One would never know one
was going to be marooned for sixty years AND CHOOSE
to hallucinate. Hallucinations for the most part are going
to be dysfunctional even on the island.

This seems to be confounding sanity with ethics. Which is 
problematic if the insane cannot make sound judgements
in their own interests by virtue of being insane.

So do I. The human condition is mortal. It would hardly 
behoove us to dwell on it excessively and abandon hope when
there was none. Perhaps the illusion of a life after death only
becomes dysfunctional when it gets in the way of the realisation
of longer life in practice.  

In the vast majority of cases self-delusion *is* going to be 
harmful. In those circumstances where it is not harmful to 
anyone including the person who is self-deluded then I'd
agree it not immoral.

I think this is pure speculation. Would a less intelligent you
be you? If you think so there may be possibilites for you 
to chart a life for yourself that involves more happiness
and less intellect. But personally I don't think so. How do 
you aim at happiness without identifying something that
will make you happy. Happiness is not itself a thing that
can be persued. 

Happiness is not a object its a consequence. Doing things
makes us happy. Actually drugs and stimulation to neural
centres probaly make us happy in a sort too. But these 
seem to involve short term happiness (pleasure) for long
term happiness. (I think I'm picking up Bishop Berkley here
but could be mistaken).

> This is of

I don't I think its premature at best and problematic at
worst. One cannot be happy without a cause. Happiness
per se is not persuable. Pleasure is. Lesser levels of 
sentience are. But I doubt these are what appeal to you
as an alternative. 

> Ergo self-delusion

Can you think of a form of happiness that you could choose
to pursue where happiness qua happiness was not the goal?

I think you will find that happiness is a side effect. It cannot
be approached directedly at though it were a destination.
It arises as a result of achieving or doing other things. Things
which are in accordance with our nature as rational social
beings.

Ah I think you missed my point. The potential to persuade 
using the sociability aspect *is* far stronger when individuals
are powerless and my point is that the all those who are mortal
are now becoming *aware* that they possess a poor form of
wealth and power if it can't extend their life and health. There
is an opportunity there to get them to revisit the social compact.
But these cagey old survivers will not fall for bs. When arguments
are put to them that are not in their interest they will not buy into
them.

So in my view a moral argument cannot be put to a rich or
powerful individual unless it is couched in terms of offering
*something* for them. We live in an historic period. In this 
period it might be possible to promote a policy of more life
for all or more life for none. 

The alternative may be cabals of the powerful working to 
'immortalise' themselves. Such a scenario may restart 
"history" whose demise was greatly exaggerated.

They learn to reason and they learn to use language to persuade.
They learn to understand what they want. This gives them the
best chance to make their way and improve their situation as
they go. It does not guarantee them success. The universe in
which hard work gurantees success is not this one in my view.

I would have been happy to point out to the unibomber that
he was born social, so much so that he couldn't raise his head
to feed.

Then I'd ask him where his sociability ended. It could be an
insightful conversation.

None are capable of going it alone yet. But here is the point
in the future we may re-engineer ourselves to such an extent
that some may indeed feel capable of going it alone. And these
indivduals will not necessarily be able to be reasoned with 
with the same starting premises. These individuals may become
meglomanical persuing as the culmination of their individuality
dominance over all else. Because, if you have no empathy 
- why the hell not?

Everyone is social to a degree. Am I really saying that everyone 
is reachable through their residual sociability. I doubt it. I think
nature throws up dysfunctional types of all forms and some
genuine sociopaths can probably only be dealt with as amoral
threats.

Babies will go with the flow and be sociable until their selfish
desires are frustrated. Then they have to learn to compromise
or they engage the world with power plays and as babies they
loss. But some learn enough from the lesson to grow older and
play better and win for a time. But in the end in 2003 the 
default prognosis is that all of us are dead. The premium is
on cooperation. To get people to cooperate you have to respect
their rational desire to look after their own interests. You have
to offer them deals that really are win win, or you have to expect
that their will be conflict and they have no moral obligation to 
buckle under and surrender their resources and power.

Yes. Imo that is a possibility. For me the interest in morality
is linked to an interest in politics and in the means by which the
possibility may more become a probability in my life time. 
Hey I am social, but I am also rational, and I am in this for
me :-)

No they optimised. But I'd argue they have sold themselves
short. They could and may in may cases yet achieve more.

No because we *are* social we learn at least some moral
codes as we becomes socialised. We maybe go through
something like Kohlbergs levels of moral reasoning. 
We learn terms like utlilitarianism and consequentialism
and from this social stock of idea on moral codes we
fashion our own. We don't invent from scratch. 
I'm suggesting we van bet better moral codes into the
ground water. These won;t remove from individuals the
need to make moral judgements but they will increase 
the likelihood that reason and enlightenment are brought
to the process of agreement making and law making.

Absolutely. I am in my view doing a pretty poor and
very longwinded effort at that here. But perhaps in 
working it through like this I will be able to distill it
into something shorter and more convincing because
it will appeal to people as a sort of empowering 
knowledge. Like probability theory, or tit for tat.

No I offer them the viewpoint that getting my spleen
will come at great risk to them and provide them 
little nourishment. I suggest that they are better of 
regsrding me as a resource and seeking to cooperate
with me.  I am pretty resourceful and persuasive.
In many cases I'd expect to pull it off because I would
really find ways to cooperate. But in some cases
the universe is a bitch. If the other guy seems me
as food and I can't persuade him otherwise his 
circumstances and mine may genuinely be that 
desperate. Then, one of us will die and one of us
will eat.

The optimal solution for me, for the other of for 
both of us? It is in my view more likely to be the
optimal solution in more circumstances because it
is the more rationally approached solution and 
by being rationally approached we can consider
each others real needs and measure each others
real willingness to compromise AND at the
end of the day we can always fall back on the
option to compete. Come that unfortunate outcome.
I would compete *very* hard.

Pre-emption is slippery. Consider the word 
pretext. Give a politician a pretext and they are no
longer arguing pre-emption they are arguing reasonable
and measured response.

I think it does matter that its rational not emotional or faith
or belief based because reasoning facilitates coomunication
and understanding between sovereign agents far more 
effectively. Reason has as its tool language. I am not pooh
poohing emotion. Emotion is what makes life worth living
by emotions cannot be conveyed in the same way as 
reasons. Nor are they are reviewable and reliable in making
judgements. In science we do well to acknowledge that out
emotions can mislead us. I think we do well also to acknowledge
this in the formulation of contracts and laws.

It does those who finally want to munch on my spleen I regard
as forces of nature like sharks or lions. I don't regard their desire
to eat me as immoral but I definately regard my desire to avoid
being eaten as just and I feel fully free to exterminate such with
extreme prejudice.

There are no *complete loners* that I am aware of. Yet the time
of the complete loner is likely to be in the future and these guys
cou;ld be very dangerous. For now dysfunctional loners that
poss a threat, when they poss a threat are fair game for 
taking action against. 

There are patterns in most forms of insanity. I'd take my 
understanding of the particular person and their alledged ailment
into account and go from there. The code doesn't prescibe a 
solution to all it only provides a (better I hope) framework. 
Individual judgements still need to be made.

I think my systme is more predictable than others. Those 
thatt present rationally are quickly processes rationally for
cooperate options and compete threats. Those that don't
operate in a rational paradign still fall into patterns. Animals
are not rational, inanimate objects are not rational, if a person
behaves in an irrational way they can often make themselves
grist for my mill or the mill of others that do act rationally
and with an eye for the political.

You miss the political point. The audience is the voting public. It is
up to extropians to convince them of our relatively non-conservative
agendas or tohave to wear the policies that are put in place. 

It is for us to be smart in our communications or wear the
consequences ofnot being. When we use the word belief we weaken
our cases where they should be strongest -we usually have reasoned
and we unlike our opponents (should be) open to the superior 
argument.

Often the extropic message is a most persuasiveluy put
when it is put in terms of clear and unambiguous 
communication. 

I have personally seen huge decisons on national policy
"justified" by political leaders not on the basis of the
evidence but on the basis of belief.

Very much so. Fact is the legislation that exists in our
countries is established in a particular way. There is no
point wishing it were otherwise, it is as it is. Therefore
I'd rather be an effective lobbyist for the policies and
laws I want to see enacted (or not enacted) then not
be.

Perhaps you are still relatively young and have yet to grow your political
teeth. This is fair enough. If you come to see the connection between
the stuff we aspire to and the legislations that goes through nation 
parliament on stem cells and nanotechnology and intellectual property
you may see things differently. I do not mean to be patronising. 
Actually I'd like to be empowering. Many young extropes could be
potent political forces for change in their own individual right if only
they perceived the need and put some time into acquiring the skills.

Mr. Orlowski,
I must seriously object to the many bigoted and offensive things you
wrote in your piece on Robin Hanson and the transhumanist movement.
Just where do you get off writing hate speech which would get you
prosecuted if you were talking this way about blacks, hispanics, or
women? All that aside, I think you should be aware of the many
innacuracies in your article:

Inaccuracy #1: Extropians are wealthy.
This is quite untrue. While some have made enough money from dot com
ventures to be financially secure, most have not. I myself am a former
tech writer working as a diesel mechanic. Many extropians are grad or
undergrad college students, quite poor or scraping by, and staying in
school because the job market stinks so badly.

Inaccuracy #2: Robin Hanson is wealthy.
Robin, who I know personally, is hardly wealthy. He supports a wife and
two kids on the salary of an assistant professor. The only wealth he
has is the immense number of friends he has and admirers of his many
contributions to his field.

Inaccuracy #3: Extropians are all white.
This is the worst sort of racist backhanded accusation. There are a
number of extropians who are black, hispanic, asian, native american,
among many other nationalities and ethnicities, as well as sexual
preferences and genders. And even if we were all straight white males,
does this automatically make us deserving of your hate? Are we all part
of the oppressor class simply because of our genes? I myself never
inherited anything, dropped out of college (twice now) due to finances,
and the highest leadership positions I've held were on the board of
directors of my local gun club and as an executive of a company I once
helped found.

The fact is, as was plain in your article, was that you couldn't find
much that other people had to say that was bad about us or Robin, so
you had to make up a bunch of absolute garbage in your typically
cynical vulturous tabloid journalist way.

As for the PAM, here is a rhetorical question for you to ponder: How
are individuals betting on the PAM futures market any less morbid than
you buying an insurance policy on your spouse's life???? That is, after
all, what you are doing when you buy insurance: you are betting that
something bad is going to happen, and you get paid off if you are
right.

The PAM only serves as a means to bribe terrorists to become informers
on their comrades, thus useful in preventing the events they are meant
to predict. Note that an informer on PAM would get paid whether the
ATTEMPT succeeds or not. Arafat needent be assasinated, so long as an
attempt is made. 

In this light, it actually seems that the PAM is actually LESS morbid
than you getting life insurance on your spouse. With your insurance,
your spouse HAS to die. With PAM, (s)he would only need to be in a
situation where she MIGHT have died.

I think you owe an apology to Robin and extropians in general.

Warwick wasn't even the first neurobot.  There were at least 50,000
people before him.  Today there are 80,000 people with cochlear
implants.  There are at least 30,000 people with deep brain
stimulating electrodes to control the sympoms of Parkinson's.  There
are hundreds of people taking part in clinical trials of deep brain
stimulators to control chronic pain, depression, and obsessive
compulsive disorder.  And there are more than a dozen people who have
electrodes in their visual cortex, their motor cortex, or their
retinas.  

The most compelling case for the first "neurobot" would have to be
either:

"Jerry", the first blind patient to regain some sight via a permanent
visual cortex prosthesis, way back around 1980.

Johnny Ray - a 53 year old ALS patient who had an electrode implanted
in his motor cortex and was able to move a cursor around a computer
screen with it.  (Work done by Phil Kennedy in 1997)

My local newspaper printed an editorial disparaging to the PAM, though
it blamed Poindexter as the architect of it, innacurate as that is.
Here is a letter to the editor I just sent off to them:

To the Editor,
I happen to know Robin Hanson personally. He is the fellow, an
assistant prof at George Mason University, who came up with the whole
idea behind the Pentagon's Policy Analysis Market, which you so snidely
call the "Terror Futures Market". I also happen to have read quite a
few of his scholarly papers, so I believe I am far more informed than
you are to render judgement on the PAM as a means of predicting future
terrorist events.
It turns out that markets are far better at predicting future events
than intelligence services that governments run. Why? Because a market
turns every participant in it into an informer to the rest of the
market on what they know that may impact the market. This is a far
better intelligence gathering network than any government could ever
afford on its own.
Many liberal politicians that you editors admire think that the PAM is
"morbid", "sick", even "evil", simply because it tries to reward people
for correctly predicting future events. Like some modern day Cassandra
(and I'll note that she wasn't popular in her day either), the PAM
would accurately predict events far better because it essentially
bribes terrorists, their associates, family members, and neighbors into
becoming informants to the rest of the world on their activities.
What I would like to know is, are investors in the PAM any LESS morbid
than you buying life insurance on your spouse's life? At least with the
PAM, only an attempt need be made for investors to win. Nobody HAS to
die. The PAM is intended to help prevent terrorist attacks.
For you to collect on your wive's insurance, she has to die. In this
respect, I'd say that you are far more morbid to buy life insurance on
a family member than to invest in the PAM. I think you owe an apology somewhere...

I actually have them in my current sf setting. "Nanoists" are people
with nanoenhancements (ranging from a bit of respirocytes or an onboard
wearable to Freitas' artificial circulatory system and laminated diamond
skeletons). Some of them (who have the right product activation keys ;-)
can transfer a "seed" to normal people, giving them parts of their own
powers (usually a complete package). This way you get clades of
nanoists. But one of them has a flawed package: when installing it 
messes up the body so that neither digestion or excretion works. Such 
nanoists would die, unless they use some of their onboard toolkit to use 
other people as a source of nutrients and dialysis...

Should be reasonably doable. Actually, we only need some device or
substance that takes fatty acids and turn them into an excretable form
at the right rate.  Maybe a bit of gene therapy making mucosal cells in
the intestine to send back fat? 

The big problem is that they are so hydrophobic. Maybe one could break 
them apart and turn the parts into alcohols. Uh oh, bad idea :-)

In the chaotic inflation scenario you already have an infinite number of 
spacetime bubbles, so the expansion only matters locally. So we really 
should be thinking from the start of the distribution of civilization 
types.

Perhaps. But we can elucidate the consequences given certain
assumptions. Robert's future scenario suggests isolated, long lived
civilizations of a certain localized kind that may or may not want to
simulate societies but have plenty of resources to do it. Robin's cosmic
commons scenario (to take a completely different scenario) suggests a
civ that will spread widely and very fast, but not do many sims. Data
from SETI, astronomy and a better understanding of our own cultural
development might help put constraints here.

### Yes, this would be what I am driving at. Eternal chaotic inflation could
have an impact on the measure of sim-building (S), living far away/long
after inflation vs. more primitive civilizations N, appearing right after
inflation of a region of space (e.g. about 13.7 billion years later). The
volume of new space could be always larger than the volume of old space,
measured over all bubbles and their ratio could remain constant over time,
producing a stable ratio of S/N. With sufficiently large inflation, it could
be true that N>>S.

It is correct that it depends a *lot* on the definition of
"integrated" and a lot on how much time you have to think
about a problem.  If one has a long time to think about
problems -- then distributing parts of ones mind across as
solar system (say 10-50 AU) may not be a huge sacrifice
while greatly increasing ones safety.  The capacity of
a 1 cm^3 nanocomputer is roughly 100,000 human minds
in something like 1/1000 the volume (of a brain).  So
I tend to use 10^6 increase in intelligence as a
conservative approximation.  The communications
bandwidth to a copy 25 AU away *will* be low but it
*will* be "you" (or a subcomponent of "you") and so there
will be a lot of shorthand notation.  So I suspect there
will be the development of "distributed" computational
algorithms.  Examples of this might be the SETI@Home or
the Folding@Home distributed computations of our time.

But you take at least a 3 order of magnitude hit in jumping
from light-minutes/hours to light-years.  I just don't think
there are going to be good reasons for doing so.

> Wouldn't it be possible to create a quantum computer based on

Yep, you could propose such a computer.  But Robert will jump
all over your butt for proposing "magic physics" on the ExI list.
There are a couple of people who have "Get out of jail free"
cards to do this (Anders & Robin come to mind since they know
a lot more physics than I do).  But anyone else gets jumped
on unless it is a serious "what if" kind of speculation.
(The primary objection at least in my mind currently is that
for QC to be useful you are going to have to propose a method
for generating and maintaining kilo, mega, and giga amounts
of qubits.  If there isn't a concrete proposal for something
we can actually build, then one gets a "Go directly to jail,
do not pass Go and do not collect 200 dollars" card.

What I'd like to see among the list membership, much as I've been
disparaging it lately for doing nothing, is to see everybody send
letters to the editor of their local papers supporting the PAM.
Specifically comparing it to getting life insurance on your spouse is,
I think, a very effective means of forcing people to make a moral
comparison that they can comprehend, and I suggest everyone use it in
their letters.

Additionally, if you are feeling especially frisky, you might also send
letters supporting PAM to your congressmonsters and senators, using the
same analogy, and putting in a good word for Robin. Lets let them know
that we won't take this lying down, eh?

It appears to be headquarted in London, but given my
own past encounters with it, I suspect it is an
entirely online publication (like, say, Wired News).
Circulation numbers and audience appear to be
comparable to Slashdot, although again I do not have
hard evidence (like circulation numbers) so I could
well be wrong.  Given its editorial nature, I would
suspect it would usually be very Extropian-friendly,
at least among those staff members who have heard of
us.  Which is why this incident is particularly
concerning.

Check and check.  Looks like we tripped his hot

(unless they choose to defend him; I think pointing
out the futility of defending easily disproven lies
may be our best strategy there, for anyone who
contacts them about this).

Actually its somewhat different.  r's evolve into k's as they trump
their hazard function (i.e. as they defeat any predators).  To do
this you have to rise to the top of any local niche consumption
hierarchy (or otherwise defeat it).  In that position one evolves
from r to k.  The "lean times" scenario supports gene regulation
shifting that explains the effects of caloric restriction -- but
the overall species longevity (and reproductive strategy) is
a function of hazard function management.

This is easy to explain -- if you have a high hazard function nature
cannot afford to evolve things like long infant gestation periods,
long infant education periods, etc.  You have to have an "r" strategy
if the species is to survive.  If on the other hand one has managed
to trump the hazard function then one can evolve longer lifespans,
longer reproductive periods, etc.

> No basis for assuming any strategy as universal among space-capable civs.

Lots of basis if one assumes convergent evolution.  For the scenario
of endless reproduction/colonization to be valid one has to presume
that a civilization would be capable of travel to another star system
but not be capable of either self-directed evolution or uploading.
That seems *very* iffy.  If one assumes a "reasonable" level of
advancement of all technologies then a distributed replicated
intelligence -- i.e. copies of "myself" but no need to replicate
endlessly -- is where civilizations end up.  (Actually to be more
specific it is likely that one end up with distributed copies
of redundant subcomponents of ones "mind".)

You have to postulate a species where individuals are willing to sacrifice
themselves for the endless production of their offspring to get the
"endless" colonization scenario I believe.  It brings into focus
the two fundamental drives -- self-preservation and reproduction.
My argument is that in advanced technological species self-preservation
trumps reproduction.

### I was not addressing the possibilities of evolving from one strategy to
another - I remarked that the two strategies, insofar as they are merely two
qualitative ways of seeing the same process, survival and reproduction, are
exhibited by *the same* organisms, depending on the circumstances.

### Have you read "Burning the Cosmic Commons: Evolutionary Strategies for
Interstellar Colonization" by Robin Hanson?

Convergent evolution can indeed be expected, with the development of an
r-like initial strategy, but at the same time, probably without the loss of
the ability to behave in a k-like manner. Neither strategy will be
universal, and the exact one used by a civ will depend on its environment,
just like in bacteria and human families.

Actually, I, for one, intend to do just that.  If
markets are the best solution, then let *the market*
provide a market.  If the gov't doesn't want to
officially sponsor PAM - and especially since it
would have been limited to just certain players, thus
making it subtly different in a way that could have
wrecked its effect - then so be it; there are other
things it is more uniquely suited for sponsoring.

I note this incident has already spurred at least one
group to start a market on the White House's next
actions.

I was reading my iuniverse newsletter and there was an article about =
searching for life on other planets. It was mentioned that the habitable =
zone may be a bit larger than previously believed and that larger, =
shorter-lived stars could also make decent candidates for =
life-supporting solar systems.

One of the pre-requisites they seem to be searching for are planets that =
exist in a "zone" where there could be liquid water.=20

Now I am not a physicist, but doesn't the fluidity of water depend on =
more than jus tthe distance from it's star and the heat from it? =
Wouldn't the composition of the atmosphere determine just how much heat =
is generated by the star? Then there are the reflectivity of the =
surface, internal heat, gravity and air pressure. Depending on the =
composition of the planet, couldn't a large planet a long distance from =
it's star still maintain liquid water? Wouldn't a planet with very =
little or no greenhouse gasses, little internal heat, and a highly =
reflective surface be able to sustain liquid water in an orbit much =
closer than ours? We wouldn't have any liquid water where we are without =
our greenhouse gasses and/or with a much higher air pressure.

It seems to me that the people conducting these searches are limiting =
themselves by putting a "habital" zone around a star.=20

Anyways, am I way off here? I was just curious and I thought someone =
here might know a bit more about this than I.

Thanks!






With kindest regards,

"Good move, John Paul!  Keep up the good work!"  That's all.  Is it really 
so hard to say?  There's no need for recriminations, random potshots, et 
cetera.  When someone makes a move in your direction, the correct response 
is a friendly wave, not spitting in their eye.

In "Heaven's Reach", Brin postulated an "Embrace of Tides" theory where 
successively more advanced species like to live next to ever-sharper 
gravitational gradients.  (Why?  Don't ask me.)  He had his Transcendents 
living next to (or perhaps it was within) the event horizons of black holes.

LOL!  Never let it be said that you are not highly appreciated
here for things like this :)

I actually would *much* rather discuss any logical and
rational analysis of the reasons that Robert Bradbury
should be assassinated than read zero-content whining
and berating from some overly sensitive type who 
prefers to emote than explain.

> (Lest anyone mistake me, I am emphatically not calling
> for the assassination of Robert Bradbury or anyone else.)

Too late.  You know how "dangerous" this list is.  He's
probably already as good as dead, because after all, there
exists *google*!  And millions of people will have mis-
understood!  His goose is cooked.  Thanks to you.

But (as if it will do any good now), I also not only do
not wish a hair on Robert's head to come to an unseemly
harm, but don't even believe that there *exist* logical
or rational reasons to assassinate him.

(And that definitely includes character assassination.)

> It seems to me that you're calling for total openness,
> and yet simultaneously placing a restriction on speech.

No, there are two (2) huge differences.  For one thing,
I am definitely *not* calling for an *enforced* restriction
of any kind.  Two, what I am urging that people do is to
desist from giving vent to their feelings on this list
---especially unsupported by argument.

hear, hear!

Oh, crap.  I will still think very poorly of, and denigrate
so long as I breathe, many kinds of inappropriate, insulting,
visceral, and disgusting speech.  Just because people ought 
to be free to say what they want, I'm sure that you will 
agree that they ought to aspire to the highest standards which
we can conceive of.

> If you enjoy, on mailing lists, that form of local politeness
> which calls for not posting offended reactions, why is that
> particular custom okay, but not that alternate form of politeness
> which calls for not advocating genocide?

The answer is that it's not a form of *impoliteness* to
advocate anything.  One must not confuse the medium with
the message, the manner in which something is said with
the content.  Railing at people has close to zero content,
except to communicate the emotional state of the speaker.
Ultimately, that is merely boring and crude.  On the other
hand, any *proposal*, no matter how outrageous, if it is
supported by rational argument deserves as much attention
as people have time for.

> Are they not both restrictions on speech?  On SL4 I don't 
> hesitate to impose both restrictions, in the name of
> preserving the glorious Signal and triumphing over Noise.

Yes, while on the one hand you say---and I agree---that 
you hope "people will be free to say anything they damn
well please", yet you enjoin people from doing so on
your list.  But I *do* totally understand and concur:
different lists have different purposes, and I'm sure 
that you'd argue that there is no contradiction in what
you are saying.

But we both, evidently, are urging others to adopt
standards of "good taste", and I think that analyses
of proposed assassinations and genocide can be in
good taste so long as they are carefully argued,
and, IMO so long as they provide a little obeisance
to traditional wisdom and people's sensitivities in
some way or another.

Which in theory wouldn't be too hard to do, although
it might still require pills (proteins can be
nanofactured; raw elements like sodium can not).  The
practical problem is finding the exact balance of
said nutrients.  It's not completely understood even
in the general population, and it tends to change
from person to person and in the same person (time of
day - for some, caffiene in the morning but not at
night - or extra vitamin C upon significant levels of
viruses in the blood).

That's probably the major research block. 
Nanofacturing proteins can be done with cloned human
tissue - sealed inside the device if there is any
question of biocompatibility, and possibly needing
replacement every ten years or so.  Then again, if
you're accepting service appointments for the body,
then assuming 50% efficiency at producing energy as
glucose from electricity, how much does a
(100*(1/.5)*24*365=)1752 kWh set of batteries weigh,
and how practical would it be to leave such in a body
for a year?  Assuming some people couldn't be trusted
to recharge themselves, or the battery was not
rechargeable for some reason.  I suspect time-release
capsules of non-nanofacturable elements sufficient
for a year would less than double the battery's
weight and bulk, although water consumption would
still be necessary: storage for a year would be
prohibitively massive, construction would require a
source of hydrogen, and absorption of water vapor
likely would not produce enough for all-environment
use.

How about for slow slimming, as in "get rich slow"?
(A year or two - more, for severe cases - to stabilize
at "ideal" weight, then just enough burn to keep you
there.)  That's still way faster than the zero
progress many people have.

This is too good to resist.

Robert raises his voice from the cart being drawn through
the village (or across space, etc.) and exclaims in
a loud Monty Pythonesque tone --

  "BUT I'M NOT DEAD YET"....

(I think its from "The Life of Brian" but I'm not sure...)

At any rate do not count me as bacteria food just yet.
As Barbara has pointed out there may be people on the list
who are clever enough to escape the final door, perhaps even
more than once.  I'm not sure I fall into that category.
But one can always hope.  It is very difficult to determine
how creative people can become when pushed to the edge.
And if you don't know the answer to that then nothing is
"certain".

Yes, observationally they're the same to outside observers.
And perhaps yes, my complaint may come down to the tense
of sentences people use to describe black holes.  But even
if that's all it is, then people have still said a lot of
very incorrect things, or, (of course) I do not understand
what is going on.

Oh yes.  In fact, Scientific American just had an article about
that.  But here I am talking about the GR theory itself.

I didn't know that superluminal velocities were a part of
mainstream theories at all.  Yes, for sure, event horizons
appear even in very ordinary physics.  You can outrun a
photon if you start about a light year in front, and maintain
about a 1 gee acceleration.  It never catches you, even though
you do not yourself (of course) ever quite get to lightspeed.

Yes, so I am told.  And it does make sense that event horizons
capture outgoing photons (and, as I contend, incoming ones too!).

No, I'm following standard GR so far as I understand it.

Well, I read that FAQ many years ago in John Baez's stuff.  But thanks
for directing me to it again.  There are many passages in it that 
almost but (to me) do not quite address my problem.  Consider the
paragraph in section 5 that reads

   If the black hole is mortal, you'll instead see those events
   [infalling astronaut] happen closer and closer to the time
   the black hole evaporates. Extrapolating, you would calculate
   my time of passage through the event horizon as the exact
   moment the hole disappears!

Note the use of the word calculate.  Often in the FAQ, the author
insists that we consider only the *appearance* of the black hole---
namely the photons that are reaching us from the events taking
(or which have taken) place near the event horizon.  He calls
this merely an "optical effect", and I too am completely uninterested
in merely what we see.

   (Of course, even if you could see me, the image would be drowned
   out by all the radiation from the evaporating hole.) I won't
   experience that cataclysm myself, though; I'll be through the
   horizon, leaving only my light behind. As far as I'm concerned,
   my grisly fate is unaffected by the evaporation. 

So here it is said, unmistakably, that even though the hole is
only mortal, the infalling astronaut breezes through the event
horizon before that occurs.  Yet if a tiny mirror (supported by
very powerful rockets) is suspended just above the event horizon,
and the hole is not going to evaporate before, say, 10^1000 years,
then you may calculate that if the mirror is close enough, then
a photon we emit may take 10^300 years to get to the mirror, and
10^300 years to get back (in our reference frame, a round trip
time of 2x10^300 years).  So my confusion stems from the fact 
that if we send a photon into the black hole just ahead of the
astronaut, then in *some* sense by our watch it strikes the
mirror only after a long time.  The astronaut therefore does
not pass the mirror and does not go through the horizon also
until a *very* long time, that is, as we reckon it, not before
10^300 years.  (Naturally, his watch is nearly frozen, and to
him it's no time at all.)  The trajectories of the infalling
and outgoing photons are identical according to what I read.

There are many puzzles such as I have just outlined.  I don't
see an answer to them.  Any help is appreciated.

One of the things I am trying to get a handle on is
is the state of the art in neural implants in 2003. 

Current state of the art is a reasonable baseline
for extrapolating and estimating future trends and roll
out times. 

The more that has been done, the moral hurdles have
been cleared with ethics and legislative bodies and the
better our understanding of the human nervous system
the closer we are getting a handle on how to do memory
enhancement and eventually uploading.  

I'm also aware that there new technologies can compete
with each other to solve the same underlying existing 
problems. It may be possible to restore neural damage
with stem cell treatment or shunt around the break 
with some sort of electronic bridging implant. At this
stage I don't think either has been done. 

Do you have sources for the Parkinson's electrodes,
the deep brain stimulators and the motor cortex stuff
you mention above Mez? 

Regards,
Brett

I do not see what safety has to do with it.

Yes, suppose that one is interested in finding the next
Ramsey numbers (a nice math problem).  Then one has no
problem with off-loading a lot of the calculation to
Alpha Centauri, or participating in a galaxy-wide hunt
for the solutions.

Yes, and getting back to another issue, *this* is why we

colonize: we have plenty of unused cm^3s.

Who wrote that?  From the heading it appears to be Robert,

Yes, this is good!  The approximately 4 gallon volume

it.  Were only the rest of the solar system so well disposed.

What Paul was saying about kinesthetic sense is very
close to my experience as well.  I "feel" statements
in a kind of internal universe as solid entities with
weighted connections to other objects.  I also have
substantial ability to program my muscles, altho I may
have acquired that, rather than being born with some
special ability.

Around or just before 1960 I think it was that I read
Maxwell Maltz's excellent "Psycho-Cybernetics."  There
were two parts that I really put to use.  

Philosophically, his discussion of how our concepts
influence our reactions to perception - if you think
it's a man in a bear suit on a lonely trail at night,
you will behave very differently than if you think
it's really a bear, etc.  It tied directly into what I
was getting from Rand when I read "Atlas Shrugged" in
1960 at age 12, when she discussed how people have
difficulty even conceiving of challenging their value
systems.  Why?  Largely because they have
shortcircuited the cognitive process by accepting
their values as givens, rather than conclusions to be
verified and challenged on the basis of data and
logic.  Maltz gave another perspective to the same
line of argument, which I always find useful.

(One of the most useful takes on problem solving that
I've ever come across came out of basic algebra.  If
you have n variables and m independent equations, then
the solution space has n-m dimensions, roughly
speaking (forgetting quadratics, etc., obviously).  In
principle, getting a wide variety of takes on an
issue, and looking for the commonalities and
contradictions among them can often yield more precise
and unexpected answers than an exhaustive analysis
following a single thread, altho both approaches
certainly have their place.  Given the fuzziness of
data so often in real world situations, additional
independent perspectives are often invaluable to
getting manageable solution spaces.)

Anyway, the 2nd thing I got from Maltz was his take on
visualization.  I picked right up on that and found an
immediate practical application - knot tieing.  I was
active in rural Boy Scouts and a big part of our
somewhat impoverished troup life was taken up in
acquiring relatively costless proficiencies in areas
like carving or knot tieing. I learned that if I
practiced Maltz's visualization that I could learn
really complex knots and learn how to do them really,
really fast, which was important, as a big use of knot
tieing was in competitions judgeing both correctness
and speed.

At a summer camp, I recall learning a pair of complex
knots I had never seen before while waiting in line to
perform them in inter-troup competition.  I visualized
every little step in tieing them in complete detail as
I moved up the line, and, fifteen or so minutes later,
I matched the camp record, even though I had literally
never seen either knot in my life.  But I was just
playing back a tape in my head essentially.  

The method also turned out to work rather well in judo
later in college, especially in getting out of jams,
as I could completely visualize my coming moves and
then execute them as a batch job, much faster than any
opponent could respond.  It did not work very well in
karate, however, where instantaneous response is key.

So, the question is, did I learn a kind of basic
kinesthetic approach from those experiences, or was it
simply the unfolding of a natural ability?

Medtronic is the company that makes the most popular deep brain
stimulator (DBS) for Parkinson's.  See
http://www.medtronic.com/activa/physician/implantable.html

Phil Kennedy, who did the first implantation of an electrode into
human motor cortex, founded a company called Neural Signals.
http://www.neuralsignals.com/

The stuff on using DBS for other diseases is more in journals than
press.  But if you search for [DBS depression] or [DBS pain] or [DBS
OCD] you'll find plenty of links.

You can also find numerous reviews of that work in journals like
Science and in the lay press.  Search on "Phil Kennedy" + "Johnny Ray"
for example.

And if you're really interested in the state of the art of brain
implants, I can send you the chapter I've written on the topic.

<lee> Getting good at geometry proofs doesn't fit with the rest of your
narrative.  

I didn't say getting good; I said excelled :) anyways, I mentioned
geometric proofs
in that the need was apparent, and ergo the steps to take were apparent.

<lee> How old were you when you  got good, or were able to get good, at
geometry proofs?

I think I was in 8th grade or so :)

<lee> Well, according to http://www.hyperlexia.org/ my guess
is that you are/were only very mildly hyperlexic.  Did
you show many of the symptoms listed there?

<me> Yes, actually; all of them. I was reading college level (my
brothers book collection)
material when I was in 6th grade... generally to the exclusion of
interaction with
my class mates..  <hence, antisocial>..  the trend has not really
slackened in the
intervening years... The only thing that I don't really match (at least
now)
is "specific, unusual fears"...  I don't really remember being
frightened when
I was a kid, with the exception of a single nightmare I had when I was a
child.
Of course that could be do to poor recall, but i doubt it..

> It was very clear to both me and my professor though
> that I didn't "learn" discrete math the same way other
> people did... It took a fundamentally different approach...

<lee> It's as though you had to hack up in software a number line
or something that others had built into their hardware.

<me> the equivalent thereof.  I have an internal mental framework;
my conceptual memory is excellent.  I can deduce missing pieces
of information by their "neighbors".  Its pretty amusing really, 
since I have terrible recall when it comes to day-to-day events;
I'm pretty much the only one i know who signficantly extends 
their memory by using keys... I lost a box of stuff once [materials], 
and  "rediscovered" a chunk of memory that was keyed off Shel 
Silverstein... but I would never have been able to recall it had I not
(accidently) read Shel Silverstein again...  Pretty funky.  In any
event,
it is clear to me that I don't really think like normal people (for
better
or worse)..

<lee> There is a certain form of verbal reasoning that I'm no
good at, and have always felt that I had to "hack up" a 
substitute for what came naturally to others.  Or maybe 
I just don't trust my native reasoning ability in addition.

<me> could be :) I don't see anything to stop that kind of 
meta-grammer from forming... Its a useful ability.

<lee> Again, it makes me think you have no number "feel" at
all, because otherwise the feature you are mentioning
would map right onto it, and you'd be very good with
numbers.

<me> It isn't a lack of number feel (quite the opposite, I have an
excellent
affinity to numbers and their manipulations)... It was that discrete
mathematics
is a weaker form of algebra; there were simply too many different ways
to
accomplish the proof that the first step didn't present itself..  I work
off a 
need-based algorithm; without a need, I couldn't really choose one way
or
another.  As soon as I saw how discrete math was intended to be used, I 
understood what was required of me in regards to proving them.. It was
like
in my world(tm), theory of computation came first, then discrete
mathematics..
Trying to teach it to me in the traditional manner was pointless; it was
like
trying to ice skate uphill.  Mind you, I *understood* the proofs (which
baffled
my professor); I just couldn't generate the next step.. As soon as I had
a 
need-based framework constructed, discrete math fell into place in one
evening.

<me> The reason why I mentioned it was to draw a distinction; I have
always done
well in math prior to (and after) discrete math.  It was the *way* it
was taught 
that was counter-intuitive to me...  it wasn't poor symbol manipulation
techniques;
it was that there was too many different ways to go and no intrinsic
heurestic 
for selection of any particular pathway.

A colleague of mine suggested that we call wheat futures
"starvation futures" since whenever the price of wheat goes up, more
people probably starve somewhere.  How dare those farmers profit from
people out there starving.

Er, why is the term "Singularitarian" being used in connection with this 
conference on the supposed deterministic acceleration of technological 
change, a claim which is neither made by, nor relevant to, Singularitarians?

I would hazard a guess to say the unfolding of a 
natural ability.  Mind you, everyone can benefit
to some degree from previsualization; I think the
difference between normal people and hyperlexic
people who have successfully encapsulated a sensitive
propiocentric system with the equivalent of a mental
grammer is the speed in which they both acquire new
skills, and maintain old skills.  Its a biological equivalent
to a skillsoft (software acquired skills).. There is,
also as another aside, a remarkably interesting subgenera
of this type of programming, but based off of biofeedback
training.

I ran across some really interesting research as it relates
to conceiving of new ideas by some Russian scientist which
sought to qualify how creative people come up with solutions
to well-known problems... I have it saved somewhere. I'm
planning on core-dumping all my research on a website @
some point.

Subject: Hyperlexia


What Paul was saying about kinesthetic sense is very
close to my experience as well.  I "feel" statements
in a kind of internal universe as solid entities with
weighted connections to other objects.  I also have
substantial ability to program my muscles, altho I may
have acquired that, rather than being born with some
special ability.

Around or just before 1960 I think it was that I read
Maxwell Maltz's excellent "Psycho-Cybernetics."  There
were two parts that I really put to use.  

Philosophically, his discussion of how our concepts
influence our reactions to perception - if you think
it's a man in a bear suit on a lonely trail at night,
you will behave very differently than if you think
it's really a bear, etc.  It tied directly into what I
was getting from Rand when I read "Atlas Shrugged" in
1960 at age 12, when she discussed how people have
difficulty even conceiving of challenging their value
systems.  Why?  Largely because they have
shortcircuited the cognitive process by accepting
their values as givens, rather than conclusions to be
verified and challenged on the basis of data and
logic.  Maltz gave another perspective to the same
line of argument, which I always find useful.

(One of the most useful takes on problem solving that
I've ever come across came out of basic algebra.  If
you have n variables and m independent equations, then
the solution space has n-m dimensions, roughly
speaking (forgetting quadratics, etc., obviously).  In principle,
getting a wide variety of takes on an issue, and looking for the
commonalities and contradictions among them can often yield more precise
and unexpected answers than an exhaustive analysis following a single
thread, altho both approaches certainly have their place.  Given the
fuzziness of data so often in real world situations, additional
independent perspectives are often invaluable to getting manageable
solution spaces.)

Anyway, the 2nd thing I got from Maltz was his take on visualization.  I
picked right up on that and found an immediate practical application -
knot tieing.  I was active in rural Boy Scouts and a big part of our
somewhat impoverished troup life was taken up in acquiring relatively
costless proficiencies in areas like carving or knot tieing. I learned
that if I practiced Maltz's visualization that I could learn really
complex knots and learn how to do them really, really fast, which was
important, as a big use of knot tieing was in competitions judgeing both
correctness and speed.

At a summer camp, I recall learning a pair of complex
knots I had never seen before while waiting in line to
perform them in inter-troup competition.  I visualized
every little step in tieing them in complete detail as
I moved up the line, and, fifteen or so minutes later,
I matched the camp record, even though I had literally
never seen either knot in my life.  But I was just
playing back a tape in my head essentially.  

The method also turned out to work rather well in judo
later in college, especially in getting out of jams,
as I could completely visualize my coming moves and
then execute them as a batch job, much faster than any
opponent could respond.  It did not work very well in
karate, however, where instantaneous response is key.

So, the question is, did I learn a kind of basic
kinesthetic approach from those experiences, or was it
simply the unfolding of a natural ability?

I knew it.  You see, I really do have everyone pegged---

Yes.  I was going to add a prediction for Brett
(his impression following the atomic bombing of
an American city) that would consist of him studying
for several hours yet further international law,
historical precedent, and the Geneva accords, and
finally concluding that the Americans had every 
right to strike back.  But I like your parody of
the Paatch/Grant dialog better.

By the way, did you see that our prolific friend has

"Distributed Replicated Intelligence"

A human brain cannot avoid the hazard function imposed by
an earthquake, an asteroid, etc.  However, if you have
redundant subcomponents distributed across 25 AU you can
trump those hazard functions.  It is basic "fault tolerance"
in computing data center configurations.

Yes, in which case the problem may not be to colonize
but to (a) identify *where* the SIs are; and (b) the
diplomatic problem of convincing them to work on the
problem once one opens a communication channel.  This
tends to require that the problem has more limited
data requirements (otherwise it requires a very long
time to communicate to more distant SIs).  It also
feeds into the problems I've discussed with respect
to "What do SIs think about?".  For example do you
want to "think" about a problem that some other SI
in the galaxy solved 20,000 or even 2,000,000,000
years ago???

But Lee, you are oversimplifying -- to use those cm^3
one needs (a) energy sources; (b) certain types of matter;
and (c) someplace to dump the waste heat.  One would
anticipate that *if* one were going to colonize one
would select optimal locations with a mix of those 3 resources.

I have not changed my mind.  Lee II's are a hazard -- but
perhaps naturally only over billions to trillions of years.
The exception to this would be if Lee II's decide that Lee I's
are hazardous first and decide to minimize the risk that
Lee I's pose.

Distributed Lee I's (within local space) pose a much less
difficult problem.  If one gets a rogue Lee I subcomponent
within a solar system one simply deletes it.  It is like
replacing a broken component in ones automobile.  But it is
*very* difficult to replace a component in a remote star system
if it is allowed to rise to your level of development.  Even at
light speed its 8 years round trip for information to/from
the Alpha Centauri system -- how do you deal with something
that has 10^42 OPS for 8 years (~10^51 OPS) to figure out
how to defend against something you may send or it may send
against you?

One can hurl black holes across interstellar space but I
would presume that using X-ray telescopes they will probably
see it coming.  Electromagnetic radiation travels faster
than matter (or black holes) -- they have plenty of time to
disperse and regroup.  And when they do they may be very unhappy.
So they may be willing to expend a significant amount of
matter/energy to balance the books.

Yes, it is me talking about myself in the 3rd person.
Sorry, I should have perhaps added a :-).

It started as a joke, no doubt.  Whether it's grown
into more...maybe.  From the site, I think they're
still setting things up (as would be expected, given
as
it's a reaction to recent events).

That's a question to be taken up with John Smart, I should imagine, but I
don't think he's on this list any longer. Then again, maybe he doesn't use
the term `Singularitarian' anyway, although last time I talked to him the
Singularity prospect was his major concern.

The far more interesting question, I'd have thought, is why a
crypto-creationist like Dembski wishes to associate himself with a
conference dealing with the Singularity, and why the organizers would
welcome him.

Just as a sidebar, I was surprised to read in Merchants of 
Immortality that Michael West had been a creationist prior
to earning his PhD and MD and going on to found Geron. 

I hasten to add this is not what Michael West himself said,
(at least to my knowledge), its what Stephen Hall says in 
MoI. If true, then it looks like that road to Damascus is a
two way highway.

Aha, so that was why that little card was lying on my monitor (next to
the "You have won second price in a beauty contest" card I thought was
spam).

Seriously, spin-coupled quantum computers probably make dandy
low-temperature parts of a M-brain. But they are not magical: at best
they have just an exponential speedup for certain problems, and they are
reversible (meaning that they do not dissipate except for bit erasure
and some error correction). I have the feeling (like Robert) that the
original proposal suggested some entanglement communication, and that is
magical physics. If we had such FTL communication, then M-brains could
be designed much more efficiently by keeping remote parts linked, and I
think the analysis of size and movement would become very changed.

Hmm, I just ended up on Boardwalk and somebody built a Chronos there...

Can you elaborate this?
Btw, it is possible that the use of satellites (stars?)
to distribute, i.e., entangled photon pairs provides
a solution for 'long' distance quantum communication.
And it is also possible that using quantum computers
(located in different regions of space) *plus* teleporting
(quantum states from a remote region, as inputs to quantum
computers located in different regions) you can reach a
distributed 'probabilistic' quantum computing network.

Water is a fluid for a certain range of pressures and temperatures; it 
is the green region in the phase diagram 
http://www.martin.chaplin.btinternet.co.uk/phase.html

So you could get liquid water in a larger temperature range by having a
greater pressure; above 21.671 MPa you pass the critical point and
liquid and vapor pass seamlessly into each other (see Hal Clement's
novel _Close to Critical_). 

You can also extend the range of the planets by having the temperature 
kept in a milder range as you say. The problem is that warm planets will 
have water vapor in their atmospheres and it is a greenhouse gas, so you 
get a positive feedback. Cold planets will tend to get much ice, and it 
is a good reflector and will make the planet colder, producing a 
snowball (where liquid water can still persist under the surface, as it 
likely did on Earth in the precambrian and right now on Europa).

Most searches are system-wise, so the exact extent of the lifezone is 
not important. But plenty of arguments about the probability of life 
depends on its average size, and a larger lifezone makes life more 
likely.

However, people are indeed expanding the range of places where life 
would not be unexpected. Some have suggested moons of gas giants a la 
Europa, and brown dwarves might have lifezones of their own.

Righto!, Kevin.  There  are all manner of unwarranted
assumptions going around, by people with very pinched
imagination, about the "requirements" for life.  

In Thomas Gold's The Deep Hot Biosphere

http://people.cornell.edu/pages/tg21/DHB.html

he writes:

There are strong indications that microbial life is
widespread at depth in the crust of the Earth, just as
such life has been identified in numerous ocean vents.
This life is not dependent on solar energy and
photosynthesis for its primary energy supply, and it
is essentially independent of the surface
circumstances. Its energy supply comes from chemical
sources,...

and 

Subsurface life may be widespread among the planetary
bodies of our solar system, since many of them have
equally suitable conditions below, while having
totally inhospitable surfaces. One may even speculate
that such life may be widely disseminated in the
universe, since planetary type bodies with similar
sub-surface conditions may be common as solitary
objects in space, as well as in other solar-type
systems.

and

...the "ocean vents", found first in some small
regions of the ocean floor, but now found to be
widespread (2), proved to have an energy supply for
its life that was totally independent of sunlight and
all surface energy sources. There the energy for life
was derived from chemical processes,...  

and

It may be that we shall find a simple general rule to
apply: that microbial life exists in all the locations
where microbes can survive; that would mean all the
locations that have a chemical energy supply and that
are at a temperature below the maximum one to which
microbes can adapt. 

and

The other planetary bodies in our solar system do not
have favorable circumstances for **surface** life. 

but

Many planetary bodies will have temperature and
pressure regimes in their interiors that would allow
liquid water to exist.

and 

The surface life on the Earth, based on photosynthesis
for its overall energy supply, may be just one strange
branch of life, an adaptation specific to a planet
that happened to have such favorable circumstances on
its surface as would occur only very rarely...

The deep, chemically supplied life, however, may be
very common in the universe.

Some years ago I read an article that talked about different measures of 
complexity and how well they applied to the age-old problem of classifying 
living vs non-living systems.

I remember that for one measure there was a graph that showed an irregular 2D 
region in the middle that they claimed was the domain of life. Chaos was at 
one end of the graph and Order was at the other. Prions lay outside this 
'life region' while virii and dormant seeds lay on the edges.

The trouble is that I don't remember the source of the article or much more 
than I've just related. Has this rung any bells for anyone? Or can someone 
point me in the right direction?  I've been digging through tons of online 
stuff about Complexity Theory, Self-Adaptive Systems, Artificial Life and the 
like without any luck yet.

Yes, nowadays, there is a large variety for where people are thinking to
find stable and life-supportable planets, as well as how life could
seed other places. A sample:

This is the strange world of aliens we live in.

Volatile-Rich Earth-Mass Planets in the Habitable Zone

Authors: Marc J. Kuchner
Comments: 12 pages, including 1 figure. Submitted to ApJ letters March 9,
2003

      Planets that form beyond the snow line with too little mass to
      seed rapid gas accretion (<~ 10 Earth masses) should be rich in
      volatile ices like water and ammonia. Some of these planets should
      migrate inward by interacting with a circumstellar disk or with
      other planets. Such objects can retain their volatiles for
      billions of years or longer at ~1 AU as their atmospheres undergo
      slow hydrodynamic escape. These objects could appear in future
      surveys for extrasolar Earth analogs.

A study of the stability regions in the planetary system HD 74156 - Can it
host earthlike planets in habitable zones?

Authors: R. Dvorak (1), E. Pilat-Lohinger (1), B. Funk (1), F. Freistetter
(1) ((1) Institute of Astronomy, University of Vienna, Austria)
Comments: submitted to A&A, 4 pages, 5 figures

      Using numerical methods we thoroughly investigate the dynamical
      stability in the region between the two planets found in HD 74156.
      The two planets with minimum masses 1.56 M_JUP (HD 74156b) and 7.5
      M_JUP (HD 74156c), semimajor axes 0.276 AU and 3.47 AU move on
      quite eccentric orbits (e=0.649 and 0.395). There is a region
      between 0.7 and 1.4 AU which may host additional planets which we
      checked via numerical integrations using different dynamical
      models. Besides the orbital evolution of several thousands of
      massless regarded planets in a three-dimensional restricted 4-body
      problem (host star, two planets + massless bodies) we also have
      undertaken test computation for the orbital evolution for fictive
      planets with masses of 0.1, 0.3 and 1 M_JUP in the region between
      HD74156b and HD74156c. For direct numerical integrations up to
      10^7 years we used the Lie-integrator, a method with adaptive
      stepsize; additionally we used the Fast Lyapunov Indicators as
      tool for detecting chaotic motion in this region. We emphasize the
      important role of the inner resonances (with the outer planet) and
      the outer resonances (with the inner planet) with test bodies
      located inside the resonances. In these two "resonance" regions
      almost no orbits survive. The region between the 1:5 outer
      resonance (0.8 AU) and the 5:1 inner resonance (1.3 AU), just in
      the right position for habitability, is also very unstable
      probably due to three-body-resonances acting there. Our results do
      not strictly "forbid" planets to move there, but the existence of
      a planet on a stable orbit between 0.8 and 1.3 AU is unlikely.

Planets in habitable zones: A study of the binary Gamma Cephei

Authors: R. Dvorak (1), E. Pilat-Lohinger (1), B. Funk (1), F. Freistetter
(1) ((1) Institute of Astronomy, Vienna, Austria)
Comments: 4 pages, 5 figures, changed 2 references made minor changes due to
referees advice

      The recently discovered planetary system in the binary GamCep was
      studied concerning its dynamical evolution. We confirm that the
      orbital parameters found by the observers are in a stable
      configuration. The primary aim of this study was to find stable
      planetary orbits in a habitable region in this system, which
      consists of a double star (a=21.36 AU) and a relatively close
      (a=2.15 AU) massive (1.7 Mjup sin i) planet. We did
      straightforward numerical integrations of the equations of motion
      in different dynamical models and determined the stability regions
      for a fictitious massless planet in the interval of the semimajor
      axis 0.5 AU < a < 1.85 AU around the more massive primary. To
      confirm the results we used the Fast Lyapunov Indicators (FLI) in
      separate computations, which are a common tool for determining the
      chaoticity of an orbit. Both results are in good agreement and
      unveiled a small island of stable motions close to 1 AU up to an
      inclination of about 15 deg (which corresponds to the 3:1 mean
      motion resonance between the two planets). Additionally we
      computed the orbits of earthlike planets (up to 90 earthmasses) in
      the small stable island and found out, that there exists a small
      window of stable orbits on the inner edge of the habitable zone in
      GamCep even for massive planets.

The Orbits of Terrestrial Planets in the Habitable Zones of Known
Exoplanetary Systems

Authors: Barrie W Jones, P Nick Sleep
Comments: 5 pages, 1 Figure. To appear in the ASP Conference Series,
'Scientific Frontiers in Research on Extrasolar Planets', edited by Deming
and Seager

      We show that terrestrial planets could survive in variously
      restricted regions of the habitable zones of 47 Ursae Majoris,
      Epsilon Eridani, and Rho Coronae Borealis, but nowhere in the
      habitable zones of Gliese 876 and Upsilon Andromedae. The first
      three systems between them are representative of a large
      proportion of the 90 or so extrasolar planetary systems discovered
      by mid-2002, and thus there are many known systems worth searching
      for terrestrial planets in habitable zones. We reach our
      conclusions by launching putative Earth-mass planets in various
      orbits and following their fate with a mixed-variable symplectic
      integrator.

What can rapid terrestrial biogenesis tell us about life in the universe?

Authors: Charles H. Lineweaver, Tamara M. Davis (School of Physics,

2002

      It is sometimes asserted that the rapidity of biogenesis on Earth
      suggests that life is common in the Universe. We critically
      examine the assumptions inherent in this argument. Using a lottery
      model for biogenesis in the Universe, we convert the observational
      constraints on the rapidity of biogenesis on Earth into
      constraints on the probability of biogenesis on other terrestrial
      planets. For example, if terrestrial biogenesis took less than 200
      Myr (and we assume that it could have taken 1 billion years) then
      we find the probability of biogenesis on terrestrial planets older
      than ~ 1 Gyr, is > 36% at the 95% confidence level. However, there
      are assumptions and selection effects that complicate this result:
      although we correct the analysis for the fact that biogenesis is a
      prerequisite for our existence, our result depends on the
      plausible assumption that rapid biogenesis is not such a
      prerequisite.

Reseeding of early Earth by impacts of returning ejecta during the late

Abstract
Mounting attention has focused on interplanetary transfer of
microorganisms (panspermia), particularly in reference to exchange
between Mars and Earth. In most cases, however, such exchange
requires millions of years, over which time the transported
microorganisms must remain viable. During a large impact on Earth,
however, previous work (J.C. Armstrong et al., 2002, Icarus 160,
183196) has shown that substantial amounts of material return to the
planet of origin over a much shorter period of time (< 5000 years),
considerably mitigating the challenges to the survival of a living
organism. Conservatively evaluating experiments performed [by
others] on Bacillus subtilis and Deinococcus radiodurans to
constrain biological survival under impact conditions, we estimate
that if the Earth were hit by a sterilizing impactor  300 km in
diameter, with a relative velocity of 30 km s-1 (such as may have
occurred during the Late Heavy Bombardment), an initial cell
population in the ejecta of order 10^3-10^5 cells kg-1 would in most
cases be sufficient for a single modern organism to survive and
return to an again-clement planet 3000-5000 years later. Although
little can be said about the characteristics or distribution of
ancient life, our calculations suggest that impact reseeding is a
possible means by which life, if present, could have survived the
Late Heavy Bombardment.

Bush Impeached? Wanna Bet?

By Leander Kahney

02:00 AM Aug. 04, 2003 PT

Though there was an outcry over the Pentagon's terrorism futures market, a
similar online exchange is in the works to predict what the U.S. government
is up to.

The American Action Market will offer various Washington "futures" that can
be bet upon and traded. Examples include:


* Which country will the White House threaten next?

* Who will be the next foreign leader to move off the CIA payroll and
onto the White House's "most wanted" list?

* Which corporation with close ties to the White House will be the next
cloaked in scandal?

The AAM will begin registering traders in September and plans to open for
business Oct. 1 -- the same launch date proposed for the Pentagon's
terrorism market, until it was shelved.

Like the Pentagon's scrapped Policy Analysis Market, the AAM lets traders
"bet" on future events by buying and selling futures as though they were
stocks. The higher the price, the more likely the market believes the event
will occur. But instead of predicting terrorist strikes, the AAM will
predict things like the next White House staffer to quit.

"The idea is to answer some of the most pressing questions in the world:
What will the White House do next?" said one of the founders, Andrew Geiger,
an American programmer living in Paris.

The AAM market is the brainchild of a half-dozen academics from various
colleges, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Yale
University, New York University and the University of Montreal. Most,
however, are keeping their identities quiet until they get an institutional
go-ahead.

The market was organized on Nettime, a politics and culture mailing list.

"It's quite amazing, the Pentagon and the White House are very fertile
imaginative fields these days," Geiger said. "(The AAM project) sounds
humorous, but that just shows how far things have gone. We've entered the
realm of fiction. Things really are Dr. Strangelove."

The AAM project complements another academic project, the Government
Information Awareness project. The GIA was built in response to the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency's Terrorism Information Awareness program.

Its organizers hope the market will attract academics, politicians, civil
servants and other insiders to provide accurate predictions of White House
behavior. Geiger said even those who read the newspapers are qualified to be
traders.

"Our goal is to have people with insight into how the White House works,"
said Geiger. "There are a lot of people who spend a lot of time thinking
about what's going on in the world these days. A lot of that thought could
be transferred into the system, giving you trading data that will tell you
what's really going on."

Geiger added, "Who knows whether it will reveal stuff? Anyway, it will be
engaging."

The public, he noted, will be able to follow trades on the market's website.

David Pennock, a senior research scientist at Overture Services, said
futures markets have proven to be very good predictors of many different
kinds of events, from the weather to election outcomes.

"It's one of the best, if not the best, way to predict the future," he said.
"It's a good, well-known method for getting information that's distributed
around the world."

Bob Forsythe, a University of Iowa professor who helped organize the Iowa
Electronic Markets, which speculate on election results, agreed that futures
are reliable indicators of what's going to happen next -- if the traders are
knowledgeable.

"You have to have informed traders or they don't work very well," he said.
"Who are the informed traders in an assassination market, for example? The
same's true for predicting the White House."

You don't need proteins, you need the amino acids. But the body 
breaks down amino acids into amines and urea that are excreted 
mainly through the urine. So you need to either pick up these 
chemicals and make amino acids again, or an external supply. Magical 
nanotech can of course do it, but human cells cannot (the closest 
would be to have plant cells; maybe your own internal greenhouse?).

According to http://www.rsc.org/pdf/books/batterysc.pdf that roughly 
correspond to a traction battery of the kind used in electric 
vehicles, fork-lift trucks and tractors. Sounds rather heavy :-)

*Possibly* not, but again, I don't think this kind of terrorism is a big
threat, personal-riskwise.

I actually don't have a 2nd amendment right since I don't live in the
USA, and I'm sure this argument has happened a million times in gun
circles that I don't frequent, but I'll say it anyway: last ditch is too
late.

This is exactly my point. After 9/11, civil liberties were cut down. Did
you use force against that? When the threat is abstract, how can you
tell whether or not to use force? If the government doubled income tax,
would you shoot anyone? If you believe in a slippery slope towards
totalitarianism, at what point on that slope do you stop lobbying and
start firing?

I'm still thinking "too late". Are you seriously talking about having a
shootout with the police/army?

The 21st century started in August 1991 and ended November 2000. I
thought it was going somewhere too.

I haven't been keeping up with the threads on this, but have noticed a 
number of pro-futures-market articles. Perhaps the initial negativity 
was what the idea needed to insert itself into the memesphere. A ho-hum 
response wouldn't have generated as much interest.

Afaik, _Earthweb_ is still in print; I've been recommending it to people 
when discussing PAM.

fyi,

The Register is a massively cynical British tech news net-only
publication that verges on the edge of comedy writing, like the Onion. I
think the people behind it are chummy with the NTK folks. Andrew
Orlowski is not representative of the site as a whole; he writes opinion
columns for controversy's sake, and loves to jump down the throat of
anyone who claims to be changing the world, whether or not they are. I
guess the PAM has touched the same nerve as the weblog hype he rants
about.

Due to his blogophobia, bloggers might be more receptive to anything he
pans. Enemy of my enemy, etc. And for all the hype and anti-hype,
weblogs really are a reliable meme vector.

Sometimes a patch of bad weather can obscure an otherwise

If we had entanglement linkages built into M-brains, then there would be 
no practical limit (foreseeable from here) to the degree of 
intelligence.  Actually, a lot of things would depend on the exact 
nature of the link.  If it had a long start-up delay, or was expensive 
to use (say, emitted a lot of heat, or had a slow bit rate), then there 
could well still be speed limits in how fast the final 
M-brain-with-quantum-link could think, but I can't see any limit on the 
size of problem that it could solve.  Merely on the speed at which it 
could be solved.  I suppose that one could say that the same is, in 
principle, true of even a simple Turing machine, but this isn't the same 
kind of limit.  The separable parts could be handled separately...

If the link were fast and cheap enough it could replace everything else 
for linking components.  This is quite unlikely, but who can say.  It 
would be equivalent to seeing the universe as it exists as a computer 
that one could program.

If the link were somewhat expensive, but had a fast bit-rate, then 
M-Brain modules would get, say, as large as a desk, or perhaps a shoebox 
and these modules would be linked using some development from, perhaps, 
Beowulf technology (or Globus?).  Thus each M-Brain module would have 
perhaps 1000 times the computing capacity of a human brain (or more, I'm 
being a bit conservative here) and these modules would be linked 
"instantaneously" to a net which could be spatially distributed 
throughout the universe.  One has to hope that there are a large number 
of "frequencies" available.  I find myself believing that were this to 
be possible, the first civilization to discover how to do it would 
saturate the available frequencies, and latecomers would only find a 
channel too noisy to use.  (The earlier developers would be frequencies 
so high and spread across the available spectrum that those coming later 
wouldn't find an available channel, or a readable signal.)

If the link were fast and cheap, but short range (say an exponential 
decay), then everything depends on the available distance.  If it's 
across the solar system, then M-Brains could be a lot more efficient 
than we have believed.  If it's across the hall, then it wouldn't have 
much effect at all, but it might up the rate of bit transmission a bit.

Simply having the possibility of a quantuum linkage doesn't tell one 
enough about the engineering trade-offs.  And since we don't yet know 
how to do it, we don't know what the constraints and limitations would 
be.  But unless we're the first it seems to range from "interesting but 
not really worth the effort" up to "quite handy, and well worth the 
cost".  Only towards the high end of the scale do we start noticing 
significant performance changes in the M-Brains.  At the nearly top end 
(practical signalling extends out to around 8 light years with a high 
bit rate) we get a dramatic change where the universe becomes accessible 
for total conversions into a single intelligence.  (This says nothing 
about whether such a choice is wise or ethical.)

Yes... but I have learned that the planting of a few seeds and
waiting can bring unexpected delights, that is, if your mind is in a
suitable state to notice the result.

Here's a flower that burst through my usual pessimism regarding the
Internet.

I have a friend visiting the Ol Doinyo Lengai volcano in Tanzania
presently, and I was surprised last week to find messages from him
in my emailbox giving me reports.

"How are you able to send me email from there?," I ask (envisioning
tents, and cooking pots and scorpions on the ground in barren,
deserted places), and he writes the next day:

"Arusha has HUNDREDS of Internet cafes: a local phone call costs
$0.5/min, an international call is $3/min, while 30 minutes are
$0.5. Two years ago, all of the Internet cafes were full of American
tourists waiting for their safaris, this year Americans are staying
away, and the Internet cafes are full of local people writing to
their relatives around the world."



Nice flower, hmmm?

Interesting anecdote.  The promise of income from tourism provided the 
startup capital for the infrastructure, which is now taken advantage of by 
the locals, who now provide the majority of the current revenue stream.

Huh? I get the feeling that you think entanglement links are some
kind of communications channels you can send information through?
Entangled particle pairs do have shared quantum information, but
you cannot get classical information from that. So if module A is
entangled with module B, you could get perfectly correlated random
numbers, but not send the contents of A to B over the link.

Entanglement in itself does not consume any energy, but you still 
have to send the carrier particle from the origin to the 
destination to get the link (and once you have used up the 
entanglement you need another). It is not FTL communication.

Yes, but this is based on FTL communication, not entanglement. If 
we can make small wormholes this might work.

Hmm? Entanglement is relatively well understood (at least we think
we understand it, no anomalies that I know of). I get the feeling
you have not kept up with the field of quantum cryptography, which
is where most of the action is right now. The latest issue of
Science has a good article about it.


Science, Vol. 301, Issue 5633, 621-623, August 1, 2003
 
Long-Distance Free-Space Distribution of Quantum Entanglement 

Markus Aspelmeyer,* Hannes R. Böhm, Tsewang Gyatso, Thomas 
Jennewein, Rainer Kaltenbaek, Michael Lindenthal, Gabriel 
Molina-Terriza, Andreas Poppe, Kevin Resch, Michael Taraba, Rupert 
Ursin, Philip Walther, Anton Zeilinger 


We demonstrate the distribution of quantum entanglement via optical 
free-space links to independent receivers separated by 600 m, with 
no line of sight between each other. A Bell inequality between 
those receivers is violated by more than four standard deviations, 
confirming the quality of the entanglement. This outdoor experiment 
represents a step toward satellite-based distributed quantum 
entanglement.

Perusing through an astronomy magazine I came across this article

   -----------------

Time not quantized -
http://www.astronomy.com/Content/Dynamic/Articles/000/000/001/219fcvov.a
sp

"...observations by the Hubble Space Telescope have shaken the idea that
time is quantized"

"If time is quantized like the energy of photons, there should be a
certain minimum measurable quanta of time, called a "Planck time" (named
after German physicist Max Planck, who originated the idea of quanta).
This also means that life, like a movie, may appear to be a continuum of
unfolding events but is really nothing more then a series of snapshots
that together define the past and future.  One consequence of quantized
time is that the speed of light should not be measurable with a
precision better than one unit of Planck time, because time becomes
undefined or "blurry" at smaller intervals. If light is quantized, it
might have minute speed differences that we cannot measure. "

"If photons emitted from a source at the same instant have tiny speed
differences, the light waves will arrive at Earth with different phases.
Over short distances, these discrepancies aren't noticeable...Over large
distances, though, differences in the light become apparent"

"Astronomers Richard Lieu and Lloyd Hillman at the University of Alabama
in Huntsville used this idea to look for speed distribution in light
from galaxies billions of light-years away that were imaged by the
Hubble Space Telescope. If all photons are traveling from the galaxy at
the exact same speed then all the light waves will arrive in phase. When
they pass through a telescope's aperture, they interact with each other
to create a pattern of bright and dark rings "

"However, if the speeds are even the tiniest bit off, the light is not
in phase. These light waves align chaotically, and no pattern is formed.
Lieu and Hillman suspected that slight differences in the speed of
individual photons would cause their light waves to get out of sync over
great distances, preventing the Airy disk from forming. Much to their
surprise, the light was all in phase and an Airy disk appeared, implying
that time is not quantized"

     ----------------

I found this quite surprising.  Surprising, first of all, that time
might not be quantized, since space, energy, momentum all are.  This
also has some implications to the last long identity debate I took part
in.  In that debate, I asked if time was quantized in sync, in other
words, as all energy progressed through time, was it ALL simultaneously
created and destroyed, or did each sub atomic particle or quanta have
its own Planck time ruler.  The implications are important, in the
former, the entire universe is created and destroyed at every instant of
time to the next, which would mean to me, no big deal if you teleport me
in a plank length of time.  In the latter case, at any given instant of
time, that vast majority of the universe is a continuation from the
instant before, in which case by my definitions identity is preserved
through time, and teleportation would not constitute a continuation of
consciousness.  

I also asked the question of the space-time quantization was an absolute
smallest scale of any part of the universe's existence, or if it was
merely the limit the laws of physics imposed on our observational
abilities.  This article implies that the latter is the case.  That even
though we can not measure any smaller than the plank length (or time)
that it non-theless exists, as in this experiment it would have
permitted small discrepancies in the speed of light, and caused the
light traveling great distance to be out of phase, and thus not cause
definitive interference patterns.  

However, the existence of the interference patterns can imply 1) time is
not quantized OR 2) that small discrepancies can not arise in the speed
of the photons.  This article is written in a manner that assumes 2 to
NOT be the case, and thus suggests that 1 is.  Is this the generally
accepted view in physics?

Additionally, the existence of interference patterns could have still
occurred if time was quantized, but space-time did not actually exist in
any increments smaller than the plank length / time, thus making it
impossible for there to be speed variations.  This researcher /article
obviously implies that time exists in intervals smaller, since it would
have direct measurable consequences.  My next question would be, is this
established in the quantization of energy and space?  Are there any
observational consequences of energy space existing in intervals smaller
than the plank intervals, and have these tests been conducted?

More to the point, if this article is correct, and these results are
found to be valid, then time is not quantized, and thus teleportation
could never considered to be anything other than a destructive copying
mechanism, and by my definitions will always result in there being no
continuation of consciousness.

In short, I was right, ppbbbbb!  =)

As far as I know, John has never called himself a Singularitarian.  He 
also doesn't seem to use the term "Singularity" much anymore.  I'd drop it 
myself if I could.  Shame about the massively predictable catastrophe 
where everyone tries to kidnap the nice poetic word for their own wildly 
different usages, wish I'd seen it coming in advance.

I believed that was the proposition.  I find it dubious, but

atoms (plus, of course, a whole lot of support equipment, 
refridgerators, etc.).  And large classes of problems would disolve into 
"trivially solved".    Large classes.  And this change could come *quickly*.

I understand that this is current belief, and I accept it as the most 
probable truth.  Certainly there will be stringent limits on and 
deviations from this assessment.  But I've seen many "well accepted" 
theories reinterpreted.  And so I'm unwilling to consider this a "final 
word".  (Big crunch, expand gently forever, or tear yourself to 
ribbons?  What's the fate of the universe.  Just two years ago it was 
"certain" that the universe would either collapse violently, or expand 
forever at a decreasing rate.  But now there's doubt.)

How does one get the negative energy density to stabilize them?  This is 
another possibility, but I feel realtively confident that wormhole 
communicaitons will always be expensive.  But it might have a very fast 
bit rate.  (Would a high speed laser link cause problems with keeping up 
the needed negative engery gradient?  I don't know the rules here.)

Many people understand a lot more about it than I do.  I'm basically a 
programmer.  And, I must admit, cryptography doesn't interest me.   My 
understanding is more at the level of Scientific American and Science 
News.  So I know the general outlines of current beliefs on, say, 
entanglement, but not the details or the certainty.  I do, however, 
remember the absolute confidence that I heard given to sentences like 
"We'll never be able to see a single atom.  Quantuum theory forbids 
it."  Which is sort of true...but not really, as quantuum dots and the 
Scanning Electron Microscope showed.  The math was solid, but the 
translation into physical models was flawed.

I haven't read the article, but I'm aware of it.  And I know that what 
they demonstrated was the transportation of infomation via ordinary 
particles.  (Perhaps photons?  I expect so, but I didn't read the 
article.)  This doesn't, in and of itself, imply anything about other 
approaches.  So I'm still willing to consider that they might exist.  
I'm sorry that I misunderstood what you were proposing.  (Which I'm 
still not certain about.  Qbits is all I could  think of after your

Well, Robin's paper at http://hanson.gmu.edu/lifeinsim.html
"How to Live in a Simulation" ends with the by-now familiar
words

   If you might be living in a simulation then all else equal
   it seems that you should care less about others, live more
   for today, make your world look likely to become eventually
   rich, expect to and try to participate in pivotal events,
   be entertaining and praiseworthy, and keep the famous people
   around you happy and interested in you. 

Besides your suggested improvement above, namely that morality
should be root reality oriented, do you (or does anyone) have
a list of current improvements to Robin's advice?  (To be honest,
I take very little of Robin's advice on this, perhaps mostly due
to laziness, but do find welcome this new suggestion that one's
moral behavior ought to be as if one lived in root reality.)

The good news is this answers a question I was going to ask Charles
(about whether one had to have fiber to maintain entanglement or
whether it was possible in "free-space").

The bad news is that it looks like I may have to start printing
more "Get out of Jail Free" cards (to discuss "magic physics").

Damn, damn and double damn.

Okay, something specific without doing any actual engineering.

The idea would be to use standard (fast, good, reliable, future...) 
computers to store and house and process data and use spin-coupling as 
a networking technique for messaging across the 
ultra-wide-area-network.  This ASSUMING that spin-coupling can be made 
reliable as a communication medium.

It strikes me there are a few "hard" problems as with all 
networking-related problems 1)  interference and 2) medium 4) 
bandwidth.  I expect that interference can be overcome as a problem 
with redundancy and error-checking and such.  I expect that if you were 
to build a truly distributed machine, the nodes could be connected by 
some kind of medium at relatively short distances (say two every 100k  
Kilometers) making propagation pretty simple.  What kind of medium 
would support the interference-less communication of spin-spin 
coupled-pairs over long distances will have to be left to better 
physicists than me.  Perhaps someone who gets a free pass could jump in?

Then on the client nodes you'd use something like pre-executed 
instructions (assuming that the computers you build would be faster 
than the communication medium) where you execute all the possible (or 
likely) scenarios "virtually" until you know which scenario is the 
actual one, commit once confirmation is received and move on.  This 
would allow relatively efficient communication method - only send the 
confirmed instruction set's signature rather than sending the whole 
thing.

I don't see this particular problem as technically less tractable than 
actually creating a replica of a personality in any computer AT ALL.

I do see that it's likely to be very expensive and organizationally 
getting enough people together to agree that it's a good enough idea 
that they could dedicate three or four generations worth of lives to 
building such a thing sounds like the a genuinely intractable problem.

Storage would have to be standard, I'm only proposing a communication 
mechanism.  The problem is how to keep the nodes in sync.     If there 
is a moore's law of networking speed, then we can expect with Gigabit 
wireless over sattelite TODAY, we can expect multi-terrabyte wireless 
over stellar distances within the next 100 years or so.

There is no known such information transmission effect. But I hope we 
can squeeze something out of quantum gravity (if spacetime on the Planck 
scale is filled with wormholes, there ought to exist shortcuts for 
communication - but I fear there might be probabilistic laws showing 
that you cannot on average send information faster than light).

We are already moving towards larger and larger quantum computing
systems. In general N qubits are worth 2^N ordinary bits, *but it
depends on the problem class*. I don't think large classes of problems
will trivially fold; we have had quantum computer theory for several
years now, and Shor's factoring algorithm and Grover's search algorithm
still seem to be the most useful ones found. I doubt one could do (say)
a chess algorithm this way. But we don't need large classes of 
algorithms to be speeded up, just some essential classes we can build 
computers on top of. Imagine a quantum algorithm that can act as a 
general but fast Turing machine - that would be revolutionary!

Beats me, but I would take a look at the Casimir effect. It is IMHO the 
only macroscopic negative energy effect I know.

If you pass too much mass/energy across, you get problems. My 
calculations (http://www.transhumanist.com/volume5/Brains2.pdf)  said 
that a one meter diameter wormhole has a max capacity of 1.56e87 bits/s, 
and a nanometer wormhole 1.56e69 bits/s. Quite a good bandwidth.

Sure. A lot of stuff gets said with absolute certainty that shouldn't be 
said that way. On the other hand, much is said in a doubtful way when it 
should be said certainly.

My personal rule is to avoid assuming stuff that would be better than 
current physics allows, or when you do it clearly mark it as wishful 
thinking.

Spin interactions are electromagnetic, so you get the usual 1/r^2 drop 
in strength. The problem is that you get a thermal noise level kT, so 
the range scales as 1/sqrt(kT) - it needs to be extremely cold to get a 
good range.

Not really, and you are essentially (ignoring the spin coupling part 
which is likely tricky hardware) scaling up an ordinary cluster 
architecture. Some problems with long latencies, but nothing unusual. I 
would likely go with optic communications instead, although having 
reversible communication (Robin has an old paper about it, very 
creative!) would be neat.

Use it for porn first. Seriously. Maybe computer games too. While
optimal solutions melt the heart of engineers (and people like me with
an engineering mindset), to get something built soon and creatively it
better give people what they want. The www was a success thanks to 
showing pictures rather than being a clever solution. Once people have 
funded the start of the M-brain to process their porn, spam, games and 
backup mindstates, then we can build the useful stuff on top of it.

Such laws only work up to physical limits (although they nicely enough 
do sneak around them quite often). There are problems with long-range 
communications. Here is the relevant part of my paper (in LaTeX 
notation):

\subsection{Bandwidth}

\begin{quote}
There is an old network saying: Bandwidth problems can be cured with
money.  Latency problems are harder because the speed of light is
fixed.  You can't bribe God.  -- David Clark
\end{quote}

Unfortunately, the amount of information that can be sent over an
information channel is limited. According to the Nyquist theorem, the
highest signal rate that can be carried over a channel with bandwidth
$W$ Hz is $C = 2W$ bits/second.  By using multilevel signaling $C = 2W
\log_2 M$, where $M$ is the number of discrete signal levels, but the
more levels in the signal, the more noise-sensitive it
becomes. Furthermore, forcing a physical quantity into one of $2^k$
possible ranges seems to be $2^k$ as hard as forcing it into one of
two ranges, rather than just $k$ times as hard \cite{Bennett94}. In
the following we will assume binary signals through the channel.

Using higher and higher frequencies of the electromagnetic
spectrum extremely high signal rates can be sent in a directional
manner, for example using lasers. Unfortunately there are some
problems involved with extremely high frequencies due to pair
production: in the presence of another particle or a field, the
gamma-ray photon may split up into pairs of electrons and
positrons. This occurs at a frequency of

\begin{equation}\nu = {2 m_e c^2 \over h}\end{equation}

at a bandwidth of $2 \nu \approx 4.9\cdot 10^{20}$ bit/s.  Although
this does not necessarily imply a limit on the bandwidth, it implies a
growing source of noise.  And since the energies of individual quanta
become higher, the number of quanta per Watt signal-strength decreases,
leading to increasing noise (see below).

Also, there is an upper limit to the rate of information that can be
sent using electromagnetic radiation for a given average energy
\cite{Caves94, Lachmann99}:
\begin{equation}
C=\left(\frac{512\pi^4}{1215h^3c^2}\frac{A_tA_r}{d^2}E^3\right)^{1/4}
\end{equation}
where $A_t$ and $A_r$ are the areas of the the transmitter and
receiver respectively, $d$ their distance and $E$ the power of the
transmitter. For a transmitter and receiver one square meter each one
meter apart and with a 1 J/s energy budget the information rate is
$1.61\cdot 10^{21}$ bits per second. The rate scales as $E^{3/4}$. The
optimal spectrum turns out to correspond to blackbody radiation, but
if the receiver can only detect the energy and timing of arriving
photons the spectrum instead corresponds to the spectrum of black
bodies in a one-dimensional world and the information rate becomes
\begin{equation}
C=\left(\frac{4\pi^2}{3h}E\right)^{1/2}
\end{equation}
which is independent of transmitter and receiver area and
distance. For an 1 J/s energy budget the maximum information rate
becomes $2.03\cdot 10^{17}$.

One obvious way to circumvent this problem is to send information
encoded in small pieces of matter at high speed. The energy
requirements are much larger when lightspeed is approached, so the
energy efficiency
\begin{equation}
\eta = {C \over P} = \frac{km}{(\gamma -1) mc^2}
= \frac{k}{c^2} {\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2} \over {1-\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}}
\end{equation}
(where $P$ is the energy used to accelerate the matter, $k$ is the
number of bits per kilogram and $v$ is the final speed) decreases
towards zero. On the other hand, the efficiency for very low speeds is
high, but is balanced by the longer delays.

As always, Bekenstein's bound introduces a constraint on information
flow. The message channel can be viewed as a chain of regions of size
$R$ containing energy $E$, in which information flows from one to the
next in time $R/c$ (assuming light-speed transmission). This gives a
bandwidth limitation of
\begin{equation}
C \leq \left ({2 \pi c \over \hbar \ln 2} \right) {R E \over (R /c)} = 
\left ({\
2 \pi \over \hbar \ln 2} \right) E
\end{equation}
or around $9\cdot10^{34}$ bit/(s J).

Regardless of the amount of energy used in transmitting information,
an additional limit is the Planck bandwidth
\begin{equation}W = 2 \sqrt{c^5/hG} = 2\cdot 10^{43} {\rm 
bit/s}\end{equation}
At this bandwidth, quantum gravity becomes important and the
wavelength of individual quanta becomes less than their
Schwartzchild-radius.

It should be noted that the above limits apply to single channels; by
using several noninteracting channels the information transmission
can be increased further.

\subsection{Noise}
\label{sec:noise}
In reality, the channel capacity is somewhat lower due to noise.
Shannon demonstrated that the maximal channel capacity (also
called the error-free capacity) in the presence of noise is

\begin{equation}C= W \log_2 (1+ {S \over N})\end{equation}

where $S$ is the signal power and $N$ the noise power. Shannon also
proved that if the information rate is lower than the error-free
capacity, then it is possible to use a suitable coding to completely
avoid errors.  If energy dissipation is no problem, then noise can be
ignored. Otherwise, the bandwidth will at least grow as the logarithm
of the power used.

Noise leads to the problem that energy has to be expended in
sending the information. In a noiseless channel information can be
sent without dissipation \cite{Landauer94}, but the minimum energy per
unit of information required to transmit information over a channel
with effective noise temperature $T$ satisfies the inequality
\begin{equation}\frac{E}{I}\geq kT \label{eq:levitin}\end{equation}
as shown by \cite{Levitin98}. The dissipation will be $E(T)$ J, where
$E(T)$ is the minimum possible energy for the system with a given
entropy; not all energy used in the information channel will be lost.

For extremely dense and high-bandwith systems energy dissipation from
communication will likely play an important role, a role that cannot
easily be circumvented with reversible computing. The exact amount of
communications used is however very architecture dependent, ranging
from nearly none in passive repositories of information to $R^6$ in
3D-structures where every node communicates with every other node.

The phase coherence of light from extragalactic sources -

in time and space Richard Lieu, Lloyd W. Hillman

I really like this experiment. I do not have the time to go
through the paper carefully, but they seem to get that c is
exact to 1:10^32. This is good, but the Planck time is
5.4*10^-44, so they seem to be a few orders of magnitude away. 

However, if the quantization is not assumed to be random but
regular in some way (like in a cellular automaton) then the
problem disappears.

If time isn't quantized, space isn't quantized either. You can
always rotate them into each other by a Lorenz transformation. 

Hmm, I wonder if this could be used to do some kind of
gravitational ultraviolet catastrophy?

Preservation of myocyte structure and mitochondrial integrity in subzero
cryopreservation of mammalian hearts for transplantation using antifreeze
proteins-an electron microscopy study.

Amir G, Rubinsky B, Kassif Y, Horowitz L, Smolinsky AK, Lavee J.

Department of Cardiac Surgery, Heart Transplantation Unit, Sheba Medical
Center, Tel Hashomer, 52621, Ramat Gan, Israel

OBJECTIVE: Freeze tolerant fish and insects in nature are able to survive
subzero temperatures by noncolligatively lowering the freezing temperature
of their body fluids using a family of thermal hysteresis proteins
(antifreeze proteins, AFPs) specific for each species. Past efforts to
cryopreserve mammalian hearts using these proteins were unsuccessful. We
report the first successful subzero cryopreservation of rat hearts using
fish derived antifreeze proteins with preservation of myocyte structure.
METHODS: Heterotopic heart transplantations were performed in isoimmunic
Sprague Dawley rats. Donors' hearts were arrested using University of
Wisconsin (UW) solution and preserved in UW solution containing AFP I (six
experiments) or AFP III (six experiments) at concentrations of 15-20 mg/cc
for 2-6 h at subzero temperatures ranging from -1.1 to -1.3 degrees C. Four
control experiments were performed by preserving harvested hearts in UW
solution alone at -1.3 degrees C for 6 h. In all experiments ice was added
in the solution for crystallization. Heterotopic transplantations were
performed in the abdomen of the recipient rats. Viability was visually
assessed and graded on a scale of 1 (poor contraction) to 6 (excellent
contraction). The hearts were then fixed in vivo and processed for electron
microscopy study. RESULTS: All hearts preserved at subzero temperatures
using AFP I or AFP III survived displaying viability scores of 4-6 1 h after
transplantation. Three of the four control hearts that were preserved
at -1.3 degrees C without the protective effect of AFP froze and died upon
reperfusion. Electron microscopy study of hearts preserved with AFP
demonstrated preservation of myocyte structure and mitochondrial
integrity.CONCLUSION: Subzero cryopreservation of mammalian hearts for
transplantation using AFP I or AFP III is feasible with preservation of
myocyte structure and mitochondrial integrity.

### I wonder how low can one go with the temperature, as you increase the
concentration of the AFP. 15 mg/cc is pretty low as soluble protein
concentrations go.

Hmmmm. So you are saying that you believe something will happen that has
never happened before in the history of the universe? (Because there is 
no sign of them out there).  And all the other times that the opposite 
happened in the past in our history, don't matter?

Any civilization is a product of its past history. An immortal
Z-strategy post-singularity civilization will be master of its local
environment and using intelligence beyond our understanding to
control its own evolution.  As a Z-strategy civilization it will
have a long history of seeking very low reproductive rates before it
gained access to very large (possibly unlimited) resources.

The r-strategy populations that maximise reproduction in our world are
all natural evolution cases where suddenly an abundance of food becomes
available. The post-singularity civilization is consciously controlling
its own evolution. Big difference!

This statement is incorrect. The fact that a few populations move from
one strategy to the other is well-known and much studied. Several
species have been studied which go through repeated and regular
population 'Boom and Bust' cycles. They start off as r-strategists and
breed furiously. Next phase, they hit one of the limits, move to being
K-strategists and the population collapses. Then the cycle starts over
again. Any of the standard limiting factors can be the cause of the
'Bust' phase, food, space, predators, parasites, etc. But this
interesting phenomenon is driven by Nature 'red in tooth and claw' and
is totally irrelevant to a post-singularity civilization which is
intelligently controlling its own evolution.

As a rule, populations DO NOT change from r-strategy to K-strategy. Once 
a Z-strategy elephant - always a Z-strategy elephant.
Similarly, once an r-strategy rat - always an r-strategy rat. Rat high
reproductive volume continues even in lean times. That's why an
r-strategy species has a high reproductive rate - they know many
children will die. That is their survival tactic.

It is most unlikely (I believe impossible) that a K-strategy
post-singularity civilization will suddenly decide that a better
survival strategy is to breed like rats and swamp the universe.

I suppose it is theoretically possible that they might suddenly decide
"Hey look, we can afford it now. See at all that food out there. Let's
go eat the universe!". Remember they have recently gained unlimited
resources so they can afford the unlimited expansion.
But if they already have unlimited resources, why would they want more?

Infinity is so restricting, don't you think? ;)

This expansion throughout the universe has not happened so far and it
seems to me to be unlikely to the point of impossibility that a
z-strategy civilization would do something so against the very nature of
their civilization. As they have unlimited resources already, they don't 
need safety in numbers. Let's hear your reasoning if you wish them to 
behave otherwise!

My description provides a reasoned explanation of why the universe is
not full of either a single (the first!) species, or full of warring
civilizations all trying to swamp the universe with their own species.
i.e. The Great Silence is because that's the way advanced civilizations
want it.

The other alternative, of course, is as Lee originally suggested, that
we are actually the first intelligent species in our light cone.

I wanted to know a bit more about:
a) mature stem cells (as opposed to fetal stem cells)
b) reverse differentiation (differentied cells becoming 
undifferentiated, apparently linked to mature stem cells).
 
Specifically, I was curious if anyone has established
a normal proportion for either mature stem cells, or the equivalent of 
a basal metabolic rate (base rate) for reverse differentiation... and 
whether or not they linked that to resistence to onslaught of aging...

> Damn, damn and double damn.
> R.

Nielsen and Chuang have shown (1997) it is not possible to build a
general purpose quantum computer which can be programmed to perform 
an arbitrary quantum computation. Thus a universal programmable quantum 
gate array - a gate array which can be programmed to perform an 
arbitrary unitary operation - that is to say a gate which could be 
used to store and execute any program upon a quantum register - exists 
only if one allows the gate array to operate in a 'probabilistic' 
mode. Damn.

But it is possible to store, efficiently enough, an arbitrary unitary 
operation in the pure state of a 'finite' quantum register, in a way 
that it can be performed at a later time. Yep.

It follows, from the above, that no 'finite' dimensional programmable
gate array can be used to teleport an arbitrary unitary operation,
with a 100% efficiency. Damn. But it is possible to store, efficiently
enough, an arbitrary unitary operation in a quantum state which can
be teleported, later. 

In example a N qu-bits program can be teleported from Alice to
Bob - consuming N e-bits of entanglement and N c-bits (classical 
comunication from Alice to Bob)- so that Bob, even ignoring the
program, can perform it.

The teleportation protocol scheme can be also applied when portions
of a global quantum computation are performed at (very) distant
locations. Imagine Alice and Bob, in two distant locations, each of
them performing a portion of a quantum computation. Let us suppose
that the output qu-bits of Alice's QC are the input for Bob's QC, 
or viceversa, etc. etc. Yep.

In these cases (above) the distributed quantum computing system is 
based on the standard teleportation protocol scheme. Which means that
Alice must send (at least) a couple of c-bits to Bob telling him
the result of her 'Bell state' measurement and what to do.
But, we know, the classical communication channel is slow, especially
when Alice and Bob live in separated regions of ... a galaxy! Damn.

Now, what if Alice changes the standard teleportation protocol? That 
is to say, what if Alice does not communicate anything to Bob? It 
follows that Bob cannot be sure he got anything from Alice, and whether
or not he got the teleported 'right' quantum state (or the 'right' 
qu-bits program). He just knows that the quantum state (or program) 
he received from Alice is the 'right' one, within a certain probability, 
25% in example. Damn.

Now is it possible to build a distributed quantum computing network
based (just) on the quantum communication channel which is fast but 
also so risky? And what if Alice and Bob are the very same person?

Excellent. If possible, could all list members doing so respond that
they are doing so and to what papers and politicians? Thanks.

You misunderstood: I, myself, am not convinced that
this needs to be sponsored by the government (as I
said: let the market itself provide a market, as it is
already doing in other areas), so I will "take this
lying down".  That's just my opinion and my intended
(in)action, of course.

Sure, I will be glad to tell you what I am doing about the Orlowski article:  
I am doing diddlysquat, to be precise.  It was a slam piece, just someone's 
opinion.  Apparently it was not all that untruthful.  

What I don't understand is why so many people think they can pass judgment on 
this terror futures idea (pro or con) within just a few minutes of reading a 
news article. I think you would need to make a prolonged and detailed study 
of the idea in order to really understand it.

Absolutely, if the answer has been misplaced.
(Of course, we are talking about an era in which
gratification may be obtained in any way wished,
so there is a higher, aesthetic sense driving the
selection of problems.)

Yes, thank you for the reminder.  I do lose sight of that
now and then.  I don't think it affects my conclusions,
however.

Cannot quite agree: in the image I have of what will
happen, one will colonize everything.  And that is true
whether the remote matter ought to be considered to be
a version of oneself or not.

Well, I do tend to ignore "threats" from others that won't
materialize in a long time.  (It's much as if I were stranded
on a desert island with 10 other people and enough supplies
for 30 years.)  We have to have a *discount factor* operating
here in your value calculations.

I wonder why it is that I don't worry about that and you
do?  I assume that distant people (even in L.A.) probably
aren't going to turn into threats in the foreseeable or
unforeseeable future.  There is a lot of living to do without
such arcane concerns.

Well, criticize this: they indeed have got a Jupiter brain
going there just as the solar system has its.  I dismiss
the threat of *physical* aggression because the distances
are too great, and the size and sophistication of the
invaders would have to be too superior.  But algorithms
are another story.  I have always pictured a "Wind from
Earth" in the sense of frighteningly superior algorithms
that local matter may or may not run as they are received
electromagnetically.  (You have stated that there are 
probably quickly arrived at upper limits to how advanced
matter will get, and my statements here are modulo that.)

Either you do not run these algorithms (and do not attempt
to incorporate them into yourself)---and run the risk of
falling further and further behind---or you do run them,
and run the risk of having your identity changed a lot and
in ways you don't anticipate.  The evolutionary struggle
never really ceases.

But it would be silly for a local intelligence to seriously
diminish its standard of living by spending resources attempting
to anticipate and prevent developments at Alpha Centauri.

Okay, and I probably should have read some " :-) "s into 
there, but attribution is not done as responsibly in general
as in the good old days, and I was just worried.

Ah, then a typical list response. Sorry if I mistook you for a doer.

While I agree that it doesn't necessarily need to be sponsored by the
government, my point isn't a matter of lobbying for government
financing. My point is that we need to represent a rational argument
for PAM in the public discourse, something that the liberal anti-market
types are dominating so far with their demonization of PAM and Robin.
Failure to do so may do more than end government support of PAM, they
might make it illegal to do in the private sphere as well.

If you think I came to a conclusion about PAM or Robin based on
Orlowski's slam, you are extremely deluded.

Once more, another typical list response, doing nothing. So highly
friggin extropic of you. I propose this list be renamed the entropians list.

Taking a look at a couple of Max's short pieces, I
note his mention of the Gramein Bank - the micro-loans
program - as an example of how to be socially
conscious and profitable, or something like that - in
his BLOG on "Why Marx Was Even More Wrong Than You
Thought."

I'm surprised on that note that Mondragon was not
mentioned.  The Mondragon Cooperative is a
world-class, outstanding business which breaks all the
prevalent business models. 

http://www.mondragon.mcc.es/

Of course, there are reasons:

The "Progressive (in a pig's eye! as progressive as
"Pro-Life" is...) Left" won't talk about Mondragon
because they aren't a socialist model at all.  In fact
they came out of the Basque Anarcho-Syndicalist school
if anything, and they have never taken a penny of
state money or assitance that I know of and have never
hocked their future to any state bank, either.  So
there, stupid socialists!  Look at all the utter
failures of socialism.  Try to find a success, just
one, anywhere???  

But Mondragon bootstrapped itself into being an
$8billion business, with its OWN bank, its OWN schools
and university, its OWN social security and health
coverage, ALL paid for voluntarily by its
worker/owners.  Ie., Mondragon is actually DOING all
the great social things that the socialists have been
holding up as an ideal.  Workers runing their own
businesses, themselves - Mondragon (NOT red China, or
Cuba, or the former Evil Empire).  What guns and
terror couldn't accomplish, hard-headed practical
business sense did with flourish and taste.

And the Right (what, another total misnomer???  When
were they ever right about anything?) hates Mondragon
because Mondragon has succeeded spectacularly as a
profit-making business WITHOUT the top-down leadership
of megabuck-salaried brave captains of industry
leading the stupid workers.  NO.  The WORKERS RUN
MONDRAGON!  And they have ALL the benefits that the
socialist left wants, plus job security, plus high
wages, and they made a $250Million net profit last
year during a world-wide economic downturn, while
doing major worldwide community outreach, such as with
the Doctors Without Borders.

so.  there.  


Check it out.  ;)

With respect Mike the best person to put any rational
argument for PAM in the public discourse is Robin.

If Robin wants assistance he is likely to want particular
types of assistance because media/political campaigns
need to be *organised*. A public list, in full view of 
your 'opposition' is hardly the best place to discuss
strategy.

Now this *is* an interesting point. Financial markets
are amongst the most globalised phenomena that
there are. I am not certain that the US government
could make PAMs effectively illegal. I am not sure
they have legal jurisdiction. 

Even assuming they did have legal jurisdiction over
the actions of US nationals, and internet sites etc
in the US, there is a little document called the 
Constitution which I reckon still has something 
useful and authoritative to say about free speech
and free association.  I don't have time to get
forensic on this. But perhaps there is a US
lawyer or some others reading that might care to
comment.

Brett

Well, Bill that cannot be a good argument in general: after all,
here on Earth itself there have been many "unprecedented"
developments, such as the beginning of life itself.  Also, please
specify whether you mean "the visible universe" or the whole
infinite universe.  But I will leave to Randall further analysis
of your arguments there.  Next you turn to Rafal:

You may wish to comment upon the difference that happens at
the periphery of an expanding population versus what happens
in the interior.  At the periphery, why would k-strategists
evolve?

I wish that you would try harder to think of very advanced
life in other than terms relating to familiar species.
Future species will obviously be at least as malleable
and adaptable as humans have shown themselves to be.

You wrote earlier

No way.  Advanced civilization will resemble---from the
outside---The Blob, all absorbing and all engulfing.
The term "reproduction" that I used was meant quite
abstractly---literally turning remote matter into 
intelligence something like one already is.  Not genes
and DNA.

Isn't that where all the evidence points at present?
Actually, I want to thank Rafal for bringing up in
a different post

There are quite a number of productive places in that

I am doing other things.  I disagree that action is

Doubtful.  The calls are for the government not to
fund
PAMs.  Trying to make them illegal would run into
trying to make certain forms of betting - that look
like betting in the present memespace, rather than
elaborate plots to disguise and fund already criminal
activity - illegal, which certain jurisdictions will
not tolerate, even to the point of prevention of
enforcement disobedience if necessary.  (Nevada, for
example.)

Extropes,

I've got a question.  

You generate two entangled and undisturbed photons,
which head off in different directions toward distant
detectors.  

Detector number one is closer than detector number
two.  Detector number one will be triggered, or not
triggered--the "wave front" disturbed by a
measurement, or, alternately, not disturbed by letting
the "wave front"/photon pass by
unmeasured/unmolested--before the "wave front"/photon
reaches detector number two.   

Okay?

As I understand it, these two photons can be described
as a wave function, and their being "entangled"
presupposes/requires that they are "undisturbed",
which is another way of saying that they have not been
disturbed by any attempt at measurement, which is yet
again equivalent to saying that the wave function
(related to the eigenvector, right?) is "uncollapsed".

Good so far?

So now we have a situation where the wave-particle
duality is fully actualized, no?  The two photons can
become determinate particles at the touch of a
measurement. Yet before that happens we are
nevertheless firmly confident--equally certain-- of
'their' reality. We know that we made them(generated
them). That we did so in a manner which has in the
past, with perfect reliability, produced photon pairs
just like this untouched wave/'pair' to which we are,
in this moment(once more, with feeling) directing our
attention.  And as before we find ourselves dealing
with that by-now-familiar quantum condition, that
quantum indeterminacy thing, where the photons
exist--their existence not in question, just their
final, definite, measurable, determinate form, no? 
And when that final state is provoked by the
inevitable measurement, we will have one photon in one
place and state, and the second in the other place and
complementary state, no? 

Okay.  If everything is agreeable to this point, then
here's my question:

Can it be determined, at detector number two, whether
the wave function has already--presumably at detector
number one--been "collapsed", whether the photons have
already been "disentangled"? 

Best, Jeff Davis

I do not believe you can take your projected long run advantages for granted 
for the reasons stated.  In the foreseeable run of events, given current 
human individual and organizational realities, it is far more likely that 
major oppression of all that is outside what is currently accepted or 
currently in power would ensue.  This would lead to a radical lack of 
innovation and a stagnation of production values.    To get around this I 
think you will need to come up with a lot more compelling arguments about how 
the innovative and new that disagrees with current ruling thought and 
practice has room to develop and come to sufficient fruition for the system 
to change and grow.    

I don't see where this would lead to economic sufficiency any more than the 
group mindedness of various socialized economies led to greater efficiency.  
How would the lack of private thought and deed improve the picture precisely?

Is your decision then arbitrary?  Because you don't seem to be fully 
presenting your reasons for it.  Nor do you seem interested in showing how it 
will not lead to dystopia.   How is this responsible?

The argument I made (borrowing from Tim Maudlin) in THE WHITE ABACUS is
that you can't even tell which one gets collapsed first, because in
relativity you can jiggle frames to argue either one happens before the other.

But I am not a lawyer.

Well, the East Coast (U.S.) people may have seen this already,
but I just saw it on the Tonight Show on the West Coast --
Arnold S. has announced that he *will* run to be the governor of
California during the recall election.

Now this may make politics interesting enough again to actually
get people involved.  Boy, one can imagine some interesting
commercials for this campaign (e.g. "The Terminator" will
terminate politics as it has become, etc.).

Can someone who knows more constitutional law than I answer
the question of whether or not Arnold can become president
(given that he was born outside of the U.S.)?  [Thanks.]

Jeff, this question used to confuse the living daylights out of me until I 
encountered many-worlds theory.  Now it still confuses the living 
daylights out of me, but I can at least see what the answer is supposed to 
be, and where it's supposed to come from.  I think.  I'm not going to try 
and explain it because I don't understand it that well yet.  Anyway, 
many-worlds theory, which gets rid of that nasty "collapse" business, is 
where I think you should look for an *intuitively visualizable* answer. 
Afterward you should be able to translate your visualization back to 
conventional quantum mechanics, if necessary.

But you are right.  This resembles the EPR situation, and
I have an essay that explains the MWI version of EPR.
http://www.leecorbin.com/EPR_MWI.html

Damien is exactly right.  If the separation between two
events P and Q is spacelike, (which only means that there
is no way to send a photon from one event to the other),
then if you are traveling with sufficient velocity towards
the space coordinates of P, then in your reference frame
P will happen first.  Vice-versa for Q.

I know that you don't have time or interest to give
the entire history of technology, :-) but how do you 
explain that some societies do have (relative)
freedom?  How is it that those in power are not
in total control now, and how did we ever evolve
away from domination by an elite?   And if you can
answer that, then why couldn't such forces succeed
in the future too?

That is indeed an interesting take on this subject, especially
considering the standard extropian take on the ideal role of the govt.

In fact one could argue that the terrorism futures market project  is
no different from the typical military-industrial complex pork thrown
to academics with the appropriate political inclinations.

Well I know enough to do a sort of google then run a 
find on "born" anyway ;-)
 
The Constitution of the United States of America.
http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.overview.html

Under Article II [The Presidency]
Section 1 [Election, Installation, Removal] 

"No person except a natural born citizen, or a citizen of the 
United States, at the time of the adoption of this Constitution,
shall be eligible to the office of President; neither shall any
person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained
to the age of thirty five years, and been fourteen Years a
resident within the United States."

So on my reading, (and contrary to what I thought I knew),
if Arnie is a US citizen  and has been a resident for 14 years
he is not precluded.

-----

[And as a *complete* aside :-) 

Section 2[Impeachnent] includes the following

'Before he enter on the execution of his office, he shall take
the following oath or affirmation:--"I do solemnly swear
(or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of President
of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, 
preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the 
United States." 

- "To the best of my ability" seems to be a pivotal phrase.

Some *are* more "able" than others.

Yet there is also the following to consider:
 
"In case of the removal of the President from office, or 
of his death, resignation, or inability (sic) to discharge the
powers and duties of the said office, the same shall devolve
on the Vice President, and the Congress may by law 
provide for the case of removal, death, resignation or 
inability, both of the President and Vice President,
declaring what officer shall then act as President, and 
such officer shall act accordingly, until the disability be
removed, or a President shall be elected."

So it seems the Congress could impeach a president 
and remove him (for gross incompetence). Although
such would be a pretty unlikely for (just say) a
republican congress given (just say) a republican 
president. ;-)

Diversion over - sorry about that]

Regards,
Brett

House but heck why not Jerry Springer?

On a *second* reading it depends where the emphasis is on
the word "or". 

If Arnie is not a natural born citizen ..... of the United States.

And was not (at the time of the adoption of this (original
Constitution) in the 18th century a citizen.

He would in fact be precluded. 

"Ors" can be a damn nuisance in legal documents. Most
statutes can be read with the guidance of an Acts 
interpretation Act. But the constitution, where it is
ambiguous would need to have any ambiguity resolved
ultimately by the Supreme Court of the United States.

I think the answer is Arnie cannot be President, (I reckon
this is what a constitution lawyer would argue to be the
likely ruling) and yet I still think were Arnie sufficiently 
determined to he might make a successful Supreme Court
challenge, on the grounds that the wording is ambiguous and
the alternate reading of the ambiguity (intended or not) is in
accordance with the broader spirit of the constitution if not
the mere isolated detail as intended by the founding fathers.

Real theatrical, philosophical stuff potentially.

Very cool :-) I'd say, with respect to cryonics, the peanut just got pushed
slightly forward.

What I'd like to see as a follow up (not having read the original paper) is
the same process applied to say pig hearts (comparable in size to the
human heart) with incremental decreased in temperature and longer period
of the organ being set aside in storage. If we can get hearts to liquid
nitrogen temperature then restore and successfully implant them we won't
exactly have our "Benny the dog" (Vanilla Sky) but we may have a partially

Information markets *are* effectively illegal in much
of the private sphere in the US, including Nevada.
Nevada only allows betting on sports.  The CFTC allows
people to create markets for gambling on commodities,
if risk-hedging functions are served and lots of money
will flow through it.  The only apparent safe place to
do private info markets is entirely within a particular
corporation.

The idea of info markets is that someone wants to know
something so they create/subsidize a market whose prices
will tell them what they want to know.  On the topic of
military/political instability in the Mideast, the US
government is one of the biggest potential customers,
since they should get great value from knowing.  Thus
losing them as a customer is a big setback to selling
that info product.

Hmm. Just had a thought. The difference between a
good and bad insurance company (as a business) 
may substantially be the quality of the information
that informs the construction of actuarial tables. 

As the rates of change accelerate the times for
roi for insurances co's will change. Those co's
that can better predict future shocks to existing
assumption embedded in their tables would
seem to have a competitive advantage. They
may ancipate new markets earlier and exit
unprofitable ones sooner.

### Indeed, it is conceivable that an authoritarian system with full thought
transparency would suffer from technological stagnation, compared to a
pluralistic, volition-based system with the same thought-reading capacity.
This is substantially identical to the comparison of communist authoritarian
states and the semi-pluralistic ones during the last century - stagnation
occurred in the former because of, among other things, poorly informed
centralized decision makers excluding alternative solutions, while the
pluralists could tolerate internal disagreement, without suppression of
valuable alternatives.

Please note that the disagreements between competing players in pluralist
societies are open, transparent, and yet the systems as a whole can tolerate
them, is not harmed by present levels of openness, and its ability to
reconcile conflict would not be harmed by even more openness. The essence of
the issue is not the exact level of transparency, but the ability to deal
with internal conflict. Whoever does it better, wins.

With thought transparency, the authoritarian systems would also be overtaken
and in due course destroyed by pluralistic ones.

### Simple. No lies, no lying politicians, no thieves, no cheating in
school, workplace, store, restaurant. No money spent on unnecessary car
repairs. Drastic reductions in violent crime, fraud. Cheaper everything. No
Bush lying about WMD. 200 000 000 000 $ saved right there.

### I am not attempting to prove that thought transparency will not lead to
dystopia (except as a side argument), merely express a belief that thought
transparency, if technically possible, will be implemented (or one might
say, will implement itself) because of competitive pressures, independently
of our wishes.

Huh? It says nobody born outside the USA can become president unless he was
naturalized when the constitution was adopted, is older than 35, and lived
in the USA for at least 14 years. Arnold was not born in the USA, so unless
he's about 200 years old and was naturalized when the constitution was
adopted he can't be president.

<brett>By including the word 'generally' above aren't you in

that there may be other reasons to rationalize other than seeking
an excuse for preemptive action...

<brett> In the real world, where our moral judgement is supposed 
to assist us, (or at least that is my contention) we are 
*never* fully prescient and so there is always *some* 
chance the suspected or likely mugger may not in fact
mug us. 

<me> perhaps; in real life, I generally prepare for the attack,
rather than instigate a pre-emptive attack.

<brett> Assuming one values oneself, how can we do
otherwise than weigh up the chances as best we can?
My answer - we can't. Therefore the point becomes 
how best we can. 

<me> learn to recognize (and avoid) abuse and abusive
behaviors..  that includes learning not to abuse others 
in an attempt to prevent said abuse.

<brett> At this point I think its worth distinguishing between 
a moral code, which may be a preconsidered 
framework that one uses to help reach a particular 
moral judgement and moral judgements per se. 

<brett> There are *no* moral codes that provide definitive
answers to all the moral dilemmas that arise just as
there are no maps on a scale of 1:1, therefore whenever
a particular moral judgement is required there is no
dodging that the subjective individual must make it
which or without the benefit of a more or less 
sophisticated moral code. 

<me> I see things in black and white;  I don't have
a particularly sophisticated moral code; just a 
sophisticated world-view.  The rules themselves are 
quite easy.  I might add that you can generate a complex
world view from an array of black/white values... and
if it is a matter of black and white values, then my moral
code does have a 1-to-1 correspondence.

<brett> Actually I'd say in the circumstances you describe 
the person *has* acted morally, but with poor 
judgement, so poor in fact that they may be found
to have acted illegally. 

<me> you would; I would not; the reason being that the
proper action is to act to seperate them, without harming
one party of another precisely because you are ill-informed.
You should have a duty (under your moral code) to negotiate
in good faith, and having said that, you have an obligation to
do due diligence in an attempt to (as completely as possible)
understand the situation.  Properly exercised restraint is a 
remarkeably under-appreciated quality.

> The point being that you have to consider the

<brett> Sure. But the "you" in this case is a subjective individual 
using their own judgement, when such judgement may 
or may not be particularly good. So it also behooves us to 
consider the granularity of the *moral code* that is taken 
by many of us into situations where it can guide particular 
moral judgements. 

<me> judgement and morality are entertwined, no?
you can't have a good moral code if you're judgement
is consistently unable to judge according to that moral 
code..  As to granularity of a moral code, I think it is sufficient
to establish a clearly understood (objective) test is in order 
to determine that level of granularity by which any particular
moral code can be applied to...


<brett>If one is running around in 2003 holding that the 10 
commandments are all the moral code that is needed 
one is going to come up against some particularly 
curly challenges in interpreting how to operationalise
the directive that though shalt not kill. 

<brett>Even this simple edict is subject to interpretation. Life in 
2003 is known to take place on more than the organismic level. 
Cells are alive. And human cancer cells are human life. 

<me> sure if you don't consider that human cancer cells replicate 
through meisos rather than fertilization.  of course (and this would 
be VERY interesting); what would happen if a cancer colony was 
able to generate say sperm.... would it be considered life...
intriguing thought.

<brett>Clearly it is absurb to argue that a cancer cell or a 
multiples of them are of moral weight with a person
dying of cancer. Yet this is not much of an exaggeration
beyond the proposition that say all embryos are a form of
human life when by human life what is obviously meant
is personhood.

<me> I say tear it out of the womb and see if it survives 
unaided.  if it does, boom, human being.  if it doesn't,
well then, at best it was an incomplete human being who
died.  There is no inherent reason to relegate women
to the equivalent of biological life carriers.

<brett>
Before laws can be set that codify legally what may and
may not be done it is prudent to have a moral disucssion
where the words we use do not obfuscate the reals 
issues at hand. Issues such as how does a civil society
weight the rights or potential persons (embryos, fetus etc
at different stages). When we do not decide or address
these questions public policy continues to be made on
the basis of outdated moral and legal codes. And persons
suffer needlessly.  

<me> Oh I would agree :) regarding a code of laws being
unduly influenced by any one particular moral code.  Personally,
I don't think laws should attempt to legislate morality.  It is
up to people to do that.

<brett> Really? I think the key word here is 'tend'. How could you
put a moral obligation on someone to act better than the
best of their abilities and knowledge?  

<me> I don't in real life; I hold everybody to the same standard 
that I hold myself to.

<brett> Do you think there is a moral sphere separate from the 
legal sphere? Some apparently don't. I think the legal sphere 
is smaller than the morals sphere.

<me> I think the two are completely seperate systems; that is not
to say a legal code cannot borrow from an established moral code
(or vice versa in cases where moral codes are not derived from
an unchangeable word of god).

<brett> Actually I think BR would hold the line even in the face of your
example. 
But BR overlooked a few things as Godel pointed out. Maybe he abandoned 
the search for a rational ethics too early. 

<me> I never read BR so I can't really comment on his particular
philosophical bent.
my circuit on philosophy keeps getting delayed; I can't stand wading
through stuff
thats no relevant (given my stripped down operating assumptions).  I
think someday
I'll get bored enough to get to the juicy parts [probably in some
condensed
version of all the philosophies].

> monroe on the island with me in order to remain sane?

<brett> Legally no. Morally? Depends. By the code I've been arguing it
*would* make a difference if there was some net difference in 
utility to you. ie. If you really *could* make the decision to 
hallucinate to preserve your sanity (or not) then I'd argue the 
moral choice is the one that you *think* will result in the best 
outcome for you. 

<me> ergo my confusion since I thought you stated that self-delusion was
immoral.
and yes, you can make a decision to hallucinate... same as you can wake
up (out of the
equivalent of a dream) when you are rescued.

<brett>
Whether it would in fact yeild the best outcome for you is not the point
as the 
facts of the outcome are not knowable to you at the time you decide. 

<me> I would say that they are; I would say that the only reason to
willing
self-delude yourself via fantasy or whatever is specifically because you
have examined the outcomes and decided that reality sucked and you could
do better. I would say that you would end up having to constantly
(subconsciously)
moniter reality to decide when you would come out of ur protective
insanity.

<brett> Now thats the moral code. The reason for the moral code is
that usually judgements will be required in real life which one 
cannot anticipate and the better, the more sophisticated your 
moral code the better, (the more enlightened) your judgement 
of your own best interests will be. 

<me> again I balk at the requirement for a sophisticated moral code;
you can have an incredibly simple moral code; but apply it through
the use of a sophisticated world view (ergo ur judgement). 

<brett> In this particular case I don't think there is much latitude for
immoral action as you really would be alone on the desert island in the
situation you stipulate. Of course the situation you stipulate could not
arise. One would never know one was going to be marooned for sixty years
AND CHOOSE to hallucinate. Hallucinations for the most part are going to
be dysfunctional even on the island. 

<me> .. for the most part? and I do dispute ur choosing to hallucinate;
ever hear
of self-hypnosis?  If you can get urself into a deep enough trance, you
can suggest
post-hypnotic suggestions that trigger when you wake... including the
post hypnotic
suggestion to renew itself until you are rescued.  And you can cause
hallucinations
in a deep enough trance btw.  And thats not even calling upon the
experience
of mystics, or people who have sufficiently advanced manipulation
techniques...

>  I tend towards a function and dysfunctional definition of sanity; if

<brett> This seems to be confounding sanity with ethics. 

Not really :)

<brett> Which is problematic if the insane cannot make 
sound judgements in their own interests by virtue of being insane.

<me> ergo my distinction between function and dysfunctional insanity.

<brett> So do I. The human condition is mortal. It would hardly 
behoove us to dwell on it excessively and abandon hope 
when there was none. Perhaps the illusion of a life after 
death only becomes dysfunctional when it gets in the way 
of the realisation of longer life in practice.  

<brett> In the vast majority of cases self-delusion *is* going to be 
harmful. In those circumstances where it is not harmful to 
anyone including the person who is self-deluded then I'd
agree it not immoral.  

<me> ok well then we've settled that line of logic :)

<brett> I think this is pure speculation. Would a less intelligent 
you be you? 

<me> does it make a difference if you are gauranteed to be happy?

<brett> If you think so there may be possibilites for you 
to chart a life for yourself that involves more happiness
and less intellect. But personally I don't think so. How do 
you aim at happiness without identifying something that
will make you happy. Happiness is not itself a thing that
can be persued. 

<me> ergo my point :) if you can't gaurantee happiness by
method of intelligence, and some mythical blue genie (whom
to the best of your abilities to discern is capable of granting) 
is willing to gaurantee ur happiness at the cost of your
intelligence than any sane, rational person of sufficient 
intellect would not think twice.  This assumes that everyone
wants to be happy[maiximized utility table]... which I don't

<brett> I don't I think its premature at best and problematic at
worst. One cannot be happy without a cause. Happiness
per se is not persuable. Pleasure is. Lesser levels of 
sentience are. But I doubt these are what appeal to you
as an alternative. 

<me> take a look at a little kid sometime :)

<brett> Ah I think you missed my point. The potential to persuade 
using the sociability aspect *is* far stronger when individuals are
powerless 
and my point is that the all those who are mortal are now becoming
*aware* 
that they possess a poor form of wealth and power if it can't extend
their life 
and health. 

<me> ... and these are the only people you're interested in approaching?

<brett> There is an opportunity there to get them to revisit the social
compact. 
But these cagey old survivers will not fall for bs. When arguments are
put to them 
that are not in their interest they will not buy into them.

<me> its been my experience that people who are very wealthy generally
don't
give a shit about social compact.  They got (and preserve) their wealth
at the
cost of other individuals...  I would agree that you need to put it in
terms
that involve greed.

<brett> So in my view a moral argument cannot be put to a rich or
powerful individual 
unless it is couched in terms of offering *something* for them. We live
in an 
historic period. In this  period it might be possible to promote a
policy of more 
life for all or more life for none. 

<me> good luck getting the rich to give a shit about the poor (past the
ones
making off with their valuables)....

<brett> The alternative may be cabals of the powerful working to 
'immortalise' themselves. Such a scenario may restart 
"history" whose demise was greatly exaggerated.  

<me> probably :) I hope to be part of a successful cabal :)

<brett> They learn to reason and they learn to use language to persuade.

They learn to understand what they want. This gives them the 
best chance to make their way and improve their situation as they go. 
It does not guarantee them success.

<me> that is common btw; in people from all walks of life

it seems (given the broadness) that it is inherent to peoples

<brett> I would have been happy to point out to the unibomber that
he was born social, so much so that he couldn't raise his head to feed.

become
extremely antisocial afterwards...

<brett> Then I'd ask him where his sociability ended. It could be an

<brett> None are capable of going it alone yet. But here is the point in
the future we may re-engineer ourselves to such an extent that some may
indeed feel capable of going it alone. And these indivduals will not
necessarily be able to be reasoned with with the same starting premises.
These individuals may become meglomanical persuing as the culmination of
their individuality dominance over all else. Because, if you have no

<brett> Everyone is social to a degree. Am I really saying that everyone

is reachable through their residual sociability. I doubt it. 
I think nature throws up dysfunctional types of all forms and 
some genuine sociopaths can probably only be dealt with as amoral 
threats. 

<me> watch some interviews with a sociopath :)  they're really quite
fascinating...  anyways, there's no reason to render a sociopath a
threat;
in fact, I'ld say they can be harnassed to detect flaws in current
modes.

<brett> Yes. Imo that is a possibility. For me the interest in morality
is linked 
to an interest in politics and in the means by which the possibility may

They could and may in may cases yet achieve more.

why change the status quo?

No because we *are* social we learn at least some moral
codes as we becomes socialised. We maybe go through
something like Kohlbergs levels of moral reasoning. 
We learn terms like utlilitarianism and consequentialism
and from this social stock of idea on moral codes we
fashion our own. We don't invent from scratch. 
I'm suggesting we van bet better moral codes into the
ground water. These won;t remove from individuals the
need to make moral judgements but they will increase 
the likelihood that reason and enlightenment are brought
to the process of agreement making and law making.

Absolutely. I am in my view doing a pretty poor and
very longwinded effort at that here. But perhaps in 
working it through like this I will be able to distill it
into something shorter and more convincing because
it will appeal to people as a sort of empowering 
knowledge. Like probability theory, or tit for tat.

No I offer them the viewpoint that getting my spleen
will come at great risk to them and provide them 
little nourishment. I suggest that they are better of 
regsrding me as a resource and seeking to cooperate
with me.  I am pretty resourceful and persuasive.
In many cases I'd expect to pull it off because I would
really find ways to cooperate. But in some cases
the universe is a bitch. If the other guy seems me
as food and I can't persuade him otherwise his 
circumstances and mine may genuinely be that 
desperate. Then, one of us will die and one of us
will eat.

The optimal solution for me, for the other of for 
both of us? It is in my view more likely to be the
optimal solution in more circumstances because it
is the more rationally approached solution and 
by being rationally approached we can consider
each others real needs and measure each others
real willingness to compromise AND at the
end of the day we can always fall back on the
option to compete. Come that unfortunate outcome.
I would compete *very* hard.

Pre-emption is slippery. Consider the word 
pretext. Give a politician a pretext and they are no
longer arguing pre-emption they are arguing reasonable
and measured response.

I think it does matter that its rational not emotional or faith or
belief based because reasoning facilitates coomunication and
understanding between sovereign agents far more 
effectively. Reason has as its tool language. I am not pooh poohing
emotion. Emotion is what makes life worth living by emotions cannot be
conveyed in the same way as 
reasons. Nor are they are reviewable and reliable in making judgements.
In science we do well to acknowledge that out emotions can mislead us. I
think we do well also to acknowledge this in the formulation of
contracts and laws.

It does those who finally want to munch on my spleen I regard as forces
of nature like sharks or lions. I don't regard their desire to eat me as
immoral but I definately regard my desire to avoid being eaten as just
and I feel fully free to exterminate such with extreme prejudice.

There are no *complete loners* that I am aware of. Yet the time of the
complete loner is likely to be in the future and these guys cou;ld be
very dangerous. For now dysfunctional loners that poss a threat, when
they poss a threat are fair game for 
taking action against. 

There are patterns in most forms of insanity. I'd take my 
understanding of the particular person and their alledged ailment into
account and go from there. The code doesn't prescibe a 
solution to all it only provides a (better I hope) framework. 
Individual judgements still need to be made.

I think my systme is more predictable than others. Those 
thatt present rationally are quickly processes rationally for cooperate
options and compete threats. Those that don't operate in a rational
paradign still fall into patterns. Animals are not rational, inanimate
objects are not rational, if a person behaves in an irrational way they
can often make themselves grist for my mill or the mill of others that
do act rationally and with an eye for the political.

You miss the political point. The audience is the voting public. It is
up to extropians to convince them of our relatively non-conservative
agendas or tohave to wear the policies that are put in place. 

It is for us to be smart in our communications or wear the consequences
ofnot being. When we use the word belief we weaken our cases where they
should be strongest -we usually have reasoned and we unlike our
opponents (should be) open to the superior 
argument.

Often the extropic message is a most persuasiveluy put
when it is put in terms of clear and unambiguous 
communication. 

I have personally seen huge decisons on national policy "justified" by
political leaders not on the basis of the evidence but on the basis of
belief.

Very much so. Fact is the legislation that exists in our countries is
established in a particular way. There is no point wishing it were
otherwise, it is as it is. Therefore I'd rather be an effective lobbyist
for the policies and laws I want to see enacted (or not enacted) then
not be.

Perhaps you are still relatively young and have yet to grow your
political teeth. This is fair enough. If you come to see the connection
between the stuff we aspire to and the legislations that goes through
nation 
parliament on stem cells and nanotechnology and intellectual property
you may see things differently. I do not mean to be patronising. 
Actually I'd like to be empowering. Many young extropes could be potent
political forces for change in their own individual right if only they
perceived the need and put some time into acquiring the skills.

Yes. Think of a train schedule, with known times for datapackets set up       
originally in physical proximity and secure EM communications available.      

One part of the data to be transmitted periodically is a timestamp, in case   
there                                                                         
are time slip issues for whatever reason. Another would be new timetables to  
begin at a specified time.                                                    

Of course, if any endpoint lost its time syncronization, it's out of the loop 
until                                                                         
secure data can be used to bring it back into communication with at least one 
other                                                                         
node still in sync - so perhaps you'll send triads of quantum nodes (or more) 
instead of singletons.                                                        

Could you send a transmission that's all 1's at a given time (agreed to prior 
by                                                                            
both ends, in case of loss of sync) and use that to resync?                   

With a repeating key, I know something like that is possible, but I don't     
have a                                                                        
real intuitive grip on the quantum encryption nuances yet...                  

There are potentially other methods, but this was the first which popped to
mind.

As far as we know, every new thing humans do has never happened before
in the history of the universe.  More below.

I think the problem is that we've been discussing "a civilization" as
if that term meant a thing, more-or-less indivisible, like a person.

I don't think it's meaningful to talk about actions or motives of
groups, but it's convenient shorthand for "most members of".  Of course,
using that shorthand leads to an evitable argument between those who
just use it as shorthand, and those who've internalized a concept of
group-as-thing.

Basically, I think you're begging the question when you assume that
a "post-singularity civilization [...] consciously controlling" itself
is possible without that "civilization" being a single person.

So let me qualify this to say that any civilization which is not 
actually
a single person cannot control its own change.  So if we're discussing
groups which have an internal governance that is so absolutely 
totalitarian
that they can, for a time, control rate and direction of change, I would
say that I don't expect groups like that to last long.  My guess is that
dystopias of control like this have a lifetime which is loosely 
inversely
correlated to how complete the control is.


There's a whole 'nother problem with your statement, in my opinion.  Let
me repeat part of that statement here so that I don't go off-track:
> An immortal Z-strategy post-singularity civilization will be master of
> its local environment and using intelligence beyond our understanding 
> to
> control its own evolution.

Evolution, I submit, is meaningless in the context of a single entity.  
In
that case, change is merely change.  Evolution is something that happens
with competing entities.  (Seems trivial, I know).  Applying that to our
discussion, when I talk about evolution of civilizations, I don't mean
change within a civilization.  I've mentioned why I don't expect there
to be only one civilization, above, so the only remaining objection is
if there is some universal reason why propagation or expansion results 
in
*less* of the entity or group expanding.

This may not be as verbose as it could be.  If it doesn't seem to make
sense, let me know and I'll try to unpack it.

If they meant "No person except a natural born citizen, or a citizen of 
the
United States at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, shall 
be",
why didn't they say that?  Basically, Brett is saying that it might be a
valid rewording to say:
When this Constiution is adopted, no person except a natural born 
citizen
or a citizen of the United States shall be eligible to the office of 
President [...]

In an otherwise admirably terse document, why add a comma in the middle 
of
a phrase, if not to clarify that two phrases are intended? :)

I'm not sure I understand your question. As far as I remember
there is no way to know if a particle is entangled or not. 
But if you perform experiments with entangled particles 
you must look at both detectors.

Anyway, Bell experiments with time-like separated impacts at 
the detectors (splitters) have been done demonstrating
the same correlations as for space-like separated ones.
(The first one was performed by Tapster, Rarity, Owens,
in Phys. Rev. Lett, 73, 1994, p. 1923.)

Thus there is a non-locality (better, non-separability)
in space, but also in time. And that is the important point.

The violation of Bell's inequalities seems to indicate that 
if the quantities involved are physical 'directions', a value 
of the system can be fixed by some physical rotation of 
a distant apparatus. But if the quantities involved are 'times',
we can (maybe) think that the value possessed by the system
depends on whether we perform a measurement on a distant
apparatus at time t1, or at time t2. (This is the so called 
'changing the remote past'! Which can be an extreme implementation 
of Wheeler's 'delayed choice principle'. Which, in turn, can be
the quantum form of Weyl's 'block universe', according
to Ashmead.)

Hence, not only quantum correlations cannot be explained
by local causes, or by local common causes (Reichenbach
causality), but one cannot suggest any 'causal' explanation
in which an earlier event influences a later one. And, as
somebody wrote, "quantum entanglement cannot be cast into
any relativistic scheme".

They did, but when they got to the "neither shall" part they listed some
additional qualifications; however as Arnold already did not meet the first
part the stuff after "neither shall" is irrelevant in his case.

I can see how this is ambiguous, given the comma after "United States".
(Notice the distinction between "natural born citizen" - of one of the
States presumably - and "citizen of the United States"). Has this ever been
tested? I'm thinking we could palm T. Blair off onto you.

Of course the "neither shall" is irrelevant.  So much so that I'm not

I don't wanna spoil your fun, you guys.
But beware of natural born Austrians!

We had a natural born Austrian, too, running for "President" seventy years
ago. Took him a while, receiving German citizenship, ruining the German
language in incredible speeches, but people seemed to like that stuff back 
then, so he got pretty successful: "Greatest Commander In Chief Of All 
Time" and a dozen of equally significant, world record breaking titles.

Hope, Arnie does a better job

Hasta la vista, movie theatre . . .

Yeah I saw that interpretation (the more probably one) after I posted
hence the follow up post A Possible correction etc. I won't repeat what
I say there here. Its still there :-)

But note what happens if you see the OR applying to more
or less of the whole sentence and the second comma as just
punctuation for a breathing space.

And if he needs a vice presidential running mate Australia's own

Seriously, the practical difficulty of getting the ambiguity resolved in
the Supreme Court is likely to mean that in practice no one is likely
to bother to test it. So imo, in practice, it way as well say that one
absolutely has to be born in the USA. (And not by caesarean
like MacBeth ;-)

Kevin, you are correct that the "traditional" habitable zone has been
somewhat restricted.  But this work is probably about 20 or more years
old now.

As more work has become known about carbon cycles, heat radiation
from planets, warming from external sources (like gravity for
Europa) the concept of a strict habitable zone has become less
"fixed".  Even the galactic habitable zone as well as the planetary
habitable zone may shift with time (Milan Cirkovic and I are
discussing preparing a paper on this).

The problem currently isn't really the habitable zone but the state
of the technology -- we cannot currently locate planets significantly
less than the mass of Saturn.  But there are some improvements in
technology and several space missions that may push us down to
Earth mass planets within the next decade or so.

The stakes are very high within the astronomy and physics communities
as well as at NASA and the European Space Agency.  The discovery of
an Earth mass planet, especially in a "traditional" habitable zone,
would be front page news on the New York Times (as well as hundreds
of other papers) -- so you can place money on the fact that there
are hundreds, if not thousands, of people working on making this
happen.

As the list of papers posted by Amara (thank you very much Amara)
points out -- people are working overtime to see just how far
one can extend the "habitable zone" concepts.

Also, people are not limiting searches to the "traditional" habitable
zone.  The searches currently detect planets based on mass (or in some cases
size).  They do not focus on location within a habitable zone.  Because of the
way the searches work they are biased towards detecting planets that
are very large and orbit very close to their stars.  So of the 100 or
so exoplanets detected thus far the sample set is somewhat atypical
relative to what is actually "out there".

Well, I have no idea really what the structures and driving forces of a
post-singularity civilization will be. And I probably wouldn't
understand them if they tried to explain them to me.

I am still open to the idea that the Great Silence is because they
choose not to be expansionist - at least, not expansionist into the
physical universe that we can see with our instruments.

But maybe we are the first! Somebody has to be, after all.


As an aside, Robin's excellent analysis assumes a space-capable
civilization whose main objective is expansion and colonisation. Like a
Star Trek type of civ. It doesn't help with the problem of WHY a
post-singularity civilization composed almost entirely of old, immortal
beings already in possession of virtually unlimited resources would want
to expand.

There a couple of ramifications to this. First you leave your
opponent with more degrees of freedom and more power
than if you take the initiative. So you take on more risk.
Second would you not agree that the circumstances
change when one has others under ones authority or
control like a leader, a military commander, or a president
who has to be able to think in terms of minimising loss
of life sometimes when the other is clearly intending on
taking life.

Where this works and it often would its laudable. Sometimes
though the abusive behavior cannot be avoided. Such is
the human condition. Some folks will go out of their way
to remove the option of avoiding them. The irony of
being free is that others are two and the person who
decides to compete or predate on one immediately
reduces ones degrees of freedom. The reactor has
less practical choices than the actor. The actor can
compete, cooperate or ignore. The reactor can be
forced to compete (or be defeated), cooperate or
not, but hardly ignore a person determined to compete.

Then if you've codified to 1-to-1 (ie. predecided what you
will do in all possible moral dilemnas) then can the future
not throw you a curly one at all that will require you to
make a new judgement?

For instance say that IVF technology was improved to
the point that a given embryo was more likely to go
through to a health birth than the more than 70% from
memory that naturally abort.

What would be your moral position if you were a
superior court judge and a state governement wanted
to pass a law that all reproduction should be via IVF
as that wasted less embryos than reproduction by the
natural method. Would your moral code cover that
- with the consequence that all sex for pleasure must
involve careful steps to avoid reckless and risky
procreation or would you have to think anew guided
by your moral code perhaps but not being able to do
a one to one look up to say point 356 of your specific
code?

Hmm. I'm around 6 foot, weight around 90 kilo and
am a former state karate champion. Yet there are some
males that are so much stronger than me that I would not
be able to separate them as you say. Yet as a third
party coming onto the scene with them grappling with
other I would in all likelihood be able to render on or
the other unconscious having the advantage of the
element of surprise (as indeed could my youngest
sister, who is much lighter and has no special training
in any martial arts, if she kept her wits about her).

Your scenario contains details for you that I didn't
see. Those details change the context. One must
act in real time within the context with the options
that one has. If the two protagonists were school
boys then separating them might be relatively easy
and involve only words. It depends.

Agreed. But "due" diligence depends on the
circumstances. Too much diligence, too much
forebearance is also a risk. The weighting of the
risks is a moral judgement that the individual
cannot get away from as no code can fully
anticipate all contingencies.

I certainly think so.

I think I see your point. A better code, one that endorses
reasoning rather than believing as a means to making
decisions, is a better guide to moral behavior, but we
can never have a code so good that the need for moral
judgments disappear altogether unless there are no
new challenges thrown at us, like the challenges that
technologies might throw up.

Most people in society are probably not operating on say level
5 of Kohlbergs levels or moral reasoning.  But the brighter
more abstract thinkers that are likely to rise to positions of
power are more likely to be better abstract thinkers and
reasoners. (They may also be better rationalizers on occassion
but a rationalization is a deceit one practices on oneself).
Your rationalisation won't convince me and vice versa.
You or I can have a moral discussion and seek to change
each others views using reason and a common language but
if either of us held that we were absolutely right to believe
what we believe then there would be little possibility of
communication and cooperation between us.

Yes. And if we consider that each of us is a person

Agreed. Interestingly though legal systems do seem to put a higher
or more formal emphasis on reasoning and the processes by which
conclusions are reached. Juries work to beyond "reasonable" doubt
standards not to mere "belief".

Its been argued that all academic disciplines are descendants of
philosophy. I am interested in philosophy not because it it esoteric
though it can be but because it can suggest solutions to problems.

My interest in morality and ethics for instance pretty much goes
back to a desire to build stronger societies and more effective
cooperatives because in this way I can do more, be more and
enjoy doing it better.

I should confess, I do think on my feet and in dialogs like
this which I greatly enjoy my arguments at the end are likely
to be sharper clearer and more nuanced becuase I've
integrated (I hope) the valid criticisms and viewpoints that
you bring up. Another positive to reasoning versers
believing. Both sides can win.

On the specific point I would say that my code would
say that self delusion is immoral. Thats what I'd endeavor
to teach children but I'd also point out that its nature
and in some circumstances moral judgements that take
in the fuller context and detail than any moral code
(that is codified) are going to be refinements.

Perhaps we have different concepts of what
constitutes an hallucination. I don't think
fantasy = hallucination. I think hallucination is likely to
have a medical/physiological cause and not be
volitional.

I see. You are interchanging fantasy and self-delusion. I
tend to think of fantasy as suspension of disbelief. One
knows one is doing it and one is doing it for fun.

Self-delusion on the other hand - one probably suspects
one is doing it at some level unless ones rational aspects
are completely shut down - but delusons I think of as
things we don't have for fun, but for other perhaps
more serious pyschological basis.

A person who is reasoning at level 1 on Kohlburgs scale (the
simplest) may not do something that is good for society in general
but for far more basic reasons, than a person who is reasoning
at level 5.

But the higher up in the levels one goes the more levels or
abstraction and nuance are likely to influence your code.
I would think that a person would have a hard time having
a complex moral code without having the ability to use language
for instance.

Our leaders must make judgements that will have impacts
on lives other than their own. The more of us that are reasoners
and critical thinkers and the fewer of us that are mere believers
the better (the healthier) we will be as a society in my opinion.

Fair catch that does look like a slippery phrase doesn't it?

No. I am an open minded sceptic when it comes to
conventional hypnosis. I have never experienced it
and those that I have seen ostensibly hypnotised on
stage seemed to me to be substantially "hamming"
or playing it up for the attention. I think some of
us sometimes like not having to be analytical all
the time and to have others tell us what to do
and just follow alone can be pleasant.

I don't know if I can get into a trance as you put it. I guess I
can its just not something I am very familiar with.

I suppose when it comes to my mind I am a bit of a control
freak, I don't like it when the captain is not on the bridge.

Is there a functional form of insanity? As I understand it insanity
is usually diagnosed on the basis of behavior. If is inferred rather
than experimentally verified. Insanity is apparently easy to fake.
Sanity on the other hand - now theres a challlenge :-)

I must be failing to follow what you mean by maximizing your
utility table of something because it still seems to me that
happiness cannot really be a target that one aims at it is
a consequence that arise as a desired and hoped for side
effect of something else one aims at.

There is a saying "man is the only animal that laughs
and weeps, because he is the only animal that sees
what is, and what might have been".

Hey I grew up in a catholic family - I've seen the old
kid of two :-)

I reckon they are very active little hypothesis testers
and experimenters. Just because we may look in from
the outside an think they are "playing" doesn't change
that they are playing at something. If they are happy
playing they probably declared they were going out
to play (something specific) rather than going out to
be happy.

No I'd aim to get the rich to care more effectively for the rich
by recognizing their relationship with the poor. My emphasis
is not be charitable to the poor my emphasis is on how would
you life be better if the poor were not so poor? If they had
more to loose. If they were able to cooperate with you to make
both you and them wealthier in absolute terms rather than
relative terms.

Would you rather be healthy and active at 130 or have a

I have no magic. If my moral code is adopted by others it will because
they see merit in it. If they see merit in it and I see merit in it I'm
prepared
to work on the assumption that their is merit in it. - That a bit simplistic
but this thread is very long.

Makes sense. But leveraging your efforts with others can be a

I think your right it comes to us naturally. But what also
comes naturally to us homo-saps is reasoning. We can
see that win wins are possible, that it is possible through
cooperation to do what we cannot do alone. We can
choose to measure ourselves against what is possible
rather than against each other.

The few will be aware of the condition of the many, and some
of the few will be uneasy in their relationships with others of
the few if those others are too harsh or cruel in the treatment
of the many. We know well enough how easy it is to go from
in-group to out-group.

Granted. But there is value in knowing why and how. The value
is in the power to identify route causes that can be changed.

And therein lies the danger of the future. Rugged immortal individualists

Because they won't stay satisfied. How can you keep up

immortalised themselves?

Bail at any time or edit with more extreme prejudice. The offer was
there in the last post.

Quite seriously, long rambly dialogs are probably
better offlist. I think it was worth having the discussion
but maybe not on list.

Any illuson I had that others might read much of this
have long past. But the upside is that the dialectic
process does help sort out thoughts. In this thread
somewhere are a few gems. They may be distilled
at a later date maybe.

Offshore 'em, if necessary.  But I seem to recall
seeing political info markets within the US - for
example, bets on the CA governors' race.  (The only
example I can immediately find, though, seems to be
hosted out of Ireland.)

Arguable.  If the market exists, the US gov't would
likely become a customer whether or not it hosts the
market.  Though I'll grant that it'd be a bigger
participant in a market it itself hosted.

Ok, now here we have an example of what life will be like
when we push longevity to 1000+ years and we have nanotechnology
to make living life "easy" and people have a lot of time on
their hands to think up really stunning/stupid things to do.

Raphala Le Gouvello is apparently planning to windsurf
across the Pacific ocean.

See:
http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/08/030807075709.htm
and the reference piece:
http://www.esa.int/export/esaCP/SEM1DKXO4HD_index_0.html

One of the more interesting aspects of this is that it
seems to be being promoted by the ESA's technology transfer
program.  Ok, lets see -- we can kill you by putting you on
a new rocket (the Ariane 5) that has a minor programming error
that will cause launches to fail, or we can kill you when
pieces of said rocket fall out of the sky on top of you, or
we can kill you by devising methods that allow you to engage
in extreme sports while entertaining the illusion that they
are safe.  Please select one of the 3 options and be sure to
read and initial the paragraphs where we clearly state "you
are assuming all risks associated with these activities".

Considering: 8000 km, open ocean, 80 days -- are you *nuts*?!?
(I think someone was lost trying to windsurf the between

Mike Lorrey explained the discontinuation of the policy analysis market
(PAM) with a  parody:
"Because betting or futures markets are crass commercialism, propounded
by evil running dog capitalists..... liberals don't understand how
futures markets work. They just puts their money into their 401k and
depend on the smart people to make them money..."
Following up on the logic of this parody,  what does it means to be from
"the left"?
It is a matter of perception.
Not being from "the left" = when looking at "the big picture", first
percieving the self,  then the street, the city,  the country then the other
countries further and furthe away...
>From the point of view of the rich/privilegied this adds-up into to thinking
:"what to do to make this situation last forever?".
Being from "the left" is the opposite of this, seeing the edges first:  the
world, the continent, the country, the city, the street, the self.
It is to percieve the horizon and knowing the absolute injustices won't be
able to last very longer... ex : people dying of hunger etc it will last for
how long? another 100 years tops? These are the problems to solve. For
someone from the left, problems of the third world are closer than problems
of vis neighbourhod.

To prove wrong someone who wold say "The idea of a federal betting parlor on
atrocities and terrorism is ridiculous and it's grotesque" and prevent PAM
to be percieved by the majority as " morally wrong", "offensive to almost
everyone" and a  "sick game",   I think a solution could be to add a new
module to the idea, a form of electronic jurisprudence where people would
have the opportunity to be pro-active at the horrors and injustices of this
world instead of just being percieved as "passive observers who are
cynically cashing-in" .  I would like to hear constructive inputs on how
this  "e-jurisprudence" could be implemented legally and technically into
"idea futures" so "the evil running dog capitalists" will be able to have
what they want out of it while giving the opportunity to make new
laws/challenge existing inefficacious laws (speeding-up the evolution of the
judiciary system might I hazard) on different issues (not just on
terrorism).

Deleuze said (I translated as close as I could) : "It is jurisprudence that
really is creating rights: it should not be left to judges. We are already
thinking about establishing modern biology rights: but everything, in modern
biology and the new situations that it is creating, the new elements it
makes possible, is jurisprudence business. It is not a committee of
wisemens, moral and pseudo-competent, that we need, but users groups."
To Deleuze, a government cannot be from the left, there can only be
government that are either more or less favorable to the issues of the left
so he says that stopping injustices with jurisprudence is a very good
example of what being from "the left" really is.

The concept of "laws" and "human rights" are empty and complacent, what is
important is what's going on in the real world: the concrete problems of
life. All of the problems out there in the world are problems of
"territory", one just have to identify the territory concerned in the
problematic and arrange the law to stop the injustice so everyone will get
an appropriate territory to be happy.
Jurisprudence is the ensemble of decisions made by courts of law about these
concrete situations of life, including cases where the law is
re-routed, when we are not in accord with it. Globally there are laws, we
are submiting to it in our structures and behind it there is jurisprudence,
wich feeds the law and makes it evolve. When jurisprudence gets too big, the
law becomes obsolete and we are obliged to modify it. This is what is
interesting in the democratic system: I acknowledge that there is a law but
nothing impeach us to modify it.
By pointing out where confidence is lacking on various aspects of various
troublesome parts of the world, betting markets such as the Policy Analysis
Market could help to increase the production of judgements of courts of law
from these places. If something bad is likely to happen evidently some
people will suffer from it and it is up to them to sue to prevent it to
happen, to request a solution for their problem of territory using
jurisprudence either to apply solutions coming from similar cases or make a
new one if needed.
 Access to internet still being patchy, this e-jurisprudence would be easyer
to implement in occidental countries at first but while waiting for more's
law to solve this problem, it's not that hard to imagine a non profit org
who would be created to distribute internet access to hotspots around the
world to give a voice to the people concerned by the bad stuff that is going
down, so as many people as possible could use these " virtual tribunals"
with their local laws to make things change. (In any case it is not like we
are short of problems right here at home, that could be solved with this
idea...) Problems should be solved regionally; interventions of an
international  police would not cut it IMO.
It would be interesting to see the e-jurisprudence formulated by people who
have a better understanding of the law than me / who are more inspired when
it comes at making-up scenarii despicting how it would be used in real life.

If PAM is not truly dead yet, each one of us should write them ideas to
improve on it so we'll see it happen. Anyone knows who should be contacted
about this?

That's a provocative reading of `natural born', but one that might be made
to cut even more cruelly in the case of tomorrow's citizens gestated
entirely in vitro, nor to mention children carried in-synthetic-utero by
men (as in, by a stroke of luck, Arnie's own movie about the pregnant Dad).
If read as `natural[ly] conceived', all those present-day in vitro kids
would have their day spoiled big time, and clones can fergeddaboudit.

Just talking about the general public and news pundits and their
willingness to assume that they could divine all there is to know

two....

Randall has already taken you to task for regarding "they" as
an entity or homogeneous.  A chief fact of evolution is *some*
diversity.  (And of course, I speak of evolution in the *most*
general terms.)

> But maybe we are the first! Somebody has to be, after all.

I hope we follow up on an intriguing discussion between Rafal
and others in which the former mentioned that at any time T
in an inflationary multiverse (i.e. lots of inflationary bubbles)
it could well be that almost all bubbles are young (just as in
some countries with booming rates most people are young).  If
so, it may affect thinking here as to how probable it is that
we are first here.

(I will abstain from what I consider to be mostly arm-waving and
unproductive overly-anthropic type arguments, but won't mind at
least reading a few.)

Lee

P.S. I am even highly skeptical that such a time "T" can have
universal significance outside a particular universe.  Seems
it might be meaningless.  Or does that just prove that I was
born in the bad, positivist part of the 20th century?

Open Access to Scientific Research

August 7, 2003


A number of influential scientists have begun to argue that
the cost of research publications has grown so large that
it impedes the distribution of knowledge. Some
subscriptions cost thousands of dollars per year, and those
journals are usually available online only to subscribers.
This looks less like dissemination than restriction,
especially if it is measured against the potential access
offered by the Internet. That is why a coalition led by Dr.
Harold Varmus, the former director of the National
Institutes of Health, is creating a new model, called the
Public Library of Science.

Several years ago Dr. Varmus's group issued an open letter,
signed by some 30,000 colleagues, calling on the publishers
of scientific journals to make their archived research
articles freely available online. Most journals declined,
so they would not undercut the profitable business of
selling expensive subscriptions to libraries. But there is
a basic inequity when much of the research has been
financed by public money.

The Public Library of Science plans to confront that
inequity by establishing a new series of peer-reviewed
journals that will be freely available on the Internet. The
first ones, published this October, will be PLoS Biology
and PLoS Medicine. The aim is to create a freer flow of
data about research and results. The journals will pay for
themselves by charging a small fee to the organizations and
institutions that support the research.

Most of us, admittedly, will not have much use for free
access to new discoveries in, say, particle physics. But it
is a different matter when it comes to medical research.
Popular nostrums abound on the Web, but it can be very
hard, if not impossible, to find the results of properly
vetted, taxpayer-financed science - and in some cases it
can be hard for your doctor to find them, too. The Public
Library of Science could help change all that, creating
open access to research. The publishers of scientific
journals are naturally skeptical, but the real test will
come in the marketplace of ideas. What will matter this
fall, when the new journals make their debut, is how many
scientists choose to publish in them rather than in the
journals traditionally deemed the most prestigious in their
disciplines.

There's another interesting contender for the governor's race: Gallagher.
Joke? Don't know, but I do  prefer Gallagher's politics over Arnie's.

P.S. I recommend his videos. He would be very sympathetic to the
transhuman crowd, me thinks.

Measuring the Interplanetary Medium with a Solar Sail

Authors: Michael Martin Nieto, Slava G. Turyshev
Comments: 11 pages
Report-no: LA-UR-03-5541

      A solar sail mission to deep space could determine the density of
      the interplanetary medium by measuring the drag force on the huge
      sail with radiometric navigational data. Thus, a mission similar
      to the Interstellar Probe might consider retaining its sail beyond
      the orbit of Jupiter to measure the matter density in deep space.
      Such an experiment would a yield an independent, new type of
      measurement of the interplanetary medium and should be pursued.

Very weird; no posts for some hours from here or several other places in
the Homeland. What's afoot? Google news suggests that there might be some
major cracker attack.

I've watched him on TV and didn't laugh :-(   He likes to throw buckets of 
water on his audience and they seem to enjoy it.

Arnie's sense of longevity would prompt me to think that he would be 
supportive of superlongevity and research to advance the science/medicine 
of improving and extending life.  I don't know his view on stem cell 
cloning though and this would be the key indicator for me in voting.

Well, I can hear you. Maybe it is just that it is thursday
night/morning there (here in Sweden thursday evening was once
called "piglördag", "maid's saturday", since servants were given
the day off and they celebrated; maybe there are many maids in the
US :-)


An interesting thing to consider: if a large section of the world 
suffers a disaster (say a meteor strike or high altitude EMP), what 
are the best strategies to deal with it for the rest of the world? 
Outside the usual aid, making sure the disaster does not spread and 
so on, it seems that we are ill prepared to deal with large 
simultaneous fluctuations in the global webs. What incentives can 
we set up to make these webs more resilient?

I can enthusiastically confirm this. I've just got back from a seminar in
Bulgaria, which showed distinct signs of change from just a year ago. It is
noticeable how the Balkans and East/Central Europe more generally is more
dynamic and with more possibilites in many ways than Western Europe and
Scandanavia. There's a real feeling of tiredness to a lot of the politics
and thinking here, but I think this may well change with EU enlargement,
which I increasingly think is one of those events that's going to have far
reaching unforseen consequences for the rest of Europe. SD

The Dallas Morning News, 7 August 2003
By Guest Columnist Diane Barnet, Arlington, Texas

[COMMENT:  Frankly, it is outrageous that the same President who does 
not want "socialized medicine" in America is planning to use American 
taxpayer dollars to pay for health care for all Iraqis.  America is 
the only major nation in the world that does not provide some form of 
national health care for its citizens.  Even lowly Cuba and North 
Korea provide national health care!  Vote For Howard Dean For 
President!  RS]

Part of President Bush's plan for rebuilding Iraq is the provision of 
health care for the Iraqi population.  Meanwhile, Americans lacking 
access to health care now number more than 40 million.

The average American is just a layoff or divorce away from losing 
health benefits.  Many workers remain in jobs they loathe in order to 
provide their families with medical coverage.  The uninsured crowd 
emergency rooms.  Even for the insured, co-payments, premiums and 
deductibles continue to rise meteorically and unpredictably.  And 
don't even try to buy individual health insurance if you have a 
pre-existing condition.

Yet our congressmen enjoy a lifelong govenment-run health care plan 
similar to the Canadian system.  But mention Canada's health care, 
and shrieks of "socialized medicine" and "rationed care" reverberate.

Canadian-style health care has much to recommend it.  I should know 
-- I grew up in Canada and have worked as a registered nurse in both 
countries.  The beauty of the Canadian system is that no one has to 
buy private insurance -- all are covered, cradle to grave.

In each of Canada's 10 provinces, the health department periodically 
hammers out a global budget with the hospitals.  Wasteful duplication 
of services is eliminated through the establishment of centers of 
excellence that specialize in treating certain diseases, such as bone 
cancer.

Doctors are reimbursed by the government on a fee-for-service basis. 
That means not only that they are paid promptly, with a minimum of 
paperwork, but also that no third-party insurance companies insert 
themselves between doctor and patient.  All Canadians over 65 get 
prescriptions free.

Since all 28 million Canadians have access to preventive care and are 
spared the stress of worrying about how to pay for medical treatment, 
they are -- you guessed it -- healthier than their U.S. counterparts. 
Rationed care?  No more than our HMOs and lack of coverage limit 
care, and Canadians can choose their own doctors.

Americans aren't well served by the present "system" of health care 
delivery.  Hardly a system, it is a crazy quilt of competing 
entities, including insurers, hospitals and other "providers".  And 
the operative word is "competing", since earning profits for 
shareholders is the bottom line.  Health care has become just another 
commodity that is bought and sold.  It has become a privilege for 
those who can afford it, not a basic human right.

Maybe Americans would be better off seeking medical care in Iraq if a 
comprehensive system is to be established there.  But I suggest 
taking a look at Canada first, especially when it is time to vote.

As I told some of the participants, it is far easier to change 
things when there is no huge superstructure already in place and 
generally believed to the Best In The World (TM). When things are a 
mess and nobody trusts the politicians, then people have an 
incentive to form institutions and use technology in the most 
efficient way possible. Once things are ordered, regulated and 
reasonably good, the incentive vanishes.

Hopefully, yes.

I took the family out to the California Science Museum last Saturday and
Gallagher walked up to me and asked me to sign his petition.  I was
dissapointed that even though it was a one-on-one conversation, he had
nothing serious or intelligent to say. It's just a joke ( and I did NOT sign
his petition, but the rest of the family got some photos and an autograph.)

Arnold can not become president of the US without a constitutional
change.  What's confusing you is the comma between "citizen of the
United States" and "at the time of the adoption of this Constitution".
That comma is an anachronism.  If the phrase were rewritten today it
wouldn't be there.

What this clause is legally interpreted as meaning is that the only
people who can become president are:

1) Those born in the US.

2) Those who were citizens of the US when the Constitution was
adopted.

As a US citizen not born here, I'm quite aware of this restriction. :)

Subject: Thinking the unthinkable: taboos and transhumanism

I feel I have to recommend the paper "Thinking the unthinkable:
sacred values and taboo cognitions" (Tetlock, Trends in cognitive
sciences, vol 7, no 7 2003, p 320--325) that was mentioned earlier
for the entire list. It is one of those eye openers that makes you 
see the overall pattern in stuff you earlier was vaguely aware of.

The basic idea is the cognitive science of sacred values. Something
is sacred when it is absolute and involable, and the mere thought of
trading it off for some secular value is abhorrent. Different
societies have different sacredness, but all societies have it. In
practice we always have to do trade-offs between values. As an
example, how much do we want to pay for road safety? If human lives
were infinitely valuable to us, we would gladly pay all money we
could for safer roads. But we actually chose (or have someone chose
for us) a finite amount. But actually being tempted or forced to
make these compromises makes us uncomfortable, and various escape
and coping mechanisms (such as 'moral cleansing' where people do
something they consider moral to balance the trade - we feel
contaminated by trading in the sacred). These taboo tradeoffs cause
strong moral outrage, especially among observers. It is seen as
unacceptable to trade something sacred for secular, or even to
consider it. 

Empirical research show that there was considerable agreement on
sacred values between conservative republicans and liberal
democrats. But Tetlock observes that libertarians accept extending
market-pricing into areas other consider taboo, and socialists want
to extend the taboo of market pricing to medical care, legal counsel
and housing. This has great importance for us transhumanists (and
libertarians). We have accepted the non-taboo nature of many things
like genetic modification of humans. But when we discuss the reasons
to do (or not do) them, we frame it in terms of secular
cost/benefit, breaking the taboo for many outsiders. This is a
strong reason why much normal discussion on this list is seen as
abhorrent by many: we share a different set of the sacred, and this
causes a deep rift of understanding. This is important to hold in 
mind. 

It turns out that it is more OK to make a sacred-sacred trade
("tragic trade-offs"): it is the stuff of greek dramas and ethical
dilemmas. Freedom versus loyalty. Family versus duty. And so on. 
Moral judgements about a hospital administrator having to chose 
between the life of a patient and saving one million dollars showed 
that people lauded the administrator who chose to save the life 
(sacred value) over the money (secular), and much more strongly if 
the decision was described as fast. The administrator who took time 
to weigh the issue was seen as less praiseworthy even when he 
decided to save the life (the administrator who chose money quickly 
was of course the worst of the lot). But if it was a tragic 
trade-off (saving a life versus curing AIDS, say), then the 
administrator who lingered before making the decision was seen as 
more praiseworthy than the one who just did one thing. Compare this 
to the usual call for more careful thinking that nearly always ends 
a statement of bioethics. 

It turns out that framing a trade-off as a tragic trade-off rather 
than a taboo trade decreases moral outrage. If the PAM affair had 
not been framed as the taboo tradeoff between money and human lives 
but instead as a tragic trade-off between the need for knowledge and 
having to use money in "dirty" ways (or even better, as a secular 
trade-off between money and knowledge), the outrage would have been 
smaller. Similarly we transhumanists should try to frame our visions 
in terms of what is sacred when we are proposing taboo-breaking 
("Yes, modifying the genome changes the "order of nature". But to do 
otherwise would block human freedom and well being!") or seek to 
show the different sacred landscape we are experiencing (although 
this is much harder). 

All in all, a very good article.

Great post! I cannot imagine a more extropian goal than the citizens of a 
particular country providing universal healthcare for themselves by 
leveraging their collective tax payments, their ability to control and 
regulate commerce within the borders of the country, and their collective 
market size in a way that maximizes their own good, and not that of profit. 

The Iraqi situation is a really good illustration, too.

Provigil has a nasty side effect. Once you've scrip for 
it, the extra hours it provides only give you time to wade 
through all the spam flooding your mailbox.

### Do you think that "good" is something else than "profit"? Experience
seems to indicate that regulation and taxation of free markets decreases
both profits, and social good, however you measure it. The Canadian system
is a pitiful example of bureaucracy running amok, with deplorable
consequences for the citizens (both financially and in terms of health
care).

Funny, a friend of mine is trying to see just how long he can stay
awake on it right now.  (For work reasons in his small business.)

Sadly there's still sleep rebound from modafinil.  It's smaller than
the sleep rebound if you stay awake on caffeine or just through sheer
willpower, but it's there.

I have come across a fascinating website which was new to me and had numerous excellent writings.   

My mother met one of the key founders, Peter Schwartz, while she attended Columbia University. This was back when dinosaurs walked the earth! lol   

The following article explains why the U.S. will truly suffer if it neglects stem cell research.  And it reveals some of the myths we have used to rationalize turning away from this key biotechnology.  

http://www.gbn.com/ArticleDisplayServlet.srv?aid=4500

John

Taken from the Global Business Network website:

Global Business Network was created in 1987 around a pool table in a Berkeley, California basement by five friends. These GBN cofounders envisioned a worldwide learning community of organizations and individualsa network, connected by the open and generous exchange of ideas, "out-of-the-box" scenario thinking, ruthless curiosity, and exciting new information technologies. 

During the late 1980s, when GBN was founded, signs of significant changeeven discontinuitywere emerging in the business environment, driven by a convergence of technological, social, political, economic, and environmental forces. GBN's cofounders were convinced that the business communitynot governmentwas most likely to translate emerging opportunities into sustainable growth and a better future. The challenge: encouraging companies to questionand changetheir mental maps, to embrace uncertainty, and to stop predicting the future based on the past. 

The Founders 

Peter Schwartz, futurist and business strategist; author of The Art of the Long View, When Good Companies Do Bad Things, and The Long Boom; former head of scenario planning at Royal Dutch/Shell in London, and director of the Strategic Environment Center at SRI International 

Jay Ogilvy, author of Living Without a Goal and China's Futures, professor of philosophy at Yale and Williams, and past head of SRI's Values and Lifestyles research 

Napier Collyns, networker extraordinaire, a 30-year veteran of Royal Dutch/Shell, responsible for planning, public affairs and human resources 

Stewart Brand, writer, futurist, and inventor of ideas; author of The Clock of the Long Now, How Buildings Learn, The Media Lab, and originator of The Long Now Foundation, the Whole Earth Catalog, CoEvolution Quarterly, and The WELL computer network 

Lawrence Wilkinson, multi-media innovator; current vice-chair of Oxygen Media and former president of Colossal Pictures 

Also instrumental in GBN's creation were several key colleagues in Europe: Kees van der Heijden and Arie de Geus, both former heads of Group Planning at Shell, and Bo Ekman, a consultant and former Volvo executive.

(end)

I find it fascinating the eventual sleep rebound (sleep debt) is reduced by taking modafinil.  I would have thought in the end the piper would still have to be paid "in full."  

Totally eliminating sleep debt would be an extremely difficult thing to do.  And even if it could be done, most likely it would speed up the aging process by increasing wear and tear on the body.  This would be due to cutting out some of the downtime needed to "make repairs."  And also there would be cognitive problems, considering sleep is important to forming longlasting memories.

best wishes,

John (who wants to join the ranks of the "Supersleepless")

Interesting post from a current slashdot discussion:




The Never-Ending Fractal Universe (Steady-State Reborn) 

This model was the result of closer examination of the scalar field models 
used to drive inflation in the early universe. In the inflationary model - 
which itself was proposed to solve the problem of the universe's matter 
distribution being so smooth - a "scalar field" existed in the early universe 
that permeated space and caused vast amounts of new space to be created. In 
the original version of the inflationary model, this scalar field's effects 
died out shortly after the big bang. A later model, however, proposed that 
the field was not cancelled everywhere - in some regions of the universe, 
constructive interference would cause it to be strong enough for inflation to 
continue.

Thus, we have a model where the universe looks mostly like our own, except 
for regions where it "buds" to form new universes. This process continues 
forever. This is the second scenario currently considered plausible (with the 
scalar field taking on the role of "dark energy").


...............

I have run across this theory before, but not too often. I like it a lot!

### The best interest of a human is for me defined by his/her well-informed,
voluntary actions (definition of "voluntary" is a separate and interesting
subject) - whatever happens as a result of such actions, where the person is
aware of both the direct consequences, and the events prevented by the
action, is in the best interest of a human.

Insofar as humans are informed, and free, they do act in their best
interest, by definition.

Groups of people do not have best interests, or rather, I do not recognize
any interests of groups, aside from the sum of individual interests of their
members.

### I was struck by the similarity of a functioning science funding system
to the information markets described in the article.

Seemingly, whatever humans successfully organize, such as capitalist
economy, or modern science, as opposed to mindless coalition warfare, boils
down to some form of market-like behavior, with large numbers of independent
decision makers sharing engaged in cooperatively competitive exchange of
information.

Well, it wouldn't if the meaning were as commonly taught, but then,
why is it there at all?  What need was there to interrupt the
phrase "a citizen of the United States at the time of the adoption
of this Constitution" with a comma?  I wouldn't expect this to be
similar to the case of the meaning of "regulated" having changed
over the years, since I'm not aware of any other purpose for commas
than to clarify the separation of concepts in a case like this. :)

Anders writes a nice piece in reference to an article
that I haven't read, but which is attempting to get
the "rational" meme (which can tolerate "trade-offs")
out to the public.

This is correct, in my opinion.  In some ways it's
close to "adult thinking" vs. "child thinking".
A symptom of child-thinking is that it does not want
to entertain unpleasant trade-offs.  That's left to 
the adults.  Now that---as Anders explained---is not
the whole story.

But it's possible that we need to see deeper into the
problem in the following way. This also dovetails with
our recent discussions.

In my opinion, one aspect that we need to look at is
our *own* urge to break icons.  I wrote an essay not
long ago called "What Happened to all the Iconoclasts?",
but did not post it.

    Back in the 1950's the world seemed to be swimming
    with iconoclasts.  Probably few knew what the word
    meant (I did not), but one could tell that whatever
    they were, there were plenty of them.

    The word, though not the urge, has gone out of fashion.
    This list has lots of them, of course.  I want to 
    speak about all of us who perhaps as good Bayesians
    should want to correct for this urge that we have
    to break icons.

    Does anyone really believe that Robin Hanson does not,
    in some tiny recess of his mind, enjoy tweaking 
    conventional tastes by proposing something that is
    quite logical, but simultaneously outrageous to usual
    tastes?  Does anyone here think that those of us very
    in love with the idea of cloning aren't also---just a
    wee bit---enjoying the avant garde feeling of endorsing
    an aspect of the provocative future?

    This urge is certainly at least as old as the chariots.
    In complete defiance of all the wizened, hardened older
    experienced warriors, someone had to think that by
    teaming up a pair of horses to a cart holding two riders
    ---one who drove and one who shot arrows from a semi-
    stable platform as fast as he could---a fiendish new
    weapon of war could be produced?

    (Do I not at this very moment enjoy---just a wee bit---
    presenting an example aggravating to the instincts of
    any crypto-pacifists on this list?)

    Yes, we *should* exult in the novel, along with all true
    SF writers, part of whose theme in the trade is to
    shock.  We should indeed be held only in check---in
    this medium---by logic and reason, and otherwise
    truly enjoy wherever our imaginations take us.

    But, as I asked earlier, do we not need to correct 
    for this impulse, and at least try to compensate for
    our sheer enjoyment of the novelty of singularities,
    uploading, terrorist futures, cryonics, and so on?

    (P.S. to try to answer my own question, Yes, if we
    wish to be only Bayesian truth seekers, but no, if
    we wish to remain human and favor the side all our
    instincts and reason assure us is right.)

It is in no wise true that Bayesians may not *enjoy* tweaking conventional 
tastes; rather, Bayesians may tweak conventional tastes (and enjoy it) 
only when the ordinary evidence is against the conventional tastes.

Or as I once told one of my little brother's friends:  "There's no *need* 
to break rules for the sake of breaking them.  If you break rules only 
when they're really awful and you have an overwhelmingly better way, you 
will have more than enough trouble to last you the rest of your life."

Stupidity is human; rationality, humane.

A special double issue on the paranormal of the Journal of Consciousness
Studies, titled:  'PSI WARS', is out, and looks interesting.

http://www.imprint.co.uk/jcs_10_6-7.html

It contains an intriguing study of purported psychokinesis data by a friend
of mine, Dr Fotini Pallikari, a solid state physics prof at Athens
University. She's done earlier work in this contested field with Physics
Nobelist Brian Josephson.

Mitch,
       I agree with what you said excepting that in my humble opinion you 
didn't go far enough -- not by half.  However believing that does not take away 
an Iota from Dr. Von Hayek and the truth of what he was saying.
       If you read Technaissance by Mike McGee it seems plain that the first 
Renaissance was powered by the printing press, etc., empowering the more 
intelligent members of the society.  However there was only a fraction of that 
group that was empowered (many just kept digging those ditches) Still Gutenberg, 
etc., empowered enough to kick off a Renaissance.
       If THE BELL CURVE and Mike McGee's book is to be believed since about 
1900 AD the increasing empowerment of the GT has been kicking off a new 
Renaissance.
       For so many of the highly intelligent to be put out of work and sent 
to pump gas or flip burgers in my opinion will either kick off a heck of a 
civil explosion or possibly those guys on their own will power another spurt of 
industrial growth in this country -- maybe.
       I don't think the guys moving industry overseas realize that when the 
jobs go overseas the market will eventually have to go with the jobs.  The 
economic signs I see seem to indicate that the American consumer has done exactly 
that -- consumed their assets.  To use a farmer's expression, I don't know 
how much seed money the consumer has left.
       So, Mitch, I don't disagree with you.  I think you have been a little 
conservative in your predictions.

You'd have my vote (if I was a US citizen) and were able to
run against the other candidates recently canvassed on this list
Mex. But that not's really as much of a compliment as it might 
be ;-)

Corp America off-shores jobs to people who will never be able to purchase
goods and services of American companies.

### Of course, if you prevent them from making money by working for American
companies, they won't.

------------------------------
Furthermore, unemployed Americans,
deprived of employment will also, no longer be able to purchase goods and
services
of said companies.

### Of course, those Americans who refuse to work, under the pretext of
being "unemployed", will not be able to purchase more than they manage to
squeeze from taxpayers in "benefits".

---------------------------------
The corporations believe that the Chinese or whomever will purchase the
goods
and services of American owned companies subsidiaries, overseas; however
this
does not seem to be happening. Thus, destablizing the American economy, as
off-shoring is accomplishing, leaves us with no genuine economic recovery.
My
guess is that this is igniting a class war, fiercer then any this nation has
yet
seen.

### The sooner the better. Useless drones should die.

Rafal

You could start with the sick and the old, kill the lot, it's cheaper and
neater and they deserve it. Retards should clearly go. Anyone in jail
should die, what have they done except leeched on the useful. Drones who
used to work before their jobs were exported should die, as Rafal remarks.
Most university staff are a dead loss with their fancy self-serving
bullshit and star-gazing. I have a little list, they never will be missed.

### The drones who used to work, now can't find the same or better position,
but still feel entitled to their previous wages, now going to the poor but
hardworking people of Calcutta, should indeed face the difficult decision -
adapt, demand less, offer more, or make room for those who will.

PS. In case it is not clear, I used a bit of hyperbole to drive home the
point that protectionism, aside from being harmful for the US economy, is in
the end a form of crude, selfish and inconsiderate short-term greed,
depriving others of chances for significantly improving their lives, and
impoverishing all.

Yes, this is being driven by bloated fortune 500 chieftans and emphatically, 
not entrepenuers creating start up businesses. As Americans become unemployed 
or take burger flipper jobs, the tax base shrinks. Money for things like 
defense will also shrink, money for investment in new technology will indeed 
shrivel. This scenario may not happen if the political forces of the American middle 
class react to deprive the corporate goons, under whose guidence has led to

<<### The sooner the better. Useless drones should die.

Rafal>>

Consider that an America reduced to a third-world status, by moving nearly 
all industry and service off-shore, (despite rabid, empty promises of the 
creation of replacement jobs) is not something that most Americans, I believe, will 
tolerate. Darwinian natural selection is a choice with humans, not a destiny.

careers have been specialized in "management" or marketing, or even nowadays, Human 
Resources. The vast majority, can never claim to have started business from 
the ground up; because they are always joiners of already thriving companies. 
Enjoy the class war (low-class?) comrades, because you will be drafted to one

I know that most people of this list roll their eyes in
disagreement whenever the Nazi/Hitler sledgehammer runs down on a poster who
says nasty things.

Sorry, but I have to state it again: fascism and inhumanity start with
exactly this kind of thinking, no matter how nice this person may be in
dealings with his peers.

### This is the old communist attitude - envious hatred for businessmen,
usually coupled to the populist dream - high wages, little work, low prices
and well-stocked stores. But, the world is a bit more complex than images of
evil bosses scheming to take the worker's pay would suggest.

The protectionist demands cheap imported goods, the right to export abroad,
initiation of force to suppress competition, and total indifference to the
suffering of others. All moral and intellectual failings are attributed to
the "others" - the colored foreigners, and the rich CEO.

Yes, protectionists, racists, xenophobes - they are all alike. Once they
gain power, it will be a bumpy ride, all the way to Hell.

Not really; it was published in a fairly broad journal,
but hardly Scientific American. He is undermining the
taboo of researching taboos and making it more clear that
even the sacred can be studied, so in the long run I
think this research will produce more rationality as it
seeps out thanks to popularizers (anyone want to do
that?). Bur right now it is mainly academic studies. 

It is interesting to note another article in TICS I noted
recently: Pascal Boyer, Religious thought and behaviour
as by-products of brain function, Trends in Cognitive
Sciences Volume 7, Issue 3 , March 2003, Pages 119-124

	Religious concepts activate various functionally
	distinct mental systems, present also in
	non-religious contexts, and `tweak' the usual
	inferences of these systems. They deal with
	detection and representation of animacy and
	agency, social exchange, moral intuitions,
	precaution against natural hazards and
	understanding of misfortune. Each of these
	activates distinct neural resources or families
	of networks. What makes notions of supernatural
	agency intuitively plausible? This article
	reviews evidence suggesting that it is the joint,
	coordinated activation of these diverse systems,
	a supposition that opens up the prospect of a
	cognitive neuroscience of religious beliefs. 

A cognitive neuroscience of religion would be as 
dangerous for ill-considered religion as the fields of 
comparative religion and literary analysis of the Bible

Yes, why is iconoclasm so fun? To some extent it is 
because it is easy attention from others - if you can 
take some criticism, then you can mine it for all its 
worth. Then there is the thrill of questioning the 
unquestionable - but why do we get it? Tetlock's theory 
only explain why people refrain from doing it, not why 
some people delight in it.

I don't know about Robin, but this is definitely true for 
me.

We might be enjoying it even more because thinking the 
unthinkable brings us to the new. And we orient ourselves 
towards new sources of information - we are curious, we 
place value in learning new things or possibilities even 
when they do not have a direct use. 

A reinforcement learning agent will normally only deviate 
randomly from its learned behavior and does not get any 
reward for it other than whatever reward or punishment it 
gets from the deviation. But imagine an agent that gets a 
slight reward for exploring. It will seek out unknown 
parts of its environment, learning where the greatest 
rewards are and then (since it now is hard to get the 
exploration rewards) exploit them, earning much more 
reward than the "stay at home" agent. 

But the optimal level of exploration is impossible to 
know a priori, it depends on the environment and luck. So 
evolution would not set us all to the same level of 
exploration reward. We are distributed in this respect, 
with some people with more explorative personalities and 
others less. The explorers would get internal rewards for 
finding out more, even when it is useless or goes against 
the beliefs of others. Maybe this is another partial 
explanation for iconoclasm.


It should also be noted that society is far more open 
today than in the 50's (largely due to the iconoclasts!). 
This means that there is less need to rebel, and 
iconoclasm can be aimed into "safe" pursuits such as art, 
gaming or showing off at the beach. The number of 
iconoclasts may not have decreased, but they are less 
visible.

### No, it's exactly the opposite. Money which would otherwise be spent on
overpaying some employees can be divided between cheaper but better foreign
workers, local consumers who will benefit from lower prices, and researchers
wherever they can be found. Research output will skyrocket.

If the money for the so-called "defense" shrinks, it's good. The US machine
for killing people is too big already.

As some Americans become unemployed, the  prices of services, homes, goods,
will drop, allowing others, the working people, to benefit, and encouraging
more economic activity, finally allowing the unemployed back into the
economy. If they want to.

### Yeah, let's select against other humans - the brown people in
who-cares-where, let them eat ... who cares what. We won't tolerate them
working for a pittance, if they can starve even cheaper. We'll keep all
industry and service here, won't let the ragheads and chinks take it away,
right? And if they get feisty, we'll send the Marines.

Those who are unemployed *do* indeed face difficult 
decisions, that is a given. And drones *do* historically 
die, that too is a given.

But when one says that they "should" die, that suggests
to me a moral judgement. Is it? If it is I think it may not
stand to deeper scrutiny.

That protectionism is harmful for the US economy seems
to me to be a pretty sweeping statement carrying many 
assumptions such as how quickly and on whose shoulders
the burden of reducing protectionism should fall.

"In the end" also seems significant. I wonder if there can 
be "in the end" a US economy that is distinct and separate
from the economy of the rest of the world? Doesn't seem
like an end point with much internal logical consistency to
me.  

And in the interum, are we not really wrestling with the 
difficulties of negotiating our path from where we are now
towards where we would be?

I imagine there would be little disagreement between Rafal,
Hubert and Damien that before "the end" the human condition
globally could and should be much better than it is now. The
point then seems to be to find ways to traverse the terrain
between here and there. This will require negotiation and
careful deliberation. I wonder what the value of hyperbole
is, even amongst friends, in the face of such challenges?

Regards,
Brett

Brett,
       If you are concerned with the capital flight from the US and the 
resulting job losses in the US the answers seems fairly obvious from this 
viewpoint.
       First, The US government is the problem not the solution.  American 
investors have gotten tired of being subject to OEO, AFL/CIO, OSHA, EPA, IRS and 
the thousand and one other alphabet laws and regulating or taxing agencies.  
As far back as the sixties when I first began working in management American 
companies were attempting to get out from under by excaping highly regulated 
states to those that would offer some shelter.  Now we have the international 
flight as a continuation of that early effort.
       If you wish to stop American investors from fleeing this country get 
rid of the encumbrances of doing business here.
       Second, Recognise that the market will eventually follow the jobs that 
follow the investment money.  This means there will be opportunities for 
intreprenuers that can tap into the supply of cheap American labor to supply 
products to the American market.  
       Third, This is really a sub section to "Second."  I don't know what 
the efficiency of foreign foreign manufacturing is relative to American 
manufacturing but it seems like it couldn't be good.  
       I know from consulting to manufacturing as an "efficiency expert" that 
labor constitutes a small percentage of the total manufacturing dollar.  When 
you compare that to the cost of shipping products back to the US and 
marketing them here any direct labor savings have to be slender. 
       On the other hand in today's environment overhead costs can easily be 
three or four times the labor costs in the total manufacturing cost.
       Taxes and regulatory costs are an important part of that overhead.  
But, that takes us back to my first point.
       Let me give you an example.   I did a cost cutting project for Ford 
Motor Company back in the early 80s.  In the first six plants they assigned me I 
acted as a leader and found them four million dollars in labor savings.  If 
we had time to discuss all the surrounding circumstances that was no big deal.
       On the other hand in my retirement I have taken up the study of Tax 
Accounting.  I am learning that an expert team of tax accountants can often save 
companies much more money than I ever could.  Of course as soon as soon as 
the Congress discovers what the companies are doing they yell foul.  At that 
point hearings are held and in comes the Justice Department to close the "loop 
hole" by criminal prosecution if possible or by recommending to Congress a new 
law.  Then Congress gets some favorable press, they pick up a few votes, and 
overseas goes some more investment money.
       Those wiley tax accountants and tax attorneys have pointed out once 
again that it is cheaper overseas where you don't have to contend with the IRS, 
OEO, EPA, etc as well as the Republicans and Democrats in Congress.

Rafal,
       Let me say that I think we are all missing the point.  In anticipating 
the future we have a choice between two predictions as to what is happening 
and is going to happen:
1.  The Singularity.
2.  A new Renaissance as predicted by Mike McGee -- see his book 
Technaissance.  
       Imho both of those will be driven by the empowerment by what THE BELL 
CURVE calls the GT (do I have the right term?)  It appears that in the first 
Renaissance enough of the most intelligent segment of the society were 
empowered to drive the advancement that occurred.  However not all GT were empowered 
at that time, many just kept on digging ditches as they had before.  At this 
time according to THE BELL CURVE an additional group of GT are being empowered.  
It appears to me that this group is once again driving our advancement.
       If what I have just written is true then we will indeed have a new 
Renaissance as Mike McGee predicts is happening.
       As I see it the difference between a Renaissance and the Singularity 
depends on the power of the additional GT and/or the availability of AI.
       But I totally agree with McGee when he predicts that the time ahead 
will be full of turmoil.  Heck, according to what I read we are already having 
board room wars in our organizations.  The old money can no longer manage the 
complex organizations and business that result from our high tech economy.  The 
new boys and girls that now have to run those organizations don't want to do 
it as hired hands that strictly follow orders as to goals -- they are fighting 
for a share of control.  You can bet that later they will demand majority 
control
       Rafal, let me come now to what I think is the point.  You and the 
others on this list are basically the "New boys and girls" that are, as a group, 
driving the changes now going on whether those changes characterize a 
Renaissance or the approach of the Singularity.  What kind of a world do you want it to 
be and what do you intend to do.
       Will you be willing to follow a great leader that hands down orders 
for the rest of us to follow?  Will you agree to go on being regulated from 
Washington, Peking, etc.?

I first heard about it in the early 1990s in an issue of _Nature_
wherein John Royden Maddox proposed it as a solution to Olber's Paradox.

### Nah, just keep them off honest working people's backs (here and abroad),
and everything will be fine. Finally even they will grow up.

###  NO!

No orders, except restaurant ones, no state regulation, no force, no fraud.

To paraphrase Mel Gibson's final  Braveheart scream "Let there be morally

### Perhaps iconoclasm is one of the rare but viable strategies for
rejecting reproductively detrimental social control. Our forefathers'
brothers who didn't internalize tribal norms at all were ostracized and
didn't reproduce, but the ones who accepted norms unquestioningly
("swallowed it hook, line and sinker"), were easy prey for deceptive,
self-deceptive, or even (internally) honest purveyors of reproductively
limiting mores. Those who can selectively reject social conditioning,
without descending into the chaos of the antisocial or borderline
personality disorders, can survive in the society better than the other two
strategies (a.k.a. thugs and sheeple), although it's possible that a high
concentration of iconoclasts interferes with social cohesion, and this could
explain our low numbers.

The cases of the Skoptsy, and Shakers, come to mind here. Skoptsy were
members of a Russian religious sect, who swore off sex altogether, and by
castration and mastectomy  made sure they couldn't change their minds.
Shakers, as you may well know, had a similar set of memes, although with
less gruesome implementation.

Only the iconoclastic Skoptsy and Shakers contributed to today's gene pools.

Nothing to do with the cosmos. But there are several
strong evidences of fractality also in microphysics.

The evolution of the probability density 
|psi(x,t)|^2 to find a particle in a box 
is characterized by highly ordered patterns 
of minima and maxima of probability, 
both in time and space. Similar
patterns with BECs, and nuclear systems,
under specific potentials.

Can fractal behavior be found in quantum theory 
despite the coarse-graining effects of the 
Heisenberg uncertainty principle? Evidently ... 

There is a nice technical paper (pdf) about this,
and look at the beautiful images therein, ... and 
there are also 4 videos (semi-long download).

### This is an old defense - "I really like my butler, he's black, but a
good man, nevertheless. But you couldn't let blacks work on their own,
listen to those scumbag abolitionists and set their own prices. They need
supervision, visas, regulations so they won't compete with me, so I can keep
my cushy job. Except for my butler, let them clean sewers".

More quotes from a protectionist:

"And those bosses, they are worthless scum, every single one of them. In
fact, you can't become a manager unless you are a stupid, incompetent
suck-up."

"And I didn't want to buy this imported car, really, but it was so cheap I
couldn't resist. Tell those loser GM bosses to get their act together, or
else I won't buy any of their cars. I have choice, you know."

"And tell them suck-up bosses who don't want to hire me, better think it
over, or else I'll come over with some buddies, and you won't have no choice
nomore."

"Yep."

On page 42 of the article (" Tetlock, P.E., Kristel, O., Elson, B., Green,
M., and Lerner, J (final revision process/2000). The psychology of the
unthinkable: Taboo trade-offs, forbidden base rates, and heretical
counterfactuals. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology"), I found the
following:



 "Greenberg et al.'s (1994) terror-management theory posits that people who
are reminded of their mortality seek out the existential comfort of a
collectively shared world view that transcends their mortal life spans and
endows their lives with moral significance.  Linking this alternative theory
of people as intuitive theologians to the SVPM leads to the hypothesis that,
agnostic Bayesian libertarians excepted, people reminded of their mortality
should be especially outraged by taboo trade-offs, forbidden base rates, and
heretical counterfactuals that de-stabilize their worldview, and especially
inclined to moral cleansing"



### I am an agnostic Bayesian libertarian, and Tetlock's findings are an
incredibly powerful synthesis of what it means to be me, as opposed to
non-agnostic, non-Bayesian non-libertarians. Explains among others why I
reacted to intimations of my own mortality by signing a cryonics contract,
how my long process of psychological self-modification could  lead to the
almost complete removal of the three Fiskean schemata from my mind, and how
these internally inconsistent elements could be supplanted by a unified,
volition-based ethical construct.



Really good stuff.

### This is an old defense - "I really like my butler, he's black, but a
good man, nevertheless. But you couldn't let blacks work on their own,
listen to those scumbag abolitionists and set their own prices. They need
supervision, visas, regulations so they won't compete with me, so I can keep
my cushy job. Except for my butler, let them clean sewers".

More quotes from a protectionist:

"And those bosses, they are worthless scum, every single one of them. In
fact, you can't become a manager unless you are a stupid, incompetent
suck-up."

"And I didn't want to buy this imported car, really, but it was so cheap I
couldn't resist. Tell those loser GM bosses to get their act together, or
else I won't buy any of their cars. I have choice, you know."

"And tell them suck-up bosses who don't want to hire me, better think it
over, or else I'll come over with some buddies, and they won't have no
choice nomore."

"Yep."

Mitch, according to my understanding of capitalist theory this is good.  I 
believe it was Marx that complained that a capitalist society was in a constant 
stage of change.  Marx was right but he didn't understand that is what makes 
us strong.
       If we are to have beneficial change this group, that are as you 
describe them, has to go.  Right now they seem to have the idea they can survive and 
thrive by seeking out sources of cheap labor.  Being thugs at heart they are 
also finding dictatorships (communist and other) that will sell them labor at 
slave labor prices.
       But these thugs will not prosper.  As I see it they will be replaced 
here and elsewhere by better smarter managers.  I see those managers coming 
from people such as you find on this list.
       I also see you (plural) operating in two ways, first as entreprenuers 
and investors, second in politics to demand reform.
       I don't know what you intend to do.  I am retired but I hope to 
generate sufficient income to return to investing -- investing in companies that are 
led by good managers.

Barbara Blithers;
Oh Steve! The Law of the Excluded Middle only applies to mathematical
Logic, and then only to consistent systems where only X and Not-X can
exist as mutually exclusive states (EG binary logic where if a Bit is
not 0 then it must be 1 and vice versa) IE mathematical systems where no
middle state exists. The law's greatest use these days is in computer
programming, cybernetics, and AI development. It only applies in
restricted circumstances and it doesn't even apply to most mathematical
"logics". It is inappropriate to apply it to rhetoric or semantics where
its use is described as a logical fallacy.(Q: Are fallacies so called
because they're only resorted to by pricks?).

The Law, correctly stated is "In a system where only True and False are
permitted as states if a state is found to be not-false it must be
true." The hilarious line (well, it had *me* ROTFL anyway); "if a defect
can be found in one side's arguments, the other is necessarily true."
just isn't the way, or the circumstances under which, the EM law works.
A case of reducto ad absurdum, or perhaps, rectum ergo sum?

> Also, how do we know there's an excluded middle?

Normally, God Botherers present all the "logical" and empirical proofs
traditionally used to convince the gullible that there is evidence for
and proof of an uber-god first before attempting to misapply the EM law,
but our troll skipped this stage. Pity really, because it can be quite
fun, when cornered by JWs and the like, to accept all the proofs as true
and then point out that the proofs can be used to support the existence
of any uber-god (Wotan, Allah, Jehovah, Amon-Ra, Vishnu, Ahura Mazda,
Khrishna, ad infinitum, ad nauseum) and then watch them squirm as you
challenge them to prove that the "proofs" apply exclusively to their
god. Anyone who tries to apply proofs to articles of faith deserves all
they get: the early squirm gets the void.

Indeed, any "maybe" excludes absolutes and excludes the excluded middle.
QED.

> Waste of time arguing with a troll. I know.

One dosn't (apart from anything else it is somewhat unsporting to enter
a battle of wits with the unarmed) rahter one ignites them with facts
(to paraphrase Domminar Rigel XVI "even a moron should know a frelling
fact when it hits them in the face") until STC occurs ;-)

Article by Andrew Orlowski:
http://dev.null.org/cgi-bin/comment.cgi?it=200308060039_extropian&mc=24a7d24e32

>>>>>>
someone named Mitch wrote:
What happened to the Extropians, those space-bound,
cryogenics-obsessed children of Ayn Rand and the WELL, after the WIRED
Long Boom came crashing down? Well, they've swallowed their
anti-statist convictions and mutated into Strangelovian
*****neo-conservative think-tanks*****, which have the ear of the
President and were behind things such as the aborted terrorism futures
market. Or so Andrew "blogs are killing Google" Orlowski says anyway. 
>>>>>>>

I have to admit his turn of words with "what happened to the Extropians, those space-bound, cryogenics obsessed children of Ayn Rand...?" really caught my eye.  What more could be added to the list? lol  

I hope the more prominent and capable Extropians don't wind up mutating into "neo-conservative think-tanks" which no longer have Extropian ideals and visions dear to their heart.  I see Max More and Anders Sandberg, among others, in time facing this temptation.    

"So let's meet the brainchild behind PAM, the blond haired and photogenic Robin Hanson, assistant economics professor at George Mason University. With phlegmatic good grace, Hanson announced the news on the Extropian Bulletin Board, that PAM had been axed. Hanson isn't himself an "Extropian", he says, but many of his followers are, so maybe it's a good time you were introduced. And since they're being touted as the radical out-of-the-box thinking that US foreign policy needs, we must not delay." 

I've always wanted an article about me which starts out by saying I'm photogenic! lol  Oh, well.  What's this?  Robin is not actually a signed-up Extropian??  He, Damien Broderick, myself and the rest of you better repent...  

I still can't get over the left-handed compliments given Extropians by Andrew Orlowski.  "We're not sure if they all 185 pounds, but they're certainly very, very rich."  If only it were true!!  I'm sure Max and Natasha would agree with me on that point. lol

It's a very creative imagination which states "a few years ago a bunch of extremely wealthy Californians met, liked the look of each other a lot, and formed a group called Extropians."  HA!!  The group of poor college grad students which formed ExI did not quite fit that description.

He continues "Extropianism, we were told, expoused "extremely advanced technology" and displayed "dedicated, immovable optimism". The hated gubberment got it particularly hard from these wealthy uberkinder, for whom the State was "regarded as one of the major restrictive forces in the Milky Way galaxy."  I would not say we truly hate the government but it does give good reason to be very disgruntled.

"Employees of the government were mockingly described as "entropians". They felt entitled to mock the poor or stupid, and amongst this self-selecting circle this amounted to almost everyone else, because they were confident they themselves would write the history books."  Wow.  Orlowski really hits below the belt with this paragraph.  I have been fairly faithful about reading the Extrolist for about four years now (and attended the Extro-5 Con) and I have witnessed on the whole a great deal of compassion in the opinions of Extropians regarding the poor and not so bright.  They want to raise people up instead of simply putting them down.  I would not say this about Mensa or other elitest groups.

"But the most interesting thing about this ersatz cult was the amount of energy that its members devoted to wanting to live forever. To flee the surly bonds of mortality, once and for all, the Extropians devoted much of their disposable income (of which, there was much to dispose) to cryogenic research - deciding how to freeze themselves for eternal life, and deciding who amongst them Shall Be First."  "Cult??"  Oh, I forgot this is a work of muckraking yellow journalism.  "An open society of very enthusiastic and hopeful technophiles who get high off thinking about the future" would have been better in my view.

Again he brings up how Extropians have a great deal of disposable income and that they even donate much of it to cryonics research.  Someone please inform Alcor to focus on fundraising among these superrich cult members! : )

"Well, until last week we could dismiss these techno-utopians as a freakish cult, but now we know two things: they have they ear of the Pentagon, and they have powerful defenders in the shape of the New York Times op-ed page, and West Coast columnists. But there's an even more tantalizing narrative we can't entirely ignore."

I had absolutely no idea just how politically powerful ExI had gotten!  We have obviously taken our place among the Illuminati in the ruling of the world.  Robert Anton Wilson will have to take this into consideration with his next book.  But seriously, it does show the strength of the organization by having people of Robin Hanson's caliber associate with it.   

"How is this so? If you want to be a Gillmor, you have to trust someone else to come up with the answer. However economists who want to ask why, and probe a little further, and ask why our economies keep failing, and our bubble keep bursting, typically don't get the opportunities that Hal Varians enjoy. There isn't an awful lot of money to sustain bad news bears. Some might even want to probe even deeper, and ask how we can maintain sustainable development, or even hope to motivate and train a prosperous middle class." 

"The Extropian answer is simple: such dunderheads will be left behind as we all lift off into space, making giddy whooping noises as we ascend."

This part of Orlowski's article shows an apparent achille's heel in how people often view extropianism/transhumanism.  We are seen as having our "heads in the clouds" with futurist scenarios bordering or surpassing most SF, while people in the real world suffer a multitude of economic, social and physical maladies.  What could we do here and now to change this?

I hope to see ExI, Pro-Act and The Society for Venturism do their part.

best wishes,

I guess that moral cleansing includes any effort to make a
group's views more uniform by exerting pressure on the
iconoclasts.  (By "pressure" I mean anything in excess of
rational criticism, including dismissals as "uninformed",
"illogical", etc., even when we believe those to be true.)

Well, one does wish for consistency inside one's value system.
I sort of hope that you are not saying more than that here.

Well, this has certainly been a very interesting thread. I am sure that this 
job market has mutated the politics of many an American. So far it has not 
touched me: I am still employed, and I and my (immigrant Asian) wife are 
doing fine. However, many others are not doing so well.

I hope that others are coming around to seeing our nation as a jointly owned 
property around an unwritten contract exists. The parties to this contract 
are the citizens of this nation.  Non citizens are NOT parties to this 
particular contract.  In part, the contract holds that the citizens must 
compete with each other for whatever benefits are to be had from 
citizenship.  Non citizens may not compete for the benefits of citizenship, 
unless they "buy in" in a sufficient amount.

If our hired men (our politicians) subvert this contract, or allow others to 
subvert it, thereby defrauding/robbing/embezzling the citizens, they should 
face stiff penalties.

Ah, but my point was that in the spirit of the earlier discussions
and in the spirit of Robin's paper on the subject of correcting
one's biases, should not Bayesians suspect that this enjoyment
slants their perception?

(Here of course I must say that I am talking about real Bayesians
since there are no ideal Bayesians---but then, perhaps no one has
addressed what *real* Bayesians do or say until this moment!?)

And if they do acknowledge this bias, then the good Bayesians
must attempt to control for this glee, by slightly devaluing
in turn their objective estimates that a certain provocative
hypothesis is true.  I proudly claim to do just this: whenever
it looks like I'm enjoying some radical proposal too much, I
try (perhaps not very hard, he he he) to develop a little
corresponding skepticism about it.

The Internet is essentially a set of self routing nodes.  You determine a 
route based on first path to respond and use it.  So if one node on that 
path fails, you try again and use the next path.

There are major pipes extending through the US that provide the major 
connections from Europe to Asia and South America.  If they were to vanish, 
everyone would try to reroute through other paths, quickly overwhelming them.

The protection would be to have backup connectivity via alternate 
geographical routes that would be capable of picking up the traffic as it 
rerouted.  Certainly non-trivial and not cheap.

Here are some sites where you can get maps of the Internet that show some 
of the complexity involved. Some of these are truly fascinating.

A slot for science


Weather, sports, and animals have their own cable television channels. Why 
not 24-hour science? | <mailto:csoares@the-scientist.com>By Christine Soares


Science is too important and the scientific process too complex to leave to 
the "tyranny" of the network news 
<http://www.the-scientist.com/yr1991/june/prof_910610.html>sound bite, 
contends a small California-based group trying to generate support for an 
entire television network devoted to unadulterated science. Modeling their 
proposed science channel on the nonprofit 
<http://www.c-span.org/>Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network (C-SPAN), 
the group is seeking seed money from investor angels or foundations to move 
forward with the idea whose time, they believe, has come.

"We now have more than 100 channels on cable, so it seems that to me there 
ought to be one of them devoted to some serious scientific discussion," 
said <http://www.csntv.org/>Terry Sejnowski, head of the Salk Institute's 
Computational Neurobiology Laboratory, who is serving as advisory board 
chair for the fledgling 
"<http://www.salk.edu/faculty/faculty/details.php?id=48>Cable Science 
Network" (CSN) initiative.

Sejnowski <http://www.biomedcentral.com/pubmed/12893928>makes a case for 
the network in the August 1 issue of Science, citing stem cell research as 
just one example of topics for which public discussion and policymaking 
require in-depth information, and current science coverage is inadequate: 
"The importance of timely scientific information was apparent in the 
debates in the United States last year on stem cell research: Speeches were 
given, positions taken, and decisions made based on simplistic and 
sensational interpretations of the underlying biology. The press failed to 
provide the scientific background, and the scientific community failed to 
provide forums to clarify the different types of stem cell research and the 
consequences of restricting research options."

CSN is the brainchild of evolutionary neuroscientist Roger Bingham, a 
researcher at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) 
<http://psy.ucsd.edu/chip/CBC2.html>Center for Brain and Cognition and an 
awardwinning documentary producer. Bingham and his wife Linda, a fan of 
both science and C-SPAN, have put together a brief position paper 
describing the possible content of a 24-hour-a-day television network that 
would provide the kind of access to in-depth science information and 
discussion that C-SPAN's three channels collectively provide for politics.

Bingham envisions offering a mix of high-end documentary material, such as 
the "<http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/>NOVA" series and a revival of 
<http://www.the-scientist.com/yr1997/july/gwynne_p1_970721.html>Carl 
Sagan's "Cosmos," with lectures, both historic and current, and talk shows. 
But the network would also carry a C-SPAN-esque assortment of unedited 
content, such as live speeches, debates, and congressional hearings.

<http://www.people.cornell.edu/pages/bvl1>Bruce V. Lewenstein, a professor 
of science communication at Cornell University and editor of the journal 
<http://www.sagepub.co.uk/journal.aspx?pid=105747>Public Understanding of 
Science, wonders how much of an audience there would be for such a channel. 
"Live science isn't very interesting," he said, and Bingham's CSN proposal 
"has its heart in the right place, but it doesn't seem to recognize or 
speak to some of the constraints for 
<http://www.nap.edu/issues/19.4/yankelovich.html>reaching the broad public 
with science information."

The National Science Foundation's 
<http://www.nsf.gov/sbe/srs/seind02/c7/c7s4.htm#c7s4l2>latest annual survey 
of public attitudes toward science found that only 8% of respondents watch 
"NOVA" regularly, whereas 90% watch television news at least a few times a 
week. Even legislators are getting science information from TV news shows, 
according to the report, which noted that a "60 Minutes" segment on human 
cloning was shown at the start of a March 2001 House of Representatives 
subcommittee hearing on the topic.

Lewenstein fears there might not be much of an appetite for the undigested 
science discussion that Bingham sees as a key element in the CSN mix. "This 
is why I'm a little bit surprised that someone who's a very experienced 
television producer would be talking about putting out something raw and 
think that it's going to have appeal. That's the piece I'm curious about," 
Lewenstein said.

Bingham, who has produced acclaimed PBS series including "Frontiers of the 
Mind" and "The Human Quest," acknowledges that lovingly crafted 
documentaries represent one extreme in science communication and can be 
highly effective. "But I also know how much stuff I left on the floor. I 
regretted a lot of the material that didn't make it onto the air," he said. 
"And it's important to have a network that's free of the tyranny of the 
sound bite."

Sejnowski notes that he has friends who are "C-SPAN junkies" precisely 
because of the channels' unscripted drama. "They just put it on in the 
background and it's kind of like a soap opera& I think it's really 
transformed public perception of what happens in Washington& what it is 
that people actually do to make policy," he said. "So I think one of the 
goals of CSN could be just to let the public know how science is done& 
having scientists debate the issues and having the process of science 
exposed to the public."

At present, only <http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/>NASA TV broadcasts 
a near-constant stream of educational programming and live transmissions 
from space missions. And several organizations, such as the UK-based 
<http://www.vega.org.uk/info/intro.html>Vega Science Trust and the 
<http://www.mos.org/cst/section/presentation.html>Current Science and 
Technology Center in Boston, produce TV-ready lectures and discussions of 
timely science topics for broadcast by other television networks and on the 
Internet.

But none of these sources rival the 24-hour reach of C-SPAN, which is 
funded by the cable television industry as a public service and is 
available to 85 million US households, with an 
<http://www.c-span.org/about/numbers.asp>estimated weekly audience of 28 
million.

Why C-SPAN itself doesn't offer science-related programming when public 
policy or legislation is at stake is a mystery to Sejnowski. He suspects 
the network's producers simply don't have the expertise to find the right 
sources, and he and Bingham would be happy to help.

Bingham says he has had initial talks with C-SPAN and other "nonprofit 
providers" about developing some programming that could be a "training 
wheels" stage in building the CSN network. For example, he'd love to see a 
monthly installment of C-SPAN's 
< http://www.booknotes.org/about/ > Booknotes" program devoted to interviews 
with authors of science books.

Working with a small private grant, Bingham is circulating his position 
paper and putting together an advisory board. So far, Sejnowski and his 
wife Beatrice Golomb, a UCSD researcher, have signed on, as have V.S. 
Ramachandran; E.C. Krupp, director of the Griffith Observatory; John Allman 
of the California Institute of Technology; Ann Druyan of Cosmos Studios; 
Paul MacReady of AeroVironment; and Michael Shermer, editor of Skeptic 
magazine.

But as yet, "there isn't any angel who finds this to be their life calling, 
where they want to make their imprint," Sejnowski said. "There are a lot of 
very wealthy individuals right now who are looking around and who are young 
enough so they can get involved. This would be the perfect project for them."

C'mon, if you think that any CEOs are going to the cellar
to be shot, or marched up to guillotines, then you are
too far from reality.  Even if you are right about overpaid
top executives, then the worst that will happen is that
they'll be replaced by cheaper and more effective CEOs from
within the ranks, as the fad of outside celebrity wears off.

I urge everyone to carefully attend to Rafal's *economic* arguments.
So far in perusing this thread, he appears to be the only one up
on free-market economics, who understands thoroughly why protectionism
always hurts everyone in the long run.

Right here, even the US is not really hurt by sending jobs
oversees where they can be done more cheaply and efficiently
because the American consumer is then so much better off.

The only bad thing that can happen is for the lazy Americans
---who *refuse* to take jobs at lower pay or at *whatever*
the market will offer---will be abetted by all the stupid
and awful unemployment "insurance" socialist schemes to 
weaken the U.S.  No one should ever receive *any* incentive
to remain unemployed, if what you want is the good of a
particular nation, or, if what you want is the good of the
whole world.

> If the money for the so-called "defense" shrinks, it's good.
> The US machine for killing people is too big already.

Okay, let's hear your tune if an A-bomb goes off in Newark
tomorrow.  I guessed at what many other people's reaction
would be, but I didn't think to guess yours.  My guess is
that you would have an immediate and 180-degree attitude
change.

Hey Mitch, they got caught, didn't they??  The American
economy---unlike European ones---is doing just fine.  Look
at the GNP and unemployment rate.  I think you and far too
many other people want the make-believe of the late nineties
back, where everybody was employed on projects that were
eventually canceled and everyone thought that they were 
getting rich in the markets.  Real life is not like that.
*This* is normal---and not so bad, so long as you are not
having to make difficult life decisions about what to do
next to help (i.e., you are unemployed yourself).

The only way that will happen is if the lazy socialist

whatever the market prices dictate.

Look, the patriotic part of me doesn't give nearly the
preference to all those non-Americans.  *I* think that
protectionism *hurts* Americans.  We are sacrificing a
lot of productive labor in other countries that could
be turning out a lot of goods that could make The Superpower
even greater and save humanity from nuclear proliferation.
That's the reason (the patriotic part of me that's left says)
we should always do as the market instructs.  By maximizing
wealth for ourselves, it so happens that we maximize wealth
for others.  I really have nothing against that!

> We won't tolerate them working for a pittance, if

Your point is well-taken; but our off-loading jobs
is not to rescue anyone but ourselves.  Still, it
does expose the inconsistency of the left who
oppose NAFTA.

No, we should send in the Marines only when someone
tries to get out of line with weaponry or repression,
and sometimes not even then.

Oh, please don't do that!  :-)   Even if I am xenophobic
and tribalistic, your economic contributions are so keen
and precious.  And even your angry sarcasm does not 
descend to name-calling or anything.

Mitch,
       You gave us a link to IMB's last three Annual Statements.  Isn't that 
Income Statement revealing?
       The big decline in Operating Profits seems to be due to the President 
and the Sales/Marketing departments not delivering the sales that are their 
responsibility to deliver.  I don't see any numbers to indicate to me that IMB 
ran into problems because EDP was deficient.
       However there is one thing we have to remember as operating people.  
Most times top management is sales oriented and relatively ignorant of 
operations in all its aspects.  It is an to the best of my knowledge a competition 
between those of us in operations and our competitors in other companies.  We 
have to constantly be concerned with delivering better and cheaper work to our 
employers.
       I am not saying this to point a finger at anyone.  Instead I am only 
reminding.  Hopefully as GT win the boardroom wars we will get managers that 
understand the need to communicate realistically to the operating departments.  
This communication is needed so the operators can make realistic evaluations 
of the job in front of them.
Ron h.

I do not see any evidence of that. In fact, common sense tells me that the 
opposite would happen--we would be worse off.

"Working" per se should not be our goal. Instead, getting the maximum wage 
per hour worked should be the goal. Imagine if I went applied for a job at 
bakery, and the employer offers me  $10/hr, and I counter with an offer of 
$5/hr, saying that since I buy bread, I will benefit from the lower prices!

Lee,
       This is partially a case of outsourcing by top management for a 
cheaper source of labor but it is also a case of operations people not entering into 
the competition for the jobs they have.
       I have been in a company, the Electromotive Division of (General 
Motors??) where the entire company was slowly moving to Canada.  Way too many 
workers were concerned only with early getting retirement when the company finally 
selected them for unemployment.  I saw labor utilization that was so wrong it 
was insane with operating management doing nothing to improve the situation.  
I felt like Alice in Wonderland.

       Lee, you also said, "I urge everyone to carefully attend to Rafal's 
*economic* arguments.  So far in perusing this thread, he appears to be the only 
one up on free-market economics, who understands thoroughly why protectionism 
always hurts everyone in the long run."
       I can't for the life of me understand why having one side of a 
transaction practice freemarket economics while the other party to the transaction 
practices protectionism to beggar the first party can be described as a 
freemarket economy or beneficial to all concerned.
       That goes double when the protectionist party has already been caught 
selling their people as sweatshop labor.
       Enlighten me, please.

Yes, my readings of the material put out by the Von Mises Institute tells me 
the Dems and Reps are playing Frick and Frack to each other.  The Von Mises 
writers have done what appears to be a good job of explaining why Greenspans 
moves would be ineffective.  However I am basically still learning the Austrian 
School's Theories so I can't back them up in that opinion.  I admire George 
Bush very much as a man but the Reps only seem to be ahead of the Dems by a step 
or two.

You are starting to scare me. What capital flight from the

worries you?  Do you have any references?

Well, who knows for sure what the reality is? I have
an open mind, but work for a *very* small company
under a pure and very smart little entrepreneur.  My
view may be unconsciously biased.

What makes you feel it likely that you are speaking
for the typical American boss? That is not a rhetorical
question, I just want to know (you could be right).  My
own take is/was that we should expect ordinary free-market
competition to be working unless we have evidence to the
contrary.

Well, so did J. P. Morgan (got started in business by
his father) while an even more silver-spooned contemporary
lost the family fortune because he did not have business
talents.  The key is whether the American entrepreneur
and business leader still has what it takes.  If not,
how do you explain the failure of competition and Darwin?

SO HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THIS??  HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN?

It's interesting how free-enterprise slash unfettered
capitalism slash free-marketeers suddenly change their
tune when the "downturn in the business cycle" hits
them personally.  If a conservative is a liberal who's
been mugged, then a born again liberal is a
conservative who's been "downsized".  However, I'm not
here to gloat or do the "I told you so" dance.  

Capitaism has its problems, as does socialism.  The
bottom line is that life is a bumpy ride, no matter
"the system" and, at the risk of seeming like a Miss
America contestant, we need to be prepared, when
bruised by act of god or man, to help each other out. 


I have no problem with the underlying theory of
capitalism: one works, generates a surplus, invests
the surplus so as to further increase their wealth.

But the simple reasonableness of this principle--which
increases the wealth of the individual AND the wealth
of the community--can be corrupted by (among other
things) greed coupled with systemic structural flaws. 
This is where I would suggest a qualifier to Mitch's
indictment of the managerial class.  

Structural flaws provide the opportunity to take
advantage of "the system" (corporate and
governemnt)and aggrandized oneself at the expense of
others.  And, tending to make matters much worse is
the further flaw in the system, whereby abusing it
confers an advantage, ie. crime pays, and the crime of
one, like a cancer, infects, compels, encourages, and
for a while legitimizes, the crime/corruption of
others.  "Everyone was doing it."

The structural flaw as I see it lies in the unbalanced
power of exectutives and massive non-accountability. 
They make the decisions, make the rules, control the
paper trail.  When the shepherd is the wolfman, look
out for the full moon.  Same problem as when the coke
dealer starts dipping into his inventory.  It's
Rousseau's cautionary note on representative
government: "How do you keep the representatives from
serving themselves at the expense of their
constituents?"  Just so, corporate execs can stray
from the ethical path and cook the books.  Plus the
government is right in there with them--the other
executive class(small "e", includes the congress and
the judiciary)--infected by and contributing to the
corruption.  Two words: campaign finance.  Then,
having been bought, they make the laws governing
corporate structure, regulation, and third party
oversight.  A guild of meta-foxes in charge of the
henhouse nation.

But not all managers are corrupt.  Not even most. 
They're a necessary part of the engine of production,
the more highly skilled, the more valuable.(Well,
duh!) Give 'em their due, don't lump them all with the
bad apples. And they're all human, like you and me.

Regarding the idea that managers are somehow unworthy
because they run businesses but rarely build them: it
seems entirely reasonable to me that these are two
different specialties, running vs building.  At least
that's a theory I've heard somewhere.  Why not?  And
those skilled at one may not be as skilled at the
other.  

So fix the problem.  Stop the war before it becomes a
war.  Correct the structural flaws.  Spread out the
power, strengthen oversight, put some teeth into
accountability.

And regarding accountablity, I have a dream.  Take all
the corporate and government rat bastards and put them
in a fenced in (as opposed to gated) community.  A
community of tar-paper, dirt floor shacks.  On one
side, the up-wind side, is the local sewage treatment
plant, on another the local freeway, elevated and
gently banked so the passers-by can get a good look;
the garbage dump and local recycling center on a
third--with open access to the pariah class so they
may freely avail themselves of home furnishings and
other collectables--and on the forth perhaps a
pleasant little park slash community garden,...built
atop a "reclaimed" toxic waste dump.  And each morning
a fleet of rusty, clanking, old school busses, like
those used to transport farmworkers and Baptists,
arrives at the freeway bus stop to pick them up and
take them to work, cleaning out the grease traps in
the fast food outlets of the world, there to be looked
down upon by their betters, the pimple-faced teen-age
burger-flippers and third-world immigrant ethicists.  


For all eternity.

Or not.  And wait for the war.    

Best, Jeff Davis

Mitch quotes from  http://www.reason.com/links/links073003.shtml

   Take this howler from IBM spokeswoman, Kendra R. Collins,
   "It's not about one shore or another shore. It's about
   investing around the world, including the United States,
   to build capability and deliver value as defined by our
   customers." 

   No, it's about working the cost side of balance sheet in
   search of profits; revenues have been flat for two years
   and show little sign of improving. This is what good
   managers do, and there is no reason to be ashamed of
   it if you truly think you are going to make the company
   stronger. 

Well, that's what I would say too.

   But the catch is that out-sourcing is being embraced without
   much sign that it will actually make high-tech firms,
   particularly software companies, more effective. Highly
   collaborative, imaginative work might suffer in the hands
   of technically adept but inexperienced programmers. 

Okay, the market place is smarter, MUCH smarter than all of
us.  Let it sort it out.  If this is true, then the companies
that send the work to India will on average not do so well---
so the capitalists and entrepreneurs should be encouraged to
follow their own profit seeking instincts.

> Ron h & Mitch-- two pro-capitalists, who know that corporate

But it hasn't worked in the West for centuries!  What
has worked has been thousands of small time entrepreneurs
(like my boss) or the genius Rockefellers, Morgans, and
Fords.  That has been what has worked.

Your mission, should you choose to undertake, is to explain
what is different now.  Government regulation?  Failing
character values among socialized pampered Americans?
As usual, the secretary will disavow any knowledge of
your mission.  Good luck Mitch.

A later development along these same lines came in
college.  I was studying some leaf in connection with
biology or something and suddenly realized that when I
looked at the leaf, I was only seeing the surface.  It
suddenly occurred to me to try to mentally internalize
the leaf structure and function so that when I looked
at it, my thoughts would be focused not on the visable
image, but on the actual 4-Dimensional leaf.  As I did
so, I felt as though I were somehow sinking into the
structure of the leaf, and losing something of my own
separated identity as I visualized the complete
perceptual/conceptual me/leaf system.

For the next several weeks, I went around picking
stuff up and staring at it, imagining that I could
somehow see into its internal structure, hefting it
around, feeling the textures, the smell, ect., it an
effort to "grok" all kinds of things, not in any sense
of imagining that I COULD actually miraculously see in
the Xray range, but as a very pleasurable exercise in
extending the integration of perceptual and cognitive,
and, as experiencing myself extending beyond the
discrete boundaries of skin, into the system of
relationships that made "me" possible.

I had never, BTW, used any kind of mind-altering drugs
up to that point - except for caffiene, nicotine,
alcohol.  My later couple of years of extensive
experimentation with mariuana and other psychodelics
was largely aimed at refining that function and
getting past all the mental screens and filters,
reworking them into something more objective than the
simple inherited memes of childhood.  I could be
wrong, but I am convinced that most people are still
stuck on "surfaces."  

The extrema of this come in areas like interpersonal
relationships, in which people learn how to "be" what
other people want, developing a persona that fits
either what some lover, parent, etc., wants to see, or
following some extreme rule-based or
rule+fashion-based program.  Such people are so
blocked in seeing what they are, in part because it
never occurs to them that there IS any alternative,
that they find real emotional interaction
incomprehensible and/or terrifying.  So they legislate
away anything that challenges their myopic
2-dimensional perspective.  And, mostly they elect the
people to power who are best at maintaining "face."  

(The Chinese, of course, base a whole culture on
"face," i.e., lies, power, deception.  Try telling
truth to power in China.  So, there is hope for our
culture at least - altho, given the right inputs,
China, with a much worse case of the problem, might
actually be able to better isolate it and turn it
around radically.  I'm working on that one.)

Realizing this, I began to program myself to take the
opposite approach.  For several years, whatever
fashion or social norms demanded, I would try to
eliminate from my behavior and mental focus.  (I
suspect that many people thought I was extremely weird
during that phase.)  

I had been programmed by my neurotic religious
fundamentalist parents to avoid "evil thoughts," and
this extended of course to the sin of gazing at a
woman with sexual desire.  Once, when I must have been
about 10, I was at Sunday School when this whole
little clique of girls came giggling into the room,
and, as on some pre-arranged signal, all grabbed the
bottom edges of their dresses and pulled them up to
their chins, like a Lolitan Can Can line.  Underneath,
they were all wearing shorts, for some athletic event
later, but I didn't know that.  I literally almost
fainted in shock, the room spinning around me, my
heart pounding, nausea, etc.

So, I began the habit of reacting to any feeling that
I needed to avert my eyes, to doing just the opposite,
getting a lot of angry looks in the process from women
as I studied their crotches or breasts - or faces. 
(Four billion years of evolution looks awfully damned
good from here...)

Philosophically, in parallel, I developed the habit of
thinking the unthinkable.  If some conclusion were
wrong, then I should be able to identify WHY, not just
slam down the mental shutters against considering it. 
Child-rape is bad?  Well, let's just assume the
negative, imagine exactly what that would be like,
whatever kinky pleasures might be involved, and then
ask, is it really bad or not?  What contradictions
emerge from that assumption?  (I leave that exercise
to the reader.)  Suicide is scary.  So, seriously
consider suicide at least once a day.

The result, after quite a few years of sometimes scary
or miserable experiences, was that I developed what
seems to be an extraordinary basic confidence in
myself as a sentient being.  I don't claim to be a
genius - and what would any such relative present day
measure matter when we develop our successors, anyway,
comes the singularity? - but I can ultimately
understand any particular thing that I need to, I'm
reasonably convinced, altho not necesarilly as quickly
as I need to.  And I have NO need to refer to
authority of ANY kind as an unquestioned source of
truth.

Agreed.  So long as it's *WORK* and not welfare/unemployment.
And your country will be best off if the people want to work,
and at whatever wages they can get.

Please try harder to be sensible.  I am old and cantankerous
and am interested only in serious progress towards the truth.
No one in your silly scenario has any incentive to say what
he did.

If you do study the process of wealth creation, I maintain,
then you'll see that if under-developed countries send us
scads of goods at low prices, then this *must* be wealth
producing for us if our people are flexible.  This means
flipping burgers for a while, if necessary, but continuing,
*as always* to look out for the best opportunity.

One thing that would help in the U.S. is to have less 
government regulation, so that hiring and firing were
easier, and no one had to worry about Big Brother
looking over their shoulder.  It would help also if
the character of the American people was more resilient,
and they weren't so damned obsessed with *security*.

Security should come from one's savings and from one's
relatives, not from stupid anti-production guarantees
from one's employer.  It would mean than fewer people
would get fired.  Like in 1830, the boss might come in
one day and say, "You are not working out. Either leave
or take a $15 per hour pay cut."  Presumably the boss
also goes over to the next worker and says, "you *are*
working out here, I don't want to lose you, here is a
$10 pay hike".

Wouldn't *my* scenario be what you would expect in
a Darwinian economy?  Do you *really* understand how
competition makes my scenario plausible?  And can you
think of a more productive, wealth-creating environment?

I have no problem with that, since it's in alignment with
my instincts, and I can explain my instincts as evolutionarily
derived and foster the relative success of my group, and
(for the cultural component thereof) ditto.  In other words, 
groups which have people in them like us---everything else
being equal---survive better.

Or unless it is deemed safe from a cultural point of view
to allow them to immigrate.

Absolutely.  Your and my only differences appear to be about
the actual mechanisms involved, and what the results will be
of allowing the free market to work.  On the plus side, it's
a  rule with very few exceptions that everyone is better off 
when total freedom (up to the usual limits) exists, and that
definitely includes economic freedom.

But the "economic freedom" to allow a lot of third-world
types into your country (e.g., the present Moslem takeover
of Europe) should not include destroying the culture that
built your country.  On the other hand, imposing trade
barriers just because Japanese, say, can build something
cheaper is a loser in the long run.  You keep up that kind
of thinking, and the rest of the world eventually leaves
you in the dust.

Lee,
       As the situation is at least debatable I prefer to give you my one 
best reference and let you come to your own conclusions.  You will find an 
excellent article or article in the following site.
http://www.mises.org/articles.asp
       In addition if you read Thomas Friedman's book Lexus and the Olive 
Tree you will find other discussion.
       However, yes, I am dead serious about the flow of internatioal capital 
in and out of the US.  As an example it has been said that it is the foreign 
purchase of our government bonds that finances our deficit spending.  Dire 
predictions have been made about what would happen if those foreigners cashing in 
those bonds as they came due and taking their money home.
       Jeff wrote to discuss our economic situation and sounded as if he 
wanted to pass some laws to correct our situation whatever that is.  I don't think 
you will convince many capitalists that we need any more laws.
       The primary problem we face as capitalists is that the left wing wants 
the government to organize us so that we all work for the "common good."  I 
don't think you could get a single congregation of Southern Baptists to agree 
on what the "common good" is or how to translate that idea into practice -- and 
if you atttempt to get the entire country to agree your problem only gets 
worse.  That was the role of Hitler, Mussolini, Lenin and Stalin to determine 
what the common good was.
       Part of the brilliance of Capitalism is that every business leader or 
owner in the country could be a committed monopolist or royalist for that 
matter and it would make no difference if the law is properly administered.
       People often discuss Enron but please note it was private folks that 
caught them and to date have done much or all of the punishing.  Arthur 
Anderson is no more.  If Enron survived it is only as a shell of its former self.
       Several other companies also went down the tubes by a similar process. 
 Incidently at the time my accounting prof assigned me another of the high 
flyers to analyse as a possible investment.  My assignment was to culminate in a 
paper I was to write analyzing the company.  I got three annual reports and 
read them before beginning to apply common accounting analysis procedures.
       I began my paper by stating that I would report on a regular 
accounting analysis so he could grade my knowledge of accounting but if this were the 
real world the I had found a "show stopper" before beginning in depth analysis 
-- i.e., a straightforward reading of the three annual reports plainly showed 
the company was either lying, hiding data or both.  They would never get a 
penny of my investment money.  He graded my analysis.  When he handed the paper 
back he grinned and nodded yes over my first sentence.

Yes---that's my point, right?  I'm learning from this thread
already, mostly due to me, however.  Okay, so what about this:
nobody moves their operations to India or wherever if there
are people around here who will do the work at the market
rate.  Now if the alternative were starvation (it never is
in Socialist America) the marketplace would smoothly determine
the (lower) wage for something about to be outsourced, and it
would stay right here.  Only if Americans could make *more*
money, ideally, doing something else, should the jobs move.

If the latter is ever the case, namely that there really
are literally too few people here for some tasks, then by
God it is good that foreigners will trade with us and do
the work.

Could you explain more how this happened?  There has to be
a reason why GM would find itself moving from Socialist
America to even more Socialist Canada.  So far as I can see,
you have not explained the underlying reasons (or I didn't 
get it).

Those who do protectionism only hurt *themselves*.  Yes!  It is so.

Say the J in country J won't buy our beef and pay more to have
it produced locally.  Who is hurt?  Us a little, and them a lot!
More J people end up working to make expensive and poor quality
beef when they could---if they would just be smart and let the
marketplace tell them what to do---be more productively employed
making radios or VCRs or whatever they do best.

Does what I am saying make sense?

Listen, they are NOWHERE near as bad as Jay Gould, Fisk, and
the rest of the 19th century swindlers.  Yet we survived that,
and even prospered.  Why?  Because for every one of them,
there was also a Commodore Vanderbilt and a Morgan.  The
bad guys do destroy wealth, and the Exxon types did too, but
it's not a big fraction of GNP.

I wish to amend that statement to add the qualification
"so long as Americans are willing to work rather than starve,
and so long as they're not voting themselves a dole."

Yes, but the unemployment rate was 25% in the Depression.
It's like 6% now, and a lot of those people have little
incentive to look for a job since they are on unemployment.
If you wish to understand economics, as so many people before
me have pointed out, look to people's incentives.

The problem is not with your rational purchase, which
was selfish and commendable; the problem is with being
broke.  Why is one broke?  Either one is living beyond
one's means, or one refusing low paying jobs in the hopes
that the outlook for his profession will improve.  I can
talk: I lived a whole year in my car when I was not
employable, and six years in a tiny van, all the time
saving money.

It could be better, but we must not wish for it to go
back to the late nineties when everyone merely *thought*
things were great.  In truth, wealth was being destroyed
at a colossal rate.  Bubbles are bad, and I bet the U.S.
gradually improves from where it is, but not a lot.

I can tell you in two words what happened to Argentina, why
it was the 10th biggest economy in the *world* in 1900 and
how it became a basket case:  Juan Peron

'Twas authoritarian socialism what killed the beast.

Here's a crazy idea: make transparency proportional to authority.
Elected representatives have absolutely no privacy, save for
bathroom breaks. You don't have to worry about shady deals because
there's a camera crew following them every second of every day.
Every person they speak to is the business of the nation; we have a
right to know *exactly* what they're doing with their power.

This would make the jobs of senators, ministers and presidents extremely
unattractive to most people. Only those who have nothing to hide will
want or be able to do it.

Two problems:

a) There's no way in hell the current [1] administration would vote this
in. Too many skeletons in the cupboard.

b) Transparency is useless without an attentive media to chase up the
wrongdoings. [2]

There are loopholes and edge cases (e.g. secret meetings still need to
be secret), but the majority of representatives have no legitimate use
for privacy. If they wanted a private life, they shouldn't have got a
public job.

Douglas Adams said it best: "It is a well-known fact that those people
who must want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do
it... anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should
on no account be allowed to do the job."

[1] I'm not talking about the USA; *no* government would
want this. [3]

[2] Now I am talking about the USA.

[3] Kind of kills the whole idea really...

And an excellent summation.

"....and you do value the freedom and well being of all humans, right?"

What other items should be on the list for the taboo trade-off 
treatment?  I wonder how it would affect Cryonics, for example.

But the traditionalists, who declined to propagate their genes, left
powerful memes, as your post demonstrates (since you remember and share
news of them). Such meme remnants might yet serve as the seed for a new
memetic attractor. (I first learned of the Skoptsy sect when I was 14 and
read Alfred Bester's extrapolation of their cult in THE STARS MY

Do you think that something different has recently
happened?

What *has* "recently" happened, as in the last century
or so, according to what I know, is that the behavior
of the principals in the market has reformed admirably,
mainly due, perhaps, to (1) a more honest judiciary
with better public exposure that sends swindler's
to prison (2) gradually greater experience and
knowledge distributed by education, so that people
are less naive when entering markets than they once
were.

Oh, it's never been as accountable as now.  I heartily
recommend that everyone read the unbelievably great
"The Scarlet Woman of Wall Street", the most hilarious,
and well-written account of the beginnings of Wall Street.
I have not read such a simultaneously informative and
entertaining book in years.

I used to worry about that too.  And then my economics guru (my friend
who I consult about all thinks economic) told me to stop worrying.

Him:  "Just what are they going to *spend* the cash 
      (that they get out of those bonds on), Lee?"

Me:   "I dunno. Hmm."

Him;  "They'll invest it somewhere.  And where, pray tell, has
      proven to be the best place to invest the loot, hmm?"

Me:   "I dunno."  (You can't really have much of a conversation
      with Mark R. about economics.)

Him:  "The U.S., pal.  They *can't* withdraw it all!  Understand:
      we kept sending them little bits of paper while they sent
      us industrial goods by the boatload.  Was that fair?"

Me:   "No, and?"

Him:  "And so it got too expensive for us to keep sending them
      all that paper with swiggles on it, and so we have taken
      to sending them bits---ones and zeros---over the
      communications links, and they turn around and invest the
      ones and zeros back here, and then send us *more* goods to
      cover the cost of the investments."

Me:   "Ha, ha.  So how does this even get better?"

Him:  "Do you know what the Japanese economy is like?"

Me:   "No"

Him:  "Well, you wouldn't believe what a basket case....(etc)"

So that's how I stopped worrying about trade balances,
deficits, job "losses", etc.

Oddly enough, this is pretty much the way many Aussie exporters (especially
of meat and grain) feel about the US, I understand; many goods are either
locked out or subject to absurd tariffs. Meanwhile, we hear preachments
about the global economy from these alleged freemarketers.

By removal of the schemata from my mind I meant more of a removal of such
considerations from my ethical models, rather from everyday interactions
with other people (that could be quite a problem in the maintenance of
relationships).

Inane corporate drivel.  It's agreed that if a company makes money in 
one country they should abide by the rules of that country.  Just 
because you can purchase slave-labour in burma doesn't mean that all 
people should allow themselves to be enslaved.  Supporting slave-labour 
or poverty-labour in other countries is extremely inhumane and our 
government inasmuch as it has any purpose at all, should be simply to 
make sure that our people do not become enslaved or nearly-enslaved.

Very funny?  Then explain what's wrong with the model
(it does work in Silicon Valley).  I claim it works
everywhere that there is neither an oversupply of
labor nor capital (i.e. equilibrium has been reached).

Historically, there indeed has often been an oversupply
of labor and an undersupply of entrepreneurs---and whose
fault is that?

Perhaps we call workers in short supply "consultants".
What is the essential difference?

I couldn't stop laughing myself.  Nevertheless, I managed to google through
my giggles to come up with some insights into the working conditions in the
1800s and somewhat beyond:

"... From the mid-1800s to the early 1900s, many young children in America
worked long hours in a variety of dangerous environments, such as
manufacturing and mining. Not only did they miss the opportunity to go to
school and receive an education, but some even lost their health and their
lives. It was because of these tragedies that U.S. child labor laws came
into effect.":

http://www.njsbf.com/njsbf/student/eagle/spring01-1.cfm

"With heavy labor came long hours and rarely did the pay increase despite
the grueling hours and often dangerous working environments. Over time,
Irish Americans banded together to organize unions and improve the working
conditions of all laborers. In 1879, Terence Powderly, a son of Irish
immigrants, was elected head of the Knights of Labor, a national association
of labor unions. Under his stewardship, it grew to include more than 700,000
members....
With the increase in numbers, the unions' ability to facilitate strikes and
boycotts posed a real threat to industries. Soon negotiations were taking
place and the working conditions for U.S. laborers began to improve
dramatically.":

http://www.immigration.net/lawyers/colum_article/articles/2001,0830-AILF.shtm

"The mistreatment of child workers is not just a foreign problem. Since
colonial times, the U.S. has counted on children to lend a helping hand in
its fields and factories. In the 1800s, children as young as 7 worked in
textile mills for 12 hours a day. Bad behavior sent a child straight to the
'whipping room' for punishment.

In 1938 a federal law was passed that set child-labor guidelines, limiting
work hours for kids and requiring safe conditions."

http://www.timeforkids.com/TFK/magazines/story/0,6277,94603,00.html

"Throughout the 1800s, women began to enter industry in large numbers. Their
jobs were primarily sex-segregated with most working in textiles,
manufacturing, and domestic services. These women worked in extremely
unhealthy, dangerous conditions for wages even worse than for their male
counterparts. In this climate, it was women who bore the triple burden of
exploitation by the factory owners, of having no voice in the government,
and of the attacks by many male workers and sexist unions that feared the
competition women represented. It was Lucy Parsons, the radical multi-racial
anarcho-feminist, who summed up the condition of women in the six simple
words: "'We are the slaves of slaves.'" :

http://www-tech.mit.edu/V122/N10/col10brice.10c.html

You get the picture.  There's a *ton* of information about working
conditions (or working restrictions) in the USA during the 19th century.  Go
ahead - anybody - defend them if you can.

I say, Lee, what you wrote (in the sentence that began: "Like in 1830, the
boss might come in one day and say...") put you in Wishfulthinkingland
(cousin of Neverneverland), and maybe Peter Pan can fly there, as well ...
but your example doesn't.

A fault is a fault is a fault? and a fault by any other name smells just as
foul:

Yes, the free market is in direct proportion to the degree of
organization within a particular industry or profession or most
importantly a social or economic class or income level. 

Farmers are quite organized and have powerful lobbies. Thus they can
stifle foreign compeition.

 What every American wants is have all the OTHER Americans in OTHER
industries face global competition in order to have better products to
buy at lower costs for themselves, while at the same time NOT have to
have foreign competition in their own industry.

(You have to log in to see the whole paper.  Enter
"anonymous" for the userid and "asdf" or anything
for the password.

Here are the first few paragraphs after the abstract.  If
this doesn't acidly comment on our recent Robert-centered
discussion, I don't know what does.


  The Psychology of the Unthinkable: 
  Taboo Trade-Offs, Forbidden Base Rates, and Heretical Counterfactuals

  Philip E. Tetlock, Orie V. Kristel, S. Beth Elson, Melanie C. Green, and
  Jennifer Lerner.  The Ohio State University and Carnegie Mellon University

    Research on social cognition ultimately rests on functionalist
    assumptions about what people are trying to accomplish when they
    judge events or make choices. The most influential of these
    assumptions have been the intuitive scientist and the intuitive
    economist. The former tradition depicts people whose central
    objective is to understand underlying patterns of causality, thereby
    conferring some advantage in anticipating life-enhancing or
    threatening events (cf. Kelley, 1967). The latter tradition depicts
    people as decision-makers whose overriding goal is to select
    utility-maximizing options from available choice sets (Becker, 1981;
    Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). Although theorists often disagree sharply
    over how well people live up to the high professional ideals of
    science or economics (Mellers, Schwartz, & Cooke, 1998), theorists
    agree in placing a normative premium on intellectual flexibility and
    agility. Good intuitive scientists and economists look for the most
    useful cues in the environment for generating accurate predictions
    and making satisfying decisions and quickly abandon hypotheses that
    do not "pan out."  Rigidity is maladaptive within both frameworks.

    This article explores the empirical implications of an
    under-explored starting point for inquiry: the notion that, in many
    contexts, people are striving to achieve neither epistemic nor
    utilitarian goals,  but rather--as prominent historical sociologists
    have argued (Bell, 1974)--are struggling to protect sacred values
    from secular encroachments by increasingly powerful societal trends
    toward market capitalism (and the attendant pressure to render
    everything fungible) and scientific naturalism (and the attendant
    pressure to pursue inquiry wherever it logically leads).
    
    A sacred value can be defined as any value that a moral community
    implicitly or explicitly treats as possessing infinite or
    transcendental significance that precludes comparisons, trade-offs,
    or indeed any other mingling with bounded or secular values.   When
    sacred values are under assault, the apposite functionalist metaphor
    quickly becomes the intuitive moralist/theologian.  Sacred values
    are often ultimately religious in character but they need not have
    divine sanction (hence our hybrid designation of the functionalist
    metaphor as moralist/theologian).  Sacred values can range from
    fundamentalists' faith in God to the liberal/social democratic dogma
    of racial equality to the radical libertarian commitment to the
    autonomy of the individual.  Although the theoretical framework
    proposed here does not differentiate sacred values with or without
    divine mandate, many writers -- from Samuel Johnson to Fyodor
    Dostoyevsky to T.S. Eliot -- have drawn sharp distinctions here, and
    have even suggested that only sacred values anchored in faith in God
    can sustain genuine moral outrage and cleansing. To paraphrase
    Dostoyevsky, if there were no God, no act -- not even cannibalism --
    would be forbidden. which depicts people engaged in a continual
    struggle to protect their private selves and public identities from
    moral contamination by impure thoughts and deeds (Belk et al.,
    1989).  
    
    The most emphatic ways to distance oneself from normative
    transgressions are by:  (1) expressing moral outrage---a composite
    psychological state that subsumes cognitive reactions (harsh
    character attributions to those who endorse the proscribed thoughts
    and even to those who do not endorse, but do tolerate, this way of
    thinking in others), affective reactions (anger and contempt for
    those who endorse the proscribed thoughts), and behavioral reactions
    (support for ostracizing and punishing deviant thinkers); (2)
    engaging in moral cleansing that reaffirms core values and loyalties
    by acting in ways that shore up those aspects of the moral order
    that have been undercut by the transgression.  Within this
    framework, rigidity, accompanied by righteous indignation and by
    blanket refusal even to contemplate certain thoughts, can be
    commendable  -- indeed, it is essential for resolutely reasserting
    the identification of self with the collective moral order (cf.
    Durkheim, 1925/1976).  What looks irrationally obdurate within the
    intuitive-scientist and economist research programs can often be
    plausibly construed as the principled defense of sacred values
    within the moralist/theologian research program (Tetlock, 1999).

    This article identifies three types of normative proscriptions--
    taboo trade-offs, forbidden base rates, and heretical
    counterfactuals--that people consciously or unconsciously impose on
    cognitive processes that are fundamental to rationality in the
    intuitive scientist and economist traditions. Here we consider each
    proscription in turn.

Yeah, here is the lead paragraph from that: 
 
   Hollywood fantasy?  Perhaps, but job stress is a
   leading cause of illness, depression and work
   place violence in America today and is increasing,
   experts say.

As compared to what?  As compared to when?  The 20th century
wasn't any picnic, nor was the 19th.  And if you want to
make yourself sick, read carefully about ancient times.

"Increasing".  Sure, maybe over the last three years as many
people learned the truth about how much money they were making
and how "great" everything was in the bubble.

The fault I spoke of above can be evenly divided between
two groups.  The first is "workers" who have natural human
resentment of achievement and who in addition have fallen
for propaganda directed at management and entrepreneurs.
The second is all the Marxists and left-leaning elements
of society that teach that being a business person or 
entrepreneur is giving in to "them" and trying to be like
"them".  Subtly or not so subtly, many working class people
grow up practically thinking themselves to be a kind of 
traitor should they think of starting their own business.

Instead of starting businesses, the goal of both these
groups the last 150 years has been to "organize", and
try to deprive entrepreneurs of their property:  most
crucially, why don't "workers" who are often in oversupply
historically, go start their own businesses?  Mostly due
to the aforesaid propaganda: it serves leftist politicians
and theoreticians to keep such ideas out of the heads of

 From Tetlock, P.E. (1999). Coping with trade-offs: Psychological 
constraints and political implications. In S. Lupia, M. McCubbins, & S. 
Popkin (eds.), Political reasoning and choice. Berkeley: University of 
California Press:

"The value pluralism model also warns us not to assume that explicit 
trade-off reasoning is always cognitively or morally superior to 
categorical rejection of trade-offs.  It is not difficult to identify 
historical contexts within which contemporary sympathies overwhelmingly 
favor those factions that engaged in vociferous trade-off denial: 
Churchillian opponents of British appeasement of Nazi Germany in the 
1930's who denounced Chamberlains effort to strike a subtle balance 
between deterrence and reassurance (Tetlock & Tyler, 1996) and 
abolitionists in the slavery debates of antebellum America who denounced 
moderates who sought integratively complex compromises that would pressure 
the Union, avert war and indefinitely preserve slavery in certain states 
(Tetlock, Armor, &  Peterson, 1994).  It is also not difficult to identify 
historical contexts within which contemporary observers deplore one or 
both of the values that complex trade-off reasoners attempted to balance 
against each other.  Pragmatic Nazis were quick to recognize a gruesome 
trade-off between their goals of mobilizing military resources to win the 
war and devoting resources to the extermination of Jews.  There is nothing 
intrinsically meritorious about trade-off reasoning."

My argument was not that Robert was posing a taboo tradeoff, but that he 
was posing a false tradeoff - genocide would have no beneficial 
consequences, despite the attempt to frame it as a taboo tradeoff which 
rationalism requires considering.

I don't think outrage should always be impermissible.  I think outrage can 
always be questioned.  Sometimes outrage survives questioning and the 
proposal of random acts of genocide is one of those cases.  I acknowledge 
that I could be wrong in the outrage or even the judgment of 
undesirability, but the judgment of undesirability and the associated 
outrage represent my best guesses.  What I object to is not that Robert 
analyzed the issue, but that he got the analysis wildly wrong.  It is mere 
rationalism to assume that any issue worth analyzing, or any issue that 
provokes deep emotional reactions, must have a complex, weighty, 
counterintuitive answer with many pros and cons where the conclusion 
ultimately negates all the emotional reactions involved.  Sometimes 
rationalists arrive at complex taboo-violating analyses of what seem like 
simple issues, but it is a profound error to generalize and start thinking 
that whoever offers the most complex analysis and violates the most 
taboos, sounds the most rational.

The undesirability of genocide is a very complex issue in terms of ethics 
under uncertainty and the evolutionary psychology of opposing tribes, but 
what the analysis ends up saying only affirms the verdict of history and, 
yes, the 21st-century taboo: the power of genocide to improve the human 
condition is far less than what is frequently imagined.  Robert's proposal 
is not a taboo tradeoff, it is a false tradeoff.

I believe that a hospital should not spend a million dollars to save the 
life of a five-year-old child, because if you take a million dollars away 
from a hospital, people are going to die.  I would applaud the moral 
courage of a hospital administrator who made that decision, and the 
willingness to confront taboo tradeoffs and risk community outrage to make 
the right choice.  It doesn't mean that I'll be any less outraged if you 
propose killing a five-year-old child to save a dollar, and this is 
roughly what I think Robert did.

It is not at all true that only large companies are able to off-shore some of 
their work.  I work for a company of < 100 people who uses some off-shore 
labor on a contract basis occassionally.  The off-shore labor is cheaper for 
the tasks needed (in this case, much of the manual portion of QA testing).  
The skill basis of off-shore workers is rising faster than their 
compensation.  So any company looking to remain competitive must consider 
such options.

It is amusing when supposed capitalist argue that it is greedy and 
shortsighted to find the lowest costs for materials and labor that one can to 
produce the products and services.   It is even more ironically amusing when 
pro-globalization folks decry competition in labor and goods from other 
countries.   It looks as if some folks are only fair-weather friends of open 
markets, capitalism and globalization.    

There is nothing that does or should guarantee you or I a job at or near the 
same rate as we have today or had two years ago for the same or nearly the 
same work.  This is inherent in a period of accelerated change and rapidly 
advancing technology.   We can discuss whether there should be more 
guarantees and safety nets but it is hypocritical as hell to decry these 
outcomes for ourselves while expecting other people around the world to grin 
an bear it for their own good.   Who are we trying to kid?

Pretext????  It is no "pretext" for an awful lot of people right now.   
"Squeeze from taxpayers"???  The unemployed paid the unemployment taxes while 
they were working!   I have paid mine up for an awful lot of years, far more 
than I could possibly consume if unemployed these days.  

Are we having funny slapping around hard-assed positions without due

And you call yourself an "extropian"?  You would limit using technology to do 
work more efficiently and at lower cost just because it might inconvenience 
people who did not see it coming and have not yet adapted?    Are you sure 
this is in keeping with your professed principals?

Damien,
       When I was a boy there was an old saying I used to hear now and again. 
 It was "two wrongs don't make a right."
       I was not defending the Aussie record on free trade nor the American 
one.  I was asking how can we call it free trade when it is not free on both 
sides.  
       As an American I look at our imbalance in trade and find that the 
countries selling to us don't allow us to sell in their countries.  Then I hear 
our economists defend what is going on in the name of free trade.  So I ask, 
what free trade?
       As to the specific example you gave on meat and grain.  I don't know 
the facts of my own knowledge but I do know this: we have about 270 or 280 
million people in this country.  I am sure we can find some that are just as 
venial as any you have in other countries.
       But my frustration is not with foreigners.  My frustration is that I 
have never heard and American economist address the issue of free trade with 
massive restrictions head on.

Actually this is a pretty good idea: to stop outsourcing, just find
the  particular routers that send messages to India, then mess them
up! I suggest bashing them with some sort of blunt object.  One of
those quaint wooden shoes they wear in Holland would probably do the
trick.....

Lee,
       I am not going to address any specific issue you raised.  I don't have 
all the answers and I am just as mystified as most on this thread.
       I believe my discussion of this thread began with the two predictions 
of first the Singularity and second a new Renaissance.
       In particular both of those seem to be powered by the mobilization of 
under utilized GT (top 5% of the Bell Curve for Intelligence)  I gave some of 
my sources for believing that.
       I see the general discussion we have had as beneficial for this 
reason.  There is a great deal of evidence that the GT are increasingly being 
recruited to operate and manage the laboratories, workshops and boardrooms of our 
high tech economy.  Put in simple terms those GT are us.
       Further, there is some observations that the GT are having an 
increasing number of boardroom wars as they wrest control of corporations from the old 
money.  I can't document where I read that.  
       But increasingly it is the class of people you see around you at this 
site that are making the leadership decisions in our society.  Look at Bill 
Clinton (include the group of associates he has) and tell me what he is but an 
example of a GT that found a way to accumulate power.  I am not taking sides on 
his philosophy just pointing out that he is a highly intelligent man that 
gained power because others needed someone like him -- so he took over.  Arnold 
S. seems to be another GT gaining power and wealth.  Some will think he is a 
simple muscle head but I say reserve your opinion until you dig out his academic 
record.  On a lesser plane the same is happening all around us.  As far back 
as the 60s I was working for inherited money that was trying to operate a 
small manufacturing business without the intelligence to do so.  Eventually they 
were forced out of the business world.
       Returning to the world economy my guess is that we are going into at 
least a Renaissance and yes there will be turmoil.  Jobs and markets will be 
unsettled for a long time to come.  But it looks like the GT are going to 
replace a lot of the old crowd just as the merchants and scholars replaced the 
nobility in the last Renaissance.
       Then there is the question of the Singularity and the effect of AI -- 
but my head hurts thinking about it.

### But I am different. I really want global competition for everybody,
including myself, because I know this will make us all rich, and I also
think this is the right, moral thing to do, to peacefully compete, rather
than use leftist, class warfare sophistry to justify the use of force to
stop e.g, me from hiring an Indian transcriptionist and giving my patients a
better value for their money.

This why I am for abolition of the licensure requirements for physicians in
the US, even though I know that in the short term this could reduce my
income. Let the Indian, Canadian, German and other doctors come here to
compete, or even give consultations, read scans and do surgery by
telepresence. This will make health care cheaper, and better, without a
single dollar taken from working people in taxes.

### The ones who rail against business the worst are also the most
incompetent at getting things done - they couldn't organize their way out of
a paper bag, and carping about the success of others as "depriving them" of
work and income is just about the only thing they do well. There are few
people who have both the brains and the guts to strike out on their own, so
it's no surprise that they reap higher rewards sometimes.

And then the commissars come over to take the money you "stole" from the
masses.

Thanks!  The very first article there is called

     Concerning the Export of Capital

and threw a lot of light on the subject.

Those curious about an economic explanation
of these issues can't do better than to 
consult that.

No, Samantha, all these positions---on each side---are being
carefully considered by some people on each side.  Your
invective is wasted  ;-)

Yes, for many people, Rafal used exactly the right word: pretext.
For many others, of course, that is not the right word.  So read
his sentence carefully before firing back.

You wrote

> The unemployed paid the unemployment taxes while 
> they were working!

Yes, but they had no *choice*.  For many, like you, had they
had the freedom to invest that money, and did so, they would
be vastly better off.  But "freedom" is not a high consideration
in many socialist mind-sets.

> I have paid mine up for an awful lot of years, far more
> than I could possibly consume if unemployed these days.  

Well, if you STAYED unemployed long enough, you obviously
could.  See how the incentives are wrecked?  Right now, the
money is not legally yours.  So if you were unemployed, it
would be either use it or lose it.  So the unemployed have
diminished incentive to look for work until it runs out.

Yet I do not see the other side actually grapple with the
logic my side throw out.  How often do those on your side
actually use the word "incentive"?

Lee,
       I agree with you.  Mike McGee in his book Technaissance shows that a 
period of intense growth is coming at us in a hurry.  If we take "us" to mean 
the civilized world then I don't think many people would argue with that 
prediction.  Mr. McGee to his credit does a good job of laying out how this coming 
about.  I think Mr. McGee misses the very point that THE BELL CURVE by 
Herrnstein & Murray do make.  Beginning about 1900 AD this economy has became 
increasingly high tech requiring employers to place a premium on hiring intelligent 
people.  By the 1950s this requirement had extended in to our top Universities 
-- after all they succeed by recruiting and graduating the people that 
employers require.
       This list represents a proportion of the people that fuel any 
advancement made by our civilization.  This being true we are looking at these 
questions seriously as Lee says.

### Let me try my hand at defending the indefensible.

Lots of people are bad. They wouldn't share a surplus even if this meant
others dying. In fact, in the absence of coercion, almost all people are bad
in this way, including you, Olga. Since, as I presume, you have not shared
all of your resources not crucial for survival with Sudanese slaves, you are
bad too. There are people dying out there, but you are not helping them.
And I am bad as well. The only non-bad person I know, is Eliezer, I think.

So what's wrong with being bad, if everybody is doing it, while preaching
for others to be good? Nothing. The word, as applied above, loses its
meaning. The communal-sharing, or equality-matching relational schemata
underlying the reasoning behind the injunction to share surplus and maintain
equality, are ethically meaningless, once you start building ethical systems
using logical means, based directly on volition, rather than an
unquestioning carryover of specialized social schemata, which worked well
for survival in the EEA, but now impede progress.

Progress is good. Economic progress is good, since it gives humans a better
ability to fulfill their wishes, which is the essence of doing anything at
all. Any vestigial mental quirk, such as tribalism, income-egalitarianism,
acceptance of authority,  that limits economic progress is bad, because it
destroys the coherence of our goal systems. Incoherent goal systems cannot
be satisfied. If you covet the richer human's resources, but jealously guard
your own from poorer ones, you will never move forward, and you will
interfere with the progress of others.

Economic progress must be maximized, within a coherent, volitionist ethical
framework. This might mean using moral symmetry, Rawlsian reciprocity, and a
few other heuristics which have been found to aid economic progress, while
rejecting egalitarianism, tribalism, male/female chauvinism, taboos, and
everything else that interferes with economic growth.

It is good to be rich. Therefore, anything that interferes with the growth
of the average sentient's income, is bad. It doesn't matter of you share
with others, or if you hoard. The only thing that matters is how much you
contribute to the average increase in wealth. Feelings of fairness, justice,
are wrong, if they interfere with the growth of average income of the
Rawlsian observer.

All the emotionally rousing images you quoted, for the rational thinker, are
yet another reason to support economic growth, while maintaining individual
freedom. Henry Ford did more for American children than the nameless
bureaucrats who drafted child labor laws. Once the children's parents became
rich enough, children's labor stopped being a problem. World War II did as
much for women as feminism - once women entered the labor pool, they learned
that economic competition gives them the power that comes from financial
independence. Technical progress did more for the Irish than the Irish
themselves, and certainly more than the greedy labor unions, which later all
but destroyed  the automobile industry - now most Irish are many times
richer than the Britons who oppressed them.

To point at the misery of the 19th century, and claim that it is a good
justification for laws which, as a side effect, may impede economic growth,
is wrong. It is not the laws forced by the social progressives that are
socially progressive, it was the growth of average incomes that is the
source of true progress.

The working conditions of the 19th century were wrong, because most people
were then poor, and it is wrong to be poor. Concentrate on creating wealth,
not righting wrongs, and all wrongs will right themselves.

Lots of people are bad. They wouldn't share a surplus even if this meant
others dying. In fact, in the absence of coercion, almost all people are bad
in this way, including you, Olga. Since, as I presume, you have not shared
all of your resources not crucial for survival with Sudanese slaves, you are
bad too. There are people dying out there, but you are not helping them.
And I am bad as well. The only non-bad person I know, is Eliezer, I think.

So what's wrong with being bad, if everybody is doing it, while preaching
for others to be good? Nothing. The word, as applied above, loses its
meaning. The communal-sharing, or equality-matching relational schemata
underlying the reasoning behind the injunction to share surplus and maintain
equality, are ethically meaningless, once you start building ethical systems
using logical means, based directly on volition, rather than an
unquestioning carryover of specialized social schemata, which worked well
for survival in the EEA, but now impede progress.

Progress is good. Economic progress is good, since it gives humans a better
ability to fulfill their wishes, which is the essence of doing anything at
all. Any vestigial mental quirk, such as tribalism, income-egalitarianism,
acceptance of authority,  that limits economic progress is bad, because it
destroys the coherence of our goal systems. Incoherent goal systems cannot
be satisfied. If you covet the richer human's resources, but jealously guard
your own from poorer ones, you will never move forward, and you will
interfere with the progress of others.

Economic progress must be maximized, within a coherent, volitionist ethical
framework. This might mean using moral symmetry, Rawlsian reciprocity, and a
few other heuristics which have been found to aid economic progress, while
rejecting egalitarianism, tribalism, male/female chauvinism, taboos, and
everything else that interferes with economic growth.

It is good to be rich. Therefore, anything that interferes with the growth
of the average sentient's income, is bad. It doesn't matter of you share
with others, or if you hoard. The only thing that matters is how much you
contribute to the average increase in wealth. Feelings of fairness, justice,
are wrong, if they interfere with the growth of average income of the
Rawlsian observer.

All the emotionally rousing images you quoted, for the rational thinker, are
yet another reason to support economic growth, while maintaining individual
freedom. Henry Ford did more for American children than the nameless
bureaucrats who drafted child labor laws. Once the children's parents became
rich enough, children's labor stopped being a problem. World War II did as
much for women as feminism - once women entered the labor pool, they learned
that economic competition gives them the power that comes from financial
independence. Technical progress did more for the Irish than the Irish
themselves, and certainly more than the greedy labor unions, which later all
but destroyed  the automobile industry - now most Irish are many times
richer than the Britons who oppressed them.

To point at the misery of the 19th century, and claim that it is a good
justification for laws which, as a side effect, may impede economic growth,
is wrong. It is not the laws forced by the social progressives that are
socially progressive, it was the growth of average incomes that is the
source of true progress.

The working conditions of the 19th century were wrong, because most people
were then poor, and it is wrong to be poor. Concentrate on creating wealth,
not righting wrongs, and all wrongs will right themselves.

That was exactly my point in my previous post to your example
(unfortunately, your example was "[Like in] 1830...").  I wasn't comparing
today's working conditions to past centuries' working conditions (surely, no
contest there).   We've got it much better now - and those reforms were not
won easily and were certainly not initiated out of the goodness of the
mucky-mucks' hearts.

Learned the truth ...? (I'm not sure what you mean, and maybe this point is
not worth pursuing, in any case.)

Sometimes a natural human resentment of achievement is a good thing.

Hmmm ... I suppose I'm a left-leaning "element" more than a right-leaning
element, but, so help me - not only have I never taught anyone that being a
business person or entrepreneur is giving in to "them" (?), but I've
actually *been* a business person and entrepreneur (and so have a lot of my
left-leaning ilky-inky-dinky-doo buddies).

Last 150 years, huh?  Hello, Earth to Lee. Granted, some women and former
slaves - who had hitherto not been able to own property (because they, sad
to say, *were* themselves designated as "property") - not only tried, but
succeeded in finally being able just to *own* property.  Whether some
entrepreneurs were deprived of their property as a result depended, I
suppose, on various sorts of things like whether particular entrepreneurs
(1) owned slaves or (2) were married to women, who (at long last) were able
to inherit the property from their husbands.  Some women and former slaves
did start businesses, and a few even succeeded.  But, if you use your
imagination, you can probably come up with a few scenarios of how difficult
it must have been.  While reforms at the workplace progressed slowly through
the 1800s and early 1900s, they really took off starting with the civil
rights years of the late 1950s and through the 1960s (and the civil rights
struggle gave impetus to many other "rights" that were eventually
implemented into the workplace as we know it now).

Again, I'm not certain what you mean about the propaganda, leftist
politicians and theoreticians and "the masses" of which you speak.
"Increase their own relative importance."[?]  ... I have lost my way, baa

Just checking my local cable listings, I can find at
least 5 channels that broadcast "a near-constant
stream of educational programming".  (Stretching the
definition, perhaps: for instance, I'm including
Discovery and its offshoots, The History Channel, et
cetera.)  The market is by no means unserved, though
one
could make an argument that it is *under*served...

My ethical system begins with Bertrand Russell's quote:  "Remember your
humanity and forget the rest."  Then we make progress from that point.

Any economic progress is good?  Al Capone's?  Kenneth Lay's?  Dennis
Kozlowki's?

You mention Henry Ford below.  He violated almost every "good" point you are
making above.

Fairness and justice are paramount.  "Remember your humanity and forget the

Henry Ford didn't do squat that someone else would not eventually have done

I am not against technical progress.  It is simplistic to call labor unions
"greedy" (why did labor unions start up in the first place?  were they all
were greedy?  were there any "good" labor unions"  how were working
conditions before labor unions?).

If you lived in the 19th century, is this what you would be telling to half
of the population in the USA (women), to the (mainly) Chinese laborers who
built the Transcontinental Railroad, to the slaves, to the children laboring
in the factories:  "Concentrate on creating wealth, not righting wrongs
...?"  Is this what you would be telling them?

He can't become president under the Constitution as it is currently
written. While he is old enough, he is foreign born and as such cannot
become president.

On the other hand, given that he is in California, if he becomes
immensely popular as governor there (and via the media, nationwide), if
any attmpt to amend the constitution on his behalf were to be made, he
couldn't choose a better state to live in or govern. California has the
largest congressional caucus, and therefore has a superior strategic
position, on raw numbers, to amend the Constitution. On the gripping
hand, though, I doubt that most of those districts would be controlled
by republicans...

Furthermore, to counter the claims by others that government support of
PAM is a waste of money and furthering the nanny state, if it can be
proven that the PAM is a more effective intelligence gathering
instrument than the CIA/NSA/DIA/FBI humint expenditures, then it would
present a net savings to the taxpayer and would therefore be a very
libertarian thing to do.

At the annual SIGGRAPH conference, there used to be a
large, robust SIG KIDS section, featuring actual live
kids who had done something interesting in digital
media.  As press, I spent some time interviewing these
kids and writing about what they had created.  

Then, one year the SIG KIDS area, which had been open,
like all the rest of SIGGRAPH, to the general
attendees, suddenly had a literal fence around it,
with guards.  When I asked how I could enter the area
to collect material for my article, I was told simply,
"you can't.  Under no circumstances will you or anyone
else be allowed to enter the area or speak with any of
the kids."

It turned out, on examination, that the decision to
seal off the SIG KIDS are had been made because of
concerns that some child molestor might take advantage
of the situation - this being shortly after that
little girl was molested and killed in the bathroom in
Las Vegas.  I asked if there had been any incidents to
date at SIGGRAPH that would suggest reason for
concern, and was told, no.

SIGGRAPH is a professional conference that attracts
tens of thousands of attendees from all over the
globe.  You don't get into the conference unless you
are a professional with ID, and, unless you are press
or a lecturer, etc., you pay substantial bucks as
well.  

Not to say that some child molestor might not be
tempted, but there are much softer targets, I'm
certain, than SIGGRAPH, where there was constant close
adult supervision well before the fence was erected. 
The kids participating did not generally come from
some cloistered high-security paradise, either.  Prior
to and after SIGGRAPH, I'm sure that they walked
unsupervised around their neighborhoods and the local
malls, etc., where there would be long periods of time
when NO adult who knew them would be around.  

These were not generally stupid kids, either, so there
was less vulnerability in that respect, and, in fact,
we know that most molestation happens at home and by
parents, relatives or people known and trusted by the
parents.  The Las Vegas incident was the bolt of
lightning out of a clear blue sky, a very rare
occurence.

When I presented this to an otherwise sane friend of
mine, however, who was somewhat involved with SIGGRAPH
decision making, her response was to immediately
question my motives.  Even though she knew that I had
had years of experience working with kids in schools
and home schooling settings, and that the focus of
many of my articles was on the integration of
computers with education, the fact that I would
question these security arrangements convinced her
that I must be secretly planning some dastardly deed. 

I asked her how she could possibly justify the
security arrangements, in terms of cost/benefit.  Her
response was to fly into a rage, ~"I'm not going to
watch MY GRAND DAUGHTER raped and murdered in some
bathroom.  The security at SIGGRAPH even now is
minimal at best and should be increased!  EVERY person
who has anything at all to do with any child anywhere
should have a complete background check first.  (And
if you disagree, then you must be a secret molestor.)"

I wondered if the clerk at the local 7/11 who saw kids
on a daily basis buying snacks after school had a
complete background check first, or the paper delivery
man, or the gardener.  Maybe we should all be locked
up, given that meeting children at the library, the
mall, the theater, etc., is inevitable, until every
adult has had a thorough background check. Or, as in
the SIGGRAPH model, maybe we should just lock up all
the kids...

I tried to point out that perfect safety would
literally be infinitely expensive, and putting every
cent into that kind of security would mean nothing for
medicine, medical research, safer cars.  I.e., the
cost of such draconian policies in practice would be
MORE deaths of children - a LOT more, but any question
of balance was again invariably met with a question of
motive.

On a related note, a huge number of day care centers
reportedly went out of business as a consequence of
drastic increased in insurance rates after the
McMartin Preschool incident, and most people today
believe that the McMartin's were convicted.  In fact,
they were all acquited, and the ultimate resolution of
the case pointed unequivocably to the planting of
suggestions and false memories by the state
psychologist.  None of the underground tunnels in
which Satanic rituals had allegedly been conducted
were ever discovered, even though the school grounds
were thoroughly excavated, etc.  Nonetheless, the
general perception and the hysteria that followed
resulted in huge insurance hikes and also the
prosecutions of dozens of innocent people in similar
cases all over the U.S.

The next year that SIGGRAPH was in L.A., there was no
SIG KIDS section.  And no raped, murdered children
there either, to be fair.  How many of the kids who
might have been there and missed out on the experience
and the development of useful life skills that kept
them alive later on in life has not been evaluated, of
course.

.... Something 
is sacred when it is absolute and involable, and the
mere thought of 
trading it off for some secular value is abhorrent.
Different 
societies have different sacredness, but all societies
have it. In 
practice we always have to do trade-offs between
values. As an 
example, how much do we want to pay for road safety?
If human lives 
were infinitely valuable to us, we would gladly pay
all money we 
could for safer roads. But we actually chose (or have
someone chose 
for us) a finite amount. But actually being tempted or
forced to 
make these compromises makes us uncomfortable, and
various escape 
and coping mechanisms (such as 'moral cleansing' where
people do 
something they consider moral to balance the trade -
we feel 
contaminated by trading in the sacred). These taboo
tradeoffs cause 
strong moral outrage, especially among observers. It
is seen as 
unacceptable to trade something sacred for secular, or
even to 
consider it.

The comments below prompt me to ask some more of my irritating questions,
apologies in advance.

It is becoming increasingly unclear to me that what it is to be an extropian
is the same for every extropian. In fact, I think we may hold disjoint sets
of values, and disjoint definitions, in many cases. ie: We may be using the
same word, but in fact have no common ground. I am brought to this by a long
history of reading the list, and in particular by the comment below from
Rafal, and by Robert's assertion that maximising complexity is his guiding
principle in being an extropian.

So my questions is this:
1 - What do you consider to be extropian, or what do you believe it is to be
an extropian?
2 - Do you consider yourself to be an extropian?
3 - If not, why not? Do you hold values which you believe are in conflict
with Extropy? Or is it purely for "I'm a tough non-joiner kinda dude(tte)"
reasons? Or perhaps for PR reasons?

My (personal) answer to the questions above:
1 - I consider the extropian principles to embody what it is to be an
extropian. I believe that they don't have a set of more basic principles
underlying them; they stand as axiomatic. So, I don't feel that a value such
as "maximise complexity" fits as an extropian underpinning. (Actually, I see
"maximise complexity" as being a misconflation of the idea of "extropy is
the opposite of the physics concept of entropy" with what I see as the real
definition of extropy, which is the use of the extropian principles, and
only appeals to the physics concept for colour & movement).

2 - Pretty close to it, but I'm still having trouble comitting, even after
all these years. I guess I'm just a tough, non-joiner kinda dude. Also, the
label "Extropian" makes people immediately think it's some kind of
californian cult (which are after all quite famous around the world), and
when you say "Well, it is from California, but it's not a cult, really",
people begin nodding slowly backing away, making no sudden movements, you
know the drill.

I am very close to it, though. What I have found is that, largely informed
by some years of participation on this list (omg), I find I am, if anything,
a strong individualist; I believe in the supremacy of the individual over
that of the group, holding that latter only exists to support the former. I
don't think I'm a libertarian, however. I support many "groupthink" agenda
items, such as publicly funded medicine, education, and welfare, as support
for the individual. 

My personal view is that the extropian principles are all informed by, and
can be derived from, strong Invidualism, which is why I like them. Actually,
perpetual progress is a sticking point... I'm not sure on that one. I like
it (!!), but I'm not sure why. I think I'm a techno utopian at heart; I
believe technology is what it is to be human, and that its progression
enriches us (as individuals, in aggregate).

3 - Urm, see my answer to 2.

Since we seem to be moving farther and farther away from words like 
extropian and extropianism, it will mostt likely become a moot 
point.  Words like Extropy and Extropic will most likely become terms used 
for innovative thinking and reliability.

You are certainly an "extropic" thinker.

Not just California type of group, but any local.  Transhumanism gets the 
same type of response, but will fair well because there are so many 
different organizations within transhumanity to balance it out.

Like you, I think the Principles are swell, and state very
well very much what I believe.  Unlike you, I <choke> hardly
hold them to be "axiomatic" (whatever you meant by that)!  ;-)

> 2 - Do you consider yourself to be an extropian?

Why not?  I believe in all that.  I don't relate to the
downsides that you expressed:  I do not care if anyone
thinks I'm in a cult---if so, the joke is on them.  I am
not a follower (the thought did not even cross my mind until
you brought it up):  you don't see me exactly deferring to
anyone on this list; I'll gladly criticize Max or Natasha
whenever it seems called for.

> My personal view is that the extropian principles are all informed by, and

That is the least attractive part of them to me.  It would
seem to me that to take as a *principle* self-improvement
to be, ah, ..., I dunno, too self-absorbed?  No, that's not
quite it.  Too egotistical?  Again, that's not quite it.
Too obvious?  Maybe.

Ah: it's too much a matter of *personal* choice, and so who
gives a fuck whether or not all the other "extropians" are
into it.  I think that's it!  For me.

<brett> A person who is reasoning at level 1 on Kohlburgs scale (the
simplest) may not do something that is good for society in general but
for far more basic reasons, than a person who is reasoning at level 5.

<brett> But the higher up in the levels one goes the more levels or
abstraction and nuance are likely to influence your code. I would think
that a person would have a hard time having a complex moral code without
having the ability to use language for instance.

<me> "But the higher up in the levels one goes the more levels or
abstraction and nuance are likely to influence your code"...
Exactly my point :) this is what I would term a sophisticated
world-view.  You understand why things are, and how they're
stated affects the outcomes...

<brett> Our leaders must make judgements that will have impacts on lives
other than their own. 
The more of us that are reasoners and critical thinkers and the fewer of
us that are mere 
believers the better (the healthier) we will be as a society in my
opinion.

<me> depends :)  there are uses for followers (believers); for instance,
I would not necessarily
want to run a committee of reasonerss and critical thinkers :) but I
would love to chair one
where there was one or two other reasons, and the rest were followers :)
I think btw, that
nature establishes the proportion of leaders to followers...

<brett> No. I am an open minded sceptic when it comes to
conventional hypnosis. I have never experienced it
and those that I have seen ostensibly hypnotised on
stage seemed to me to be substantially "hamming"
or playing it up for the attention. I think some of
us sometimes like not having to be analytical all
the time and to have others tell us what to do
and just follow alone can be pleasant.

<me> trust me, hypnosis is real, and very VERY effective :)

<brett> I don't know if I can get into a trance as you put it. I guess I
can its just not something I am very familiar with.

<me> you should check it out :) their are some qualitative tests to see
whether or not you are hypnotizeable to any
such degree.  It may also be a comfort issue with you :)  There are
(technically) ways to get around your mental
blocks... read some material on hypnotic inductions for patients who are
subconsciously resisting hypnosis :)

<brett> I suppose when it comes to my mind I am a bit of a control

<brett>I must be failing to follow what you mean by maximizing your
utility table of something because it still seems to me that happiness
cannot really be a target that one aims at it is a consequence that
arise as a desired and hoped for side effect of something else one aims
at.

<me> theoretically [NOT physically] everyone has an internal weight to
stimuli;  maximizing ur utility table means successfully selecting an
action
from all available actions that maximizes ur utility for that set of
actions... ergo happiness :) ergo all ur actions are incidental as they
are all
targeted towards maximizing ur utility table :)

<brett> Hey I grew up in a catholic family - I've seen the old
kid of two :-)

<brett> I reckon they are very active little hypothesis testers
and experimenters. Just because we may look in from
the outside an think they are "playing" doesn't change
that they are playing at something. If they are happy
playing they probably declared they were going out
to play (something specific) rather than going out to
be happy.

<me> if laughter/smiling is a consistent symptom of happiness,
little kids (who are loved) generally have it in spades...

<brett> Well self interest will do.

<me> in most cases, it will; in some cases (where the agents lack

<brett> No I'd aim to get the rich to care more effectively for the rich
by recognizing their relationship with the poor. My emphasis is not be
charitable to the poor my emphasis is on how would you life be better if
the poor were not so poor? If they had more to loose. If they were able
to cooperate with you to make both you and them wealthier in absolute
terms rather than relative terms.

<me> if they acknowledge a relationship with the poor... 

<brett> Would you rather be healthy and active at 130 or have a
very expensive funeral and a prestigiously looking burinal
plot at 80?

<me> the former :)  I (personally) am not arguing with ur goal :)
I just think rich people won't see it ur way (as a win-win solution).

<me> more like Darth Vader or Emperor Palpatine :) <GRIN> ;)

<me> on a serious note though, I would not be part of a cabal
that sought to hold back life-extending technologies... I think
all medical advances should be shared equally, without regard

<brett> I have no magic. If my moral code is adopted by others it will
because they see merit in it. If they see merit in it and I see merit in
it I'm prepared to work on the assumption that their is merit in it. -
That a bit simplistic but this thread is very long.

<me> my only concern, really, is to point out that you may be

<brett> Makes sense. But leveraging your efforts with others can be a

<brett> Granted. But there is value in knowing why and how. The value is

More inane corporate drivel.

Remember that new jobs are created in the United State primarily by 
small business-people.  They may not be "good organizers" but they sure 
are good at getting the job done.

But the overwhelming favor of capital in the closely protected halls of 
American Banking prevent any serious competition.  Free trade would, if 
it meant anything at all, the freedom of currency as well.  Without 
freedom of currency, the whole project of free trade is joke.

Best,

The alleged sophomoric `extropian handshake' gag (it *was* a gag, wasn't

If you don't already see the parallel between your position and the

Talk about wishful thinking.

Rafal thinks that concentrating on cornering the market in orange juice 
and pork-belly futures will help wrongs right themselves?

Do you think that creating a noncompetitive global banking system might 
be useful in this regard too?

I think too much has been made of that one comment
by Rafal, as too much was made of one comment by
Robert.

Consider Einstein and Bohr. When they got together to
talk they were both physicists. What they talked about, what
fired their passions and sparked their conversations was not
the overwhelming majority of things that they agreed on
(which most people of their time may have only considered
a small subset of), what they discussed were the points on
which they disagreed, and sometimes our champions who
we see bestriding the world like intellectual colossus (colossi?)
need a place to play, to make some mistakes and learn and
to be ordinary humans too.

When Eliezer chastises Robert, or Damien teases Rafal
I don't see the good fighting with evil but thinkers who
sometimes get things wrong, and would admit it, wrestling
with the issues of the times. Bohr and Einstein when they
disagreed were only disagreeing about the nature of the
universe (no small thing from one standpoint) but neither
would claim the other was not a *physicist*.

If we aren't finding things to disagree about then we
are not engaging with the challenges of the times and we
become a mutual congratulation society. But none of us
are entirely intellectual and I doubt any of us come 
entirely to the ExI list with totally thought out positions.
We come at times, I think, because of the salon thing
Anders and others mentions. 

Hey sometimes our friends may fart in the lift and 
embarass us a bit (heck the other folks in the lift
might associate the emission with us) but we don't need
to respond by punching them out :-)

Robert is not blowing up millions, Rafal is not executing
drones, both these guys are looking for solutions and
if we want to find they have feet of clay then its not
they that have claimed to be gods. I am glad to live in
a time where there is the technology to converse and
to communicate across oceans with the likes of Robert
and Eliezer and Rafal and Damien. And the list goes
on and on.

> 
> So my questions is this:

I like the extropian principles they are not perfect but
they are very good. I like the concept of extropy as
against entropy. I see no need to carry a card or to
tie myself to an oar. Let others label me. If I want to
save the ship I will row hard anyway voluntarily.

> 2 - Do you consider yourself to be an extropian?

Sort of, but I'm no card carrier. Its the ideas, and
the people I like. Its the travellers headed in the same
direction and making for a more pleasant trip.

The PR reasons factor for me (I am aware that if I get
into a lift with someone who enjoys farting loudly) 
people will judge me by the company I keep. 

Sometimes this bothers me more than other times.

I think when I was in primary school my highest aspiration
was to master the art of the ventriloquist fart and project
it in the direction of the most prim and proper teachers
pets. I've outgrown that now for the most part. But I still
like to play.

I am politically aware enough to want to be interpreted
in context and to know that many perhaps even most people
will misunderstand anyway but there is no need to encourage 
that. I don't sleep in a tuxedo. One can be serious without
being serious all the time. One can be intelligent without 
having to be right or to deliver only verified proofs all the 
time. Sometimes its fun to collaborate on works that are
in progress. And many extropian threads are about thoughts
from folks who ideas are works in progress. 

Regards,
Brett

Actually, I think this is hinting at a point which others have made about
the global free economy, or Globalization if you want to use a capital
letter.

There is a glaring hole in "free trade", which is that goods and money can
move freely, but labour can't. That's ok if you are a consumer of labour,
you just move to where it is cheapest. In fact you get some extremely cheap
labour, subsidized in a weird indirect way by the artifical partitioning of
national borders. However, as a supplier of labour, you are very clearly
disadvantaged by your inability, in most important cases, to move to the
economic conditions that best suit your labour supply business (ie: that
best suit your life generally). 

I'm quite impressed by the theory of global free trade, but in practice the
restriction on relocation of individuals makes the market extremely
inequitable for the suppliers of labour (most people in the world), and
thus, I think, very damaging to most people.

An article from last May 3 in The Economist called: "Gauging
Generosity" offers a discussion of measures of "giving" and tries to
answer the question: "Which rich countries do most to help poor
countries?"

The Center for Global Development, a Washington think-tank, with
Foreign Policy magazine rates 21 rich countries used these measures
of help:

* aid,
* trade,
* the environment,
* migration,
* investment, and
* peacekeeping.

The Economist paper is here:
http://www.cgdev.org/rankingtherich/EconomicsfocusCDI.pdf

For the full perspective,
You should look at the table in the above paper to see a numbered
rating for each of the six categories, here, however is the average
calculated for the six categories:

Netherlands     5.6
Denmark         5.5
Portugal        5.2
New Zealand     5.1
Switzerland     5.0
Germany         4.7
Spain           4.7
Sweden          4.5
Austria         4.4
Norway          4.3
Britain         4.2
Belgium         4.0
Greece          3.9
France          3.8
Ireland         3.6
Italy           3.6
Finland         3.5
Canada          3.4
Australia       3.2
U.S.            2.6
Japan           2.4

It's an interesting evaluation. Norway is a generous aid donor, but
it has protectionist trade policies. America scores very well on
trade, but gives only 0.12% of its GDP in aid and scores poorly in
the other categories as well. Portugal is very high in investment
(it is a big investor in Latin America). New Zealand, Switzerland,
and Germany are extremely high in migration. Switzerland's migration
policy (the number of legal migrants it accepts relative to its
population) was surprising because it is not usually thought to be
open to foreigners. From my experience so far in Germany and Italy,
I can say the migration numbers for Germany and Italy seem about right
(Germany: 8.1 and Italy 1.1).

Of the aid and trade measures, the CGD has a sophisticated rating
system that adjusts foreign aid to the country's GDP, and the
quality of the aid. Of the quality of the aid, for example, it
deducts administrative costs, and it strips out principal and
interest repayments made by poor countries (because a lot of the
"aid" is in fact low-interest loans, not gifts).

The environmental index tries to capture how much rich countries
deplete global environmental resources, for example by measuring
greenhouse-gas emission per head. It also looks at their
contributions to clean technology and commitment to environmental
treaties. U.S. came out at the bottom, but The Economist points out
that it didn't consider investment in pharmaceutical or agricultural
research, where the U.S.'s contribution is significant.

The CGD index is a crude first stab at measuring the rich world's
help for the poor and the authors themselves admit that it has many
flaws, but it is a good first step that emphasizes that aid alone is
a misleading guide; trade and peace matter at least as much.

No time to read the article right now, but even aside from your great
point here, wouldn't another gauge of helping others be the results?  In
other words, if X gives away a higher %age of its wealth to charity than
Y, but X gives to charities that actually make people worse off than Y,
then Y might actually be helping things out more than X is.  (Trade and
peace have much better results, I bet, than international welfare.  I
would also note that a lot of foreign aid is actually internal
redistribution.  For instance, the aid from the US to Iraq is being
gobbled up by US contractors.  This is not unique to the Iraq War.  The
same thing happened in the Balkans.  I bet it happens elsewhere too and
with other donor nations.)

Later!

It looks like scientists may have developed a combination
therapy of stem cells and gene therapy that can heal
hearts after a heart attack...

"Inserted gene helps stem cells heal heart"
New Scientist, 11 Aug 2003
http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99994039

The implication is that if one is able to "bank" such modified
stem cells in advance then one could repair the damage caused
by a heart attack.  The next modification that one would want
to this is to be able to use stem cells harvested from the blood
rather than from the bone marrow.  Bone marrow harvesting is
a relatively complex and perhaps painful procedure.  Harvesting
stem cells from the blood is much easier though a more complex
cell sorting procedure may be required.

When I was in college, I did some pretty silly things in the art 
department.  I covered an entire floor of the academy and called it 
Performance Art.  Other things, I'd hardly admit to :-)

When Max started ExI he was at university and in his 20s.  The journalist 
who wrote "that" article represented extropians as a type of intellectual, 
radical group of folks.  This was all true.  Even though I remained on the 
outskirts of extropians at that time (I was more a transhumanist and didn't 
fit into the group), I had a lot of respect for these folks.  First, 
because I had been there and done that radical thang.  Second because I was 
much older and out of school for quite some time.  Regardless, the hand 
shake, jokes, radical nature, intellectual debates and very smart ideas 
were something that attracted me to Max and extropy.

I think we should just laugh it off as past. Our future will certainly make 
all that seem fun, light-hearted, and insignificant.

Interesting.  I do not recall encountering this during my
biological education -- it seems that in certain genes the
RNA produced from the DNA undergoes a conversion process
where some or many of the adenosines (A) become inosine (I).
That implies that RNA has a 5-letter code (A/C/G/I/U) rather
rather than a 4-letter code as does DNA (A/C/G/T).
Interestingly, at least some of the RNA base letter conversions
seem to be based on the 3-D structure the RNA forms and appear
to be targeted to genes found primarily in the nervous system.

See:
Dual Discoveries In Genetic Processing Improve Accuracy Of Genome Information

RNA Editing by Adenosine Deaminase

The implication is that evolution found a way to produce a
greater amount of information from a lesser amount of
information.  If one thinks about this for a while I think
it has significant "information theory" consequences.

Responding to this thread, I believe that Extropians can insist on their 
standards, but pragmatism has to be the means to the end. Concerning economic 
issues, there ought not to be a litmus test for accomplishing Extropian goals. If 
capitalism does the job, fine. If government intervention, achieves the goal, 
good on us. 

Conforming to the teachings of Ayn Rand, or Karl Marx, or Milty Freedman, 
should merely be a guide, or anti-guide, depending on how unworkable their views 
are. Chucky Marx would be among the last guys I would consult; since he was so 
wrong, so consistantly. But, if he concludes that religion was the opiate of 
the masses; so be it. 

Conformity seems to be a recurring theme, over the years on this list, with a 
few people. But to be influential, a pragmatic policy seems the way forward.

Dan,
       I hadn't thought about that.  What you are saying is that if the US 
spends money to build a road in Iraq and uses a US contractor to get it built 
then we didn't give the Iraqis the road.  And if we let Bethel (?) or someone 
put out oil well fires because they are American the fires aren't out they are 
still burning.  Furthermore if an American company is paid to restore power in 
Baghdad when they get more power in Baghdad than when Sadaam was in power then 
because it is an American company they haven't done anything.

You don't really get more information. The data processing theorem
of information theory shows that you will always lose information
in every step of processing, you will not be able to increase it. 
In the RNA case, the insertion of inosiol is a function of the
neighbouring bases, so you could replace it by a more complex
ribosome instead - the base is correlated with the surroundings,
it does not have any extra uncorrelated information.

But biology may cheat a bit: the conformation that apparently
guides where replacement happens could add a bit of environmental
information. If the conformation is dependent on temperature or
the presence of other chemicals, environmental information would
enter the rewriting and you would have a small amount of extra
information added before the ribosome. If the conformation is 
independent, then there is not really any new information, but it 
still could act as a nonlocal information transfer along the gene 
that affects the resulting protein. 

The question is how the inositol affects the amino acids. Anybody 
knows?

In any case, it is way cool.

General comments:

For me being an extropian is simple:
  "More information (or complexity) is better than less".

This is because in part of my process of becoming "enlightened"
20 or more years ago, I was taught that there are only 3 things
one can do:
  "More, different or better".

So the extropic process (acting to defeat entropy) acts in each
of those 3 directions.

Why is this useful?  Because each of us has a greater or lesser
desire for self-preservation -- it has to be a built in "axiom"
for any species existing today.  (If you can't survive, you can't
reproduce and the evolutionary process fails.)  Ultimately according
to current science we are facing a dead end.  All of the stars
burn out, perhaps the protons decay, the universe may be spread
apart by the dark energy, etc.  E.g. entropic processes.  The
only thing that gets us out of the dead-end path is complexity,
particularly intelligence.  That may allow us to implement
Dyson's "Time Without End" scenario, or prevent the proton decay
or tunnel into some alternate part of the multiverse or even
create a universe with different laws of physics that we
transport ourselves into.

Being extropic is a fundamental duty to oneself from the simple
perspective of self-preservation.  I consider the Extropian
Principles to be a reasonable set of guidelines as to how we
might get there.

Now, one can choose "more", because it increases our rate
of information production (e.g. more scientists).
One can choose "different" paths, perhaps exploring the
phase space of alternate art forms, because one may not
believe we can "beat the clock" or it simply makes living life
more interesting or fun (this gets into Eliezer's "Fun Theory").
If one doesn't have fun then one may not get either "more"
or "better" (because people see no point to life).  Finally one
can choose "better" because we need to get a better handle
on theories of physics, how to engineer things, how to predict
the future, etc. if we are going to ever "beat the clock".

I think Rafal's recent statement about drones is about the question
of whether there people are supporting "more, different, or better".
If they are not, then they are probably a drag on the path to the
singularity and indirectly a threat to "beating the clock".  That
in turn is a threat to my personal survival.  The connections are
tenuous -- but they *are* there.  My statement, which some objected
to, was an attempt to explore "possible paths to the future".

Now, depending on what day one talks to me I may question whether
*any* human being has a fundamental right to exist.  If that
existance threatens any of the "universe survival" scenarios
that I have outlined above then I would want to see a cost benefit
analysis.  If the universe doesn't survive and we don't find a
way out of it, then I'm a dead person.  *So*, individuals *not*
contributing to an extropic set of vectors (whether or not they
view themselves as an extropian) I would probably view as
threats to my survival.  My impression of some of the comments
that have been made is that genocide is an "undesirable" solution.
But that doesn't make it unconsiderable if the universe (or my
life) is at stake.  To argue otherwise is to invoke the moral
dilemma that an individual is obligated to sacrifice themselves
for others (and *yes* I'm aware of the time scale problems).
The primary problem is that it seems unlikely that genocide can
be used as a tool to predict the best possible paths to a
future that enables our collective survival [1].

Individuals who do not envision (or are not fond of) things like
lifespan extension, uploading, MBrains, making copies of oneself, etc.
as "reasonable" possibilities may disagree with my perspective.

Interesting note Amara.  However, any "environmental index" that
does not take into account biotechnology and nanotechnology funding
is biased.  They will make a *significant* impact on the long term
benefits to countries around the world.  These will include pollution
reduction, clean water, better crops (the potato blight problem
recently got the benefit of a genetic engineering solution),
improvements in world health (look at the largely U.S. and European
efforts to sequence all of the genomes involved in the organisms
involved in malaria), etc.

So not all "foreign aid" is best judged by the amount of funding
sent offshore.  I will admit that an "onshore" approach does not
help foreign countries "now" so one would need some kind of
discounted present value analysis which may be difficult.

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) requires extreme programming
efforts, whether in Perl or in other XYZ programming environments.

http://mind.sourceforge.net/perl.html is the new Perl AI Weblog.

No matter which AI language you favor, please accept the challenge
of coding a main Alife Mind program loop with stubbed-in calls to
the following artificial intelligence mind-modules:
- Security
- Sensorium
- Emotion
- Think
- Volition
- Motorium.

Please code this first AI module in your favorite
XYZ programming language by following the steps at
http://mind.sourceforge.net/acm.html -- DIY AI.

If you know several programming languages,
please release the AI Mind loop in each of them.

Put the resulting "main Alife Mind program loop"
on your personal Web site as open source AI code.

Then come back to this forum and post a link to your
free AI source code for others to copy and enhance.

The idea is, if enough AI code warriors implement the first
Mind-module, other AI enthusiasts will respond to the grand
challenge of AI and code the AI Mind a little further.

We do not wish to standardize or homogenize the resulting AI code.
On the contrary, we want to see many pathways of AI evolution
branching off into the future in a survival-of-the-fittest race
towards the Technological Singularity of Vernor Vinge.

<brett> There a couple of ramifications to this. First you leave your
opponent with more degrees of freedom and more power than if you take
the initiative. So you take on more risk. 

<me> hardly; practically speaking, it means knowing when to attack, and
when not to attack (based on your enemies movements).
It is a fallacy to think that because you are reacting you are
necessarily @ a weaker advantage; more often than not the
one moving with "more degrees of freedom" is at the disadvantage because
so little is known (certain).  I just started
reading sun tzu (a recent translation) the art of war, and I am
impressed with the clarity of his understanding of warfare.
he reaches a similar conclusion; that most warfare is decided prior to
the actual conflict, generally by skillful manipulation
of the situation (by a talented general) and by not rushing foolishly
into a situation where there are too many unknowns.

<brett> Second would you not agree that the circumstances change when
one has others under ones authority or 
control like a leader, a military commander, or a president who has to
be able to think in terms of minimising loss 
of life sometimes when the other is clearly intending on taking life.

<me> no :) I run my life like I would run an army :) that is to say that
my personal decisions affect all those
around me, and so, I take my actions seriously.  I take pains to avoid
unnecessary suffering, intentional
or otherwise.

<brett> Where this works and it often would its laudable. Sometimes
though the abusive behavior cannot be avoided. Such is the human
condition. Some folks will go out of their way to remove the option of
avoiding them.

<me> I'll agree with this statement; but they're attempt to impose their
presence on you despite your attempts to avoid them is in and of itself
a declarative action;
I have no problem scratching an itch, preferably with a 10 pound
sledgehammer.  I hate dealing with annoyances.

<brett> The irony of being free is that others are two and the person
who decides to compete or predate on one immediately reduces ones
degrees of freedom. The reactor has less practical choices than the
actor. The actor can compete, cooperate or ignore. The reactor can be
forced to compete (or be defeated), cooperate or not, but hardly ignore
a person determined to compete.

<me> hahaha :) I think that this is a fundamental difference between me
and 
other people; I believe you can sedate the things you hate; others do
not.  Its
come up on several occassions.... Suffice it to say that in my case, I
never ever
have to deal with people I don't want to deal with (law
enforcement/violent
crime excepted sans prep time).

<brett> Then if you've codified to 1-to-1 (ie. predecided what you
will do in all possible moral dilemnas) then can the future
not throw you a curly one at all that will require you to
make a new judgement?

<me>  It isn't predecided; it is partitioned what is good
and what is bad in reference too different axis; the
actual selection of my own responses happens according
to a simple ruleset that operates on these states.  So throwing
me into different situations isn't a big deal; I'll identify whether
or not the situation sucks (by my standards), what available options
are there (from my skillset, materials, and the environment), what the
projected state would be for each of those actions, and whether or
not they would satisfy my own needs (which may or may not depending
on the severity of my situation, include the welfare of others) or that
of others.  practically speaking, I am very rarely thrust into
situtations
that can't be analyzed as such and yield a satisfactory action.  In
fact,
I am fully capable of generating (apparent) conflicting actions when
dealing with seperate parties which are in reality, united under a
general
operating principle..  Generally such instances are preceded by, "if I
was
in your shoes..."  The closest I come to moral crisis is what I would
term
"games";  generally they are very abstract points that have not had 
resolution yet based on my experiences;  they fundamentally alter the
set of possible outcomes :)

<brett> For instance say that IVF technology was improved to
the point that a given embryo was more likely to go
through to a health birth than the more than 70% from
memory that naturally abort.

<brett> What would be your moral position if you were a
superior court judge and a state governement wanted
to pass a law that all reproduction should be via IVF
as that wasted less embryos than reproduction by the
natural method. Would your moral code cover that
- with the consequence that all sex for pleasure must
involve careful steps to avoid reckless and risky
procreation or would you have to think anew guided
by your moral code perhaps but not being able to do
a one to one look up to say point 356 of your specific
code?

<me> it depends; are you asking me as a person,
or me as a citizen responsible for crafting
policy to be inflicted (and I choose inflicted
on purpose) on others...

<me> if you ask me as a person; I would say present
your evidence and I *may* choose to do as u wish;
in this case I am *already* planning on procreating
through IVF :)   If you ask me as a citizen crafting
policy, I would say, nobody has a right to limit how
you choose to procreate, short of physical rape (e.g.
date rape is crap IMHO).

<brett> Hmm. I'm around 6 foot, weight around 90 kilo and
am a former state karate champion. Yet there are some
males that are so much stronger than me that I would not
be able to separate them as you say. 

<me> we have a saying in egyptian; "the army teaches
you to improvise".... can't seperate them, locate
resources that will enable you to seperate them;
this may be police, threatening to run them both down
if they don't stop, or calling for nearby passengers :)
I am a firm believer that the reason why life sucks is
that most people do not do their duty in establishing a
reasonable operating environment;  sometimes the police
are not available, and you have a duty in ceasing harmful
activities in progress.

<brett> Yet as a third
party coming onto the scene with them grappling with
other I would in all likelihood be able to render on or
the other unconscious having the advantage of the
element of surprise (as indeed could my youngest
sister, who is much lighter and has no special training
in any martial arts, if she kept her wits about her).

<brett> Your scenario contains details for you that I didn't
see. Those details change the context. One must
act in real time within the context with the options
that one has. If the two protagonists were school
boys then separating them might be relatively easy
and involve only words. It depends.

<me> well I've been thrust into that situation on several
occassions :) and I've never had a problem... granted
no weapons were involved.  That also included random
strangers btw :)  The point is to stop the escalation
without being partial to either of the combatants, because
you realize that you are *NOT* in full possession of the 
facts.

<brett> Agreed. But "due" diligence depends on the
circumstances. Too much diligence, too much
forebearance is also a risk. 

<me> agreed; there is a time for action; I would say
err on the side of too much diligence than too less.
The beauty of it is, though, that with more experience
enforcing a rigid structure as such, the better you as
an individual will be in recognizing (gauging accurately)
exactly when you have reached that point of due 
diligence :)  I believe that the worst thing you can do as
a person (both for yourself (directly, and indirectly) and others)
is adopt an inconsistent enforcement of any particular policy.

<brett> The weighting of the
risks is a moral judgement that the individual
cannot get away from as no code can fully
anticipate all contingencies.

<me> I shift the preponderance of the work towards
establishing the environment you are in (accurately);
so my moral code is simple and complete :) [ergo sophisiticated 
world-view statement above].

> you can't have a good moral code if you're judgement
> is consistently unable to judge according to that moral code..

<brett> I think I see your point. A better code, one that endorses
reasoning rather than believing as a means to making decisions, is a
better guide to moral behavior, but we can never have a code so good
that the need for moral judgments disappear altogether unless there are
no new challenges thrown at us, like the challenges that technologies
might throw up.

<me> its more basic than that; its an age-old systems problem; if a
system is theoretically perfect, but always implemented poorly (due to
agent errors),
can it really be considered theoretically perfect?  would not a system
that inherently compensated for agent errors be even better?  What if
you 
could implement this uber-algorithm, but couldn't gaurantee its
compensations... would you still consider it theoretically perfect
because it
explicity addressed the tendency towards agent (human) error and sought
to correct them?  What if you could gaurantee that system did
[eventually] correct said behaviors, but no time frame was given in
regards to its convergence to optimal corrections, would be even better 
than ur uber-algorithm?  All important aspects to be considered when
choosing to adopt or reject any particular moral system....


<brett> [snip]... But the brighter more abstract thinkers that are
likely to rise to positions of power are more likely to be better
abstract thinkers and reasoners. (They may also be better rationalizers
on occassion but a rationalization is a deceit one practices on
oneself). Your rationalisation won't convince me and vice versa. You or
I can have a moral discussion and seek to change each others views using
reason and a common language but if either of us held that we were
absolutely right to believe what we believe then there would be little
possibility of communication and cooperation between us.

<me> first; I would say that abstract thinkers do not have a tendency to
rise to positions of power anymore than anyone else;
second; I would say it depends on whether or not the agent "thinking
that they were absolutely right" thought that naturally
implied that the search for disproof was pointless or not... for
instance, if you asked me to hold a conversation on
whether or not 2+2 = 4 in decimal arithmetic as its currently defined, I
would probably not choose to engage in such a
conversation; if you asked me if 2+2 = 4 in all cases, I would, because
their you *may* be talking about some unifying principle
irrespective of any particular algebra (ergo 2+2 may not be equal to 4
in all cases is a true (and absolutely correct) statement,
but you may be discussing a particular aspect of it that may be at a
higher level than the statement itself).

<me> trust me, I understand the distinction between women as life
support
for a fetus and a fetus as collection of foreign cells in a parasitic
arrangement
with its hosts :)  suffice it to say that in certain cases, a cancer
cell may
actually be more valuable than the host it is living on... but that
follows
from my (reasonable) assumption that we're all going to die anyway :)
For instance, there is a line of skin cells that are cancerous that are
actually harvested for skin grafts on burn victims.. they are
particularly
interesting because they don't raise any immune response from
individuals
(thus making them extremely valuable for their intended use).

<me> I would agree :)  ergo my suggestion for a clear, unambivalent
test,
tending towards reserving the right for any person to make their own
moral decisions rather than a state.  If it lives, its a human being...
if it dies, it is not.  If god wanted it to be considered a human being,
he would have helped it live :)  I see no conflict between that and any
of the traditional moral codes currently running amok.  God never said,
thou shalt not maim; he said, thou shalt not kill.  Any damage done to
the fetus after being ripped out of the womb would be incidental to
the "moral" <smirk> ethic currently employed.

<brett> Agreed. Interestingly though legal systems do seem to put a
higher or more 
formal emphasis on reasoning and the processes by which conclusions are 
reached. 

<me> thats incidental; legal systems generally attempt to be
accountable; that requires consistency,
and consistency can only come from particular formal systems (past
draconion kill everyone statements) :)

<brett> Juries work to beyond "reasonable" doubt standards not to mere
"belief".

<brett> Its been argued that all academic disciplines are descendants of
philosophy. 
I am interested in philosophy not because it it esoteric though it can
be but 
because it can suggest solutions to problems.

<me> historically speaking, likely :) theoretically speaking, math is
more important than 
philosophy (IMHO, but only because I would like to be accurate) :)  I'm
interested
in philosophy in that I think philosophy is a commoners pursuit just as
much as its
an academics or nobles.   Or rather it *should* be :)  As it is
practiced now, most
philosophy discussions end up invoking the thoughts of long-dead people
rather
than concentrating on using available resources (cognitive, historical)
to identify
key problems.

<me> put another way, I would rather talk to a person who has rederived
the philosophers
works independantly, rather than someone who has adopted them based on
extensive
reading of said philosophers (and ergo, has not really contributed to
them).

<brett> My interest in morality and ethics for instance pretty much goes
back to a desire to 
build stronger societies and more effective cooperatives because in this
way I can do more, 
be more and enjoy doing it better.

<me> for me it was a search for policy :) it is an active attempt to
remove the crap currently
floating in my environment (from my point of view, of course) :)


<brett> On the specific point I would say that my code would
say that self delusion is immoral. Thats what I'd endeavor
to teach children but I'd also point out that its nature
and in some circumstances moral judgements that take
in the fuller context and detail than any moral code
(that is codified) are going to be refinements.

<me> I would endeavor to teach children above all else, make sure its
functional;
always search for an objective measure to test for ur situation, and
alwas attempt
to find optimal solutions that do not unnecesarily inflict needless
suffering for
others, nor impose needless limitations on urself.  And have fun :)

> and yes, you can make a decision to hallucinate...

<brett> Perhaps we have different concepts of what
constitutes an hallucination. I don't think
fantasy = hallucination. I think hallucination is 
likely to have a medical/physiological cause and 
not be volitional.

<me> hallucinations may have a physiological cause;
however they are not necessarily the only cause.  There
is a whole subfield of perception devoted to determining
how u think affects (internal mental states) how you perceive
stimulus...  If you can manipulate your own (or anothers) 
internal environment, you can achieve real hallucinations 
(equivalent to one that is induced by a somatic condition, or drug).

<brett> I see. You are interchanging fantasy and self-delusion. I
tend to think of fantasy as suspension of disbelief. One
knows one is doing it and one is doing it for fun.

<me> no :) I'm not :) I'm saying that some people can subsume themselves
into their fantasies, effectively hallucinating.



Self-delusion on the other hand - one probably suspects
one is doing it at some level unless ones rational aspects
are completely shut down - but delusons I think of as
things we don't have for fun, but for other perhaps
more serious pyschological basis.

A person who is reasoning at level 1 on Kohlburgs scale (the
simplest) may not do something that is good for society in general but
for far more basic reasons, than a person who is reasoning at level 5.

But the higher up in the levels one goes the more levels or abstraction
and nuance are likely to influence your code. I would think that a
person would have a hard time having a complex moral code without having
the ability to use language for instance.

Our leaders must make judgements that will have impacts
on lives other than their own. The more of us that are reasoners and
critical thinkers and the fewer of us that are mere believers the better
(the healthier) we will be as a society in my opinion.

Fair catch that does look like a slippery phrase doesn't it?

No. I am an open minded sceptic when it comes to
conventional hypnosis. I have never experienced it
and those that I have seen ostensibly hypnotised on
stage seemed to me to be substantially "hamming"
or playing it up for the attention. I think some of
us sometimes like not having to be analytical all
the time and to have others tell us what to do
and just follow alone can be pleasant.

I don't know if I can get into a trance as you put it. I guess I can its
just not something I am very familiar with.

I suppose when it comes to my mind I am a bit of a control freak, I
don't like it when the captain is not on the bridge.

Is there a functional form of insanity? As I understand it insanity is
usually diagnosed on the basis of behavior. If is inferred rather than
experimentally verified. Insanity is apparently easy to fake. Sanity on
the other hand - now theres a challlenge :-)

I must be failing to follow what you mean by maximizing your utility
table of something because it still seems to me that happiness cannot
really be a target that one aims at it is a consequence that arise as a
desired and hoped for side effect of something else one aims at.

There is a saying "man is the only animal that laughs
and weeps, because he is the only animal that sees
what is, and what might have been".

Hey I grew up in a catholic family - I've seen the old

I reckon they are very active little hypothesis testers
and experimenters. Just because we may look in from
the outside an think they are "playing" doesn't change
that they are playing at something. If they are happy
playing they probably declared they were going out
to play (something specific) rather than going out to
be happy.

No I'd aim to get the rich to care more effectively for the rich by
recognizing their relationship with the poor. My emphasis is not be
charitable to the poor my emphasis is on how would you life be better if
the poor were not so poor? If they had more to loose. If they were able
to cooperate with you to make both you and them wealthier in absolute
terms rather than relative terms.

Would you rather be healthy and active at 130 or have a
very expensive funeral and a prestigiously looking burinal

I have no magic. If my moral code is adopted by others it will because
they see merit in it. If they see merit in it and I see merit in it I'm
prepared to work on the assumption that their is merit in it. - That a
bit simplistic but this thread is very long.

Makes sense. But leveraging your efforts with others can be a

I think your right it comes to us naturally. But what also comes
naturally to us homo-saps is reasoning. We can see that win wins are
possible, that it is possible through cooperation to do what we cannot
do alone. We can choose to measure ourselves against what is possible
rather than against each other.

The few will be aware of the condition of the many, and some
of the few will be uneasy in their relationships with others of the few
if those others are too harsh or cruel in the treatment of the many. We
know well enough how easy it is to go from in-group to out-group.

Granted. But there is value in knowing why and how. The value is in the
power to identify route causes that can be changed. Lets go for the

Because they won't stay satisfied. How can you keep up

immortalised themselves?

Bail at any time or edit with more extreme prejudice. The offer was
there in the last post.

Quite seriously, long rambly dialogs are probably
better offlist. I think it was worth having the discussion
but maybe not on list.

Any illuson I had that others might read much of this
have long past. But the upside is that the dialectic
process does help sort out thoughts. In this thread
somewhere are a few gems. They may be distilled
at a later date maybe.

I'm not so sure Anders -- it reminds me of the statement from
"Through the Looking Glass..." [1].  One may be able to make
a "word" mean many things depending on the context.  I'll call
this "information overloading" and I'm not sure whether standard
information theories can be applied.  At least not standard
theories of the information content of DNA or RNA.
This may be similar to the overloading of natural languages
such as the verb tenses of Danovën [2].  I think there is also
a similar language from Russia, perhaps Udmurtia, that overloads
its verbs as well.

I don't, it looks like there may be changes in amino acids from my
brief review.  I didn't go through all the references enough to
explore what the mapping may be.  *But* this may have impacts
in 3 domains; (a) the amino acid coding derived from the RNA;
(b) the lifetime of the mRNA (due to the fact that non-coding
regions of the RNA that impact structure may be critical to how
long it takes the RNA to be degraded (and the inosine *does*
alter the base pairing and therefore the 3-D structure of the RNA);
and (c) the rate of translation by the ribosome if the mRNA structure
becomes more or less "difficult" to work through.

Agreed.

Omard picks up our somewhat lengthy thread with a second
bite and writes:

---------

But just to briefly recap. I am trying to argue (despite views to
the contrary from many intelligent philosophers like Russel)
that it may in fact be possible to derive a moral or ethical
code on the basis of a handful of universal truths which are

a) the all (effectively all in the moral universe) humans have
some propensity to reason,
b) that all humans by nature are born in a state of such 
dependency that they cannot even lift their head to feed so
they are by nature at least predisposed to be social. i.e.. they
need others or have needed others at some stage to survive.

c) I am arguing that the simplifying principle for developing a
moral code is that the essential self interest of each individual,
that they perceive the universe from a necessarily self centric
position cannot be denied.

d) I don't claim that moral codes remove the need for moral
judgements just that a good moral code (one that acknowledges
these principles) helps inform moral judgements in real time 
better than a poor one (like the 10 commandments, or utilitarianism
or any other code on offer) and in the end each of us must 
make moral judgements ourselves -we must each follow the 
maxim "to thine ownself be true".

Ergo my argument comes down I think to the notion that
if we were to teach children that they are rational and social
and that they ought not accept challenges to their self interest
other than through the process of reasoned compromises for
a net gain we would have the basis of a more enlightened society.
Key to this notion is that belief has no place, belief is contradictory
to reasoning and clear thinking and that when intelligent people 
use the word belief they usually mean it as a form of shorthand 
for "this is my current working hypothesis", or alternatively, they
are not at that moment being particularly rational or intelligent.
Further language and participation in the social stock of 
knowledge flows from our capacity to reason not from belief.  
Belief qua belief then in this system is anti-social and 
dysfunctional as is altruism.

To be clear I would not ban the use of the word belief I would
leave it as a useful means for numskulls to continue to identify
themselves as such and allow them to continue to shortchange
their reasoned (or otherwise) arguments in political discourses
in front of audiences. 

This is just a summary. Its a long thread :-)

Could it be your experience to date is coloring your preferences
here? Followers, believers, are not hard to find. If you want 
people to just follow instructions then, acquire some skills and
you'll find them. But the projects that are really worth doing,
the ones on a grand scale. Say extending human life are likely
to require the coordinated efforts of many bright people who 
may themselves be able to bring followers in their train.

To an extent. There are various theories of leadership. Personally
I take a situational approach. Sometimes I lead, sometimes I
follow, sometimes I'd be laisse fair, sometimes in military situations
I'd be more authoritarian. Its horses for courses.

If I could do them without giving another person power over my

All links and book refs I'd be curious in at least. But I don't

Sorry still don't get it. Can you break it down further. I know what
utility (usefulness) is and what a table is. But your comments about
"selecting an action form a set of actions aimed at maximising happiness
just doesn't seem correct.

Let me ask do you see this utility table as a construct one makes or
an evolutionary artifact one inherits?

I miss you point. Regret *is* a word. Prima facie it has a referent
or maybe more than one. Have you never experienced regret?
Do you think regret is not experienced by others?

As a rule the successful folk, don't lack vision across the board. 
And one does not need to persuade all of them to make progress.
My point is that if you approach them with a real answer to their
*fair* question, what is in it for me, you are likely to get further.

I think luck has nearly nothing at all to do with it. My point is
a *moral* rich man *is* a poor man.

I'm at a loss with that remark :-) How could they not acknowledge
a "relationship". If they don't I can point out several in seconds.

The poor vote with one vote each just like the rich. They can
even vote themselves money. Don't confuse the relatively poor
with the stupid. Democracies are the result not of the wealthy
and powerful conceeding rights to the masses they are a point
of rough equilibrium between power groups.

I don't need to persuade all of them. Just the ones who want to

That's nice but we gotta be practical. You do vaccinate

No I'm prepared to take on board constructive criticism,

If the intuitive person could communicate the solution
with language that's great, I'm not anti-intuition, if not,
they don't have a solution I'm interested in, because it
cannot be socialised. I'd regarded it as just another
belief system.

Yes. But a better word than disease would have been a
dysfunction or a suboptimal worldview for achieving his

No, I won't go in circles indefinately with you, anymore than
I would with him. At some point other considerations in this
contingent universe require I make a judgement. So sooner
or later I'd make a judgement on the best data available.

At some point I might launch a pre-emptive strike because
if I did not the shit would hit the fan on some other front
I was being forced to neglect whilst I argued in circles. 

I would not try and bs him about his self interest if he is
a genuine predator and likes it, that is a fact and that I
would deal with. This is why peace must be one. We 
can't choose it for others when they choose conflict.
We can only respond to their choice to predate on
us with resistance or surrender. I'm not into surrendering
my life any more than he/she is.

It would be a continuation of the status quo except 
fewer sentients would die by misadventure or accident
and more would die by murder.

Neither do I. The lowercase letter was not a typo.

There was a Jesuit Frence philosopher who tried
to reconcile the theory of evolution with theology.
He argued that God created the usiverse but through
the mechanism of evolution. Teilhard de Chardin.
(spelling may be wrong).

I am not sure if it was his idea or my extended musings
on it, that posited "the beginning there was only one
sentience" it was bored and lonely so exploded itself
into fragments that made the universe and over time
those fragment coallesced into more and more intelligence.
There was a movement back towards godhood.

However, power is seductive, and the satan myth is
provocative too. I can imagine self satisfied super
powered satanic like sentients wanting to be the one. 

Let me be clear I am playing with *myths* here.

Intellectually I am an agnostic. Practically I am
an atheist because the position of indecision about
whether the cavalry is coming or not I think we'd better
not dwell on whilst there other things so obviously needing
doing. Atheism is my operating hypothesis. All notions 
of god I have ever heard of were logically inconsistent 
or fanciful beyond my capacity to accept. I can't prove
there is no God if one adopts an atypical definition and
I am not going to waste too much time with the question. 

If there is a god, my numbers in the phone book, he/she/it
can call me, meanwhile I'm busy trying to clean up the
mess with a few practical likeminded humanists like
myself.

I have pretty much the same reaction to the notion that
we are in a sim and that their is some architect calling
the shots. I an agnostic on that point to and in practical
terms I act atheistic. I think this is *more* moral than the
alternative of waiting for the supernatural cavalry but that's
just my opinion.

I would not *render* them a threat. I'd make a judgement
as to whether they were a threat, a curiosity, or something
else on the evidence. A sociopathic serial killer that enjoys
it would not be *rendered* a threat by me but I would 
hope they would be accurately *perceived* as one by me
to the extent that they were.

I think you can deal with it in the standard way, it is just that 
you have to calculate information across the entire gene and not 
just single bases, i.e. take correlations and higher-order links 
into account. It is not enough to sum the entropy like -sum_i 
sum_{b=ATCG} P(x_i=b) log P(x_i=b), but you have to look at longer 
stretches like -sum_i sum_{b1=ATCG} sum_{b2=ATCG} 
P(x_i=b1,x_{i+1}=b2) log P(x_i=b1,x_{i+1}=b2) and so on. 

The question is how the mutual information between the DNA and the 
finished protein differs from the mutual information calculated 
purely from codons; this is the real measure of how much information 
"sneaks in". It should be quite observable. 

Of course, entropy is not quite what we call information. It would 
be maximal if all bases were uncorrelated and random, rather than 
for complex correlation patterns.

Extropes -

We are in the process of changing our "extropian" list. I'll be making an
announcement about the new lists very soon. Up until our new lists are
generated, please help to make this "extropians" list a smart and pleasant
place to discuss, debate and challege ideas. 

Regarding the "extropians" list, we have now tightened our belt and are
taking subscribers off the list who have abused list rules in the past and
those who continue to disrespect the ideas and values of ExI, "extropians"
and list members.  We have asked over and over again to please post with a
sense of respect to others and we have always welcomed criticism, when done
productively.  Not all criticism is productive. Some criticism is harmful
to our community.  I have received so many complaints from list members
about out of hand postings that I have had default to either asking people
to take a break from the list or remove them from the list.

In September, when the new lists are generated, everyone's slat will be
wipped clean and anyone who has left the list will be welcomed back.  Yet,
our rules will be enforced more tightly so we do not have to repeat past
problems.

my best to all,

Natasha

Natasha Vita-More
President, Extropy Instittue

I can see several reasons why those in power have not been in total control:

1)  The "elite" is not monolithic.  The guy at the very top wants to 
keep the challengers down, so he encourages their challengers.

2) Strategic alliances.  This is really a generalization of point 1.

3) A frontier.  If there's somewhere to get away to, then people won't 
stick around when things get really bad.

4) Speed of communication.  The rate at which communications can be 
transmitted have an effect on how difficult it is to organize a large 
area.  And at the borders there's a "kind of" frontier.

5) Complexity of organization.  Fine grained control of a system 
requires a finely grained organization.  This can be difficult to achieve.

6) Unions, guilds, etc.  Economically important groups have some 
leverage.  (Not much, but some.)

7) Unexpected changes make the future hard to predict.

An excellent example of why Left and Right are inadequate categories for

We can avoid buying from some companies, because we know that they are 
slavemasters.  Many, however, make parts that are incorporated into 
other merchandise, and their names never appear in public.  Others have 
hidden the fact that they are slavemasters.

It's not as easy as just saying "Don't buy Nike shoes".  That's a start, 
but only a start.  But what's the next step.

Not they haven't done anything, but perhaps they've done less than the 
dollar figures indicate.  It's rather like MS giving away software.  
Yes, they've given a word processor.  And that has value.  But they kept 
the money.  They decided what you would buy with their "gift", and it 
was something they made.  And they took the tax writeoff as full sale 
value.  But if what you needed was a bed, it's not as satisfying as 
getting the money.   (Actually, for me it wouldn't be as satisfying 
anyway.  I'm perfectly satisfied with the MSOffice97 that I bought.  And 
I'm replacing it with OpenOffice.org.  So I'm not even going to bother 
filling out the paperwork.  (Some lawsuit verdict!)

It doesn't only happen in foreign aid.  It's endemic throughout the 
system.  And I am much less than grateful to be the recipient of the 
right to some MS software as payment for *their* misdeeds.  They should 
pay me to take it.  (Only it would have to be without their EULAs and 
renewal requirements, or I wouldn't even then.)

Charles,
       As I have said before we are somewhere between being the leaders and 
being the coming leaders.  If we don't buy the slavemasters the word will go 
forth.  Others will get the word than they shouldn't get caught buying from 
slavemasters either because then we won't buy from them.
       But I notice you said that is only a start.  Even though I indicate 
not buying from the slavemasters producing retail has repercussions among the 
parts producers that still isn't enough.  
       I think we have to talk to each other and inform ourselves who the 
slavemasters are.  In addition I think we have to recognise that we are leaders 
and lead our friends into following us -- we can do that.
       In addition I think as leaders we have to study social engineering.  
Frankly I feel remiss for knowing no more than I do.
       I would like to hear from others but just to chip in one idea for 
learning to lead I suggest you search on the Delphi Technique.  The Delphi 
Technique can be used for good causes and for the knowledgeable it can also be 
identified and disrupted when used for a bad cause.   There are other techniques.

Charles,
       True, but they only get away with it because we let them.  You know 
there is no group in this country as the people that go door to door 
electioneering only because they are interested in good government -- if only they

Hey you've now come full circle if you are contemplating
when to attack (as opposed to merely preparing to defend)
you are accepting in some instance pre-emption. That was
the point I started with - sometimes pre-emption *is* moral,
it depends on the circumstances.

I depends. With conventional military force they used
to argue it took three times as many men to storm
entrenched positions. But we are not just talking about
the civil war through to WWI   I presume. We're talking
about pre-emption and whether it is ever moral to act
pre-emptively. I am say of course it is *sometimes*.

Where heading off topic :-)  All things being equal
the clearer thinker, the better game theorist will win.
All things are not always equal. Sun Tzu also says
if a battle can't be won - don't fight it. This is not
to say surrender - it is to say choose a time and
terrain and circumstances of your chosing, or
hell why not even just negotiate.

Not quite the same. As a military commander your would
give orders that you would know would result in the death
of some persons (your troops). They would not be partially
dead, their entire subjective universe is snuffed out. That
is a different proposition to running ones own life. That is
where hard moral decisions are needed and hard moral
judgements must be made. Because not to put ones
troops lives on the line (not to play God as it were) will
leave open in many cases the certainty of more loss of
life. We do not get to choose the all good option over
the all bad option or very rarely anyway.

So now are you saying responding to declarative actions
is not really pre-emption. :-) What about when they don't
see the utility in telling you they are going to kill you, they
make no declaration, but go about the business of what
to you looks like taking all the necessary preparatory steps
do you then extend your notion of declarative action to
implied declarative action. I'm getting a sense of deja vu
all over again here :-)

Who said anything about hate? A lion doesn't hate a zebra,
the lion probably thinks zebras are delicious.

A mugger may just want what you have and not want you to

Sometimes one can disarm or passify or negotiate with an
aggressor but if you think you can do it all the time I think
you either have some remarkable strategies or you have

So you haven't codied 1-1, you use guidelines, not an

Game theory is a rich source of inspiration for reason

No these are not what I was asking you. I put you in
the position of a superior court judge and posited you
the responsibility of deciding policy that would affect
others (a whole state).

I said the fact of the matter is that natural conceptions
will result in 70% loss of embryos through natural
abortion but by using a new positied form of IVF
this could be got down to below 70% and as
a consequence one state wanted to make sex by
the natural means illegal in deference to the rights
of embryos.

They are the facts of the case presented to you how
will you rule as a judge what law will you make for
that state?

You might resign or excuse yourself from the case
but if the case is brought up *someone* is going to
decide it, you not deciding just means someone else
will.

Hey hang on, it was your example above I was replying
to. You said intervening in a mugging by hitting the person
I think is the mugger over the head is morally wrong if I
mistakely identify the mugger. A hit over the head is doable
with minimal strenght as opposed to wrestling two males
apart.

You point out below the army and the police may use
the resources at hand to break up a situation. By hitting
the person I think is the mugger over the head that is
exactly what I would have done.

The only difference is whose judgement is used. Mine or
the police or the armies. My point is that in agreement
with your next paragraph sometime I have to decide
'cause I'm the only one there. Its not immoral to make
it mistake, it may be unfortunate and it may be illegal
(if my judgement really stinks) but you can hardly accuse
me of immorality.

So if someone is mugging someone else and your not

wallet's contents 50/50 :-)

Seriously, we are recovering ground. The point is
we must make judgements and if they are judgements
made on best endeavours in the circumstances they
are not immoral though they could be foolish or illegal.
The point is to thine ownself we must be true.

You thinking on the personal one crisis at a time scale.
On the larger stage too much due diligence on problem

You misunderstood I think. I meant (1) I see your point that a good
moral code is not good if it doesn't produce consistent judgements.

The I went on to say why I thought reasoning was a better
component to include in a moral code than believing. I was trying
to get back to the particulars of the moral code I was proposing.

In corporations and governments etc. They do. The ability to
manage people is the most complex managerial task. If someone
can manage people at a high level in one organisation that are
often able to manage people at a high level in another. At the
lower levels of management it knowledge of the product or
service and the means of producing these matters more. At
the higher this has been delegated. I don't know how to prove
this to you (I don't know what you know about management
and organisational behavior) but I am confident that this is so.

 100%                         >50%       <50%                  0%

The above is a scale that can have more precision added with utility.

The word belief can mean anything from this is what the priest told
me and I trust him to I've checked this and its statistically significant to
9 decimal places but I'm still not sure. If an audience is hearing two
people describe their views and the above two both use the description
I believe the second person has forfeit a huge advantage in pursuading
the audience to the vastly more probable truth.

Belief is too crude a word. To blunt an instrument.

So the kid asks you: what do you mean functional in terms

Obviously you weren't paying attention in California V. Nike.  They can

Say to yourself this:

       ##Robbie, it sounds as if you have an agenda that you haven't put 
before the house.  In addition you are making gratuitous statements without 
offering either evidence or basis.

       ### Then you continue to quote me, "Perhaps sometimes there is no

"You do what you can, no doubt, but this doesn't make the overarching problem 
magically go away."

       ###Did I mention magic?  I suggested that you have here a collection 
of very intelligent and knowledgeable people.  These people can spread the meme 
of not buying the products of slave labor.  They also can keep up with who 
the slavemasters are.
       ###And once again you quote me, "In my opinion when we knowingly buy 
these products we are only the Morlocks of H. G. Wells. world living off 
someone elses misery."  And you reply, "Definitely, assuming we could reasonably be 
expected to KNOW that we are and that we have a CHOICE in the matter."  I know 
of nothing that prevents you from knowing that products from particular 
countries are from slave labor products.  I am sure a phone call to any 
international union headquarters would get you a list that would be astounding for its 
completeness.  As to your insinuation that we don't have choice I have never had 
a salesclerk point a firearm at me and dictate what product choices I should 
make.
       At one time time in my misspent young adulthood I worked for a 
manufacturer of ladies hairrollers and orther hair care products.  We knew that a 
shyster had sold a bunch of hairrollers of a particular color in Arizona and that 
as a result Arizonians just wouldn't have anything to do with a hair roller 
of that color.
       Now if an American Hairroller company can be that sensitive to the 
color of its product in certain markets then people that do purchasing for retail 
outlets can be just as sensitive and in fact they are.  So the last thing we 
need is another layer of big brother looking out for us.  All we have to do is 
remember we are leaders and start being leaders.

Yep! This dude is some kind of heretic...ATTACK!ATTACK!ATTACK!ATTACK!

Or perhaps we could make him submit to some sort of ideological purity 
test....hmm.

Here is a proposed ideological purity test question:

Q1. Have you ever read the NY Times columnist Paul Krugman's column and 
thought, "Yeah, this dude is right!"?

decades) since I've looked at the core of "information theory"
so I'm a bit rusty.

The RNA modifications may not be too different from post-translational
modifications such as glycosylation or perhaps modifications performed
by kinases or other enzymes that add additional atoms or molecules.
But it seems like there is a "multiplier effect" in that a single enzyme
could enhance the information content of a number of different proteins.

I also am not sure that a simple information content analysis based
on base probability will work because the "multiplier effect" probably
often works on the 3D structure and that *isn't* obvious from a
simple analysis of the DNA/RNA.  One would need a much higher level
analysis of what 3D "words" mean.  There are protein structure and
protein motif databases with some of this information but I don't
believe we are anywhere near understanding the complete "language".

Ever see the "Buy an SUV, ride with Osama" bumper sticker?

If I have an agenda here it is this - that the political issues 
involved in creating "better societies" far outweigh the technical 
issues.  It's possible that these political issues don't need to be 
resolved in order to create a better world for a few people.  The 
question then would be whether or not that was a worthy goal?  This 
topic is being covered elsewhere.

As for basis, in the sense that it's clear that the American monetary 
system commits us to a hawkish foreign policy (and that the hawkish 
foreign policy commits us to this monetary system) it equally makes us 
all severally and jointly responsible for the war-time and peace-time 
atrocities committed in the advancement of that project.

I don't think this should come as a surprise to anyone - it's as nearly 
tautological as anything meta-economic could be - the largest financial 
institutions have the majority stakes in each of the major 
corporations.  Nothing new at all.

I am in complete agreement with you that we SHOULDN'T buy products 
produced with slave-labor.  Where I slightly disagree with you is 
whether or not that's possible.  Given, for instance, that FMR, 
Barclays, Citigroup and a few others are the largest corporate owners 
of both GM and Nike, it means that supporting GM is supporting Nike by 
extension.

I suggest a brief study of the S & P 500 would give you the data you 
need to understand this problem.  If you haven't got the time to go 
through the corporate ownership pyramid, try:

http://www.thetip.org/snptotals.txt

Gathered from finance.yahoo.com institutional ownership records.

The data is a little out of date, but if you add it up, you'll see what 
I mean, it hasn't changed that much.  The fields are:

Company
Owner (Institutional Ownership only NOT mutual funds)
Percentage Owned	
Value

If you add them up the same way I did, you'll see that the largest 
institutions, the usual suspects, own both the BAD companies and the 
GOOD companies.  If you widen your research, you find that they own 
them both in the US and abroad.

The numbers were taken from Yahoo! Finance late last year.

Now given that the FED (you know, the federal reserve system) gives 
great competetive advantage to american financial institutions (doubt 
me, check

Good point.  What should we do about FMR, Barclays, Janus, JP Morgan, 
etc.?

Well, if you MUST take a car to work, then you MUST buy gas.  If it 
turns out that Gas is only available from a small number of very 
dangerous sources, then what choice do you have, you HAVE to go to 
work, right?  You gotta eat?  I mean you could drop out of society all 
together, but what good would that do?

If you MUST eat, then you MUST buy wheat-proucts.  Who do you think 
consistently sets the price of wholesale wheat in the US?

Agreed, no one is proposing another layer, if I were to make a proposal 
it would be the elimination of the corporate ownership system as we 
know it today by making liability transparent - if you OWN something 
that does something evil, you should be liable for that economically 
and criminally.  BUT that would assume that I thought that something 
could really be done - on that particular issue I am agnostic - the 
proof is in the pudding.

Sounds easy.  How do you propose to start?

Best,

The word is out that long time poster Mike Lorrey has
run afoul the list authorities for some unspecified
reason.  This is pretty hard to believe.  I don't know
exactly what list rules he is alleged to have broken,
but in my opinion this really bodes ill for the future.

So who else has been chopped?  I really found Mike Lorrey's
posts to be intelligent and extremely informative.  He will
be sorely missed.

The list rules used to say "engage in personal attacks"
but are now to be "harmful to our community"?  For one,
I don't like the sound of that.  (I hope that this remark
itself by me is not taken as "harmful to the community".)

It's remarkable that there haven't been any on-line
complaints that I've been aware of.  I wonder how
recent are these complaints that you refer to.  I for
one have not found the list to be problematical.
There exists courtesy here absent from most such
forums.

Not at all.  What I am saying is not that nothing gets done but that a
lot of foreign aid is internal wealth redistribution.  I should NOT have
used the Iraq War as an example, since it's too politically charged, so
let me just used a schematic example.  Country X allegedly gives aid to
country Y.  The aid is for a specific project P.  Well connected
interests C inside X lobbied for this specific project and the aid
really amounts to the taxpayers of X pay C to do P.  Yes, Y gets P, but
the real pressure to do P did not come the citizens of X per se but from
special interests in X that saw a way to get the aid money transferred
to them.

This kind of thing goes on, I bet, a good percentage of the time when it
comes to foreign aid -- and I'm not focusing on the current Bush
Administration or the US or wartime.  There seems to be a good public
choice argument for why this stuff would go on -- the incentive for C (a
tiny minority) to lobby for P is much higher than the incentive for the
rest of X (the ones who, in the end, pay for P) to monitor it or fight
against it.  After all, P might amount to thousands or more in profit
for each C while it costs each taxpayer only pennies.

There's also a knowledge problem here too.  Since P is going on in a
foreign land, its even more difficult for those taxpayers to monitor.
The same difficulty applies to politicians who sign on to P in the
motherland.  (For all we know, P might not really benefit people in Y or
its benefits could be uneven, destabilizing, or even counterproductive.
An example might be food donations that bankrupt many marginal farmers
in Y.)

Later!

If I was a socially dysfunctional programming wiz with a burning
desire to make my own avenging bot to settle some scores 
would not this sort of open source open sharing empower me
in dangerous ways.

I don't know if  "friendliness" can be built into an AI, but
I don't doubt some folks with knowledge will use IT savvy
for mischief.

Any thoughts on this sort of approach from a public
policy stance Eliezer? Anyone?

Regards,
Brett

Don't open-source an AI that can potentially be corrupted and that can 
accomplish more damage than uncorrupted AIs can correct.  If you're in a 
state where a corrupted version of your AI can do serious global damage, 
then don't open-source that AI.

That sound very sensible to me, but then I have the additional thought,
the military, even in the West can read everything that's in the public
domain, not share the benefits of work taken further or generally have
to be accountable. They just declare national security. It may be damn
hard to get friendly AI up first with the military wanting fierce attack
dog AI that bites whoever it is pointed at without question.

Brett

I agree it's crazy! I'm a little behind in reading the list but I can't
imagine what Mike did to deserve that.

Imo, this a good striking of the balance. Rules need to be 
enforced consistently to be fair and respected. The clean slate
seems to me like a good fair way of drawing a line in the sand 
at a particular time and saying henceforth we will be better i.e.
the quality will be going up a notch for the sake of message 
integrity vs. noise and not for the sake of censoring anyone.

Seems extreme, if true. It's not like he suggested *killing* anyone...  :)

Either I'm Googling on the wrong terms, or, in some impossible way, this 
information exists yet cannot be found on Google.

What is the history of the measurement of the permittivity of free space, 
aka the vacuum permittivity or the electric constant, and the measurement 
of the permeability of free space, aka the vacuum permeability or the 
magnetic constant?  In particular, what were the experimentally measured 
values of these constants in 1861 when Maxwell published his calculation 
of the speed of light from these two constants?  I know that the estimate 
of the speed of light was Foucault's 1850 estimate of 298,000 km/s.  I 
can't find any historical account of these two constants at all, so I 
suspect I'm Googling under the wrong search terms.

If there's one thing the Extropians list has desperately needed for the 
last seven years, it's a policy of shooting first and asking questions 
later.  I vote that the new regime keeps a heavy finger on the trigger, 
shoots anyone who twitches, and keeps firing until the magazine is empty. 
  If they have to shoot through the innocent to reach the guilty then 
that's fine too.  If my own dead body ends up smoking on the heap of 
innocent corpses it would not be too high a price to pay.  You can't make 
an omelet without cracking a few skulls.

Government on mailing lists does not and should not run on the same rules 
of justice as government in physical reality.

A bit of scenario analysis, based on some binary assumption 
trees:


If the strong autodevelopment scenario of AI is true, then AI
development is a "first come, first win" situation that promotes
arms races. But there are two additional assumptions that affect
things: is there a high complexity threshold to the
autodevelopment or is it just about finding the right seed, and
how much would the autodeveloping AI change things - while we
tend to assume it is a phase transition, it could turn out that
the top of the development sigmoid is not that high, and the
resulting ultimate AIs still far from omnipotent. 

If we make up scenarios based on these assumptions, we get eight 
possibilities:

Autodevelopment   Threshold   Effect
   can occur

1  No                No          Small
2  No                No          Large
3  No                Yes         Small
4  No                Yes         Large
5  Yes               No          Small
6  Yes               No          Large
7  Yes               Yes         Small
8  Yes               Yes         Large

The first four are the scenarios where rapid autodevelopment can 
not happen, because general intelligence turns out to be messy 
and incompressible. 1 is the case where AI develops 
incrementally, never taking off or becoming very smart. 2 allows 
you to push to superintelligence, but it requires a broad 
research base. 3 and 4 represent situations where it is very hard 
to get anywhere, and a huge push would be needed - which would be 
hard to motivate if people believe they are in 3. But lets 
disregard these for the moment, even if I think we should 
consider refined versions of them as real possibilities.

The last four represent the take-off scenarios. 5 & 6 are the 
"seed is easy" situations and 7 & 8 the "seed is hard" 
situations. If the seeds have a low initial complexity, then they 
are possible to do for groups with small resources. Manhattan 
projects have an advantage, but it is not total. In 7 & 8 
amateurs are unlikely to get there, and Manhattans will win the 
game. 

How large the perceived effect of the AI is will determine
policy. If AI is seen as "harmless" there will not be a strong
push to control it from many quarters, while if it is believed to
be of world domination class stuff people will clamor for
control. (I made the mistake above of looking at objective power 
of AI; lets retroactively change the third column to "perceived 
power" - it is what matters for policy). 

The Center for Responsible Nanotechnology has written a very
interesting series of papers on control of nanotechnology, which
they consider to be relatively easy to bootstrap ("seed yes")
once an initial large investment has been achieved ("threshold
yes") and then it will change the world (for good or bad). Given
these assumptions (and that it is likely to be developed *soon*)
they conclude that the best way to deal with it is a single
international Manhattan project aimed at getting nanotech first
and set up the rules for it as a benign monopoly, giving DRM
limited matter compilers essentially to everyone to forestall the
need for competing projects. (I'm writing some technology and
policy comments on the papers which will appear later; I disagree
with it a lot, but it is a good kind of disagreement :-)

Compare this to AI. CRN are in scenario 8, and presumably their
reasoning would run the same for seed AI: we better get a central
major project to get it first, and competing projects should be
discouraged until success guarantees that they can be prevented. 
Of course, getting such a project of the ground assumes
decisionmakers believe AI will be powerful. It is worth noting
that if such a project is started for technology X, it is likely
to be a template for a project dealing with technology Y or even
extend its domain to that - we get the Technology Authority
trying to get a monopoly, and nobody else should be allowed to 
play.

On the other hand, the nightmare for this scenario is that seeds
do not have high complexity thresholds but are only about getting
the right template into order. To get a Technology Authority
going takes time, and if a myriad amateurs, companies and states
start playing in the meantime there is a very real risk that
somebody launches something. Even if it later turns out that the
AI is not super (it just changes world economy totally, but no
gods pop up) the perception that it is dangerous is going to
produce calls on ending these bioweapons-like projects. It is
worth considering that if the belief that seed AI is possible and
has a not too high threshold and will be powerful - Eliezers
position as I understand it - becomes widespread among
policymakers, then it is likely in the current anti-terror
climate such AI research would be viewed just as unacceptable and 
in need of stopping as people working on homebrew bioweapons. 
Expect marines kicking in doors. It is actually more relaxed in 
the high threshold belief scenarios, because there the worry 
would be just other Manhattan projects, amateurs are not seen as 
risks. 

On the other hand, if AI is not generally perceived as powerful
or possible, then the field is clear. No Manhattan projects, no
Homeland defense raids. That might of course be a mistake in
scenario 5 and 6.  This is where we are right now; the
policymakers and public are right now unaware or think it is
unlikely that seeds or powerful AI will be developed. 

So where does this put the "AI underground" that believes in seed
AI? The ordinary academic AI world mostly believes in non-seed AI
with or without complexity thresholds, so they are not overly
worried.  But if you think seeds are possible then things become
more complex. If you believe that there are complexity
thresholds, then you need a Manhattan-like project (be it the
Singularity Institute, a popular open source initiative or
selling out to North Korea). Otherwise just enough brains or luck
is needed. 

Should you try to convince people about your views? If you
believe in the low threshold situation, then you should only do
it if you think that it is a good idea with antiterror raids on
AI developers because AI development is too dangerous - if you
are megalomaniac, think that you could do it right or that AI
will almost certainly be good/safe, then you better hack away in
secrecy instead, hoping to be the first. In the almost certainly
good/safe situation, or if you think that AI will just shake up
the world a little, then spreading sources around to facilitate
faster development makes sense. If you believe in a high
threshold situation you should go public (or more public, since
the project is still visible) if you think it is likely that you
would end up in the big centralised project (which you assume to
be good or at least better than alternatives), or that you have a
reasonable chance in a race between Manhattans. If you distrust
the big project and worry about competition, you should be quiet. 
If the threshold is high, spreading sources won't matter much 
except possibly by allowing the broad criticism/analysis from 
others "in the know". 

>From this analysis it seems that the "AI underground" that
believes in seed AIs in general would be rather quiet about it,
and especially not seek to convince the world that the Godseed Is
Nigh unless they have plenty of connections in Washington. An
interesting corrolary is that beside the usual suspects on or
around this list, there are likely many others who have thought
about these admittedly obvious issues and reached similar
conclusions. There are likely many (or at least some) people
hacking away in cellars at their seeds beside the publicly known 
developers. If I believed in seeds of low threshold, I would be 
seriously worried.

Enforcing the rules are "A Good Thing"

The more the conversation is keept on track, the more interresting it 
is, and it would not hurt to get 50 just quality mails a day instead of 
100 partly off-topic.

Yes, setting up killfiles is too dificult for the average extropian
subscriber.  Wouldn't want people to have to press the delete key too
often.

One problem might be that they didn't have a system of units at that
time. The metric system was only officially adopted in 1795 in France,
electrical units were specified in 1861 in UK.

See: http://www.aticourses.com/international_system_units.htm

Thanks, Bill, but that's not what I'm looking for.  I want to know: when 
Maxwell surprisingly found that the already-measured speed of light could 
astonishingly also be derived from the already-measured electric and 
magnetic constants, what were the electric and magnetic constants measured 
to be at that time?  (I'm looking for a good, strong, unambiguous 
historical example of Nature's Surprise Consistency; no one realized in 
advance that these constants ought to match when they were measuring them.)

Robbie,
       Now, if I read that as a sweeping policy statement for a political 
philosophy of some party that you have not identified then it sounds great.  But 
you are not preaching to the converted and frankly you haven't proven anything 
you claim.
       The thread starts with a presumption that we are approaching the 
Singularity or failing that a new Renaissance.  Like any Renaissance we are talking 
about massive upheaval.  If it is the Singularity then there will be greater 
upset.
       I have taken the view that just as the last Renaissance resulted in 
the overthrow of one entire social class and the rise of a new one the years 
ahead of us will result in the same.
       Already in this Renaissance people are predicting what amounts to the 
overthrow of the American Consumer at king.  The jobs are moving off shore and 
the American will no longer have money to consume as he once did.
       In addition just as the merchant and scholar once replaced the knight 
others have predicted that we are seeing the coming of the GT class and the 
over throw of the old money class -- the old money as a class doesn't have the 
brains to operate the businesses they own.
       Robbie, you made a great show of the interlocking of business 
interests in the companies that own each others stock.  That is old news.  One of the 
beauties of the modern capitalist economy is that anyone can buy stock on the 
open market.  People very often do spread their money out and invest in a 
great number of profitable businesses.  It is called diversification.  In addition 
when folks have a large enough sum invested they often gain representation on 
the board of directors.
       You closed by asking me, "Sounds easy.  How do you propose to start?"  
Well, I would start by recognising that you belong to a class of people that 
is replacing all the people that have been running corporations.  If you 
follow that train of thought for a while you will probably come to questions like 
where am I going to get the money and expertise to buy into the game?  I am 68 
but I know what I personally am going to do.  I have no doubt you can find 
your answers also.

Ladies & Gentlemen,
       It is with a lot of regret that I resign from this list.  I did not at 
first understand that Mike Lorry had been expelled -- I first misunderstood 
and thought the discussion was over a proposed expulsion.  I had faith that 
calmer heads would see the folly of expelling Mike.  Apparently my faith was 
misplaced.  In any case I do not wish to belong to a list that considers Mike 
unacceptable.
       For the rest of you.  Sometimes our relationships were a little 
tumultuous but they were never dull.  I learned a lot from you and will always have 
a warm place in my heart for you.  You struck me as very intelligent, learned 
and above all humane to one another.

Physics Today recently published a very moving obituary for
Robert Forward.

http://www.physicstoday.org/vol-56/iss-8/p66.html


Obituaries
Robert Lull Forward

Physicist and science-fiction author Robert Lull Forward died on 21
September 2002 in Seattle, Washington, from brain cancer. A leader
in gravitational radiation astronomy and advanced space propulsion,
he contributed particularly to gravitational and inertial sensors
and low-loss electronics.

Forward was born on 15 August 1932 in Geneva, New York. He obtained
his BS in physics from the University of Maryland in 1954, an MS in
applied physics from UCLA in 1958, and his PhD from the University
of Maryland in 1965. For his thesis, he built and operated the first
bar antenna for gravitational wave detection; he did this work under
the direction of Joseph Weber and David Zipoy. His antenna was on
display in a Smithsonian Institution museum and is now in storage
there.

Beginning in 1956 and for the next 31 years, Forward worked at the
Hughes Aircraft Research Laboratories in Malibu, California, rising
to senior scientist on the director's staff. In his early years at
Hughes, he invented and developed gravitational radiation detectors
and explored many new ideas in space applications. One such
invention was the rotating cruciform gravity gradiometer mass
detector, which measures Earth's subsurface mass variations or
gravitational multipole moments. In 1960, he was the first to point
out that a laser interferometer gravity-wave detector could be built
to be photon noise limited, and that scaling it up would make
extreme events in the universe detectable.

Retirement for Forward was a simply a new category of innovation and
activity. He took early retirement in 1987 and founded Forward
Unlimited. The appropriately named company emphasized space
propulsion methods, including using laser- and microwave-driven
sails and antimatter propulsion for high velocities.

Through his concepts for matter and antimatter rockets and laser-
and microwave-driven sails, he explored the only technically
credible ways of sending probes to the stars; such craft can reach
speeds necessary for those vast gulfs. His book Mirror Matter:
Pioneering Antimatter Physics (Wiley, 1988), written with Joel
Davis, presents his ideas on matter and antimatter rockets.

In 1992, Forward formed Tethers Unlimited Inc with Robert Hoyt. The
company specializes in innovations for space travel using elegant
mechanical methods. He retired again just before his death.

Forward's written work consists of 157 technical publications and 71
popular science articles. His 14 book-length works include science
fact and science fiction. His best known novels are Dragon's Egg
(Ballantine, 2000), which is about life on a neutron star and is
still used in astrophysics courses, and Rocheworld (Baen Books,
1990), which is based on his concept for propulsion using
laser-driven sails. He was among the most rigorous of the "hard"
science fiction writers. His best nonfiction summary work is
Indistinguishable From Magic (Baen Books, 1995), based on Arthur C.
Clarke's Third Law, "Any sufficiently advanced technology is
indistinguishable from magic."

Elegance of concept marked his many inventions; in all, Forward
obtained 20 patents. Orbital tethers will be both graceful and
useful. In a long series of papers, many with Hoyt, he calculated
how light cables could be used to transfer energy and momentum
between spacecraft; that effort opened new methods of orbit
changing. Cables carrying electrical currents can raise or lower
orbits by using the J ? B force, available from Earth's magnetic
field. Forward believed that antimatter could provide the most
fundamental method of containing energy. In the 1980s, he published
18 issues of his privately circulated journal, Mirror Matter
Newsletter, to stimulate the field. He saw how magnetic traps could
make antimatter useful in medicine, principally in tumor treatment.

Forward lived up to his name: His thinking was well ahead of his
time, and he was known for a positive, supportive, and playful
manner. We knew him primarily as a pioneer of beam-driven sails, but
he had a thousand other interests. Some of his papers have amusing
titles, such as "Laser Weapon Target Practice With Gee-Whiz
Targets." He fancied wearing colorful vests to go with his exciting
ideas, concepts nonetheless developed with full conservative
scientific rigor. Knowing of his fatal illness, he devoted his last
months to writing out his newest, partially explored scientific
ideas.

Of Forward's many innovations, some were realized in his life, but
most will likely emerge in 21st-century space propulsion and
gravitational wave detection. Now that the first solar sails are
about to be launched and plans are being made to beam microwaves at
them to demonstrate photon propulsion, Forward's ideas are starting
to become real. He was fond of saying that he wrote science fiction
to advance ideas that he couldn't get into the scientific journals.
He usually coupled his science-fiction writing to his science papers
and thus gave concepts a wider publicity and advanced public
understanding of what the consequences of these ideas could mean.

Dear Dan,

If the Center for Global Development doesn't already have a plan for
this kind of results evaluation, then I suggest you email them your
letter that you posted here. If they are smart, they will consider
it.


There's a web site,

=============

http://www.cgdev.org/rankingtherich/home.html

Ranking the Rich:
The First Annual CGD/FP Commitment to Development Index

The CGD/FP Commitment to Development Index ranks 21 of the world's
richest countries based on their dedication to policies that benefit
the 5 billion people living in poorer nations worldwide. Moving
beyond all-too-common assessments of foreign aid flows, the CGD/FP
Commitment to Development Index also considers countries' openness
to developing-country exports and performance in peacekeeping,
investment, migration, and environmental policies. The Index rewards
generous and selective aid giving, hospitable immigration policies,
sizable contributions to peacekeeping operations, and hefty foreign
direct investment. It penalizes financial assistance to corrupt
regimes and policies that harm shared environmental resources.

The Index builds upon contributions from scholars at the Center for
Global Development, the Brookings Institution, the Institute for
International Economics, and the Migration Policy Institute and
benefits from the generous support of the Rockefeller Foundation.

The Index is featured in the May/June issue of Foreign Policy. Read
the full article.

The background papers and data sets upon which the Index is built
are available in the Details section of the site.

Index highlights: Why an index? | Racing to the top | Signs of
change

=============

with links for ** comments ** and to join a mailing list, even.

Apparently this ranking program is something they intend
to maintain and perhaps pursue further.

Thanks Amara.

Thinking from countries to organizations, I've been wondering the past 
months how ExI can produce philanthropic aid to underdeveloped 
regions.  While we are not rich by monetary measures, we are rich in ideas 
about the future and do have first hand experience in dealing with the 
challenges of change.

One way that  I think we can do this is by helping the learning centers and 
schools in poor areas.    Once our critical thinking online course is 
developed and other reading sources, we could donate thousands of easy to 
print books to the schools.

Maxwell's paper "On physical lines of force" 1861-62, was mostly later
discarded by him, but this was where he originally made the claim.

http://physics.hallym.ac.kr/reference/physicist/maxwell/maxnew-2.html
describes his discovery. The section I think you want is:

Quote:
 The Speed of an Electromagnetic Wave
In 1861 the British Association for the Advancement of Science set up a
committee under William Thomson's chairmanship to establish a set of
electrical and magnetic standards. During the course of their work it
became clear to Maxwell and others that important insight can be
obtained by comparing results expressed in the two sets of units,
electrostatic and electromagnetic, that were being used at the time. The
electrostatic units were particularly appropriate to static electricity,
and related the force of attraction and repulsion between two charged
bodies to the quantities of electricity that they held. The
electromagnetic system of units, on the other hand, related force to
electric currents. The quantity of electricity residing on a wire at a
given time depends on the speed with which the current travels along the
wire. It can be shown that the ratio of an electromagnetic unit of
charge to an electrostatic unit of charge is the speed with which the
current passes along a wire.

During the 1860s Maxwell and various colleagues carried out careful
experiments in which they compared the two units. Maxwell's own
experiments were carried out using equipment made available to him by
John Peter Gassiot (1797-1877), a wealthy wine merchant and amateur
scientist who had already done some remarkable experiments using vast
numbers of electric cells. The conclusion from the experiments comparing
the two sets of units was that the speed of an electric current was
close to 3 x 10 m/s, which is the speed of light.

An alternative approach, used by Maxwell and others, was to compare the
electrical quantity now called the permittivity of a vacuum, o, with the
magnetic quantity now called the permeability, µo. Maxwell's
mathematical treatment of Faraday's lines of force led to the conclusion
that the speed v of an advancing electromagnetic field was given by

v =1/(o µo)

Measurements made by various physicists of µo and o also led to the
result that v obtained in this way was the speed of light. These results
convinced Maxwell and others that light is an electromagnetic wave; in
his own words, emphasized in italics in his 1861-62 papers:

    "Light consists in the transverse undulations of the same medium
which is the cause of electric and magnetic oscillations."

In other words, a single electromagnetic theory is needed for light, an
electric field and a magnetic field. The field produced by an electric
current has also a magnetic component, and the field produced by a
magnet has also an electric component; light also has electric and
magnetic components.

End Quote.

It should at least give you lots of words to google on!

Friends, we gather here today to mourn the e-passing of one Mike
Lorrey, or as he was known by his neighbors, "Gun-Nut Mike."

Mike was a person who was able to blend the seemingly disparate worlds
of the gun-toting New England hillbilly mechanic with the rarefied
hi-tech ouerve of the computer programmer, and the protectionist blue-
collar, kitchen-table economist with the Extropian globalist-
freemarketeerist.  

Although we here will no longer be able to grin at his fiery email
antics here on this list, we know that somewhere out in "meatspace"
Gun-Nut Mike is flipping off a government vehicle on the backroads of
New Hampshire ("damn revenooers!"), or dashing off a vitriolic
editorial letter to the local Thrifty Nickel newspaper.

May his electrons rest in peace.....

I'm really sorry to hear that Ron, but I understand why you're upset. At the
very least I think it would be nice if somebody explained exactly what Mike
Lorry did that was so much worse than what many others did, otherwise a lot
more good people might resign. Personally I think it stinks, but it's not my

You can already see this happening.  The increase in SPAM seems
to have annoyed someone high up in the Russian government
(Minister of Communications or something like that) who then
directed some programmers to develop software to take revenge
on the people sending SPAM (I don't know whether it acted
through a Denial of Service attack or an automated calling
of phone number attack, but both are clearly feasible).
[This was discussed on /. a few weeks ago.]  One does not
want to SPAM a "Minister of Communications" because one
can be pretty confident that they have access to a bigger
pipe to the internet than you do.

There has also been discussion on /. in one of the articles
related to SPAM about developing standard filters that
effectively extract the response addresses/phone numbers
that SPAM typically require and having them generate
something like one automated response per second.  E.g.,
sending email to 25 million people results in 25 million requests
per second to some machine, or telephone effectively shutting it down.
(Interesting to note though that this might produce enough demand
on routers and switches to cause a telecomm industry recovery...).

So we already have examples of individuals getting *really*
annoyed and doing something about it.  It is probably not
going to be a good thing if individuals get *really* annoyed
and have an AI at their disposal to do something about it.

Doesn't this depend on what the rules are?  "For the good of the 
community" is the kind of waffle-speak that could mean anything.  If you 
must not act "In ways injurious to the community", then what procedure 
is used to decide?  How can you know ahead of time whether or not any 
particular utterance will be found in violation?

Sorry.  "No personal attacks" can be decided on.  "the good of the 
community" is undecideable on rational grounds.

I can't really make a libertarian argument against this action, as this 
list is a private organization.  But to the extent that it is a public 
forum, then this change in the rules seems anti-libertarian.  (I can't 
say anti-extropian, as I don't have the right to define what that 
means...that's up to the members of extropy.org.  But I know what 
liberty means.  And the enforcement of undecideable rules isn't a part 
of it.)

 One problem with this is that you probably won't have a good estimate
of the damage that could be caused by a corrupted version, so this
reasoning will lead you to keep the source secret even if that slows
down development enough that someone else produces the first AI, and/or
hinders the debugging to a degree that you end up relying on an AI that
isn't as friendly as you think it is.
 Another problem is that if you keep it secret and claim it's powerful
enough to save the world, it would seem sensible for anyone who believes
your claims about its power to suspect that you will use it to acquire
personal power over the rest of us.

 If, as I suspect, releasing the source code only enables corrupted versions
to become powerful after years of learning (i.e. much of the value is in
a database produced by the AI that takes a lot of cpu time to duplicate),
then I recommend open-sourcing the AI even though that causes some hard-to-
evaluate risks of malicious AIs being produced at some uncertain time.
 Remember that keeping it secret can't eliminate the uncertainty - once
someone shows that AI is possible, there will be lots of people trying to
write their own AI. It's just a matter of time before they succeed.

Could one of the changes please be to make the digest form of the

does?  Personally I find it difficult to find the time to scroll

Neat analysis Anders. I started to add a couple of columns
on the left. Column 4. Does this drive the singularity significantly
and Column 5. Would the govt/military want to classify or
render patents secret in this instance. I thought that 4 and 5
might couple in an unfortunate way, that is when the singularity
is likely to get the biggest boost the govt is also most likely to
cut in, perhaps cutting it off, but I haven't had the chance to 
run through it yet to check. 

I think this sort of binary tree analysis could be taken up a notch
to produce tables identifying where the best extropic reward for
effort can be achieved factoring in some reasonable assumptions.

Sorry haven't the time presently to give this the attention it 
deserves.

### You seem to be looking at managers from the underdog point-of-view - you
portray them as the powerful, dangerous, mean types, who can bite you if
they want, and get all the best bitches in the pack.

Well, the greediest segment of the economy is not the manager. The manager
has very little individual power, his actions are channeled by the owners of
capital on one side, and consumers of goods on the other. US managers now
send jobs overseas because they can, thanks to technology. Just as railroads
allowed the sending of vegetable-growing jobs from Maine to Florida,
communications technology allows sending IT jobs to India. US managers send
jobs overseas because they have to - if they don't, somebody else will,
offer cheaper products to consumers and kill their company. Since the
capital owners want the manager to give a return on capital, and consumers
want him to organize the production of cheap but good quality goods, the
manager does their bidding.

You are a consumer. If you have anything in a mutual fund (like I do), you
are a capitalist. It is you, the average American (well, not quite average,
you are on the Extrolist), who is responsible for sending jobs to India, by
your everyday choices.

Start throwing away money on poor investments instead of quality funds,
start buying pricey local products instead of good foreign ones. Once you
have thus proven you are not greedy yourself, feel free to preach against
greed.

Also, since the American middle class is overwhelmingly in possession of
capital (I am not including middle-class wannabes who are pretending they
are rich by spending on credit), the globalization of labor will only
benefit them - you can't shrink a capitalist by making his investments pay
more. American economy can only stabilized and expanded by cooperating with
good workers all over the world.

Greed, channeled through a free market, is good.

Would you deny me, Rafal Smigrodzki, a productive non-citizen, the benefit

I haven't seen anything untoward from Mike for months because, as
Alejandro pointed out, dropping the ranting lunatics in my killfile is
a trivial exercise.

I can only listen to so many priveleged, white men talk about how great
the free market economy and capitalism are before I puke.

### Well, probably not. A 600 000 000 000$ (no, I didn't confuse the number
of zeros) bill for Iraq, and a 500 000 000 000$ budget deficit (gosh, I love
to write out those zeros, feels like playing with the money Germans had
before the Nazis came. I have a genuine 50 000 000 000 Reichsmark banknote,
it's a beaut) are highly unlikely to reduce the risk of suitcase nukes going
off in Newark.

Although, since radiation exposure sometimes causes an IQ drop in the range
of 10 - 15 points (in cancer treatment), so a nuke so close could indeed
wreak havoc with my subtle reasoning :-)

Rafal,
       I don't want to argue with your comments but rather to add to them.  
The manager sends jobs over seas also because he is tired of being hemmed in 
and barked at.
       If I am a manager I am constantly beset with problems with Unions, the 
EPA, OEO, OSHA, local building codes, politicians looking for favors, and a 
multitude of others.  If I shift to an overseas supplier I hear a chorus of 
"Yes sirs" as suppliers vie for my favor.

### Common sense tells me that if I own an American company (and I own many
hundreds), I will be better off if they make more money for me.
Additionally, since the cost of labor in the US might drop (as it already
started to, in some medical specialties), I might eventually be able to
afford the services of a gardener, from the proceeds of my earnings which
became capital.

I gain both ways.

### Neither should be our goal.

Fulfilling the maximum amount of human wishes with the minimum amount of
labor, this should be the goal (in fact, it is, right at the very bottom of
almost everyone's goal system). Translated into everyday economy it means
getting the most done with the least labor and no force or fraud (because
these are by definition reducing the net amount of wishes fulfilled).

Getting the maximum wage per hour will get you the pre-Nazi German answer -
inflation, bags of money, and unfulfilled wishes.

Yes, the possibility of unwittingly unleashing a kind of "berserker" upon
the earth would seem to be not statistically insignificant, nonetheless, I
remain confident (if only via gut feeling) that this kind of
Saberhagen-esque scenario will never come to pass. Is it completely
unreasonable to presume that 'human-level' intelligence implies human-level
ethics and values (two kinds of social intelligence) as well as pure
knowledge crunching/combinatorial power?

A tendency toward malevolence and unnecessary destruction are still
considered entropic and SUB-human in these parts are they not?

Robert? ;-)

### Actually, I am not devoted to the free market. As you wrote somewhere
else (I think), if the market does it, good. If it takes a government,
that's OK as long as it works.

I wrote on this list about control of land ownership, production of
information, enforcement of liability insurance, subsidizing the poor (the
"poorhouse" threads), subsidized health care, production of meta-laws, and
some other functions which under some special circumstances could IMO be
productively discharged by a non-market mechanism.

The reason why I oppose protectionism is not ideology, while you don't, is
my different time scale. I know that in the long run (and every long run
starts today, so you can't put off taking it into account) protectionism
will hurt me personally (in addition to all the brown, yellow and white
people out there), so I am vociferously fighting it. For my own good, mainly
(although hurting brown people rubs me the wrong way, too).

If you take seriously the idea that you might be around in 100 years, join
me.

### Oh, so you don't want me here? You don't want to have a doctor willing
to work for less and be just as good as the locals (by standardized tests)?

I can tell you one thing - America needs me more than you think.

If America heeds you call to squish competition, one day you will be a
broken old man, in a government-run nursing home, in an economy shattered by
trade wars, with your "maximum wages" all eaten up by inflation, and the
local unionized doc will be our of your financial reach. There will be no
H-1B nurses willing to come in and wipe your feces.

Remember about the long term.

How about if you and I and several other business partners develop a product, 
then you turn around and sell the trade secrets relating to the product to a 
competitor. You make out big time and I lose out big time. Oh wait, I forgot--
because the competitor did not have to spend the money and time to develop 
the product (just the money he gave you), he can sell the product more 
cheaply than our company would have.  Less development expenses, etc.

And now, you say, in reply, I (and the other partners) can buy that product 
more cheaply than before. If I can make enough at Walmart to buy the product, 
of course.

Gee, business partner, please don't do me any more "favors."

Of course, not to put too fine a point (guess I do have to do that...), as an 
analogy, we Americans and our ancestors built this country into a place with 
tremendous competitive advantages: we as voters control and have exclusive 
labor market access to the biggest consumer market ever.  That means that we 
can charge far more when we sell our labor here in the USA to labor buyers 
who want to sell products to this enormous consumer market.  Compare to third 
worlders, for example.

Or, at least we SHOULD have exclusive labor market access. Instead, those 
entities who BUY labor have convinced us that by giving up this exclusive 
labor market access, we can get those products more cheaply. That is, if we 
can save enough at Walmart to buy the product.

The way they go at it is by dividing the populace/business partners: make 
them think it will always happen to that mythical "other guy."  The only 
ramifications to "me" will be lower cost.

Gee, "business partner," please don't do me any more "favors."

### There was a time that I opposed immigration (imagine, me, an immigrant,
opposing immigration). After thinking about the issue for a long time, I
came recently to a conclusion quite similar to yours - it is wrong to limit
the mobility of labor by arbitrary rules at state boundaries. I still think
that limitations related to enforcement of personal liability insurance, or
exclusion of security risks, are acceptable, but otherwise states should
have no right to limit movement of people or their employment.

Gasp! DoublePlusUnGood!

You mean, where is the extropian "dogma"? Sorry to disappoint you, but I do 
from time to time have...."unpure" thoughts. I personally think that getting 
more money for citizens is extropian.  Giving money away to foreigners for 
the nebulous value of cheaper consumer goods is non-extropian. I guess I am 
greedy that way.  I guess when it comes to the freemarketer, "greed is good" 
only when it comes to investors, and not when it comes to those morlockian 
subhuman working class types.

In other areas, such as my stance on genetic engineers, longevity, etc., my 
thoughts are as pure as the driven snow, extropian-dogma-wise.

I am quite we have discussed this before, Rafal.  You have of course used an 
ancient debating tactic here: seize upon one good argument, and try to apply 
to different areas.

I myself and I am sure many other socalled "dirty rotten commie pinko 
protectionists" has said that some medical specialties are just too important 
to restrict.  

As I have said before, I favor the unfettered import of all doctors we 
possibly can get. Of course, the doctors have organized far more than the 
programmers, et al, and have raised the standard for foreign doctors (making 
them get a higher score on a test than American doctors), so as to restrict 
the supply.

A few genuine *scientists* are another case of a common good. Of course, 
globalist dogma says if A is good, then B-Z is also good. So now we are 
lowering our standard of living because of a flood of legal and illegal 
foreign labor.  
And now we have our own govt facilitating job outsourcing.

Like hell, if it is intelligent enough to accumulate resources and transport
itself it is *REALLY* dangerous (and that does *not* require much intelligence).
That is why my hat is off to Eliezer for pointing out the problem of an
unfriendly AI.  (Take SARS and multiply it by many orders of magnitude and
one gets the hazard level of an unfriendly AI).

But one doesn't have to deal with only unfriendly AIs.  It appears that unfriendly
viruses have this capability (look at influenza epidemics).

Perhaps.  Our ethics/values have been dictated by survival requirements
(better to have friends than enemies).  A novel AI need not have such
restrictions.  (Just program a berserker -- screw the consequences.)

I would say that "malevolence and unnecessary destruction" would fall
into the category of "entropicness".  The more "organized" resources
one destroys the fewer resources one has to advance extropicness.
One could look at a simple scenario of what the resources cost that the
U.S. devoted to the reconstruction of Japan or Germany after WWII
that might have been better devoted to scientific (or other types)
of research.

### I notice you have a penchant for starting your posts with a contemptuous
dismissal of your adversary's opinion, followed by reasoning which doesn't
convince me. If I had the patience of an angel, I would refrain from
adjusting my argumentation to your style (as I did in "Inane commie drivel")
and would start the arduous task of explaining exactly what is so
unconvincing in your post. However, I don't have this useful character
trait. My imperfection.

But, since I already started answering you:

I know that you know that nobody is purchasing slave labor in the global
economy. It is an effective argumentative ploy to redefine the meanings of
words (in the spirit of Newspeak), so that your enemy can be spit upon with
greater conviction. So you call Nike a slave-driver, although you know very
well that Nike could not be classified as a slave-owner, or purchaser of
slave-labor, by any stretch of imagination. You know that instead of
enslaving people, the global economy makes them graduate from the wretchedly
poor, to merely poor, or from poor to low-class affluence. I don't know why
you make your argument against giving low-paying work to the destitute, but
it's clear that you are trying to manipulate definitions to elicit emotional
reactions which could make simpler minds follow your lead.

While still at a very early stage, a small company 
in the US is turning to antimatter as a potential 
form of particle therapy. PBar Medical is currently 
using antiproton beams at CERN to investigate the 
effects of antiprotons in biological material.
Antiprotons exhibit the same Bragg peak as protons, 
but when they meet protons and neutrons at the treatment 
site, they annihilate to produce gamma rays and high energy 
particles that cause further damage to cancerous cells. 
Antiprotons might therefore be much more effective than
protons, although this remains to be demonstrated.
- Physics World March, 2003 p12 - 

"For antiprotons no data on dose profile vs. depth in biological medium
exist and we can therefore not determine the absolute absorbed dose for
the different slices. Furthermore, the requested beam time is not
sufficient to measure the dose profile. Instead, we introduce a new
quantity, the biological effective dose ratio (BEDR), which will allow
us to extract meaningful biological data without absolute dosimetry.
Because antiprotons behave nearly identical to protons in the plateau
region we can use standard dosimetry methods to determine the relative
plateau dose."
http://doc.cern.ch//archive/electronic/cern/preprints/spsc/public/
spsc-2003-020.pdf

"Just as with protons or heavy ions, antiprotons can be used to deliver 
radiation to the body in a controlled way; however antiprotons will 
exhibit additional energy deposition due to annihilation of the 
antiprotons within the body. The slowing down of antiprotons in matter 
is similar to that of protons except at the very end of the range beyond 
the Bragg peak."

Last month there was a thread about measuring the speed of gravity and
discussing whether it was equal to the speed of light (popular) or 
whether it might be instantaneous.

A report was published in Feb 2003 claiming that Jupiter had been used
to measure the speed of gravity.

http://www.jupiterscientific.org/sciinfo/sog.html

An update has now been published discrediting the previous claimed
measurements.

http://www.jupiterscientific.org/sciinfo/sogupdate.html

The latest state of play is:

"The relation cg = c in Einstein's gravity theory is fundamental.
Theorists believe it to be true. Unfortunately, it has not yet been
established experimentally. The most likely way that his equality will
be checked will be by a gravity wave detector such as LIGO (Laser
Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory) or its successors. If a
faraway catastrophic astrophysical event occurs that sends out both
light and gravity waves and both are detected to arrive at Earth at the
same time, then cg = c can be verified".

--- Lee Corbin reported the as yet unconfirmed
"elimination" of ML from the list.   

HOWEVER, note the following from Natasha's post
regarding upcoming list changes:

****In September, when the new lists are generated,
everyone's slate will be wiped clean and anyone who
has left the list will be welcomed back.**** 

By my reading that means that 19-49 days from now
Mike--if his participation has in fact been
curtailed--will be welcomed back.

Did no one notice the above phrase and its import, or
is it like the oft-ignored prefatory phrase to the
second amendment: "A well regulated militia, being
necessary to the security of a free state, ..."? ;-}

Yeah, sure, we saw it. But we couldn't let something like that spoil the fun,

I think you are right, if you consider making derogatory comments about a man

I'm really glad to see you write this. I think it is a huge problem with the
global economy, and really needs to be high on the agenda for anyone
proposing free trade.

OTOH, although free trade causes some (hopefully) short term problems
because of restriction of movement, it may also eventually create the
pressure which finally busts borders open. Let's hope so.

Ok, but such a berserker would presumably be the first auto-evolutionary AI
created by humans if it were to have a chance of fulfilling its dark
purpose. Where technological evolution tends to follow double-exponential
progress curves (kurzweil), it would seem unlikely that a malevolent
AI(2),(5), or (7) could ever technologically overtake (threaten) an evolving
AI(1).

Ok, it's assumed here AI(1) turns out to be friendly or at any rate
loves/esteems/respects its progenitors sufficiently to dedicate minute
resources to protecting us from subsequent rogue AI systems and accidents.

In respect to the rise of human ethics and values, I think it might be more
precise to say they've been 'influenced by survival requirements' rather
than "dictated by survival requirements" since we are presumably talking
more about memetic evolution than legacy genetic.

Why sure.  Just as sure as it would help you if you were a brilliant software 
genius dedicated to using your skills to increase the effective intelligence 
and knowledge of humankind.    Tools are tools.  Their uses, good or bad are 
up to individuals and individual groups.  There is no way to restrict 
tools/information/algorithms in such a way that only good uses can possibly 
come from them and only the good are empowered by them.  That is a pipedream.

Why on earth (or anywhere more sane especially) would such a think lead to

Sometimes Mike posts really good stuff.  Many times though he is very 
confrontational and not above being quite insulting and engaging in ad 
hominem among other ills.  I can't imagine how anyone could read this list 
for any amount of time without noticing this.

What do you mean by "exclusive labor market access" exactly?   Are you 
implying in the above that charging the most for your labor and the most for 
your products is what is wonderful about this country and should always be 
protected?   Do I read you right?  If so I strongly disagree.

If your labor is cheaper (including automation), then your unit cost are lower 
and the saving can be passed on to the consumer.  Where do you have a 
problem, if you do, with that?

Existence proof please.  Could we please have an AI that even remotely 
approaches human level intelligence in practice *before* we start talking 
about restricting the field in various probably draconian ways?    At this 
point, based on actual AI in practice rather than unsubstantiated theory, I 
ranke the changes of a "berserker" AI being released any time soon and most 
certainly statistically insignificant.  

As far as your last sentence though, there is a simple existence proof.  There 
are many millions of beings on this planet with human-level intelligence who 
are missing any degree of ethics and values that effectively check some of 
the worse possible actions.   Of course not much can be said for much of what 
generally passes for human ethics and values.    Certainly normal human 
ethics and values are likely insufficient for a super-human intelligence.

Well, with a good AI based "smart" retribution collateral damage should be at

If the seed AI exponential self-amplification scenario is true,
then this approach will of course be too late. In that scenario,
the only policies seem to be to call for draconian restrictions,
centralising the project (into whose hands?) or have a
free-for-all to become Mother of God. 

The problem is indeed that we do not have any good theory or 
evidence that the seed AI scenario is feasible or likely. This 
is where IMHO *we* really can make a difference, by doing good 
thinking and research into the issue. If one can show seeds are 
unlikely (say by demonstrating that general intelligence is 
computationally very hard to enhance) or possible (say by a 
existence proof that such a program can exist) then the 
discussion becomes much more informed. 

The precautionary principle in its active form suggests that we
should actively find ways of protecting ourselves from the risks
of a bad AI even if it is an unknown factor; friendliness theory
is a start, building institutions is another. But that 
shouldn't distract us from actually getting a better knowledge 
of the problem.

Well *I'm* not that good a programmer, and possibly, on
some days, I am a *bit* socially dysfunctional (but please
don't tell anyone).

I think what your saying is *generally* true but this *might*
be a special case. 

I don't know exactly what having access to the first planet
destroying "doomsday device" for instance would do even
to me psychologically. I might develop a meglomanical 
streak and demand in godlike fashion that the world leaders
get their shit together proto, that all weapons budgets be
immediately frozen at current levels and turned into foreign
aid budgets aimed first at funding global vaccination and
later at education programs for the soon to be voting third
world's women so they can be prepared to take their place
at the new UN as citizens of the world. From now on *I'd*
be making and enforcing peace and some security at the
international level for everybody dammit! 

Emboldened by my besotted and faithful attack dog AI 
(Rover), in my meglomanical beneficience I might inform 
the heads of all UN nations states that the *next* major
border incursion by any military force would result in my
letting Rover and Rover's mind children loose on the
offender. And, btw, an AI generated trojan horse, which
I quixotically name Godels ghost has now made its way
onto the worlds financial systems and all the worlds
terrorist organisations need only tune their receivers into
say a nominated hyjacked satelight for the engineering 
specs for quantum computer cryptography (which 
contains a backdoor known only to Rover the AI.)

Anybody pisses me off 'cause they ain't say giving
women the vote fast enough, or enacting certain nice to
have legislation, then I can empower their most bitter 
enemy to do their worst to them. Rover ain't social,
Rover is sociopathic with exceptional understanding
of psychology, and game theory and profiling based
on patterns without empathy, Rover is the emotional
puppy in a strikly two person pack. Rover has no
sex drive because Rover is immortal and doesn't need
to breed. 

Pretty soon the whole world might stop being divided into
two camps for and against this new kick arse dude with 
Rover the AI and start to feel a bit patronised particularly as
they become better educated. Fortunately with my AI I had
the sense to anticipate such a pychological outcome and
so (just in case) I e-hijack another persons identity very
early on in the process and so when everyone unites to 
oppose Rover and Rovers owner that they are lead to
"believe" Rovers owner is not Brett but Samantha! ;-)

That was kinda fun if self-indulgent, but seriously, I *am*
genuinely interested in what folks who know more about
AI, than I do, folks like Eliezer and Anders whose 
knowledge bases are informed by something more solid 
than my mere intuitions that seed AI is not going to be
easy at all and therefore is likely to be neither a planet 
busting threat (soon), hooray!, nor a magical boost to the
singularity (soon), bummer!, would make of the open
question "Is it safe to distribute knowledge about how
to build AI's to just anyone?" I was keen to see what 
sort of framework or answers might be offered because
I wanted a kickstart on the reasoning process and I
wanted to know how concerned I should be.

You may well be right. I think it bears thinking rather than 
just guessing or believing about though.

Or a nightmare possibly! My preference is we put the

No. But I'm going to try and keep my wits about me; about
real dangers, to me, to the folks I care about which are a 
pretty wide group these days. I've even taken a liking to 
some sassy, sometimes contrary, extropic types, whom I've
never even actually met ;-)

At least one of my ancestors, (possibly a shared one with you
if we go back far enough and do the math), probably did play
with fire *in* the cave and possibly emerged in a hurry 
because they'd accidently set fire to the place.

Defence against threats, real and imagined, are one of the
*oldest* influencers of public or community policy. Fear *is*
pretty primal. As is the reaction of uniting in the face of a 
"perceived" common enemy.

### You know I agree with you here. These are illegitimate restrictions of
trade, harming all Americans, except for a few fat-cat old docs.

I also think that programming, transcriptionists, gardeners, and burger
flippers are too important to be restricted. You see, I think that doctors
are not in any way different from other professions in terms of importance,
so it makes sense to treat everybody like doctors.

### So how much poorer did you, the average American, become in material
terms (stock options excluded) in these years of relentless assault from
abroad? The SUV's and homes are getting bigger and bigger, soon the
impoverished Americans will have to build wider roads to accommodate them.

You will need to import a lot of poor people to build them for you.

### So where is the analogy? You are one of the Founders? You built this
country? You hammered the nails in the Transcontinental Railway?

Nah, the analogy goes like this - you are a junior partner, who wants to
take over the firm built by generations, stop hiring workers who are cheaper
and maybe better than him, and wants to get paid by seniority instead of
real work.

### OK, I know where it starts, but what does it mean?

My ethical system begins with "The qualium of desire may not be denied", but
I bet you might be surprised that it leads me to e.g. advocate compulsory
liability insurance in certain situations.

What practical injunctions do you derive from the good professor's dictum?

### I don't know who is Dennis Kozlowski. Al Capone's progress came at the
price of losses to a lot of people, and represented a net loss to the
economy. Therefore, in agreement with what I wrote above, it was not
progress, and he was a bad thing to happen.

### Well, his workers kind of liked the way he paid them, and the customers
liked his cars, there were no bodies dumped in the river (AFAIK), so I
couldn't judge him harshly, although I am sure that if his greed and
ambition were not acting within something resembling a free market, he would
be happy to be a very bad person, as exemplified by his collaboration with
and support of the Nazi party. I've known it for a long time, but for me
it's the outcome, not the intention, that matter in social analysis (which
is different from daily life, but this is a different story).

### Define "fairness" and "justice". And every two-bit dictator, preacher,
demagogue, or union boss has his own private definition, too.

My "Average income in constant dollars", "Rawlsian observer", are about as
clear-cut as it gets. You cannot hijack them to your own benefit, because
they are much more observer-independent, reason-based, than the
feeling-based categories of justice and fairness. This is why I suggest
using them in the formulation of ethical systems which are supposed to serve
large numbers of people, in fact, all people who want to live long and
prosper.

They say Torquemada had the makings of a saint. Is the world better off
because of him?

I am a consequentialist.

### One of the best methods of creating wealth is to free slaves (so they
happily work and enrich themselves and everybody else, instead of having
labor wrested out of them by overseers). A good method of making the tenth
child of poor parents richer, if you don't have the money to pay for his
schooling, is to give him work (rather than have him starve). As I mentioned
above, removing the legal and customary impediments to economic progress of
women, allowed a great creation of wealth, and righted a great wrong at the
same time. Racial and ethnic discrimination is one of the major limits to
wealth creation and is ruthlessly punished by a free market.

Some animals are more equal than others, huh? Sorry, bud. This is America. 
All American CITIZENS are equal with respect to the constitution.  Maybe you 
want to move to a country where Investors and Entrepreneurs are elevated as 
demigods above the hoi polloi. Oops, that's right--neoconservative propaganda 
is already well on its way to making America into just that.

The extraordinarily pompous phrase "ad hominem" now joins two others "level

having the distinction of having never been used to support any position I

Boost Your Brain Power: Creatine, A Compound Found In Muscle Tissue, =
Found To Improve Working Memory And General Intelligence
Research undertaken by scientists at the University of Sydney and =
Macquarie University in Australia has shown that taking creatine, a =
compound found in muscle tissue, as a dietary supplement can give a =
significant boost to both working memory and general intelligence. The =
work, to be published in a forthcoming Proceedings B, a learned journal =
published by the Royal Society, monitored the effect of creatine =
supplementation on 45 young adult vegetarian subjects in a double-blind, =
placebo-controlled experiment.

"The level of creatine supplementation chosen was 5g per day as this is =
a level that has previously been shown to increase brain creatine =
levels. This level is comparable to that taken to boost sports fitness," =
explains Dr. Caroline Rae who led the research. "Vegetarians or vegans =
were chosen for the study as carnivores and omnivores obtain a variable =
level of creatine depending on the amount and type of meat they eat - =
although to reach the level of supplementation in this experiment would =
involve eating around 2 kg of meat a day!"=20

Creatine power

Athletes and fitness fanatics have known that creatine supplementation =
can increase sports performance and the compound - a close relative of =
the amino acids - has also been trialed successfully in the treatment of =
neurological, neuromuscular and atherosclerotic disease. "We know that =
creatine plays a pivotal role in maintaining energy levels in the =
brain," says Dr. Rae. "So it was a reasonable hypothesis that =
supplementing a diet with creatine could assist brain function."=20

The experiment tested this hypothesis by giving the one group of =
subjects a creatine supplement and a second group a placebo for six =
weeks, followed by a six week period with no intake and a final six week =
period when the control and placebo group were swapped. Intelligence and =
memory were tested at four points: the start of the trial; the end of =
the first six week period; and the start and endpoint of the final six =
week period.=20

Testing tasks

The effect on working memory was tested using a backward digit span test =
in which the subject has to repeat in reverse order progressively longer =
verbal random number sequences. Intelligence was tested using Ravens =
Advanced Progressive Matrices - a methodology commonly used for IQ =
assessment involving completion of pattern sequences. The test is a well =
validated measure of general ability with minimal dependence on cultural =
factors. "Both of these tests require fast brain power and the Raven's =
task was conducted under time pressure," says Dr. Rae. "The results were =
clear with both our experimental groups and in both test scenarios: =
creatine supplementation gave a significant measurable boost to brain =
power. For example in the digit span test subjects ability to remember =
long numbers, like telephone numbers, improved from a number length of =
about 7 to an average of 8.5 digits."=20

The study shows that increased creatine intake results in improved brain =
function, similar to effects shown previously in muscle and heart. The =
results agree with previous observations showing that brain creatine =
levels correlate with improved recognition memory and reduce mental =
fatigue. "These findings underline a dynamic and significant role of =
brain energy capacity in influencing brain performance," says Dr. Rae. =
"Increasing the energy available for computation increases the power of =
the brain and this is reflected directly in improved general ability."=20

A short term boost?

Long term supplementation with creatine has yet to be declared truly =
safe as there have been reported effects on glucose homeostasis (the =
regulation of blood sugar levels) and potential subjects with a medical =
history of diabetes were excluded from the experiment. In addition =
taking the supplement can have some antisocial effects. "To be frank =
taking the supplement can make you a considerably less 'fragrant' =
person," says Dr. Rae. "However creatine supplementation may be of use =
to those requiring boosted mental performance in the short term - for =
example university students."

 I suspect you have a very inaccurate estimate of how productively 
hospitals use their money. I'd guess it takes well over $10 million
of typical hospital spending to produce an expected savings of one life.

 The hard choices are more likely to happen when the doctor says there's
a small chance that the $1 million will save the child. The doctor is
likely to overestimate his abilities, and the administrator could easily
overestimate his ability to save lives by putting the money to better
uses. So it's not clear that there's anyone who can be trusted to make
the right decision.

That may be, but how much more malice is generated through honest
mistakes?  Its natural to think that if someone does something that harms
us that harm must have been their intent (and I'm sure Eliezer can give a
better description than me as to why), but in the complex world we live in
its hard to judge the impact of our actions on everyone they effect, even
if we do try.  When someone stupidly argues for/against the war with Iraq,
or immigration your opponent is probably not out to destroy America, and
it pays to remember this.

 Subj:  Longevity Vs. Retirement Age 

The pension funds in many large corporations (e.g., Boeing,
Lockheed Martin, AT&T, Lucent Technologies, etc.) have 
been "Over Funded" because many "late retirees" who 
keep-on working into their old age and retire late after the 
age of 65 tend to die within two years after their retirements. 
In other words, many of these late retirees do not live long 
enough to collect all their fair shares of pension money such
that they leave a lot of extra-unused money in the pension 
funds resulting in the over-funded pension funds. 

Dr. Ephrem provided the important results in the following
Table 1 and the associated chart from an actuarial study of life 
span vs. age at retirement. The study was based on the number 
of pension checks sent to retirees of Boeing Aerospace. 

Table 1  Actuarial Study of life span vs. age at retirement.

Age at Retirement     Average Age At Death 

         49.9                         86 

         51.2                         85.3 

         52.5                         84.6 

         53.8                         83.9 

         55.1                         83.2 

         56.4                         82.5 

         57.2                         81.4 

         58.3                         80 

         59.2                         78.5 

         60.1                         76.8 

         61                            74.5 

         62.1                         71.8 

         63.1                         69.3 

         64.1                         67.9 

         65.2                         66.8 


Table 1 and the chart indicate that for people retired at the
age of 50, their average life span is 86; whereas for people 
retired at the age of 65, their average life span is only 66.8. 
An important conclusion from this study is that for every 
year one works beyond age 55, one loses 2 years of life span 
on average. 

The Boeing experience is that employees retiring at age of 65
receive pension checks for only 18 months, on average, prior 
to death.  Similarly, the Lockheed experience is that employees 
retiring at age of 65 receive pension checks for only 17 months, 
on average, prior to death.

Dr. David T. Chai indicated that the Bell Labs experience is 
similar to those of Boeing and Lockheed based on the casual 
observation from the Newsletters of Bell Lab retirees.  A 
retiree from Ford Motor told Dr. Paul Tien-Lin Ho that the 
experience from Ford Motor is also similar to those in Boeing 
and Lockheed. 

The statistics shown in the Pre-Retirement Seminar in
Telcordia (Bellcore) indicates that the average age that 
Telcordia (Bellcore) employees start retirement is 57. 
Therefore, people who retire at the age of 65 or older are 
minority as compared to the number of early retirees. 

The hard-working late retirees probably put too much stress
on their aging body-and-mind such that they are so stressed 
out to develop various serious health problems that forced 
them to quit and retire.  With such long-term stress-induced 
serious health problems, they die within two years after they 
quit and retire. 

On the other hand, people who take early retirements at the
age of 55 tend to live long and well into their 80s and beyond. 
These earlier retirees probably are either wealthier or more 
able to plan and manage their various aspects of their life, 
health and career well such that they can afford to retire early 
and comfortably. 

These early retirees are not really idling after their early
retirements to get old. They still continue doing some work. But 
they do the work on the part-time basis at a more leisure pace 
so that they do not get too stressed out. Furthermore, they have 
the luxury to pick and chose the types of part-time work of real 
interest to them so that they can enjoy and love doing that "fun" 
work at a more leisure pace. 

The late retirees are small in number, tend to die quickly after 
retirement and disappear from the population of old people
beyond the age of 70.  Late retirees, therefore, have very little 
weight on the statistical average life expectancy of the population 
of "old people" dominated by the early retirees. 

Conclusion and Recommendations  - 

When you get older, you should plan your career path and
financial matters so that you can retire comfortably at the age 
of 55 or earlier to enjoy your long, happy and leisure retirement 
life into your golden age of 80s and beyond. In retirement, you 
can still enjoy some fun work of great interest to you and of 
great values to the society and the community, but at a part-time 
leisure pace on your own term. 

On the other hand, if you are not able to get out of the
pressure-cooker or the high-speed battleground at the age of 
55 and "have" to keep on working very hard until the age of 
65 or older before your retirement,  then you probably will die 
within 18 months of retirement. By working very hard in the 
pressure cooker for 10 more years beyond the age of 55, you 
give up at least 20 years of your life span on average.

'What happened to Ted?'
http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/news/2003/08/12/williams_si/?cnn=yes

Ignoring the 'isn't-this-grisly-and-goofy?' slant, I wonder, are the
facts right? If Ted Williams wanted a full-body suspension, then
something seriously went wrong.

This is the primary reason why I think people should be judged on the
consequences of their actions, instead of their motivations.  Since we
can never truly know someone's motivations, but we can much more
objectively determine the consequences of their actions.  Besides, it is
entirely unclear whether (good intentions) + (ignorance) has caused more
harm in the world or (evil intentions) + (intelligence) has.  Those who
commit ills with their good intentions + ignorance are never encumbered
by such nuisances as a guilty conscience.  Witness the banning of DDT,
done with entirely good intentions, has now lead to the death of more
than 20 million people, mostly children in Africa, which otherwise would
not have died.  At the height of DDT spraying deaths from malaria
numbered in the single to low double digits every year.  Now they number
in the millions.

Extropes,

This is a *good* thing!

STEM CELLS: Scientists Create Britain's First Stem Cell Line

(link below)

Reason. 1. The UK which (now) has the worlds most liberal
stem cells laws (excepting perhaps China and those that don't
really have laws) but was not as advanced as other places
(like the US and Australia) has now caught up (or imo) even
passed the high water mark set by these countries.

Reason 2. The cell lines will be available to researchers
unencumbered. Think open source in terms of accelerating
rates of understanding. Think less toll gates on the product
development highway.

Reason 3. Because embryos are allowed to be created to
around the 5 day stage from people known to have diseases
(such as Parkinson's) etc. The resulting stem cell lines (cells
taken from the Inner Cell Mass of the blastocyst (= 5 day
old embryo) can give vital clues into the how a genome with
Parkinson's develops. And thereby offers better (more
focussed, cheaper, quicker) drug discovery.

As Robert Bradbury is wont to say on occasion. Today
is a good day to be an extropian :-)       - and a person.

Brett

STEM CELLS: Scientists Create Britain's First Stem Cell Line

http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/nm/20030813/sc_nm/health_brit
ain_stemcells_dc_2

"LONDON (Reuters) - Scientists said on Wednesday
they had created Britain's first human embryonic stem
cell line, clearing the way for more research into
diseases including diabetes and Parkinson's.

The team, at King's College London, said the new line
 -- a string of many identical cells -- would be deposited
 in the Medical Research Council's $4.2 million stem cell
bank, which was launched last year.

Stem cells hold the promise of treating a range of medical
conditions but their use is controversial because although
they are found in adult tissue, the most flexible stem cells
come from early embryos.

In this case, the researchers said they obtained three stem
cell lines from 58 embryos. Two cell lines perished but the
remaining one had now been growing for many months.
"We are very excited about this development," said Dr
Stephen Minger, one of the leaders of the team whose
work was published in Reproductive BioMedicine Online.
"Human embryonic stem cells are found in the earliest stages
of development and are capable of giving rise to all the
different types of cell in the body. This means their possible
therapeutic uses are almost endless."

Minger told Reuters the researchers were particularly
interested in research aimed at generating new cells for
transplantation in diabetes and Parkinson's disease .. and
possibly also for patients with heart disorders.

Traditionally, stem cell lines have been created with great
difficulty using cells from embryos surplus to IVF, which
are often of poor quality. But in this case, high-quality
embryos were donated by women undergoing pre-
implantation genetic diagnosis because they were known
to be at risk of passing on serious genetic disorders if they
had children.

Only embryos unaffected by these disorders were replaced
into the women. Cells from the remaining embryos, which
were unsuitable for replacement and would normally have
perished, were used to generate the stem cell lines.

The Kings College team was one of the first two laboratories
in Britain to be granted a license by the Human Fertilization
and Embryology Authority to generate human embryonic
stem cells.

Excellent post! Right in line with my recent thoughts.  This really belies 
the growing neoconservative "arbeit mach frei" propaganda that has helped 
lead to the increasing age at which one may draw SS benefits (was 62, now 65, 
soon to be 67).  We need to take a look at what we are doing, and decrease 
the SS eligible age even if we have to greatly reduce benefits.

FWIW:  In Africa they still spay with DDT.  The mosquitos, however, have 
evolved various resistances that makes it less effective against them.  
(Avoiding it is one of the one's I've heard mentioned.)  So that 20 
million has some other explantion.  I can accept that "At the height of 
DDT spraying deaths from malaria numbered in the single to low double 
digits every year.", but resistances take time to evolve, so the 
argument doesn't carry (i.e., I can accept that if you mean single digit 
millions).

OTOH, DDT has many more effects than just killing off mosquitos.  I 
don't think we even know all of them, but most of the "side effects" 
that I've heard of have been deleterious, though not clearly in the same 
range as 20 million lives.  But then they didn't stop spraying, so that 
figure has to have some other explantion.  Possibly one that a bit more 
complicated, or possibly something as simple as "they changed their 
method of counting cases".  (You don't mention what the +or- error bars 
are.)

I agree that stupidity has probably cause far, far more human suffering
than malevolence, especially since its so much more common.  However, the
best methods of responding to stupidity is very differnet from the best
method of responding to malevolence.

If the DDT opponents had caused the spraying to stop with the express
purpose of causing all those deaths, we could punish them in some way so
as to deter other people from acting in such a horrible way.  On the other
hand, knowing that they would be punished for the wrong decision wouldn't
have affected the actions of a DDT opponent who sincerely beleived that
they were doing the right thing.

On the other hand, a malicious person with a sufficient threat hanging
over their head can be persuaded to act well, but a stupid person won't
improve in this way.  This makes it important to recognize which your
dealing with, and given that the normal human bias is to attribute actions
to bad will, thus my signature (which isn't stored on this particular
computer, unfortunatly.)

True.  But locking the barn door before the horse exists hardly seems like 
reasonable policy.  Too much paranoia now about some theoretical scenarios 
could very well rob us of the many benefits of all levels of AI, benefits 
that are very much required if we are to have the intelligence to chart our 
course wisely.

The precautionary principle is one of the worst notions I have ever 
encountered as it proposes to base policy on the ability to prove a negative.

Give me a break!  I personally have been victim of some real attacks on this 
list in the past.  So have others, many of whom are now gone.  To stick your 
head in the sand and pretend nothing bad ever occurred and we need do nothing 
different strikes me as tremendously uncaring, unobservant and at worse, 
dishonest.

### If you look at estimates of QALY cost for various procedures, you will
find that the cost varies between 2$ and 2 000 000$, depending on the
procedure. If the hospital already paid for all the cheap methods of
prolonging lives, indeed saving a million dollars by letting a child drop
dead would be the wrong thing to do. However, even in the US, and certainly
in the majority of hospitals in the world, a million dollars properly used
could buy more than 70 QALY, and thus should not be inefficiently invested
in this one young person, to the detriment of others.

Malice by definition excludes bad results from honest mistakes.  Malice 
requires deliberate harmful action.   For instance, I have a difficult time 
chalking up to stupidity actions by our government that given their premises 
and a bit of intelligence, look very much like planned implementation of said 
premises.  Yet most people refuse to see this because seeing it is 
frightening and dispiriting.  They would prefer to believe that these actions 
simply came from stupidity.    The premises may well be "stupid" but the 
carrying out of those premises required malice aforethought.

The particular purpose behind a bit of malice might be hard to discern, e.g., 
in the above the purpose of any position on that issue most likely had 
nothing to do with "destroying America".   Nor was I referring to simply an 
opposing position on some issue or other.  I don't consider the possibility 
of malice in such trite cases generally unless there is a likely connection 
to other observed actions of sufficient extensiveness and thought.   I am 
much more interested in cases where those in power seem to me to be executing 
a well thought out plan which is ignored under the rule-of-thumb of assuming 
stupidity instead of malice.  I am particularly interested when such apparent 
steps in a plan are more or less exactly what I would have done in their 
position if I shared their premises and worldview.     If we apply the 
bromide about stupidity vs malice too broadly we are apt to ignore too much.

Exactly. The problem is to keep a balance between worrying about 
possibilities and waiting too complacently. If we show that we care about 
the risks and want to minimize them, many people react favorably - but too 
much disaster scenarios may make people fearful. Showing that many worries 
are groundless is important to help research develop, but we should not be 
polyannas assuming everything automatically turns out the best.

Actually, in its simple and correct form it is just common sense. What you
react to is how it is *usually* used - "don't do anything until you have
proven it safe!" which is actually a misinterpretation of it (just look at
how it is stated in the Rio Protocol, as an example). The corrupted
version is unfortunately the one that is used most widely by conservatives
of all colors. The active form I mentioned (absence of scientic proof of a
danger is no reason not to proactively minimize dangers) can of course be
used to stifle development too, but judiciously used it makes a lot of
sense when venturing into the unknown.

A reply to dissenters.  I didn't want this to turn into a rant, but if  
you want proof, you want proof...

1)  Dehede011@aol.com: I know that corporate consolidation of economic  
power is OLD NEWS.  I said so.  I just presented the evidence in case  
you weren't aware.  Sorry if it was too obvious, but you asked for  
proof.  Those are the facts underlying the policy.  If you're looking  
for "policy proof" that follows here:

2)  As for whether I've "proven" anything I've claimed, my claim is the  
combination of the weak moral claim:

	a) You shouldn't buy products from people who are killing or enslaving  
people.

To which I take it there is no dissent.

(And the strong economic claim:)

	b)  Disclaiming of economic ties is bullshit - if you own a company  
who's doing dirty business, then YOU are doing dirty business.  Even if  
this support is "leveraged and hedged" against an index fund like the  
S&P 500 - your minimal ownership is still benefiting from the  
oppression of others. Supporting companies that do dirty-business is  
just dirty-business - funding them is participating.

Which is perhaps only slightly contentious - at least I haven't heard  
it denied.  I've heard the position defended (elsewhere) that the  
ability to corporately disclaim responsibility from investments is what  
led to the ascendency of the Western World.  On this point, it's not  
clear that this is a good thing AND it's not clear what would have  
happened had we insisted on personal responsibility from the outset.

Don't like it?

	"When he said, repent, I wonder what he meant" - Leonard Cohen.

(And the even stronger disenfranchisement claim:)

	c)  If there are no corporations NOT found in the nexus of  
killer-corporations (eg, companies owned by companies that profit from  
human slavery and killlings then our moral responsibilities (under (c)  
above) become somewhat abated and redirected under the general rule  
Ought Implies Can.

	( (cf. Columbia Water/Bechtel/PepsiCo, etc....  
http://www.trilliuminvest.com/pages/news/ 
news_detail.asp?ArticleID=250&status=CurrentIssue ) or Nike, etc.))

	d)  Ought implies can.

	Which simply means that you can only be required to do a thing if you  
can actually do it.  I take it this is uncontentious as well.  Maybe a  
Kantian might deny it - perhaps you can be required to do things that  
are impossible for you.  I don't know how that can be defended  
COMPLETELY though.

	e)  Which leads to the more generalized moral requirement that we  
CHANGE the economic system that supports consolidation of power under  
wicked people or more stringently enforce laws that prevent the  
wickedness both here and abroad.  This because we Americans CAN (eg. we  
vote, we can speak freely, we can run for office, participate in the  
political process, etc.)  If we couldn't we would probably be in the  
position of pre-revolutionary France and our moral responsibility would  
be revolution.  But it's not, so no point in talking that way YET.

(Here's where I get a little Libertarian on y'all:)

	f)  But the enforcement of existing laws (and the improvement of them)  
tends simply to protect the economic power of the "long money".

The empirical proof of this is simply to point out that Barclays is  
still on top along with those banks that the Bank of England and  
Barclays saw fit to give hand-outs too in the 1800's.  If law  
enforcement and government could solve this problem, THEY WOULD HAVE.   
If anyone wants to have a drawn-out discussion about how  
early-investment tends to play out in the medium-run (eg. 200-500  
years), we can do that.

The a priori proof would be that the "long-money" is able to manipulate  
short-term goals of individuals to it's best interests by simple  
behavioristic motivation - carrot, stick, fear, greed,  
enforcement->behavior.

(And the nasty conclusion:)

	g)  We must change the economic system that supports consolidation of  
power under wicked people.  This is our first civic responsibility (as  
opposed say to the moral responsibilities we have to our families).

While we might take "mini-steps" to only buy gas from minor companies,  
not to drive to work, to live like neo-Primitivists, this will only  
tend to increase the power of the "long-money" in the long run unless  
you can convert a significant (eg. more than a billion) number of  
people to this way of thinking.  (Perhaps this is what China OUGHT TO  
DO, but I don't know.)  BECAUSE technology will defeat primitivism,  
it's inevitable (witness who enslaved who from 1700-1800).

Followed by the policy proposal:

	h)  We need to enforce free-marketeer values FROM THE TOP DOWN and  
BOTTOM UP.

(I know, sounds vague and slogan-y.  Here's the what I mean:)

TOP DOWN - This means NOT starting free-marketing from the perspective  
of widgets and labor-hours and the companies that do that business, but  
from the point of view of Laws, Governments, Jurisdictions and  
Currencies.  Otherwise we end up with heavily protected "castles" of  
capital able to protect themselves by force and technology against an  
unwilling and rather upset mass of people.  (We'll assume that this is  
a BAD thing for the moment, pace the villianization of poverty by  
Rafal.  In any case, MOST people in that case would have a lower  
standard of living and would likely be upset enough to do something  
about it - "Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose.")

BOTTOM UP - It also means not starting free-marketing from the  
perspective of Corporations, but rather from the point of view of  
Individuals.  Individuals are the primary bearers of rights (perhaps  
pace Extropian dogma, I don't know.  But I know it can be defended  
either positively or negatively, that is if rights are defined  
positively or negatively).  And their freedom of movement, association,  
speech, etc. are to be released PRIOR to any release of Corporate  
Restrictions.

I believe the combination of these two "rights-movements" would  
significantly improve our chances for creating survivability as well as  
significantly put a stop to major human rights violations worldwide.

	g)  This means starting competing government services - competing  
currencies, competing social services, etc.  This can be done in a  
variety of ways.   I would recommend starting with Health services and  
exchange services to enable exchange of resources for the immediate  
improvement of the longevity issue.  I understand Bill Gates has a good  
idea in putting his money into infant mortality.  Bully for him.

(An aside - Bill Gates is a major blemish in the record for the  
Long-Money managers.  We can regard the Internet Boom as the deliberate  
effort on the part of the Long-Money to prevent the creation of further  
multi-billionaires.  I expect you all probably know  this, maybe I'm  
wrong?)

	h) This also means changing the laws so that they don't vigorously  
defend the rights of corporations against individuals and competition.   
In particular, freedom of exchange AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS would be a  
good start - the elimination of the national banking system and those  
systems which are dependent upon it.  This would have to start with  
political action.  In this regard, the Libertarian party is the best  
current venue INASMUCH as it is not being co-opted by the likes of Karl  
Rove and Rafal.

3)  Rafal's question is a valid one, "Should he be prevented from  
making an arbitrary exchange with consenting persons?"  The answer is  
yes - if you are exchanging human lives (perhaps any of the value which  
results from human lives), you should be prevented from making  
ARBITRARY exchanges of that kind.  You should be prevented by those  
morally responsible for that person's being - themselves, their friends  
and family, etc.  In any case, it should be the other way around - the  
political forces which exist to enable you to make such exchanges  
should be removed.  In today's world this means removing border and  
economic restrictions on individuals and political organizations FIRST  
while enforcing those rules on corporations.

4)  Dialectical Ad Hominem for Rafal:  On Nike's slavery commitments,  
20 seconds on google will get you all the information you need.  You've  
been informed, the responsibility is now yours.  (first reference:  
http://www.geocities.com/cslnews/ ).  It did, after all, make it to the  
supreme court.  WHY do you think that major US corporations ship their  
labor oversees if not to take advantage of cheaper labor?  Do you think  
that labor doesn't become inhumanely cheap so as to be morally  
equivalent with slavery?  Really?  Do you think that Government  
Protectionism for "long-money" corporate wealth isn't at the root of  
this problem?   I'm just trying to determine if you simply don't KNOW  
that it's going on or if you are trying to redefine words so that it  
doesn't sound so bad.

5)  A grammatical reply for Rafal:

Slavery is  vague word like other words "fraud" or "peace" or "bald",  
etc.  The point is simply to recognize the underlying phenomena to  
which it refers (people who work for less than $.01/day and can't go  
work someplace better or who are psychologically and/or politically  
dominated by their workplace so significantly that they can't leave.)   
You can call THAT phenomena BAD or GOOD, that is our choice.  You  
appear to be calling it GOOD.  I call it BAD.  As for word choice,  
"Slavery" is the closest single-word that I could think of that  
simultaneously described the situation (lack of financial freedom  
coupled with political/psychological domination transcending  
generations), if you have a better word, I'm happy to use YOUR WORD for  
THAT.

BUT if you think that obfuscating this issue into an issue about the  
meaning of words is going to CONVINCE THIS AUDIENCE, I sincerely hope  
you're fooling yourself.


6)  Bringing this back to Extropian(ism) - Extropians have a choice -  
Extropianism can be a form of elitism where the wealthy, powerful and  
extremely clever are brought into the new world of long-term-life OR it  
can be a form of liberation where the resources of all people can be  
used to benefit ALL people.  One might say that Pragmatism demands the  
former.  I say that Pragmatism demands the latter for two reasons, on  
policy and one pragmatic:
	a)  The goal of creating a mechanism capable of supporting Longevity  
(if not immortality) FOR ME or US requires both the technology and  
political climate to let it survive.  This means both gathering  
resources (an economic issue) and support (a political issue) for the  
effort LONG TERM.  Since concentration of power naturally leads to  
dissent, and dissent to war, a better tactic will be to create a stable  
political and economic environment in which everyone could (and would  
have a reasonable expectation TO) participate in extropianism.
	b)  The world created in which only people who were able to utilize  
the resources of other people for their own advancement and their  
detriment would be a massively competitive world (much like our own) -  
with long-term high-tech competition comes extreme risk.  Risk is BAD  
if you're trying to build a long-term survival machine.  Increasing  
risk by fostering conflict is stupid.  Oppressing a group of people  
fosters conflict - even if they are the (seemingly) weak and poor.

7)  Not that it's any of my business (being a newbie to the  
"extropians" list) but I will miss: Dehede011@aol.com if he leaves  
because of someone else's leaving.

Best Wishes,

Robbie Lindauer

I think you mistunderstood what he was saying.
Perhaps some initial harmful action is an honest
mistake, but how often is it the case that harmful
action is deliberately conducted in reply?

You have a good point, however it seems in general -
not solidly proven that I know of, though there have
been several studies leaning this way (e.g.,
Prisoner's Dillema overall optimal strategies) - that
it is better to err on the side of forgiving
intentional affronts, than on the side of getting
revenge for unintended harm.  (Especially if it leads
to concentrating on how to recover from and/or prevent
harm, whether or not it is intended.  For instance, a
government may promise not to burgle your house if you
leave the door unlocked, but if they have no reason to
come by that they claim is legitimate, what harm would
be done by leaving it locked while you're out?
Indeed, in that case, how would they even know,
without admitting their bad behavior?  This theory is
behind laws that routinely get evidence thrown out of
court.)

Well it looks like synthetic diamonds are catching up
in terms of production for both cosmetic as well as
semiconductor purposes.

Alcor's new era of "professionalism".

Larry Johnson got involved with Alcor somewhere around
the end of 2002, six months or so after the Ted
Williams affair broke.  Was groomed for the position
of COO by, apparently, Charles Platt, and took that
position around the beginning of July 2003.  At the
same time, July 3rd, he registered an internet domain:


http://www.freeted.com/

here's the link to the whois info:

http://www.betterwhois.com/bwhois.cgi?domain=freeted.com&x=39&y=18

Somewhere along the way he decided to cash in on the
Ted-Williams-at-Alcor affair.

How exactly this came about is still a mystery (to me,
at least).

Ahhh a summer of media frivolity.

### You seem to be using a taboo to reject a class of tradeoffs. You might
want to read Tetlock's article we discussed in the "Taboos" thread recently.
In effect you are arrogating to yourself the right to judge others, and to
bend their will to your ideas of what is good for them.

Not nice, IMO.

### Well, yes, this exactly what I deny - slavery is slavery, cheap labor is
cheap labor. Nike is not a slave driver.

### The following characteristics are true of slavery as defined by the
dictionary: All slaves are owned. All slaves are possessions. All slaves are
property. All slaves serve. All service by a slave is servitude. Or, as
described by Encarta, the definitive characteristics of slaves are as
follows:
Their labor or services are obtained through force;Their physical beings are
regarded as the property of another person, their owner; and They are
entirely subject to their owner's will.

All other uses of the word in this context are empty rhetoric. You might not
make much headway with this approach, at least not on this list. This is not
alt.politics.socialism.

Also, I would like to point out to you that, as is obvious to anybody who
read my posts, I do not consider the condition of having to labor for 1 cent
a day to be, as you wrote "GOOD". I stated (and you jeeringly commented on
it) "Poverty is wrong". Please do not try to demonize me be ascribing to me
a hatred and contempt for humanity.

The adequate words to describe the plight of those who are paid little by
global companies for their labor in e.g. Burma, are "poverty",
"disenfranchisement", "state oppression", and "oligarchy". More global
investment is the best cure for these ailments.

Well, I believe that the direction of the list is conformity. And also, it becomes a mutual admiration society. This is quite typical of many lists, and very human; but hardly, transhuman.

Alcor News Report:  8/13/03

=============================================================

      Renewed Ted Williams Controversy: An Interim Response


Earlier this year Alcor News reported that we hired Larry
Johnson, a nationally certified paramedic, to manage our
standby/transport work and emergency response capability.
Larry came to us with excellent references and was actively
helpful in implementing a major revision of our meds kits. He
participated in our March training sessions and also helped
to train paramedics in Phoenix and Florida. Larry became an
Alcor member and made no secret of this. He told a CBS TV
news team from Los Angeles that he had always wanted to see
the future, and he seemed to feel that cryonics would help
him to get there.

In two cases, Larry made a decisive difference by giving
emergency guidance over the phone. He helped to minimize
ischemic damage and made a radical difference to the
condition of the cryopatients in these cases. We were
impressed by his assistance generally, and were glad to have
him at Alcor.

Unfortunately Larry seemed to feel unhappy with some aspects
of Alcor. He had come to us from a very large, well-funded
paramedic facility where he had been better compensated.
Apparently he nursed a grudge to such an extent that he
provided a reporter at Sports Illustrated with confidential
information which seemed calculated to damage Alcor as much
as possible. The news item was picked up by The Associated
Press and triggered reports from sources such as The New
York Times and The Arizona Republic.

We were astonished and dismayed that a nationally certified
paramedic would behave in such a way, without any significant
provocation that we are aware of. We had done everything we
could to get to know Larry and verify that he was an ethical
person whom we could trust.

Fortunately Alcor has accumulated some redundancy among its
field team members during the past year. We can still respond
well in an emergency. In the meantime, in reply to some of
Larry Johnson's allegations, we are providing the news media
with information explaining that our procedures are
formulated to minimize damage, not create it.

In particular, the damage caused by fracturing when a
vitrified cryopatient is cooled to liquid-nitrogen
temperature is small compared with the cellular damage that
used to occur using glycerol as a cryoprotectant. While we
won't be entirely happy until the day when we achieve zero-
damage cryopreservation, we are absolutely convinced that
repair of simple fractures will be easy compared with the
reconstruction of cellular debris that used to be caused by
ice formation.

Also, when we use a perforator (a standard medical tool) in
our operating room to create two small burr holes in the
skull, this is a precaution enabling us to inspect the
surface of the brain during cryoprotective perfusion.
Observation of the brain is a safety measure to reduce the
risk of edema. Here again, we tolerate a small amount of
damage in the interests of avoiding much greater damage. (A
burr hole can be repaired even with today's medicine.)

Finally we must emphasize, contrary to news reports, that
Alcor has never collected "DNA samples" from its
cryopatients. Obviously Alcor has no need to collect "DNA
samples," since a neuropatient already contains billions of
DNA molecules. We may collect venous effluent samples during
the perfusion of a cryopatient, but the purpose of these
samples is to evaluate blood chemistry via standard lab
tests.

So far as we can tell, Larry Johnson took some of Alcor's
property away with him when he disappeared without warning at
the end of the weekend of August 9th and 10th. During the
preceding weeks he recorded conversations with Alcor
employees without notifying them or seeking their permission,
and he probably viewed confidential documents. We will be
taking appropriate action. Alcor must make a clear statement
that it will not be intimidated by the threat of bad press
and will not tolerate gross violations of its standard
nondisclosure agreement by employees or ex-employees.

We will provide additional updates when we have any
significant news to report. Currently we have been unable to
reach Larry Johnson via phone or email, despite repeated
attempts. If he has any statement to make regarding our
description of what we believe he did, we invite his
response.

You'd have to care to read it.

Basically - remove restrictions on currency and travel for individuals 
FIRST.  This would be by lifting immigration laws, removing currency 
restrictions, privatizing basic social services, eliminating 
opportunities for oligarchy generally.   Then, hold members of 
corporations personally responsible for the actions of the 
corporations.  There are too many specifics to list quickly.  Maybe I 
should draft some legislation.

What I said was:

"In any case, it should be the other way around - the political forces 
which exist to enable you to make such exchanges should be removed.  In 
today's world this means removing border and economic restrictions on 
individuals and political organizations FIRST while enforcing those 
rules on corporations."

Read better and snip better.  The ANTI-Competetive forces that would 
allow you to trade in human effort need to be removed, enabling the 
human "being traded" to bargain fairly for the value of their labor.  
These include the Limited Liability Corporation (in its various forms 
including the standard American C-Corp and S-Corp) as well as various 
legal restrictions on personal behavior (for instance the freedom of 
travel and the freedom of exchange - including the freedom to use 
alternate currencies such as Gold).

An aside - it's a typical and rather annoying practice called SELECTIVE 
SNIPPING.  No point in continuing if you're going to continue to not 
read what I've written.

Fine, it's BAD to use INHUMANELY CHEAP LABOR.  Are we now in agreement 
or is there something more to your position along the lines of "It's 
okay WHATEVER NIKE might be doing"?

In what sense is "Slavery" not MORALLY equivalent with FORCING people 
to work for $.01/day?
I didn't say they were the same thing, just that they were morally 
equivalent.  "Salva veritae" in moral distinctions.
If someone should be punished for enslaving someone else, they should 
be punished for forcing them to work in self-perpetuating sub-poverty 
conditions.

  As I said, if you want to make this a game of words, the only one you

"Slavery" IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER ABOUT IT.

My mistake, so you're in agreement that any humane (and Extropic) 
political program should include as a primary goal the lifting of the 
political conditions that contribute to chronic poverty and that 
Oligarchies, disenfranchisement, state oppression and unfair business 
practices are among the main causes thereof?

Not sure what you mean by "Global Investment" but I'd suggest an 
alternative for global investment as it is actually practiced today is 
the political elimination of the anti-competitive nature of oligarchies 
SUCH AS the policies of the United States, China, Burma and just about 
every-other state.  Otherwise your global investment is likely just to 
end up in the hands of the wealthy - as it always has.

The a priori argument is simple - if Nike is allowed to continue its 
current "Global Investment" strategy, it will use its economic power to 
perpetuate its power and in particular will invest in situations that 
will tend to keep labor cheap and profits high.  This will include 
sponsoring "sub-humane" labor conditions in third-world nations.  If 
they can find some military fiend to assist them in Burma, so much the 
better.  Similarly, the banks that own Nike will continue lending 
practices which empower those nation-states which enforce sub-humane 
labor to continue that practice as long as possible and will seek to 
create new slave-states wherever possible and profitable.

On the other hand, if we were to call the owners of Nike to account 
PERSONALLY for the actions of the corporation, for instance, by making 
it illegal to be an owner of a company that utilizes child-labor or 
forced labor or sub-poverty labor, then we'd have something worth 
talking about.

Best,

Robbie Lindauer

Maybe now we can more about AI, cryonics, crypto, networking, space travel,
and life extension. And less about gun control, patriotism, and emotional
attachment to one economic system versus another.

Conformity? You damn well bet... localized, consensual, emergent
conformity. Also known as consensus. Also known as having a platform. Without
that, any forum or organization lacks meaning and focus. Luddites are not
welcome on this list, nor are Flat Earthers, nor are Scientologists. Maybe
left-wingers and right-wingers shouldn't be welcome either. After all, we
don't subscribe to NRA or GOP mailing lists and rant about nanouploads, do we?

Maybe they should go off and found their own Extropian Gun-Nut or Extropian
Single-Payer Health Care or Extropian Europe Sux America Rulez lists... maybe
that will even memetically benefit Extropy overall by playing good cop/bad cop
with the public's perception of us (which one is the good one and which one is
the bad one depends of course on your frame of reference).

But IMHO the list is better off without the constant Samantha/Mike
flamewars. Of course if Mikes absence doesn't solve the problem then by the
process of elimination we'll know where the problem lies.

That being said, I actually agree with Mike on a lot of topics, particularly
free markets, gun rights, property rights, and individual responsibility. But
it's embarassing to have these views presented in a propagandistic,
confrontational, irrational manner. Decentralized systems work because they
work, not because they're the "American Way" nor because they have some sort
of privileged moral status. It's game theory and information theory, people,
not some kind of religion!

I'm still in shock over this.  Larry Johnson's actions may create the greatest storm Alcor has faced since the Dora Kent affair.  And as with that incident, I am convinced Alcor in the end will be vindicated.  But getting to that point may be a very long and hard road.

Dr. Jerry Lemler and his staff will need all the legal, financial and emotional support they can get.  And with Dr. Lemler fighting for his life against cancer, this could not have happened at a worst time.

best wishes,

Hi all,

I received the following request to sign a petition aimed at 
preventing the stoning of a Nigerian woman for adultery. 
Apparently a similar petition has been successful before. 

I have signed it but I am not going to forward it as it 
requests to people in my address book because I 
don't know that to do so would not be exposing them to
an email spamming scam.

Here's the quandry. 

(1) This seems like a very worth while petition to sign if 
something so easy to do can have such a positive outcome
and the technique could be used elesewhere.

But.

(2) Can someone with the tech knowledge please advise
on the safety of forwarding it? It asks for an email address
at the point of signing. Possibly that is the real danger point
where people would be exposing themselves to spammers
when trying to do something humane.

Its annoying, but it seems to me that it would be easy for
scammers (who'd be spammers) to use just such a tool.

This would gruesomely hilarious if our possible future lives hadn't been
put at risk by this vile prat. 

"In an exclusive Sports Illustrated shock report, Dr. Herbert W. Dickhead
today revealed events of unspeakable depravity conducted at St. Pancreas's
Hospital, where he was recently appointed Chief of Cardiac Surgery.

"`The scene I confronted when I entered the operating theater left me
feeling ill for days,' Dickhead told our reporter. `I think I caught
Traumatic Stress Disorder as a result, and I will be suing the hospital for
$79.63 million compensation. 

"`The room was filled with MASKED men and women wearing STRANGE GARB. No
sooner had the patient been wheeled in that they CHILLED the poor man's
body, and then CRACKED OPEN HIS CHEST! It was like a scene from the last
days of the Aztecs, and I don't mean the sports team. 

"`These fiends TORE OUT HIS LIVING HEART! And then, even as I ran from the
door to start up my website (please see Paypal link), they STITCHED IN A
DEAD PERSON'S HEART!'

"SI is sickened to read of these excesses. Readers are urged to send money
at once to Dr. Dickhead, who will be taking up his new position as Head of
Interment at Redemption Mortuary in Scrotum, Nigeria. We eagerly await his
report on the macabre way DEAD PEOPLE ARE BURIED IN THE GROUND, where they
quickly ROT INTO SLIME, at this comical yet horrifying establishment."

Well, I believe that the direction of the list is conformity. And also, it    
becomes a mutual admiration society. This is quite typical of many lists, and 
very human; but hardly, transhuman.                                           


You could say that about any group or forum that maintains any greater degree
of focus than, say, an unmoderated newsgroup or Slashdot in -1 mode.

I, for one, have no bones conforming to something I agree with in the first
place and have agreed with before I even knew there was a name for it.

Mike is right about a bunch of things, but all too many of them are noisy,
contentious 20th century brick-and-mortar issues that really are less
important to the fate of humanity than what's on-topic for this list. In the
year 2XXX, will the name or flag of any contemporary nation have any meaning
outside the field of history? Will scarcity-era "capitalism" be any less
laughable than scarcity-era "socialism"?

Diversity of opinion is important. So, let's start a
Paleo-Libertarian/Conservative Extropian list and outsource all debate
regarding non science/technology/memetics topics to there. If there is demand,
lets also start a corresponding Liberal/Socialist Extropian list. And leave
this list to people who put the word Extropian first and the modifiers second
(or absent).

This has nothing to do with Synthetic Diamonds, unless a radical new method

...and as for this list being mutual admiration society, as a matter of fact
I do admire the people on this list. Including Mike and Samantha... except
when they're aiming vicious little barbs at each other with the rest of us in
the middle. With the world so full of petty, snide, cynical, mean-spirited
nonsense perhaps a little mutual admiration is exactly what we need here.

So Larry Johnson was employed for a couple of months as
Alcors Chief Operasting Officer, what was he doing before
hand I wonder?

I do not know whether the statement that "....this company 
...indulged in activities .... including capital offenses against
the laws of our society" is true or not. 

If it is not true, I think there is a very good chance that Larry
Johnson has libelled himself.  If he spends a cent on anything
other than what he claims he is raising the money for then their
is also the question of fraud. 

There may be legal grounds to get the offending material
removed. Alcor clearly needs legal advice. 

Politically, of course, things are more complex. A legal battle
would generate publicity which is apparently Johnson's intent
and might throw brear rabbit into the briar patch, if it were 
poorly handled. 

It might also yet be managed to Alcor and cryonics net 
benefit depending on the facts. But the media as well as
the courts are the battleground on which this matter would
be fought out.  I don't know the facts.

Real attacks? You were knocked to the ground were you? What you really mean
is somebody produced a ASCII sequence you didn't like.  Criticized would be
a better word and we've both done it, hell you criticized me in your last
post but that's OK, I'll survive. I note that one person you didn't
criticize was Tim May last February, in fact you jumped on me when I said
May had lost his mind when he advocated  terrorist destroy Washington DC so
a lot of black people could be gotten rid of.  Apparently pushing for
genocide is forgivable but calling somebody a doo doo head is not.  Odd rule
for a list that is Extropian.

That seems a good suggestion, however, when, in month's past I have posted

that same result, though they should speak for themselves, and not me.

Bickering is very, very, human; but it doesn't seem to be transhuman, and 
that is what draws the mosts posts/reactions.

The story of this woman is a valid one, and Amnesty International is a
reputable organization. In their privacy statement they inform users that
they will not redistribute the information you provide except for the cause
in which you are providing it. Disclosure issues are elaborated here:
http://www.amnesty.org.au/privacy.html and would only be done if they were
required to do so by law (criminal or court reasons). There are no hidden
cookies used either, accept for their Australian site, which is non
identifiable. This is such an important cause, and since you will just be
forwarding an email to others that will provide a link to the form that
requests their email address, there is no apparent spam threat. I commend
your concern and have filled out the petition.

Such posts and urls are always very welcome, Mitch, and I'm sure are read
and saved by plenty of us. Few have enough deep knowledge to add anything
useful, though; hence, I think, the silence... not a matter of lack of
interest.

Keep 'em coming, pal!

I strongly second this, though I know how you feel, I read, save
or mentally note far more of the tech posts than I comment on. Also
because I don't read via the Javien BBS, my browsings don't show
up on the counter, so if your tempted like me to take that as some
gauge of interest, be aware that it is not picking up all browsings.

BTW: I posted an article on Stem Cell recently, that imo (and I do
feel pretty well placed to comment on the political  aspects in this
field) is something of a real political or social watershed. But the
breakthrough is not in the science per se, its in the acceleration
past the bottleneck that had formed in stem cell science politics
and social policy. My point is that sometimes the topics are of
such that the significance is not always obvious even to generally
bright folk.

In my case I also tend to post the occasionally rough and sloppy
post just to keep in contact, I'm not always on my best behaviour,
and that probably influences my credibility for other busy folks
too.

Regards,
Brett

Please don't post subject lines such as "Obituary for Mike Lorrey".  They

Excuse me but I do not accept the implication that I have been slinging 
vicious little barbs at Mike.  The few times when I thought I did go over the 
line I usually apolotized.  Compared to what I received I do not in the least 
deserve such an accusation.   I ask that you retract it immediately.

Do you really consider this highly biased recollection to be an accurate 
portrayal of the validity of my claim?  If so then I think you have done 
little for your credibility.

Meet the 'transhumanists' behind the Pentagon terror casino
By Andrew Orlowski in San Francisco
Posted: 05/08/2003 at 11:01 GMT

http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/32170.html

If there was an other-worldly feel to the news last week that the Pentagon 
was investing in an online futures exchange to reward terrorist atrocities, 
then the following few days have been even stranger.

Rather more than any 'sexed-up dossier', which is a dispute about the 
integrity of intelligence material, this episode tells us far more than we 
would have dared to guess about the protagonists and their motivations, and 
what they think 'intelligence' really is. While we've seen economists and 
pundits rush to the defense of the aborted 'terror casino', very few 
commentators have examined the curious ideological motivations behind the 
ill-fated Policy Analysis Market, which at times appear determined to outdo 
any occultist. The phrase "not of this world" might spring to mind as you 
read on.

Although the disgraced Iran Contra felon Admiral Poindexter duly carried the 
can - by Wednesday well-placed sources were leaking that he is to leave his 
post at the Pentagon's R&D division, DARPA - the idea was actually initiated 
before Poindexter arrived.

So let's meet the brainchild behind PAM, the blond haired and photogenic 
Robin Hanson, assistant economics professor at George Mason University. With 
phlegmatic good grace, Hanson announced the news on the Extropian Bulletin 
Board, that PAM had been axed. Hanson isn't himself an "Extropian", he says, 
but many of his followers are, so maybe it's a good time you were 
introduced. And since they're being touted as the radical out-of-the-box 
thinking that US foreign policy needs, we must not delay.

Yo! Hey! Meet the Extropians

"I am a 6 foot, 185 pound, 40 year-old, well-educated, married white male 
American, with two children. I have a wife Peggy, and sons Tommy and Andy," 
announces Hanson on his personal home page. All well and good so far, 
although you might be wondering why we needed to know his exact weight. Or 
that he's white. Both those details, and the fact that he's "well-educated" 
are pretty superfluous in Extropian circles, where the disciples are 
uniformly white and well educated. We're not sure if they all weigh 185 
pounds, but they're certainly very, very rich.

How did it start?

A few years ago a bunch of extremely wealthy Californians met, liked the 
look of each other a lot, and formed a group called Extropians. Revealed to 
the world in a Wired article in 1994 as "a philosophy of boundless 
expansion, of upward - and outwardness, of fantastic superabundance," their 
greeting was described in some quite painful detail, for us, thus:

"Right hand out in front of you, fingers spread and pointing at the sky. 
Grasp the other person's right hand, intertwine fingers, and close. Then 
shoot both hands upward, straight up, all the way up, letting go at the top, 
whooping 'Yo!' or 'Hey!'"

Extropianism, we were told, expoused "extremely advanced technology" and 
displayed "dedicated, immovable optimism". The hated gubberment got it 
particularly hard from these wealthy uberkinder, for whom the State was 
"regarded as one of the major restrictive forces in the Milky Way galaxy."

Employees of the government were mockingly described as "entropians". They 
felt entitled to mock the poor or stupid, and amongst this self-selecting 
circle this amounted to almost everyone else, because they were confident 
they themselves would write the history books.

But the most interesting thing about this ersatz cult was the amount of 
energy that its members devoted to wanting to live forever. To flee the 
surly bonds of mortality, once and for all, the Extropians devoted much of 
their disposable income (of which, there was much to dispose) to cryogenic 
research - deciding how to freeze themselves for eternal life, and deciding 
who amongst them Shall Be First.

Time will tell if any of this elite will succeed and have themselves 
cryogenically reborn in a future time, but that's what they're hoping for. 
But give them a plaudit for their imagination. While the eugenicists of the 
thirties had a simple solution, which was to sterlize or isolate the poor or 
the ugly, or the lumpenproletariat who didn't share their happy thoughts, 
the Extropians have found a clean and politically-acceptable solution, one 
as we will see, that is endorsed by today's hygienic punditocracy.

While Hanson disavows loyalty to any '-ism', he is true to his word in 
thinking outside of the box. Hanson was the ideal candidate to organize an 
online terror futures market, because the fellow has never met a futures 
exchange he didn't like. Or more accurately, he's never seen a problem that 
can't be fixed by setting up a futures exchange.

Hanson modesly describes himself as Jungian type 'ENTP', and helpfully 
points us to the explanation that Jungian type ENTPs "tend to be oblivious 
of the rest of humanity, except as an audience." Judge for yourselves.

Take the humdrum business of democracy. He advocates replacing one-man, 
one-vote elections with "values exchanges" - another form of market. He also 
proposes an ingenious idea of bugging the undereducated, idle 'entropians' 
(and that must mean us) called "Tax Leisure with Time Audits" which 
essentially involves bugging the hell out of any 'entropian' who hasn't 
developed an Extropian's sophisticated spam filters:

"The government could randomly check on each person say ten times a year, 
and see if they are working for wages at that moment," he gushes.

Intrusive? Hell, no.

"Of course to implement this each person would, when working for wages, need 
to be quickly contactable at random times, such as by staying at a desk, or 
having a cell phone or a beeper. But since most people will have such things 
for other reasons, the presumption could be that the exceptions are doing it 
to avoid taxes, and so failure to contact will be coded as not working for 
wages," explains Hanson.

He's full of such good ideas.

It's easy to mock the Professor as the kind of swot who grew up without 
having his head dunked in the toilet by the school jocks. But this time, 
it's serious. Not only is the Extropian ideology now blessed with Pentagon 
dollars, it's defended by our finest brains, in our most respected 
newspapers, and here we move on to the really interesting part of tthe 
post-PAM defense of the mystical market.

"Other-worldly" is not an insult in these elevated circles. On the Extropian 
BBS a warm profile of Hanson at US News was reprinted with the proud 
headline "Robin Hanson, economist for Starfleet".

Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft

Hanson's PAM provoked widespread public revulsion. But because it was billed 
as a "market" - the most mystical of things from which all wisdom must be 
divined - it was inevitable that interested parties who'd based their 
careers on upholding the divinity of the mechanism, rather than skeptics 
seeking to determine its flaws - should feel the most alarmed. Righteously 
alarmed, they didn't hang around.

First up to the plate was Berkeley economist Hal Varian writing in the New 
York Times. Varian, with Carl Shapiro wrote a dotcom book on marketing 
strategies that eschewed the dotcom hype, Information Rules. Highly 
recommended, and justifiably so, Varian has been excellent company when 
we've called on him to discuss pricing wheezes.

But the lush era of experiments is over, and somehow we found Varian 
throwing some extraordinary contortions in his Op-Ed piece last week.

Varian insists that "markets" provide answers answers we can't collectively 
work out for ourselves. Not only are they aggregators of knowledge, but they 
divine knowledge we couldn't arrive at through any other means, he says.

Marching into the firestorm of whether the PAM could help us predict 
terrorist atrocities, Varian offered us this:

"Markets do an awfully good job of forecasting many events and trends." So 
far, so speculative, but do carry on. "There is good reason to believe that 
a market set up to forecast the sort of political instability that leads to 
terrorism might work well, too."

Anything wrong with this picture?

Well, give him credit. Varian is quick on his feet: the forecast of events 
has been neutered into the far less specific forecast for "the sort of 
political instability" that might lead to an event, in other words, a 
terrorist atrocity. What sort, you might ask? OK, Varian now seems not to be 
claiming that the model predicts terrorist acts but the "sorts" [sic] of 
instability that might lead to a terrorist act. But to believe that, you 
have to believe there's a causal connection. Afghanistan, which after twenty 
years of civil war was probably at its most 'stable' when 9/11 struck, kinda 
disproves this. But let's see where Varian is heading. He's a man with a 
mission, only he's hedging his bets.

About a third of the way through, he tells us:

"If you were a potential target, wouldn't you want the best possible 
forecasts of possible attempts on your life? I would."

Ah, so. After all that, it seems, he's now decided that the market can 
inform us of specific terrorist atrocities and by cutting off its funding, 
we are all putting ourselves in grave danger.

Although Varian can't make up his mind whether PAM is good enough to predict 
possible factors "that might lead" to terrorism, or the devilish acts 
themselves, we must give him the benefit of the doubt and conclude that he 
is not suffering from multiple personality disorder, but merely producing 
rhetoric to serve his ideological cause. That might explain, if not forgive, 
his striking inconsistencies. He's committed to the idea that some 
collective intelligence, which we cannot explain rationally, resides in the 
market.

The San Jose Mercury's Dan Gillmor, for once gave up his redoubtable 
moralism to plead, "give them a chance". Dan, temporarily we hope, believes 
the approach deserves merit, although he doesn't say how, and he implies 
that there's power in the "hive mind". He doesn't say where you can find 
this wisdom, and this is the beauty of link-and-run blogging: you rarely 
have to explain yourself to your readers.

But a more coherent analysis is offered by Joseph Stiglitz, former chief 
economist to the World Bank, and Nobel Prize winner:

"If trading is anonymous, then it could be subject to manipulation, 
particularly if the market has few participants  providing a false sense of 
security or an equally dangerous false sense of alarm. If trading is not 
anonymous, then anyone with information about terrorism would be, 
understandably, reluctant to trade on it. In that case, the market would not 
serve its purpose."

Then, amazingly, Hanson himself added that PAM couldn't affect futures 
because the sums were so small. An acidic Stiglitz wondered how the market 
could be so omniscient, if it had to rely on good old fashioned government 
defense pork in the first place.

Market makers

Harmless fun? Well, over the past twenty years
economists have faced several choices. If you follow the funding and tinker 
over the minutae of how markets work, and create elaborate mathematical 
models based on the metaphysical, then you can if you're lucky, land 
yourself a tenure.

But all actions have their consequences, and to pursue such a path requires 
a certain hardening of the heart.

This week I've heard from one Silicon Valley engineer who has been downsized 
to work at Target, for $7.50 an hour. Breaks are regimented, and in her 
elderly fifties, she wondered if she could keep on her feet all day. I don't 
blame her. Another staffer told me she was being called in to work at 
Hewlett Packard - a crown in the jewel of Silcon Valley - just so she could 
retrain her replacement in India.

How is this so? If you want to be a Gillmor, you have to trust someone else 
to come up with the answer. However economists who want to ask why, and 
probe a little further, and ask why our economies keep failing, and our 
bubble keep bursting, typically don't get the opportunities that Hal Varians 
enjoy. There isn't an awful lot of money to sustain bad news bears. Some 
might even want to probe even deeper, and ask how we can maintain 
sustainable development, or even hope to motivate and train a prosperous 
middle class.

The Extropian answer is simple: such dunderheads will be left behind as we 
all lift off into space, making giddy whooping noises as we ascend.

Well, until last week we could dismiss these techno-utopians as a freakish 
cult, but now we know two things: they have they ear of the Pentagon, and 
they have powerful defenders in the shape of the New York Times op-ed page, 
and West Coast columnists. But there's an even more tantalizing narrative we 
can't entirely ignore.

When the current US administration decided it was going to invade Iraq, it 
set itself in direct opposition to the kind of institutionalized 
intelligence gathering which the CIA regarded as its preserve. Whatever you 
might think of the CIA, it is undoubtedly an American cultural institution, 
in the sense that terrible shame will be wrought upon those sons of the East 
Coast patriarchy who fail the clan.

Don't underestimate these Langley folks. The CIA may easily be satirized as 
an anonymous army of Agent Smiths, replicating at random, but this view 
underestimates the strong psychological sense that the CIA, and yes, it 
might be a paragovernment, capable of all the anti-democratic crimes that 
MI5 indulged in as it sought to undermine Wilson's democratically-elected 
Labor government in the mid-1970s, still feels ancient obligations to 
preserve The Republic. Like we say, you don't have to agree with it, you 
just have to grok that it feels its nose is very much out of joint right 
now.

Now what are they faced with? We have the 'Office of Special Plans', a 
short-circuited, privatized intelligence authority reporting directly to the 
executive. And, here, fresh on the scene, is a whacko Pentagon-funded 
research project that claims to know the unknowable - backed up by top 
columnists! - all through the power of markets. Or some such voodoo, they 
that can't even agree on.

Want to place a bet on how this one will work out? Contact our all-knowing, 
RSS-enabled Futures Exchange, please. We'll set one up as soon as we've 
parked your 'Hive Mind'.

But the last word must go to a researcher friend who must remain anonymous, 
when I ran the op-ed pieces by him last week.

"Let's send them up on their own in a plane. Then they can form a futures 
exchange to discover how to land it." ®

Sorry, but governments are not trying to increase the official
retirement age because of neoconservative propaganda.

The problem is that the money is running out.

The western European countries have a huge pensions problem looming over
them. It is so bad that even politicians who will do anything to remain
in power, are taking hugely unpopular measures like reducing pensions
and benefits and increasing the retirement age.

The aging population problem (people living longer and having fewer
children) means that fewer and fewer working people are paying taxes to
support more and more 'retired' people. And it will reach crunch point
in just a few years.

Many people are depending on company pensions for their retirement. But
since the stock market collapse and many companies going bust making
their shares worthless, company pension schemes are in big trouble. In
some cases the 'black hole' in their pension scheme fund is greater than 
the worth of the company. They are stopping new members to their old 
scheme and providing a much lower benefit scheme for new employees. And 
hoping that the stock market will recover enough before they have to 
meet all their pension scheme commitments.
Some people call this 'whistling in the wind'.

I entirely agree that early retirement is a good thing and will mean a
longer life, as the statistics from David A. Kekich show.

But, How to fund it?, is a non-trivial problem while we are still in a
resource scarce environment.

Samantha, the same of course could be said of you.  Do you really
consider *your* highly biased recollection to be an accurate portrayal
of the validity of *your* claim?  Obviously the person to best comment
on such a history would be someone with little interest in either side.
If anyone would be more likely to be biased, it would be those directly
involved.  I hardly think anyone here is an ultimate pervayeor of
absolute truth while everyone else is a raving biased lunatic.

Excellent point. But WHY is the money running out? You have bought into 
another neoconservation progaganda point. Yes, the money is running, but not 
because it has been given to the pensioners. There was always enough money to 
support the retirement of the taxpayers who FUNDED the social safety 
networks. 

The problem is really that we have failed to maintain control of our 
governments. They have gotten too distant from us, and now they see us as 
their livestock, instead of their bosses.  

Many of the govts of the western democracies have used the funds meant for 
pensions to instead provide perks for 3rd world immigrants and other 
noncitizens--in order to help attract them.  

I live in a city full a million of such immigrants, most of whom buy their 
food using in part an electronic card. I know. I wait in line behind them.

Who do you think pays for these cards? You and me through our Social Secuity 
taxes. These govts are in collusion with other large and powerful entities 
(business and media) that want ever more people crammed into the country. And 
we pay for the enticements.

Also, much of the SS tax money goes to special educational programs, such as 
bilingual education, and a veritable HOST of meaningless and worthless 
education and welfare seminars etc etc etc.  This stuff is bleeding our 
pension funds dry.  Our legion of govts from federal to local are out of 
control.

Early retirement is an extremely extropian goal, as shown by this inescapable 
evidence.  But what a surprise--we still have to consider old fashioned 
politics in order to consider attaining these goals. How mundane.....

http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/32170.html
A few years ago a bunch of extremely wealthy Californians met, liked the 
look of each other a lot, and formed a group called Extropians. Revealed to 
the world in a Wired article in 1994 as "a philosophy of boundless 
expansion, of upward - and outwardness, of fantastic superabundance," their 
greeting was described in some quite painful detail, for us, thus:

"Right hand out in front of you, fingers spread and pointing at the sky. 
Grasp the other person's right hand, intertwine fingers, and close. Then 
shoot both hands upward, straight up, all the way up, letting go at the top,

Well, as long as the group does not succumb to "conformity" issues, its 
purported creation is immaterial. The writer is doing a BOE, not based on 
experience, but based on envy; which is a hallmark of the UK reportage.' We wish we 
were a world power too, and America must be controlled, especially by Laborite 
Britain, which is much wiser then the rest of humanity! That is the jist of this 
kind of thinking.

There was an interesting sidebar concerning some women in the Silicon Valley 
who was getting screwed over, by off-shoring and such; but is that a real 
person or a composite, based on journalistic 'license' ?  

Attacking Professor Hanson's theories, or suggestions was the weakest point 
in the article, and smacked of "different is bad" no matter how good, or poor 
the idea is. The idea that people taking bets on what kind of terrorism could 
happen, is not calous, but rather a sort of national or international Delphi 
Poll, that futurists have used to forecast with, since the early 1960's. 

The old saying, that its better to be looked over, then overlooked, seems 
valid for Extropes and Transhumanists. Thanks for submitting the article, it was 
at least food

Whatever.  I am no one's conformist (the idea of me as a conformist is 
outrageously amusing) or in to mutual admiration.  I am into constructive 
criticism and would like to learn how to do that better without lapsing into 
bits of the destructive variety.

### Good you put the quotation marks around "owners". The joint ownership
form that is a state is the antithesis of individual ownership, and by
disconnecting gains from work and losses from responsibility, it diminishes
you and everybody it touches.

No, you are not an owner, you are being owned.

Well, then I guess all joint forms of property are "the antithesis of 
individual ownership". You have heard of "joint ownership"?

I and my ancestors built this country. That was our work.  Our wages are 
higher than in many other countries. Mexico, for example. Now you see our 
gain. In fact, you Rafal personally decided to enjoy a bit of OUR work and 
enjoy the gains of the country WE built, even though you are the grasshopper 
to our ant, correct?
 


> No, you are not an owner, you are being owned.


In fact, that is somthing similar to what I have been saying--we are being 
ROBBED.

Well, NASA seems to have finally scheduled the launch
of SIRTF for August 23.

Last of Great Observatories Set For Launch
http://www.spacedaily.com/news/telescopes-03w.html

Now this will be something to watch.  It is one of the
few telescopes we will have over the next few years
that has the capability of discovering advanced ET
civilizations (in the form of Jupiter Brains, Dyson spheres,
MBrains, small probes in our solar system, etc.).

Though it is not designed as a survey telescope as
the failed WIRE [1] mission was, there is still a chance
that it might detect something "unusual" in the
process of its normal observations.

If something "unusual" happens to the SIRTF mission
then it may be rational to move into an "X-files"
conspiracy mode (i.e. the "aliens" are acting in ways
to prevent us from discovering them).  If it functions
as designed then we should still learn alot about the Universe.

Excuse me if I'm wrong, but it seems like the cost of social security
dwarfs that of immigration by several orders of magnitude.  Even the
highest estimate of the costs imposed on us by immigrants don't exceed
$5 billion per year in government spending, while social security
currently costs $500 billion per year, and the baby boomers aren't even
retiring yet.

My analysis is of a selection effect operating on motivations.  Given
a diversity of motivations, I look at what evolutionary selection on
such motivations produces in terms of behavior at the leading edge of
spatial expansion.

### The more dilute the ownership, the less it has to do with individual
freedom, so the most dilute form of ownership, the state, is therefore
farthest away from it. A jointly owned medical practice is still controlled
by its owners, a state is no longer owned - it owns you.

### "I and my ancestors"! :-)

Like "I did it, and they helped out, too."

It's not "our" wages, it is John's, Dick's and Harry's wages - in the free
market, from everyone according to his ability, for everyone according to
his usefulness. What other citizens pay, for what, to whom, and what they
get, from whom, and for what, is nobody's business but their own. You don't
own them.

Well, whatever work you did, you got paid. Period. None of the purchasers of
your work took on an obligation to keep you employed, even when hiring you
is no longer a profitable venture. Nobody owes you a living. No Americans,
no Mexicans. Whoever your ancestors might have been. Hired work doesn't give
you ownership rights to the factory you are working in.

You want to really own a piece of America, buy real estate or stocks. This
is ownership, earned, deserved. All else is tribal spear-shaking.

Saying "My daddy worked here, so give me special treatment" would get a job
applicant laughed out of any well-run business, and hopefully America, Inc.,
won't listen to such demands either.

### Of course I decided to enjoy the opportunities offered by the US job
marketplace, because I personally deserve it - my services are useful to my
employer (and indirectly to you, by limiting the costs of medical care), and
I offer them in a fair exchange, without trying to pull in any favors, but
bringing in about 300 000$ in education and other growing-up expenses that
your ancestors didn't have to pay for. You know, my uncle was in the
Marines, my aunt worked here for 40 years - so what? What counts is that me,
Rafal, offers his services as a physician for sale, and will receive the
price the market will bear, which is what I deserve, for what I build (not
some nebulous "WE"), no more, no less.

Nah, I am the ant that pulls his weight.

Looks like the weapons strategies for "war" are about to
become more complex.

See:

Gamma-ray weapons could trigger next arms race
David Hambling, 13 August 2003
NewScientist.com
http://www.newscientist.com/news/print.jsp?id=ns99994049

My understanding of such technology is that it would allow
the relatively painless termination of human lives (vs.
nuclear weapons where the heat produced is likely to produce
burn victims).  Rafal, Aubrey or anyone else should correct
my impressions if you believe they are incorrect.

Please remember that I am looking at *strategies* here
[for explanation, perhaps see [1]] and not actually
things we "should" do.  But understanding what we might
do and why we might do them might better guide future
paths forward.

UCF brain cell research spawns hope for longer life

University of Central Florida researchers find that
nanomaterials developed for industry triple or
quadruple life of brain cells
ORLANDO, Aug. 13, 2003 -- A molecular biologist and a
nanoscientist at the University of Central Florida
have found that nanomaterials developed for industry
have an unexpected and potentially revolutionary side
effect: They can triple or quadruple the life of brain
cells. 
The result is people could live longer and with fewer
age-related health problems. 

Beverly Rzigalinski, assistant professor in the
Department of Molecular Biology and Microbiology and
at the Biomolecular Sciences Center, and Sudipta Seal,
associate engineering professor at the Advanced
Materials Processing and Analysis Center and the
Department of Mechanical, Materials and Aerospace
Engineering, will receive $1.4 million from the
National Institutes of Health, National Institute on
Aging to study the reasons behind the reaction and
possible future applications. 

Rzigalinski has spent the bulk of her career on
NIH-funded research from the National Institute of
Neurological Disorders and Stroke studying how brain
cells "talk" to each other, most recently focusing on
microglia -- a specialized cell that responds to brain
injury and initiates the response to either repair or
destroy the damaged neuron. Seal creates nanostructure
materials and recently developed a process for
engineering particles on a nanoscale -- so they might
have more efficient industrial applications. 

Because of the current flurry of publicity that
anti-oxidants have received for their potential
anti-aging properties, Rzigalinski decided to explore
introducing the miniaturized particles to the brain
cells of rats. 

"In culture, rat brain cells usually live about three
weeks," Rzigalinski said. "The cells exposed to the
engineered nanoparticles lived three to four times
longer." 

To confirm the results, Rzigalinski, the grant's
principal investigator, repeated the process multiple
times and found that cells exposed to a single dose of
engineered nano-oxide particles routinely outlived the
untreated cells by three- to four-fold, with the
longest living cell lasting 123 days. 

Rzigalinski then explored the quality of the aged
neurons and found they were signaling or "talking" to
each other in the same manner as their youthful
counterparts. "This shows there is a potential not
just to extend the life span but to preserve
function," she said. 

Seal has worked on developing oxide particles for high
temperature production since his undergraduate days in
the late 1980s. In 2000, as he took over the
coordination of UCF's nanotechnology initiative, he
and a student developed ultrafine nano-sized powders
and solutions. The particles, less than 10 nanometers
(about 30 atoms) in size, not only offered a more
efficient coating for use in machines but also opened
the door for biological studies in collaboration with
Rzigalinski. 

When a university research administrator aware of the
work of each scientist introduced the two, the
possibilities immediately began forming. "This type of
cross-disciplinary partnership is what we dream
about," said Pallavoor Vaidyanathan, assistant vice
president for research. It is also critical to forging
frontiers in nanoscience. 

Research in the medical profession suggests that a
major component of aging is free radical damage to
cells. Free radical scavengers, often taken in the
form of vitamins, can counter the damage to a very
limited degree. A regenerative nanoparticle, such as
the one developed by Rzigalinski and Seal, offers
promise of negating those problems and could be
helpful in treatment of certain age-related disorders
-- such as Alzheimer's disease -- as well as arthritis
and other joint-related problems, Rzigalinski says. 

Most recently, the Rzigalinski lab has found that the
nanoparticles have potent anti-inflammatory
properties. The investigators plan to explore the
possibility of creating a coating from the particles
that could be used for vascular and orthopedic
implants, stents and other devices that are prone to
inflammatory reactions. 

Initial tests show that the nanoparticle anti-oxidants
regenerate once they penetrate the cell -- meaning one
dose could conceivably continue its therapeutic
effects indefinitely. 

Rzigalinski introduced the collaboration to her
colleagues at the NATURE biotechnology symposium in
Miami earlier this year. She has also submitted an
abstract on the project to the National and
International Neurotrauma Symposium, and Society for
Neuroscience. 

Nanotechnology is considered the new frontier of
science, and it could revolutionize modern medicine in
the future. The potential for creating new materials
at a size capable of being absorbed by human cells
calls for a new type of scientist -- one who can
collaborate across seemingly unrelated disciplines.
Combining the fields of biomolecular science with
engineering offers a significant step in that
direction. 

Pappachan Kolattukudy, director of UCF's Biomolecular
Science Center and a consultant on the project, said
the collaboration is part of a strategy that UCF is
going to be using increasingly in building its
presence in the biomolecular sciences. 

"We are concentrating on building interfaces between
areas in which we have strengths," Kolattukudy said. 

Vimal Desai, director of AMPAC, said that
nanomaterials are currently considered highly
strategic for important applications ranging from
homeland security to just plain good health. 

"It is so good to be able to build bridges for an
interdisciplinary effort through competent and dynamic
researchers at UCF," Desai said.

I have finally read this, and belatedly have to agree - it is really
quite thought-provoking (even though the economists in me balks at
what passes for a "theory" in sociology).   I look forward to reading
the other related papers.

FWIW: former Navy physicist Dr Evan Harris Walker commented:

======
<This is an old idea and one first put into development by the Soviets. The
technology was labeled by the Soviets "red mercury," mercury being another
element that can be so excited. There were claims in 1990 that the former
Soviets had it up for sale to the highest bidder.

The danger is that its 1 to 10 thousand eV/atom energy release is exactly in
the mid-range between the 1 to 10 eV/atom of chemical explosives and the 10
to 100 million eV/atom of fusion and fission bombs. It does blur the line,
but that line is getting very blurry all by itself.

The good news is that it is much more difficult to make in that all the
energy has to be put in at the factory using very expensive processes
(unlike the others where the ingredients carry the potential energy).

By the way, it is environmentally friendly (i.e., if you don't mind a little
mercury or hafnium vapor)! Nice clean gammas.

Some more incidental information, an ordinary nuke can be made less than 5
inches in diameter, in at under 155 mm complete with a half inch of steel
for a carrying case. From what I have heard rumored, the smallest size was
never determined. A nuclear handgrenade is a likely possibility. That idea
of an nuclear handgrenade use to be a common physics joke, but we now know
there are people out there who are dumb enough to want such a thing -- and
they are not US. >

Oh my Gawd.  (Mouth hangs open for impolitely long period.)

Within five years thousands of dollars per kilogram makes
material can suddenly release 50Kg of TNT worth of energy.
So that's less than a dollar for bullet that releases
a truck bomb worth of energy on impact?  It really is a
new millennium.

It would also make a phenomenal propulsion system, at an energy storage
denstiy near that of fission, it could propel humanity into space.

### Well, death from radiation can indeed be relatively painless, as in the
case of nuclear reactor worker who received about 10 000 rem of radiation in
a minute or so, quickly became confused, then unconscious and died in a few
hours.

The devices described above, however, would release gamma rays in a
non-directional way, meaning all persons within a radius would be exposed,
and the dose would vary from very high in a few to merely lethal in the
rest. Merely lethal means the same general pattern of radiation sickness we
know from exposure to fallout: radiation burns, intestinal lining loss,
diarrhea, vomiting, hair loss, immunosuppression, cachexia, cancer and
leukemia. A bad death.

Interesting to imagine the suicide marksman of August 1st 2066, who in
imitation of Charles Whitman Jr., climbs a tower somewhere in the US, armed
with 700 rounds of 50kg TNT-equivalent bullets.

On the other hand, the Homeland SWAT brigade will be by then armed with the
low-orbit-to-surface hypervelocity kinetic kill weapon, which  should get
him within a few minutes (picture a lance of superhot tungsten descending
from the sky to smite enemies of the state...), and the 3rd generation
airborne laser, which might vaporize him within a few seconds of target
acquisition.

This will be an interesting millennium.

If there is any research worth putting on the back-burner, production of
nuclear isomers looks like a good candidate.

You still need to get the x-rays to trigger it, but that might
scale (or not). It is still a weapon that needs sizeable 
production facilities and somewhat unusual raw materials that 
can be detected, but again it blurs the line between nukes and 
more conventional weapons in terms of production. 

It would probably make an interesting shaped charge/laser for 
the production of very strong gamma ray beams. Is the radiation 
coherent too? If it is I have some applications for it in 
subverting nanotech tamperproofing.

My first thought too. But gamma rays in themselves are not very good
for propulsion, so they have to be used to (say) heat a propellant. And
then the issue becomes why we are looking at using nuclear isomers
rather than an ordinary NERVA-style reactor.

As for really alternative strategies, I recommend "The Spiders"
at http://www.e-sheep.com/ - a new part (#3) has arrived and it
has some wonderful thoughts on networked warfare.

The general has a good point: "And this won't be a problem for
the next *10* years, but the next *ten thousand*. Grok this fact,
and _then we_ can discuss *ethics*, Liutenant"

### While I agree with the specifics you provided this time, I have to
protest that my initial objection (that you are using a taboo-tradeoff
rejection) was well-justified from reading of your initial statement. You
did say that individuals should be prevented from bargaining their lives for
money and other considerations, by some persons "morally responsible" for
these individuals. I very strongly reject such limitation of freedom.

### No, I don't think it is bad to use inhumanely cheap labor. As long as
there is no breach of contract, fraud, neglect of parental duties, monopoly
ownership of resources, and no use of non-consensual violence, an action is
not immoral, according to my consequentialist ethical system. Since the
outcomes of actions which do not exhibit the features I mentioned are almost
guaranteed to improve the average well-being of humans, I consider such
actions to be good or neutral until proven otherwise.

### Well, it is exactly the point - Nike is not forcing anybody to work for

### Oh, yes, by all means! You might note that I joined the thread in part
to point out that protectionism, in addition to harming Americans, harms
foreigners as well, and this is, as I wrote before "rubbing me the wrong
way".

This said, the term "unfair business practices" has been used in very vague
ways, so I would need more details before agreeing on it. For me, the only
unfair (=wrong, bad, unjust, immoral) business practices are the ones
involving breach of contract, fraud, neglect of parental duties, monopoly
ownership of resources, and use of non-consensual violence (the same list I
wrote in a paragraph above). By this definition, protectionism is an unfair
business practice, contracting for child labor is not.

### No, poverty does not exist because of Nike, but despite Nike.
Businessmen invest where labor is cheap, thus causing labor to get more
expensive. Businessmen do not keep people poor. Politicians do. Businessmen
can only become a force of evil if they buy the services of politicians and
armies, which is actually a rare occurrence. In most cases, political
systems *feed* on business, not the other way around.

### Owners of Nike (I might be one too, I haven't looked at the list of
stocks in my mutual funds for a long time) should not held responsible for
their actions, beyond the value of the stock they bought, in accordance with
the law. It should not be illegal to utilize child-labor, or sub-poverty
labor (whatever this might mean), since it is not immoral for children and
poor people to contract for sale of their labor. Only the use of forced
labor is wrong, since it involves non-consensual violence.

Liability of joint stock corporations for harms inflicted can easily be
handled by a compulsory, free-market liability insurance.

The correct way of helping poor children is to offer education support
(perhaps in the form of a loan) and protection from abusive parents, rather
than prosecuting persons who offer gainful employment to them.

The correct way of helping poor people in general is to offer attractive
employment to them (or removing the political obstacles to it, as I
definitely agree with you), perhaps more attractive than wages at Nike - and
not trying to shut down Nike by political fiat.

Unfortunately, prosecuting "villains" is a more exciting path than actually
helping others to a better life by a consensual exchange of considerations,
so the former strategy achieves undue prominence.

I am not at all sure that such an evolutionary analysis is applicable in any 
meaningful way.  Did you choose the "fitness" criteria in a way that escapes 
being circular?

I see what strategies are left at the leading edge, assuming many diverse
strategies are tried internally.  "Fit" is having many descendants at the
leading edge.

Could you explain how you derive that understanding?

I offer two objections:

1. The effects of gamma irradition drop with the distance.  So you
   get the usual distribution from instant death through serious
   injury down to no damage done, depending on where your victim
   is located relative to the initial gamma flash.  I don't see how
   this is supposed to be different from, say, a large chemical
   explosion.

2. As far as I know, traditional fission and fusion devices release
   most of their energy in the form of gamma rays, which the
   surrounding atmosphere largely translates into blast and heat.
   I assume the same would apply to a gamma flash released from
   nuclear isomeres.

If you want to kill somebody quickly, you need to do it individually,
under carefully controlled circumstances.  Whether you choose
irradiation, a bullet through the head, or a machete, doesn't matter
all that much.  Area effect weapons, while more economical for
killing a large number of people, will also produce large numbers
of wounded.

It would seem to me this might have some relevance toward developing a Gamma
Ray Laser, and that could have all sorts of non military applications. I
wonder if Gamma Ray Holography would be possible and I wonder if you could
make such a picture of a object that was not small, a human brain for
example. The resolution would be extraordinary.

No, it's X rays. mostly soft X rays.

I would suggest printing hard copies of a few items before you go - your
desktop wallpaper perhaps, and a digital image or two of your fingers
hovering just above the keyboard. At any rate you'll probably want wallet
sized images of both your start button and the little clock in the corner.
I've found these tricks helpful in the past, though I admit I've never
actually attempted a separation of the kind of duration you are describing
here.

The NY Times has an interesting article by Kristof regarding
how America may be becoming more religious (in a state that
pioneered the idea of separation between church and state).

It would be interesting to speculate how much the "run-up" to

ancient ideas because they fear the unknown of the future.

Diffraction and dispersion still gets them. Besides, the isomer bomb 
would likely not be very directional (my guess is that you could get 
some neat lobes). 

100 keV gamma beams have a half-distance of 35 m of air absorbtion. The
intensity also gets diluted by the 1/r^2 if the bomb is not a
beam-source. My guess is that most of the energy does end up within a 
few tens of meters around the bomb, producing at least a weak fireball.

Laser beams do diffuse according to inverse exponent
after a certain distance.  Don't recall the numbers
well enough just now to say if that exponent is 2,
but any laser beam has at least minimal divergence.
One can focus this divergence inwards, so the light
comes to a point at some distance out, but after that
distance, it's spreading.  One can also try to narrow
the divergence - indeed, one of the main useful
properties of lasers is that their divergence is so
small as to be practically zero over very long
distances.  But if you shone just about any modern
laser towards, say, Pluto, the beam would probably
have measurably diverged by the time it got there.
(Maybe just barely measurably, but still measurably.)

Then again, gamma rays in small quantities can still
do great damage compared to similar amounts of thermal
or kinetic energy, especially when one focuses on
which form of energy will still be around an hour
later.

Exactly my thought. I have been considering nanotech tamper proofing of
small "black boxes". While I think I have some good designs that are
impervious to material tampering, a gamma ray laser might allow making a
destructive hologram. The beam hits the black box, disintegrating it,
but before that a refracted wavefront appears and can be caught on a
screen, enabling reconstruction of the black box interior.  The main
problem is the wave-particle duality: in order to get the hologram we
need to get enough photons on the screen to find the pattern, and that
implies a very high intensity. 

Anybody who knows more about gamma diffraction to give a considered
opinion?

I think one way of hiding data better is to hide it in electron spins, 
but that might also show up in the hologram?

INteresting subject.  I am also fairly sure that a trend of increasing 
agnosticism started to die sometime in the 60s. It may seem strange now, but 
in those days there were actually movies that seriously questioned the 
existence of a god, and that had characters who were atheists. Look at the 
movie The Sandpiper starring Burton and Taylor.  This was not an art house 
film.  That has all died out now. 

I suspect it has something to do with the consolidation of news and 
entertainment productions.  You have huge conglomerations that produce news 
and films and TV shows.  They are highly profit driven. This may have been 
also influenced by the movement of so many people to the cities, and at teh 
same time, the dying out of almost all of the newspapers in cities, except 
for one winner.

In a way, our media has become like our presidential politics--aimed to the 
lowest common denominator, which is the religious believer.  And so this 
stance reinforces itself.

But I think the internet will gradually reverse the current trend. Already it 
is taking time away from TV and movies.

They should be prevented, in NEGATIVE a way.  That is, the social 
structures that tend to coerce people into selling themselves (and 
under-selling themselves) should be removed.  The only way a person can 
be brought into a position where they bargain their lives for money is 
if the damage of force, corporatism and statism is already done.

When you see thousands upon thousands of people put in the position of 
having to bargain for their lives, you know that something has gone 
desperately wrong, in general, it's economic oppression enforced by the 
state.

Here we are in partial agreement, although you don't want to extend 
"non-consensual violence" to economic pressure.  I do.  It's backhanded 
to say someone is freely entering into a contract if not accepting that 
contract would cause them irreperable harm (either economic, social, 
physical, etc.)

I understand the ends justifying the means, however, I see that the 
ends are children living in puddles of their own pee.  You seem to 
think the ends are immortality or something.

You're right, Nike isn't forcing them, but their government is.  Nike 
is paying the government for that particular service.  Even more 
relevant, the largest shareholders of Nike are paying them for that 
service through the WTO and World Bank.

Contracting for child labor ENABLED by protectionism?

Well, here we just have a plain disagreement.  Nike takes valuable 
resources from Burma and relocates them to the United States and takes 
the profits for themselves.  This has the generalized effect of making 
Burmese poorer, Nike richer and American's better-shod.  Since the 
Burmese are becoming poorer, Nike richer and American's better-shod, 
they are likely to be able to, if they so desire, perpetuate the system 
that impoverishes Burma.  Indeed, we know that this is the case BECAUSE 
IT IS HAPPENING.

It happens both at the direct level - shoes and money for nike - and at 
the global-economic level.  Cash from the WTO (funded by Citigroup, 
Deutchebank, Credit Lyonnaise, Barclays, etc.) goes to the Government 
of Burma which then buys military supplies to ensure it's ongoing 
ability to enforce its rule over its people.  Meanwhile, Nike which is 
majority owned by those same interests, goes and takes advantage of the 
cheap labor created by the oppressive government.

Do  you see it differently?

Well, since "the law" was set up specifically to prevent the owners of 
Nike from taking any responsibility WHATEVER for the actions of their 
corporation, here we just have a straight disagreement.  The law really 
should be changed to make the owners of a company jointly and severally 
responsible for the "official" actions of the company.

How often, would you say, are children sold into slavery consensually?

You think this would make things better for the people living in mud

Again, I hear your claim, but the mechanism has been around FOREVER and

No one's trying to shut down nike.  Just make Nike play nice.

Agreed.  Being a missionary is ONE good way of directly helping poor 
children in Burma.  Will that solve the long-term problems there?  No.

If you look at the workers of an impoverished country as desperate for 
work, what incentive could someone capable of providing better wages 
have for actually going and competing for resources in that country.  
It's bad business.  If Nike is paying $2/day, Addidas wants to pay $1.  
So if Nike is doing business in Burma, Addidas will go to Angola.  
That's how "REAL BUSINESS" works.

Do you seriously think that we're going to run out of poor countries in 
which workers can be exploited?

   A good missionary would want both short-term comfort for the poor and 
long-term abating of the conditions that contribute to poverty - 
including and especially Globalized Banking.

Best,

Robbie

<excerpt><bold><color><param>0000,0000,ffff</param><bigger><bigger>Genome
Hunt Shows Humans Closer to Rats Than Cats

</bigger></bigger></color></bold>

August 13, 2003; Washington, D.C. (<italic>Reuters</italic>) -- A
comparison of human DNA to <bold>12 other animals 

</bold>shows we share more than our genes and helps show that people are
more closely related to <bold>rats </bold>than

to <bold>cats</bold>, scientists reported on Wednesday.  The survey also
adds to the argument that so-called "junk" 

DNA is <bold>nothing of the sort</bold>, but must do something important
because it stays virtually identical across 

many species.  It also supports what is becoming increasingly clear --
that the stretches of DNA we call 

genes are only a small part of the genetic story.


        The research team at the National Human Genome Research Institute
and several universities 

compared the same stretch of DNA in a<bold> chimpanzee, baboon, cat, dog,
cow, pig, rat, mouse, chicken, 

zebrafish, </bold>and<bold> two species of pufferfish</bold> -- the
Japanese delicacy <italic>Fugu</italic> and <italic>Tetraodon</italic> --
with <bold>human 

</bold>DNA.  In people, this stretch of DNA it is a much-studied genetic
region that contains the CFTR gene 

that, when mutated, causes Cystic Fibrosis.


        "It provides some pretty definitive evidence that we are indeed
closer to rodents than we are to 

carnivores," Dr. Eric Green, scientific director of the NHGRI and leader
of the study, said in a telephone 

interview.  "Our data really puts the nail in the case. In the sequence
you can find changes in the genome 

that clearly occurred in both humans and rodents but did not occur in
others."  The changes come in repetitive 

sequences of DNA that, until just a few years ago, were believed to be
junk -- useless stretches of trash 

that somehow got saved.  DNA is very difficult to interpret. Its long,
long code is built on just four 

nucleotides -- the compounds known by the abbreviations <bold>A, G, T,
</bold>and<bold> C</bold>.  


<bold><color><param>0000,0000,ffff</param><bigger>A Tricky Code to 
Break

</bigger></color></bold>

        Reading the long string of four letters repeating in various
combinations is proving to be even 

trickier than scientists thought it would be. At first they believed the
genes -- the sequences that control 

production of the protein building blocks of the body -- would be the
only functioning parts of the sequence.  

But it turns out there are sequences that control the genes, and perhaps
that do even more. "It now seems 

that about 5 percent of our genomes are functionally important," Green
said.  "Only a third of that codes for

genes. That means that two-thirds of what is functionally important is
not (gene) encoding DNA. We don't 

even know what it looks like <bold>so how are we going to find
it?</bold>"  Green hopes to do so <bold>by comparing the 

genomes of different species.</bold>  "This is the idea that you can
truly use sequences from multiple genomes and 

analyze them all at once to try and find the small percent that is shared
among all of them," he said. "We believe 

this is going to be a very valuable way to find those sequences that are
very important."  Why? Because nature 

cannot ditch vital DNA.  "Evolution is about mixing things up. If
evolution has hung on to some stretch [of DNA], 

even if it is repetitive, it is telling us something ... Where did
(evolution) find it wasn't safe to change the genome?" 

he asked.


        Green's team, working with researchers at Pennsylvania State
University, the University of Washington, 

and the University of California at Santa Cruz, will look at 100
different regions of the genomes of the 13 species.  

This is the first region they have analyzed, they reported in Thursday's
issue of the journal <italic>Nature</italic>.  "We will 

discover new types of functional elements in the coding DNA that we
didn't even know existed," Green said.

Just a small terminological boggle:

Rafal says that many transhumans are `rationalists regarding the mind'. I
think what's meant is `empiricists regarding the mind'. Traditionally in
philosophy, if I remember correctly in my discussions over a guttering
candle with Rene, rationalists were philosophical idealists who argued that
the source of mental activity and awareness must be a non-material
reasoning soul. 

See, e.g.: http://www.gre.ac.uk/~jk13/new_page_4.htm

Ok, so you get great resolution -- what in the blazes are you going to
use to "imprint" the image on?  All photons above UV energy levels will
cause bond cleavage (Nanosystems, Section 6.5: Photochemical damage).
One of the big problems they are having with Extreme UV lithography
now is that they don't have materials that can withstand the damage
caused by the light at the smaller wavelengths.

I don't see how you can disintegrate the box and not the hologram material.

I can see it now, people show up at the airport, throw their luggage
onto the Gamma-Ray machine which subsequently vaporizes their luggage
while providing them with a data cube of what their luggage contained.
At their destination they throw the data cube into a matter compiler and
"pooff" out comes their luggage (presumably still rather warm from
the rapid assembly of so many molecules).  I expect it would make the
airlines very happy.

No kidding...

I would think that how they manage to pull the rabbit out of the hat
with the Chandra telescope would be the place to start.  In particular
whether or not they studied the lifetime of the scope.  I'm believe
that you can detect X-rays with CCD detectors but I'm unsure of what
damage the detectors are exposed to in the process.

I've never seen anything that suggests you can query the spins using
X-rays or gamma-rays (I will however ask someone who knows more than I
[my father] and get back if he speculates positively about this.)

It's more than a quarter of a century since I read John Brunner's stunning
sf novel THE SHOCKWAVE RIDER, and I'd forgotten this prescient element:

http://www.skypoint.com/members/gimonca/brunner.html

< Brunner's future in "Shockwave Rider" includes an info-futures betting
pool called Delphi. Even as people struggle to keep up with the tiring pace
of technological change, they can win money by betting on the next
breakthrough. (There is info-futures betting for entertainment only on the
Internet today at http://if.arc.ab.ca/IF.shtml). Brunner sees this not as a
free-market instrument, but as a tool to be manipulated by government
bureaucrats who fiddle with the odds: "What the public currently yearned
for could be deduced by watching the betting, and steps could be taken to
ensure that what was feasible was done, and what was not was carefully
deeveed. It was a task that taxed the skills of top CIMA experts to ensure
that when the government artificially cut Delphi odds to distract attention
from something undesirable no other element in the mix was dragged down
with it." What appears on the outside to be freedom is actually government
control by information feedback. >

My opinion about the cause is fundamentally that the mind abhors a vaccuum.  
American culture has become pretty devoid of much real sense of purpose or 
values beyond consumerism and "making it".    The lack of substance is very 
palpable to many.    Anything that seems to fill the void is an attractor.    
Religions are good at filling or seeming to fill this void.  Add to this 
increasingly rapid change and economic uncertainty and new post 9/11 levels 
of fear and you have a very potent brew.   

Now, transhumanist values and goals could also fill some of this void quite 
nicely.  But they are a bit more work to understand and embrace, and frankly,  
we are not anywhere near as good at selling.  

Another factor I am very sorry to have to acknowledge is that America has  
been dumbed down on purpose.  With a non-black illteracy rate of 14% and 
black illteracy rate as high as 40% the problem begins to show itself.   
Polls of the lack of knowledge about the world among Americans, even very 
simply knowledge your average 6th grader would know, are commonplace.   
Another poll reports that over 50% of college graduates report that they did 
not read another book after they graduated no matter how many years ago that 
was.  

Massive sense of meaningless, lack of training in reasoning and logic, large 
doses of subjectivism and cultural relativism among the educated, uncertanty 
about the future - it all adds up to high vulnerability for comforting 
comprehensive memes.   And yes, it also tends toward distrust of and anger 
toward the intellect as much of the imbibed intellectual fashion of the day 
taught fundamental meaninglessness and subjectivity and arbitrariness of all 
values and value systems.   The distrust of the intellect is because of what 
the intellectuals tell them and because using the intellect would seriously 
threaten the new found comfort memes.

Have you ever been in a situation where like-minded people at your job and/or
school insist on openly discussing high shock-level topics in the presence of
low shock-level or unknown shock-level individuals?

It's not particularly good memetics to use the L-word (life extension) in
front of faculty members. Let alone make fun of Christianity... especially in
Texas of all places. They don't believe me.

Anybody have suggestions on how I could communicate the need for nuance,
diplomacy, and picking one's battles to these well-meaning but slightly naive
youngsters? Some example, some object lesson that would resonate with people
who overestimate the degree to which the 'normal' world gets the big picture?

On Sat, 16 Aug 2003, Alex Future Bokov asked about how to
spread the memes without blowing "belief" fuses...

Well, citing an article in Science will have a pretty good impact
on any serious faculty member [1].  As will pointing out the number
of companies now working on aging [2].  And a serious attack
on the conditions associated with aging (such as Aubrey has
developed [3]) will tend to silence the objections of those
more educated in medicine.  Its not a question of "if" but "when".

> Let alone make fun of Christianity... especially in
> Texas of all places. They don't believe me.

One way to spin this is to point out that we aren't talking about
"immortality" (that is what tends to blow the "belief" fuses I
think).  Much better to point out that we are talking about extending
healthful life (gerotologists call this making the longevity
curve "rectangular").  As Damien pointed out in the Spike and Robert
Freitas pointed out at a recent Alcor conference [4] (and was obvious
to me back at Extro3 so many years ago...) you cannot beat the hazard
function (at least not as humans are currently instantiated).  Probably
the best you can do is something like 2000-7000 years unless you
really push on the hazard function by reengineering the human body
with nanotechnology and even then it is still very very difficult
to trump the hazard function.

(So by preserving the meme that one "will" die, you don't have
to break the entire christianity/death/salvation meme-set.
One simply replaces the concept of a death that may be prolonged
and painful with the image of a much longer life -- where one gets
to enjoy ones great-great-great grandchildren and a probable end
which might be painful but will probably be quick, e.g. car accident
or something similar).

Now the thousands of years concept may be a stretch.  I once did a
calculation on the best estimates I could find of loss of brain
neurons and the numbers I got were much less (hundreds of years if I recall).
So unless we get stem cell replacement of neurons on a regular basis all
bets may be off much sooner (so long as one doesn't mention "uploading").

A very, very long time ago, I took a course as part of my "enlightenment"
process -- one of the things that stuck in my mind was the statement:
  "Never destroy someone's belief system unless you are committed to replacing it".
(Or something to that effect.)  The emphasis is on your personal commitment
to *replacing* the belief system -- a very very hard thing to do -- one
must essentially reprogram a human mind which probably has years of experience.

It is a very powerful concept.  People construct their lives around their
beliefs.  Why?  Because their beliefs have allowed them to survive until the
current day.  Destroy someones beliefs and you might as well have cast them
adrift in a Class 5 hurricane [5].  So it is relatively important to present
ideas in a way that is compatible with pre-existing belief systems.  As new
ideas become more commonplace (consider for example the impact the Matrix
series will have on society) then the older ideas will be discarded
(witness gay bishops being elected by the Anglican church for example).

[I'm not stating that the Matrix led to the election of a gay bishop --
they are separate vectors -- I'm simply commenting on how beliefs can
and will change over time -- but it is very difficult to "force" the
process.]

I tend to agree, but there does seem to be a marked difference between the
U.S. and other parts of the world. Anti-intellectual evangelical
Protestantism is becoming the dominant form of Christianity in Europe, as
well as in the U.S. and much of Latin America, but believers are an
increasingly small part of a generally secular culture (as the article
pointed out). It's the U.S. in particular that seems to have such a large
religious population. I'm not sure why this is myself. I suspect we are
seeing the appearance of large, self-contained subcultures that increasingly
reject and cut themselves off from what they see as the 'sinful'way of life
around them.

It's the same over here. The ignorance of the students I teach is often
simply staggering. Last year I asked a student who had delivered a short
talk on the Dreyfus Affair what he thought the connection to zionism was.
Response: "What's Zionism?". Less than half the class knew.

Dangerous, I agree. I think the tide is turning somewhat among the
intellectuals however, there is a growing reaction against the irrationalism
that found expression in such movements as pomo, I feel. Steve Davies

Move to Austin!  It's not part of Texas :-)  Seriously though, let's not 
finger Texas.  When I lived in California, it was very inappropriate and 
often dangerous to make fun of Spirituality.  It all depends on what moral 
vehicle people are using, not the specific piece of earth.

Sure:  Here are 2 of my favorite quotes I think about when people try to 
push their beliefs on me:

I like to do all the talking myself. It saves time, and prevents 
arguments.   Oscar Wilde

. . . an equally great [talker] knows when to stop.
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart


 From my book on a topic of how to deal with difficult people or those who 
simply shut down when you want to discuss living longer:

The best way to understand the person who you are talking to is to take the 
time to listen to that  person. Who is the person I am talking to?  What 
are his or her needs, interests and concerns?  People will let you know, 
one way or another,  within a few minutes who they are.

The next step is to do a little math on the cost to benefit.  Discern if 
the time and energy expended will be a productive and successful 
exchange.  (9 out of 10 it is.)  If the numbers line up and it looks like a 
profitable expenditure, choose a strategy of communication.

Which strategy? Are you in this to win friends and influence, or rave about 
your own views while alienating the other person and ending up in a pissing 
match? This is where critical thinking comes in.

Since the goal is to do the best job with the least amount of stress, 
youve probably chosen educate and are ready to employ the hardy 
handy-tools of monitoring information,  feedback, error correction, 
accurate replay, and collision avoidance. These tools are for preventative 
emotions and, if nothing else, will help to keep emotions calm.

With the foundation established, the softer tools are employed, a common 
ground of interest.  People tend to be more receptive to new ideas if they 
know that we share something in common. At this point, the refining tools 
such as historical parallels give that extra quality of expertise. People 
seem to be more receptive to challenging ideas if given examples of 
historical events that relate to the discussion.

Practicing patience is a tool that I keep protected in fine chamois.  No 
matter how successful a person is in one domain, he may lag behind in 
another.  People develop at different ratesan early-bird or eleventh-hour. 
People have different psychological barometers for accepting change and 
challenge. Sometimes we need to repeat ourselves over and over for the 
concept to set in.

Ignite curiosity.  Every question we answer leads on to another question. 
This has become the greatest survival trick of our species, writes Desmond 
Morris.  I think, at a childs birth, if a mother could ... endow ... the 
most useful gift, that gift would be curiosity, mused Eleanor Roosevelt.

Just when I think my communications are flowing smoothly, I sometimes hit a 
snag.  I revert to humor because its the best way I know how to rescue the 
conversation and give it a little polish. .

I'm not quite sure what you mean. I would think if you didn't want to build
a specific structure but just record information then bond cleavage is
exactly what you'd be aiming for; if a bond has been broken then it must
have encountered a photon, if it is still intact then it has not. I couldn't
find much about Gamma Ray Holography but a lot has been done with the X ray
variant and atomic resolutions have been achieved, see below.

[F28.04]  X - Ray  Holography with Atomic Resolution
Miklós Tegze (Research Institute for Solid State Physics, H-1525 Budapest,
P.O.Box 49, Hungary)

In the conventional diffraction experiments only the intensity of the
scattered radiation is recorded, its phase is lost. In holography [1], the
scattered radiation is mixed with a reference wave and the resulting
interference pattern is recorded. The hologram contains both the intensity
and the phase information and the three dimensional image of the object can
be reconstructed. The most important limitation of this imaging technique is
the spatial resolution, which is given by the wavelength and/or by the
source size. In the last decade the introduction of soft x-ray instead of
visible light tremendously improved the resolution which reached a few
hundred angstrom [2]. An other line in holography, based on the inside
source concept, was suggested recently [3]. We have applied this concept for
the case of fluorescent x-rays emitted by a single crystal. We were the
first to demonstrate theoretically [4] and experimentally [5] the
feasibility of  x- ray holography  with atomic resolution. We have recorded
the holograms of different crystals and successfully reconstructed the three
dimensional order of the atoms. \bigskip [1] D. Gabor, Nature \bf161, 777

The next ExtroBritannia meeting is scheduled for Saturday the 6th of September
2003, in Cambridge, UK.

The theme of the get-together is "The engineering approach to
life-extension". Life-extension researcher and promoter Aubrey de Grey will
give a presentation on the subject, followed by an informal Q&A/discussion
session.

THE PLAN

We will meet at 12,00 noon at the Salisbury Arms, 76 Tenison Road, Cambridge
CB4 1PA, not far from the train station, and will order lunch at about
12,30. If this is your first time at an ExtroBritannia meeting, look out for a
copy of Ray Kurzweil's "The Age of Spiritual Machines" being displayed at the
table we'll be sitting at.

If you cannot make it for lunch, you can still reach us at the Salisbury
Arms until about 2pm, when we'll decamp for the universitys department of
genetics, for the presentation.

Yes Laser beams diverge but if you double the distance the intensity of the
radiation does not decrease to one quarter like it would with a regular
light bulb. The exact amount the beam would diverge and thus become less
intense depends on how well the laser was made. I seem to recall reading
about using the 200 inch telescope to shine a Laser beam on the moon, when
it hit the moon after more than a quarter of a million miles the diameter of
the light was bigger than 200 inches but still only about the size of a
tennis court.

Real Audio streams apparently do not cache onto your hard disk as mp3's and
windows media files do. The audio stream relies upon continuous feedback
signals from the user's computer which makes capturing these files a bit
convoluted. You need to download an audio recorder such as total recorder
http://highcriteria.com/ which can then be run simultaneously during
playback to capture and record the stream in real time as a mp3 or wav.

Note that the (free) shareware version of total recorder is fully
functional, but records only 40 seconds of audio. To record longer streams
you have to pay the $11.95 license fee. I have not spent enough time
googling on this to determine if other (totally free) recorders are
available. Hope this helps.

Incidentally, I had been planning to stay up all night to try to become one
of those 'initial thousand' PAM traders. Bureaucracy sux.

Best wishes,
Russell Evermore

She may never qualify as an immortalist but this is a person who is intelligent, strongly supports technological progress in its myriad forms, and can obviously write at a level most of us only dream of.  I am grateful for the link provided because I got the chance to become aware of her work.

Ms. Engdahl disagreed with transhumanism but did not "trash" it.  Randy, I would ask you to be more thoughtful in how you write your subject headings.  

I share her interest in an afterlife and psi phenomena but I want to make the most of my life in terms of both quality and quantity.  That is why I'm signed up with those "crazy cool" folks in Scottsdale.

I attend a college affiliated with the ELCA, and I've also noticed this
"death" of the Christian intellectual tradition.  It's amazing how many of
the professed christians among my fellow students (the majority being ELCA
Lutherans) have no grasp of the most prominent theologians of their faith,
such as Paul Tillich and Karl Barth.  I recently took a bioethics class in
which I presented a case defending stem cell therapies, genetic
manipulation, cryonics, uploads, and essentially the whole transhumanist
package using Lutheran theology, yet the class was more taken by the purely
emotional and Kassian arguments presented by one of the nursing majors
against reproductive cloning.  An example of a dialogue that commenced:

Me: So, what are your views based upon?  In final analysis, what is wrong
with this procedure?

Student: I just feel that it's wrong.

Me: What is that feeling based upon?

Student: It's based upon god.

Me: So you have a direct channel to god?  You know exactly what god thinks?
I don't believe that such "religious" defenses are valid in an argument.

Student: {no comment}

All too often, it seems that "god" becomes little more than an apotheosis of
an individual's prejudices.

Sad, really, but I can understand their feelings.  While I largely agree
with Tillich's theology, in the end I found it largely irrelevant- one is
left with a religion that there is essentially no reason to practice, and
for that reason I abandoned my Lutheran upbringing and moved on to Zen,
which presented both a religious view that I found intellectually satisfying
and a meaningful practice.  But it seems that "intellectual satisfaction"
isn't an essential component of religious belief these days.

Thanks for your advice, but I think I was misunderstood.

I'm not trying to convert the non life-extensionists... our relationship with
them here is a low-key, productive detente.

I'm trying to keep the life-extensionist guys from blowing the roof off and
exposing us all to unwanted scrutiny prematurely.

Subject: Re: CNN: 'Explores Possibility that Power Outage is Related to
    Internet Worm'

The german publishing house "heise", producing the magazines c't and ix,
got a news on their page mentioning a probable link between the worm and
the power outage.

http://www.heise.de/newsticker/data/ju-15.08.03-001/

The article is in german, but I'm trying to translate the important pieces
to english:

The failing niagara power-plant belongs to National Grid USA. That
power-supplier is listed as a reference customer of Northern Dynamics.
Norhtern Dynamics labeled themselves as "Home of the OPC Experts" and
offer a range of products that use OPC for control and operation systems.

OPC stands for "Ole for process control" and is based on microsofts
COM/DCOM model. In a network affected by the W32.Blaster worm the
DCOM-communcation fails, and therefor OPC fails on unpatched systems.

OPC is employed among other things for the linking of so called SCADA
systems (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition), as used by
power-plants.

The OPC experts from northern dynamics also list General Electrics,
Siemens AG, european power-plant constructor ABB and the european
organization for nuclear research as reference customers.

Best regards,

Dominic

THE LATEST BOGUS FOSSIL-NUKE BLACKOUT:  THIS GRID SHOULD NOT EXIST 

By Harvey Wasserman 

< http://www.freepress.org >


This is the fourth---and worst---completely unnecessary major blackout of the
Northeast in forty years, dating back to 1965. 

It's scope---from Detroit to Ottawa to New York and New Jersey---is absolutely
awesome, especially since it's due to total stupidity and corruption. 

This does not count the blackouts that raged through California in 2000-2001. 
Those were "blackmails," set by Enron and the other Bush gas cronies to rip $60
billion out of the state, leading to, among other things, the impending ouster
of Gov. Gray Davis. 

When the lights went out, Davis kissed the feet of Southern California Edison's
John Bryson, who engineered a deregulation bill that gouged $30 billion out of
the ratepayers for the state's failed nukes.  That opened the gates for the gas
pirates to steal yet another $60 billion.  Davis got caught in the backdraft. 

The culprits in this latest northeastern disaster are basically the same---the
barons of fossil and nuclear power and their cronies in the electric utility
business. 

Their "weapon" is an ancient electric grid that's obsolete if not obscene. It is
a massively fragile Rube Goldberg device that dangerously and inefficiently
carts around electricity from expensive, polluting and extremely unsafe central
generating plants to buildings that waste massive amounts of energy and generate
none. 

That the grid will crash again and again and yet again is absolutely certain. 
The only question is who are the real terrorists:  errant crazies who blow
things up, or entrenched interests that refuse to change? 

The technology now exists to transcend this mess.  In the mid 1990s California's
green energy advocates proposed a 600-megawatt mosaic of solar, wind and other
renewable generators that would have entirely prevented the fake deregulatory
crisis of 2000-1.  It was approved by the California Public Utilities
Commission, but then killed by Southern California Edison and the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission. 

Today, the Bush Administration wants to further subsidize its fossil/utility
friends with a bad energy bill, and by pouring billions into "upgrading" the
electric grid.  The only thing certain is that every cent of that money will be
wasted. 

In 1952 a Blue Ribbon report to Harry Truman predicted that the future of
America's energy rested with the sun.  It predicted 13 million solar-powered
homes here by 1975, and the promise of decentralized, off-grid self-sufficiency.
. 

Instead, Dwight Eisenhower took us into the pit of the "Peaceful Atom".  A
trillion dollars later, we have a half-century of crashing grids and dangerous
nukes that are vulnerable to terrorism and must shut down precisely when they're
most needed, as they did during this latest blackout.  The latest Bush energy
bill only makes the situation worse, with more nuke subsidies and a powerful
push for fossil fuels, especially coal. 

The whole system demands a green deconstruction.  Solar technologies are ready
to make energy self-sufficiency a tangible reality.  Photovoltaic cells on
rooftops and embedded in windows can produce grid-free electricity, with battery
or fuel-cell backups. Geothermal power can heat and cool with nothing but the
power of the earth's crust. Methane digestion can turn waste into usable gas. 
Basement generators can use biomass fuels like ethanol and soy diesel for
off-grid self-sufficiency. 

These systems need not provide 100% of a building's energy, but can gradually
make them increasingly self-sufficient.  Meanwhile more efficient heating,
lighting and cooling systems can reduce demand.  Windows that actually open and
close can balance usage, building by building. 

Bush's "upgrading the grid" means a new money pit for the same old unsafe nukes,
polluting coal burners and gas turbines whose prices are set to skyrocket all
looped together by dangerous, wasteful wires that are bound to crash again and
again. 

San Francisco has used part of a public bond to put the first of a new
generation of solar cells atop its downtown Moscone Center.  Those same cells
could've kept Madison Square Garden or any other Manhattan building up and
running during this latest outage. Will New Yorkers know better next time? 

The technology for a decentralized, solar-based power system is ready now. We
don't need massive research breakthroughs. 

We need public demand and fully funded production capacity.  And to stop
repeating the same mistakes because the utility and fossil/nuke guys fund the
politicians in power. 

This isn't rocket science.  It's just common solar sense, known to all since
1952.

Reminds me of the INDY gene (I'm Not Dead Yet) in drosophila...

Life is going to be interesting in the future -- rather than commit
acts of violence, one will simply send people who have annoyed you
cockroaches that cannot be destroyed by anything less than a
small nuclear weapon.

Anyone here happen to have near at hand a copy of Isaac Asimov's IN MEMORY
YET GREEN? I need a couple of page references from it for a book I'm doing.
Pliz e me offlist, and I'll pass along the quotes; they should be easy to
locate.

Much more remote possibility: anyone have a copy of R D Laing's WISDOM,
MADNESS, AND FOLLY, another autobiography?

About a week ago, a contributor of long standing was suddenly
and summarily expelled from this list, an act that seemed to
me capricious and perhaps arbitrary, and for several days after
that, I didn't feel like posting anything.  During that time,
I thought that I was just annoyed, and that it would pass.

But my feelings on the matter did not change in the days 
following, and I finally figured out why.  It was due to
the large number of posts I'd written and threads that I
had started in the past two years extolling to the skies
this list and the people who ran it; the theme of those
many, many posts was that through thick and thin, freedom
of speech had always won out in the end on the Extropians
forum.

I now feel like a fool.

However, I could live with that---after all, one does many
foolish things in life and one gets over it after a while.
But there is something far worse than looking or being
foolish.

I will not be a hypocrite.

My only choices are to either leave this list, or begin a
series of posts taking back all my fine words, renouncing
my praise, and admitting that my perceptions had been wrong,
or else pleading that actions like this never recur, or, etc.
etc.---moves sure to foment controversy and ugly discord (and
which would probably result in my own expulsion anyway).

Any lessons learned?  So far, only one: be temperate in your
praise of others, else you will come to feel responsible for
their actions.  I hadn't known that.

So anyway, in a single sentence there is no way for me to
communicate the appreciation I have of what I have learned
here, the information I've gleaned, the friendships I've
made, the laughs I've had, or the stimulating, productive,
and entertaining discourse I've been privileged to be a part
of.  It's been fun.  Good-bye, and good luck to everyone.

It was not in the least capricious or arbitrary.  It was a long time coming 
that some action to actually enforce certain standards would be taken.  Nor 
was the particular person an arbitrary choice.   I am sorry that you can't 
see that.

Freedom of speech does not require the freedom to verbally attack and demean 
without consequences.   I am sorry if you believe it does or should.

I suggest you use your fine mind to see that that is due to one particular

It is very strange that someone who claims their are no objective values would 
claim that utter unregulated free speech apparently with no consequences for 
various offenses is such an objective and inarguable value that you would be 
morally sullied if you accepted actions based on any other view.    That you 
act like it was some kind of betrayal of clear values is even more amazing.

I hope you rethink this.  I value your participation a lot.

Lee, we had some quarrels. And I had some violent exchanges with Mike
Lorrey, too.

It has always been my point of view to really express what I feel about the
view of other posters. There are times when you have to forget your
politeness. I guess from what you write today that it might have been better
to really have said what you thought - sometimes.

I understand that it's not everyone's business to endure name calling or
these ominous "ad hominem" attacks, but . . . hell . . . what the fuck . . .
you say dirty words, some people are not amused, others know it's only too
human. Having expressed my indignation about your or Mike Lorrey's opinions,
I think I would for example gladly  join you and Mike for a weekend picknick
anyway, because I know you both are decent guys and we could learn from each
other  simply *because* we think differently.

I think it was wrong to expell Mike Lorrey from the list. My first reaction
was to propose an exchange deal: they let Mike Lorrey come back and I leave
the forum till the new list is established in September. But now, after
second thoughts, I suggest it:

Let Mike come back, I leave till September.
It would be a great loss if you left the list, Lee.

Please stay with us and start "taking back all my fine words, renouncing
my praise". This should be interesting and a step forward to hear the truth
behind all the politeness.

Hubert

But you're *not* responsible.

Why would you be a hypocrite if you stayed?  You didn't throw Mike Lorrey out.

At the last Foresight Gathering, I met Gary Hudson, the rocket scientist. 
  Or at least, I met a person with "Gary Hudson" on his badge.  So I 
asked:  "Are you _the_ Gary Hudson?"  He gave me a strange look and said 
yes.  "Wow," I said, "you were one of my childhood heroes."  He gave me 
another strange look and said, "I'm not sure how to react to that."

I didn't think of the correct reply to this until later:  "You don't need 
to react to it at all.  You are not responsible for what other people 
think of you."

What I choose to think of Gary Hudson, or, say, Douglas Hofstadter, is my 
business.  Douglas Hofstadter could decide to go into business as a palace 
torturer in the Third World and, while he might be responsible to himself 
for that decision, he wouldn't be responsible to me.

I don't see why you can't just take back everything nice you said about 
the Extropians list as relates to freedom of speech.  You were 
demonstrated to be wrong, that's all.  It happens, especially for positive 
forecasts.  Is it really that terrible if we fail to live up to your 
expectations?

[I'm still having connectivity problems at home -- thus I'm using the BBS
interface for the first time.  I guess I'm old-fashioned; I still like the
email list format, but I'm having trouble sending email from home.]

Im very sorry to see Lee leave the list, but I have to count it as a mistake
on Lees part.  The mistake arises from what the concept of free speech means
in the specific context of this forum.  Everyone probably agrees that some
kind of specific post could justify excluding someone from the list. Hard
questions arise when we realize we almost certainly wouldnt agree on the
precise limits beyond which a single post could justify exclusion.  We enter
the ground of irony when we realize that even some people who disagreed very
strongly with Mike Lorrey dont support his exclusion (vid. Hubert Manias
post of today.)

There will be even more disagreement about whether, rather than a single
post, an overall approach to posting justifies exclusion.  But we cant
escape this hard question in maintaining an online forum.  Take a look at
almost-completely wide-open fora like Yahoo groups and BBSs: No tone
criteria at all are maintained there and that kind of forum is the lowest
form of online interaction as a result.  I doubt many of our subscribers and
web readers waste their time by reading such groups, even though one might
occasionally find something of value there.

To return to the concept of free speech, I urge subscribers to consider that
ExI is not a government, and the values and rules regarding governmental
regulation of speech dont necessarily translate into matters of private
list governance.  The metaphor of the salon discussed here some weeks back
is much more apt.  That metaphor ought to suggest that matters of tone and
style will be much more important in how the list can and should be governed
than the extreme sensitivity to any curtailment of the right to expression
that the metaphor of government regulation of publishing or media entails.
Persistent combativeness and lack of politeness can and should be a factor
 an important factor  in applying the sanction of exclusion in a private,
focused forum.  Someone whose posts are consistently personalistic and which
generate continuing personal unpleasantness cant stay in a semi-public,
semi-private forum forever without the overall tone of the forum being
degraded.

I know there is a core disagreement among some people about whether values
of politeness and personal tone should be a factor in list governance.  To
those who maintain that they should not, I urge you to consider that the
packaging of ideas IS important and that a community can be and will be judged
by the manners it tolerates.  Having begun with noting an element of irony,
Ill end this overly-long post by pointing to another irony: The very act of
enforcing minimal standards of tone and style itself generates unpleasantness
and ill-feelings among many.  But this is also a challenge of freedom: Real
liberty is perforce accompanied by the duty to realize such values, or freedom
becomes corrosive to civilization.  The paradox is resolved by what many have
noted in the wake of Mike Lorreys exclusion: Ultimately he is free to post
elsewhere, create his own forum, post web pages, etc.

Finally, I urge those who are unhappy to look again at Natashas post: New
organization for our discussions is in the works and any exclusion from this
forum is temporary.

It would be nice if the list administer would admit to being wrong and
concede that recent actions have not improved the overall quality of posts,
but I don't really expect that to happen.

Yes, but exactly what did Mike Lorrey do to justify expulsion? If he sent
something that was hate filled or insane I didn't see it.

I agree, and sometimes Mike was impolite, but no more so than many others.
Very recently someone on this list told me to swim in a crocodile infested
river, but she's still here. I'm certainly not suggesting we have yet
another expulsion but it does illustrate the arbitrary way the rules are
enforced around here.

I personally do not think the issue lies primarily with a question of
free speech.  It's a question of an apparent wanton and arbitrary
expulsion of someone who happens to present generally unpopular
political opinions, and more specifically political opinions which
apparently counter opinions of extropy board members.  In addition, I
can hardly find it reasonable to suspect that Mr. Lorreys banning had
nothing to do with calling to task the unproductive and inactive nature
of members of this mailing list, and official extropy activities.

Nor can apparently vague, arbitrary, and explusions suspicious of a
personal vendetta not degrade the overall tone of this mailing list.

And it is also judged by the manner in which it tolerates dissenting
voices.  I find it hard to believe the Mr. Lorrey is the single worst
perveryor of deragotary implications, personal attacks, or general
un-productive un-civilized discourse.  I invite any one to view
Humanias' vitriloic emotional rants of the past few months presented
against those who supported the War in Iraq.

Indeed, which is why it would be good to present a reasonable and
understandable case for Mr. Lorrey's explusions, or else people of
similar political persuasions or even those who feel they may one day
not be in good favor with the 'right' people may persistently feel the
sword of Damaclees is perpetually hanging over their heads by an ever
thinning thread.  Even in your post justifying his expulsion, we still
see no clear and reasonable case made about it, just some vague comments
about maintaining the integrity of the list.  Coupled with Natasha's
previous comments about 'harmful to the community', some do not feel
this bodes well for the integrity of discourse on this list or the value
of continuing to be a member of it.

No one is saying you cant do what you want as a private organization,
but don't expect it to not reflect negatively on the integrity of the
list.  It is a private forum to be done with by the owners what they
will, but fortunately unlike governments, we can freely choose to leave.
I hope extropy does not see a mass emmigration, but given past events I
cant see how there wont be at least some.

This is a private forum, not a government, but that doesn't mean we have
to sit by and not protest the apparent change from an open, progressive,
and free discussion to one of e-gulags and enemies of the e-states.    

Of course, if we dissent, much like in oppressive governments, we may
simply be e-disappeared.

Sure, but the precedent has been set.

Mars-

As many might already be aware, Mars is in the news. I should have
been forewarned, Sky and Telescope has been publishing articles
all year, but I got behind in my S&T reading this year.

I went out last Friday night though: the Italian Amateur Astronomy Association
had telescopes set up at Castel d'Angelo in Rome.
http://www.eurosnaps.com/images/Roma/CastelloPA164906.jpg
The sky seeing was hazy, awful really, and the only objects visible,
were, in fact, the Moon and Mars. That was OK, though, because those
were the two objects at which the telescopes were aimed.

The Italian group advertised their star party in the newspapers
(they will have more this month, all over Italy), and I was thrilled
to see ~100 people waiting to look through the scopes. So much
interest for the Red Planet! The kids were especially fun to watch.

It has been more than ten years since I've seen Mars through a telescope.
I could see a bright polar cap and some color discolorations over
the surface, even in the bad seeing conditions.

Go take a look! It is part of the solar neighborhood, in which you live.

Mars is near, the closest in 60 000 years:

I don't think there is a "wrong" in this situation.  As Greg's recent
post points out there is a balance one has to strike to maintain the
tone and usefullness of a list.  I would not be on the list if Damien
or Eliezer were "assaulting" my opinions every day.  (Fortunately I
only stick my neck out far enough for them to (reasonably?) do that
somewhat less frequently.)  Damien was kind enough to point out to me
several posts in which Mike was rather abrasive.  I dealt with Mike
offlist to resolve the sources of what may have been misunderstandings
on his part -- but Mike is ultimately responsible for any such
misunderstandings.  (You can blame Enron for misrepresenting the
state of the company but it *still* comes down to a question of
whether or not one "did ones homework".  The exchanges over the last few
months suggest that Mike did not do that.  Net result: misunderstandings,
aggressive and/or rude behavior, people taking offense, lost list members.)

I do not believe that John is correct regarding "improved the overall
quality of posts".  The general quality of the posts on this list is
very high.  So it would be difficult to "improve" on them.  The question
one is dealing with is when some people get into what are effectively
"flame wars".  I've been reading lists for 20 years or more.  I've seen
wars come and go.  Usually the wars on the ExI list are reasonably
logical -- highly unusual as "flame wars" go (which is why I think it
was unfortunate that Harvey chose to leave).  The question ultimately
is how to manage such outbursts.

I believe that the forthcoming changes may help with that.  The
development of a chat list will be a big step forward for people
who want to deal with a large volume list where discussions may
sometimes go on and on and on.  The addition of a multiple moderator
functionality (still in the process of being defined) will allow
for some checks and balances at that level.  I think it is better
to realize that it is difficult to get this "right" and that one
needs to be prepared to evolve and adapt.  The Extropy Institute
is trying to do that.

Robert

I too saw a little irony in all this, but not the same irony: This little
incident doesn't seem to exactly confirm the hopes that technology and
spontaneous order will solve extant social problems. It is interesting the
way Greg describes the problem. We have two choices: either no list
moderation, which leads to an unacceptable degradation of list quality; or
some form of coercion is used to enforce list rules. This either/or seems to
go back to the Greeks and his proposed solution of distinguishing between
government/private suppression of speech is also a familiar idea. Will our
greater understanding of human nature and greater technological mastery not
help? What would a technical fix to the problem look like? The most common
suggestion is that if you don't like someone's posts you should put them in
your killfile. As it turns out, Mike has been in my kill file for a
longtime. Not that I find everything he says offensive or unworthwhile, it
is simply that my assessment of the signal to noise ratio doesn't make it
worth my time to read his numerous posts. (A little too much Yosemite Sam
for my taste). Clearly the kill file advice has been around for a while and
hasn't done much to avoid the present problem. (For the record: I have no
idea what Mike is alleged to have done to merit the expulsion so I have no
idea whether this (temporary) expulsion is justified or not). I am sure Mike
has no idea he is in my killfile--I've never had an acrimonious exchange
with him for instance. The reason, as I explained, is simply a cost/benefit
calculation.  I wonder if the problem is that the killfile solution doesn't
provide sufficient feedback. Imagine a public registry of killfiles:
somewhere on the Ex site you could register your killfile preferences, so I
could look up my name and see the names of those who are not "buying" what I
have to say. It would be even better if the list could be configured to send
only those emails that are not in my killfiles. The hypothesis of this
experiment is that people might be a little more careful in what they say,
because they will have an interest in not increasing their killfile
quotient; and that there may be fewer merely ad hominem exchanges as people
can publicly signal their disapproval by changing their killfile
preferences.  I don't think most of us would see this as curtailing free
speech, since the right to free speech does not entail that others have a
duty to listen. In any event, without some sort of feedback mechanism it
seems pretty clear that there is little hope for some sort of spontaneous
order, which means that we will be stuck with the either/or that Greg
describes.

If I were a critic of transhumanism I would certainly use this as an example
of how little technology and science seem to improve age-old social
dilemmas. If my experiment is not tried I hope others will be suggested and
tried that will attempt to move us at least a little beyond this age-old
either/or.

Greg,
       I think you have just put your finger on the problem and also 
unknowingly shown that you do not understand what is going on.  Let me attempt to 
explain it to you.
       In accounting and I suppose in law there is a concept of ownership.  
As you pointed out this list has owners -- no one to my knowledge disputes 
that.
       In addition there is the concept of a Stakeholder.  If we think of 
this as a grocery store there are not only the owners but also stakeholders such 
as regular customers, suppliers, etc.  These people have an interest in the 
store also.
       We seem to be having a battle between the owners of this list and some 
of the stakeholders.  Right now a large group of them seem to be voting with 
their feet.
       Frankly, Mike seems to have been singled out for his specific 
political opinions.  If you don't agree I suggest you go back and read the chortling 
that took place on this list when it was announced he was banned.  Only this 
time read the specifics of what was written
       On the other hand we have a blessed few on this list from the idiotic 
wing of the left wing that are still as welcome as the flowers in spring.
       Last, if you read the comments Natasha included in email it seems to

Add my personal preference and a third choice:

We create two lists.  One is a discussion list and is wholly and
completely unmoderated.  The other is a moderated (announce-only style)
list, where only a few people can send to the list.

Generally, everyone is encouraged to subscribe to the moderated list,
which should be low traffic (less than 10 messages a day).  Anyone who
wishes to participate in discussion subscribes to the discussion list.

Discussion threads start on the discussion list, where everyone can put
in their two cents.  When the thread reaches a point where it's either
interesting or has terminated, someone (not necessarily a participant in
the thread -- the volunteer can be anyone) then summarizes the
highlights of the thread that might be interesting.  They then send that
summary to one of the moderators of the moderated list who collate the
day's summaries, then sends it out to the moderated list.

This way, folks who don't want to (or can't) sift through the noise get
to at least see what they might have missed.  Then, they can optionally
go back through some threaded message archive and read up on the actual
thread if they want deeper detail.

This is similar to what folks like Gina are doing with the Nanogirl
News, but would be specific to the content represented in the Extropians
mailing list.

This is a widely used technique for many mailing lists and Usenet
newsgroups and works well, as long as there are enough volunteers who
summarize worthwhile threads.

Robert,
       I tell you three times.  The ones that are objecting believe that 
Mike's banning was due more to political opinions, including list politics, not 
due to his having objectionable personal habits.
       The evidence for this is the people that are still accepted and the 
chortling email at his being banned.

Extropes -

I think Greg Burch wrote a thoughtful and insightful message today.  It
sums up much of my own thinking, and I'm glad he wrote it.

List administration looks at the facts and follows the rules.  Simply. 
Mike got a warning for attacks and he continued.  He was removed.  If this
is a problem for anyone on this list, either deal with it or not.  But to
continue harping on it and whining about it and trying to further problems,
it is not productive to anyone, including Mike Lorrey.  It makes him look
weak, and I don't think Mike is weak.  Instead, Mike's "supporters" could
have taken this opportunity to encourage extropic topics and level heading
thinking.

The mistake list administration has done is not to have had more than one
moderator and also not enforcing list rules. If a handful of you all who
want to tar and feather the "list administration" because you think a
poster has every right to speak his/her views no matter who they affect, no
matter if the accusations are right or wrong, no matter if they are
purposefully intended to poison the well, no matter how inaccurate,
libelous or yellow dog, then you are not reading this list rules.  If you
want this type of freedom to be brazen, false, and impolite, than you will
not find it here.

This list was founded for extropic thinking. Show a little of it.  Move on
and maybe we will all be the wiser and better communicators.

This is incorrect, Ron.  Mike share some of the some of the same political
leandings as many others on this list.

I said people have been unsubscribed in the past and might in the future. 
There is no threat. If people disregard list rules that will be enforced
now the new list moderators will deal with it promptly, rather than a slack
moderation that ignored peoples' complaints and dissatisfaction.

Natasha,
       Please don't ban me from the list -- I sent my resignation in nearly a

We are working on two lists, and when we get the parameters established I
plan to announce it, or have an announcement from the new 6 list
moderators.  Good suggestions, thanks.

We are all still humans.  Espousing TransHumanism doesn't make one a 
trans-human.  So don't be surprised that normal human politics it the 
actual reaction pattern even among those who promote other patterns as 
preferable.  And when the rules are vague and subjective, then those 
making the decisions will be greatly influenced by their own emotions. 
Will be, not may be.  In that situation there *is* not alternative.

I don't trust any centralized authority run by people, because over and 
over again people have proven untrustworthy.  But I do trust traffic 
signals.  They only play the favorites that they are designed to play 
(e.g., emergency vehicles, or timed signals).

OTOH, I don't trust voting machines.  Consider the reasons:
1) how they work is hidden.
2) there have already been instances where they were appearantly corrupted.
3) reputable authorities have stated publically that they don't have 
good safeguards against being corrupted.
4) Influencing the vote so that your client wins has a tremendously high 
payoff.
But do you really think that the prior elections were without 
corruption?  Even after the last one, where several different modes of 
corrupting the vote became public knowledge?

Centralized authority is an inherrent weakness when the authority can 
benefit from misusing it's power.  It's an evolutionary process, and if 
you don't consider the likely mutations, you can't predict the end 
result, but it won't be what you wanted.

I certainly agree. Mars is a wonderful world.

Since I currently run a rpg scenario set on a future terraformed Mars I
have had the enjoyable challenge of converting Nasa's altitude
observations into maps (Matlab works well for this too), and then learning
some regions by heart. The resolution of the maps is so high that one can
really think about city planning or just how heavy a trek would be. It
would be wonderful to stand at the edge of da Vinci and look down into
Hydraote chaos, or to treck along Shalbatana Vallis towards Orson Welles.
Just the names of the regions are beautiful, and some of the places looks
amazing (see my renderings of Noctis Labyrinthus and a terraformed
Juventae Chasma at http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/Game/Mars/labyrinthus.jpg
and http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/Game/Mars/pdl1.jpg - the directory also
contains some of my maps for a seriously terraformed Mars)

Another great Mars map to start with is
http://geopubs.wr.usgs.gov/open-file/of02-282/of02-282.pdf
with close-ups athttp://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/mgrid_mola.html

Why go to Middle Earth when there is another Earth? :-)

I certainly have sympathy with this line of response: there will not be any
significant improvement until we change our natures. However, transhumanists
sometimes suggest that even in the absence of changing our nature the
application of science and technology to our (human) lives will emcipate us
from at least some extant social ills. I guess to such transhumanists you
would say: 'not likely'. In any event, what I suggest is an experiment: I
take it you will bet on the null hypothesis here: the application of
technology and information about our social natures will do little to change
the normal course of human politics. You may be right, running the
experiment would be one way to decide the issue.

I'm not sure I understand the relevance of the voting discussion. I'm not
suggesting that we vote people off the list, I'm suggesting that people
might change their behavior in response to the signals they get about the
value of their posts. Think of it as somewhat like a market. We are
producers of messages and we want as many people to "buy" our messages as
possible. If I send out messages that have a high perceived noise to signal
ratio many people will put me in their killfile, so I will have fewer
"buyers". I agree about the perennial dangers of centralized authority, and
while what I am suggesting is not immune from distortion, I also think the
dangers of corruption are fairly minimal. The public display of the
killfiles might look like a table with everyone's name on this list (there
is what about a 1000 people on this list?) on the X and Y axis. I could look
up your name and see if I am in your killfile and you can look up my name
and see if I am in your killfile. One conjecture then is that if people can
signal their dislike of someone's posts by using the killfile this may
reduce the acrimonious exchanges that sometimes go on. If we are having such
an exchange I might put you in my killfile and you might retaliate by
putting me in your killfile--and so would end the exchange. Next to each
person's name would be the number of people that have entered him or her
into their killfiles. The conjecture is that people might change their
behavior so as not to be entered into too many killfiles. Take an extreme
example. Suppose an individual posts tons of Nazi propaganda to the list
every day. I conjecture that almost all will enter this person into their
killfiles, hence the Nazi's voice will go unheard. This Nazi cannot complain
about a centralized authority squashing her voice since the killfiles are
set by individuals. As I said, the right to free speech does not entail an
obligation on others to listen. The reason this system would be relatively
impervious to corruption is that each person's killfile would be displayed.
If there was an attempt to discredit someone by artificially raising their
killfile quotient this could be easily detected because each killfile is
assignable to a specific individual. If the list managers tried to
artificially raise your killfile quotient they would have to assign it to
some individuals, say one of them is me. When I look and see that my
preferences have been tampered with I will scream bloody blue murder on and
off the list.

Cheers,

A very well-done site in Denmark about using "soft kill option" methods
to create optimal mechanical structures:

http://www.topopt.dtu.dk/

They apply it to MEMS, satelites, phonon bandgap materials, materials with
negative Poisson coefficient, bridges and everything else - and have an
interactive applet where you can try it out for yourself!

The basic idea is to take a domain subjected to forces, calculate where it
needs reinforcing and where it is lightly loaded, and redistribute
material to where it is needed. The results often have a nice organic
style - I like the branching pylons that often result.

Pardon me for interrupting into what seems to me to be a family squabble.
As a mortgage broker, I rarely have anything useful to contribute to this
list. I follow that same interests as many of you, but I can only devote a
minimal amount of time to the things that I find intersting and wonderful
about humanity while many of you are experts in your fields.
I think that I may be in a unique position to contribute this time. This is
because I don't know anyone on this list. Although I  haven't been around
long, I read each and every post.

One thing that I think nearly everyone here will agree with is that
diversity is a good thing. Both in terms of living organisms, and in human
society. Without this diversity, things would move forward much slower.

The largest appeal that this list has to me is the wide range of opinions on
a wild array of subjects. There are many nrilliant minds here. There are
people from all walks of life. Somepeople are sensitive, others are harsh.
Overall, the blend is excellent.

Some of you have pointed out that the list has rules and that these rules
need to be followed. Others trump the value of unimpeded free speech. I am
certain that the best road to follow is somewhere in the middle.

The expulsion of Mike Lorrey has caused quite a ruckus. It seems to be
having a cascading affect on the list. As people withdraw, more seem to be
coming closer to doing so. Many may have already left without the farewell
letter that Lee Corbin provided. This could very well drastically reduce the
diversity on this list.

At the same time, there are people who seem to have a justifiable grudge
against Mike.

It seems to me that the problem here is how best to protect everyone's
interest and at the same time, allow for differing opinions.

The expulsion of Mike Lorrey seems to have been too harsh. What I would
suggest is a different response to Mike's apparent rude comments. I suggest
a system of governing rules that provide a few steps between a warning and
expulsion. It would work like this:
1.) written warning
2.) short suspension (2 weeks)
3.) long suspension (1 month)
4.) Expulsion (with ability to make amends and ask for a vote to be brought
back to the list)
5.) Permanent expulsion

This would allow for the occasional venting if someone deemed it necessary.
We would all have to consider the cost-benefit of what we say on this list
without fearing removal from the list. It would also prevent people from
engaging in continuous personal attacks.

Finally, with the ability to appeal the first expulsion decision, it allows
a person who engages in thistype pf activity to work out their differences
with the offended party before coming back, and would only allow them back
if the majority of people felt that this person added value to the list.

I know this seems simple. I'm not fortunate to have a doctorate or work in
research. Some ofyou may see my post and assume that I am a "stupid". But I
couldn't just sit back and watch such a brilliant group of people act so
foolishly any longer.

Let me know what you think. Maybe we can petition for this type of change
and get some of these people back.

In your message you use the word killfile fifteen times.

Maybe it has to to with a language barrier, but when I read the word
killfile 15 times in a 35 line message I get the impression there is a war
going on in the heads of the posters. All this scoring and voting,
collecting
points, making impressions, being competitive, getting adapted to the rat
race of a mental market place.. Scoring, statistics  . . . well I simply
don`t like it. The use of this very word "killfile" suggests a hostile
atmosphere, at least a competitive one with this
noise-to-signal-ratio-correctness, always this obsession to be efficient.

I never implemented a killfile in my whole Internet career. I want to *know*
what my opponents think. That's why I read their messages with a special
care and interest. Sometimes I learn from them more than from persons I
always agree with.

Luckily someone forwarded this message to me. ;  )

I agree that 'killfile' doesn't exactly have pleasant overtones--of course
it is not a term I invented. I'm not sure what should replace it:
'conserving electrons' or 'the right not to hear' are way too cumbersome.

It would be foolish not to admit that the system I propose would not be
without costs, and you rightly point out that it may foster a competitive
spirit, and some may take this to be a cost. As far as I can see, there are
three options on the table, no list monitoring, coercive monitoring, or
trying a market option. The first sins against list quality, the second
against liberty, and the third against fostering a non-competitive
atmosphere. Presumably you find the cost of the latter too high to even try
as an experiment, so you'll opt for one of the first two options. Myself I
am undecided. I would like to see the experiment run, say for 3 or 4 months,
before I decide. I find it hard to imagine in the abstract how large a cost
the competitive spirit would be. I can certainly imagine the cost to be too
high or the system otherwise unmanageable--that's why I call it an
'experiment'.

Thanks for your feedback.

Full paper is available from Professor Alan Heaven's web site:
http://www.roe.ac.uk/~afh/MC1190rv.pdf

Quotes:
The universe is gently fading into darkness according to three 
astronomers who have looked at 40,000 galaxies in the neighborhood of 
the Milky Way.

"Our analysis confirms that the age of star formation is drawing to a 
close", says Alan Heavens. "The number of new stars being formed in the 
huge sample of galaxies we studied has been in decline for around 6 
billion years - roughly since the time our own Sun came into being."

"Stars are formed in galaxies and there was a peak in the rate at which 
galaxies formed, and that time has passed and been and gone," Prof 
Heavens said.

Professor Tony Hewish, who won the Nobel prize in 1974 for his work in 
discovering quasars at Cambridge University, said the dimming effect 
would be made worse by those bright stars that did remain being spread 
further apart as the universe expanded.

"We live in an accelerating universe now and so, as time goes on, the 
density of galaxies is going to thin out," he said. "As far as we know 
the universe as it is now is going to expand for ever, so ultimately it 
must do something like that."
End quotes.


So apparently there are no signs of new energy being created by alien 
civilizations in the 40,000 galaxies surveyed. It all seems to be 
gradually dying out. And they are dying out in line with the natural 
lifespan of stars - not because they are being put in a box and used as 
batteries. :)

Well, I don't believe in deliberately censoring anyone. I don't really mind hitting the delete button on my emails if I read something I don't like. I also try to stay out of the "flame war" mentality in general. It's definitely the list moderator's job to warn people and then remove them if they are consistently behaving "badly" as determined by the list owners.

That's my two cents. Otherwise, I am glad to stay here and interact with y'all!

Peace,

Artillo

There are two very easy answers to that question.

First, there is no "magic" on Mars (at least to my knowledge) --
i.e. no "one ring".

Second, Mars does not have Liv Tyler (Arwen) or Cate Blanchett
(Galadriel).

As much as I admire the landscapes of Mars -- they do not
produce the emotional attachments that Middle Earth does.

(Seriously Anders, now that you have resolved the issue of a PhD,
the next question becomes *when* will Anders get a girlfriend,

With respect to Mars, you will have to up the emotional significance --

My preference is unmoderated lists; however, the proposed moderated list
for discussion and another for chit chat is a workable approach.  On our
TLC (Thailand-Laos-Cambodia) lists one is for mission and the other for
chit chat.  It appeals to those with varying employment restrictions and
interests.

I too prefer not to killfile anyone, even the most (IMO) arrogant, bombastic,
and ignorant poster.  I dislike stereotyping.  Here is a quote from my
Humanistic Psychology textbook: " [...] one may have a mystical experience -
een one which may change one's life.  This is not controllable: and if there
is one thing which academics are about it is control.  It doesn't matter
whether they are old nasty positivists of new shiny constructionists, they
are all about control.  Nietzsche would have laughed."

But there are rumours that there exists a backdoor or exploit in all the
Red Era nanotech that would give the wielder power over the solettas, the
Marinovska plants, the unageing nanoists - everything. It is said to have
been compiled on top of Pavonis Mons by the Chief Areologist but was lost
after the Battle of Tharsis when rouge memeticists ambushed the bearer
somewhere along Coprates Chasma :-)

That is an interesting issue. Could it be that we have terrestrial
landforms so strongly imprinted in our brains that we won't perceive
grandeur (beyond the initial wow!) in an alien landscape? Maybe it is true
for us, but I would be surprised if Mars-born children saw it the same way
("Earth mountains are so *squat*! And that horrible blue sky color!")
Brains are plastic.

The real answer is of course that my SO at any moment is my current
project. Right now it is martian landscapes, a few weeks back it was
minimal surfaces and in a few weeks it could be astrobiology. I like to
play the field.

In my setting, there was actually a political conflict between the
terraformers and Dysonistas about the division of the mass and energy of
the solar system. In the end the Cruithne Accords of 2136 (attached below)
settled the issue (most ended up in the Dyson of course).

In reality the issue will decided by the speed things go software after
large-scale space colonisation occurs. If the Introdus begins early there
will not be many who have formed strong emotional ties to Mars (and humans
form emotional ties to *anything* they are close to for more than a few
minutes ;-) and few will object to optimizing things. If the Introdus is
late, then there will be people opposing dismantling of their
"homeworlds", and much will depend on respect for property rights and
relative willingness to compromise. The accords below might actually be a
good example of such a compromise. It is not unlikely that the posthumans
were thinking long term here: sooner or later the Homo sapiens cultures
would come around anyway, and then dismantling could be done with no
quarrels. They can wait for total optimization a few millennia.




The Cruithne Accord

1.	Earth and Mars, with their respective natural satellite systems and
space within these systems out to their L2 points, are entitled to 1400
and 606 W/m^2 respectively (99% of natural solar output as measured June
2136) or enough augmented solar input necessary to keep their climate
within the standard parameters of the 2120-2136 period, whichever is the
largest. The spectral characteristic of the solar radiation is not to
deviate markedly from a stellar blackbody spectrum. Other regions of the
solar system are left open to exploitation.

2.	All polities outside the Dyson sphere are entitled to a hemispherical
4K sky entropy sink and no more entropy influx than the June 2136 standard
sun.

3.	The resources of the Earth and Mars systems are left under control of
their local polities (the NEO Adhoc and UN of Earth, MTN of Mars) or
successor polities to these.

4.	The Mars system polity is acknowledged as owner of current MTN mining
outposts, the bodies they are located on and masses in transit from and to
these, as well as an additional 1e23 kg of mass from as yet unallocated
mass.

5.	The Earth system is acknowledged as owner of current mining outposts
based on Earth or NEO economies, the bodies they are located on and masses
in transit from and to these, as well as an additional 1e23 kg of mass
from as yet unallocated mass.

6.	The Dyson community is acknowledged as owner of currently designated
Dyson or Trophe-Posthuman habitats and systems, the bodies they are
located on and masses in transit from and to these.

7.	Unallocated mass and energy beyond these accords are to be distributed
by a first-come-first-served basis according to the Revised Outer Space
Treaty of 2104.

8.	The use of autonomously self-replicating non-citizen systems that can
survive in free space is prohibited.

9.	If a conflict about these resources, the proper division of a multiply
colonised body or the proper interpretation of these accords occurs, all
parties defer to the reconvention of the Cruithne Summit or delegate
authority.

Note: The Cruithne Accord process delegated a body allocation court to
settle the issues related to the Jupiter moons, Juno and WK3934. The body
allocation court formally remains in service for the future located at
Cruithne.

I'm glad you pointed out the two distinct lists, there is the Nanogirl News
list (just news) and the Nanotech list (news and discussion). This model has
worked very well for myself and the members of the two differing lists.
Originally I had just the one list that had not only the news but was also
open to discussion (which is still in the form of the Nanotech list).
Unfortunately this forced acceptance by members who were only interested in
the latest news to also fill up there inbox with messages they were not
interested in or just did not have time to read or respond to (this leads to
unsubscribers), this was the birth of the separate lists. By providing these
two options members are not lost, they can find their own comfort zone.
Maintaining email lists is not as easy as it may seem, especially when the
group is large and consists of many opinions and intellects. My list's
subject of nanotech is more narrow than the topics discussed here on the
extropy list, this creates even more complexity.  I would like to think that
as a code I do not like censorship, when I began my list, I would not deny
any post with free speech as a priority. However this code has been broken
and I have been at times forced to intervene as moderator. I do not like to,
as it would be a much easier world to keep everyone happy, this however can
occasionally be, impossible. At times things have been submitted that appear
to be spam in disguise, here in lies the approval issue.  I recall an
incident where profane insults were being thrown around and the discussion
wavered from the topic of the list, the focus was lost. Since I would like
my list to be appropriate for everyone (my email group settings in fact
specify that the group is appropriate for all ages), as the nanotech meme is
imperative to those of all ages, including youth, I had to express my
concern to the list and suggest (warnings that other members don't see can
be ignored) that the argument move somewhere else more appropriate. I was
very happy that everything was quickly resolved. Of course the Nanogirl News
list, is extremely easy to maintain, since only the news is distributed.
There has never been a problem. The few I have had on the other list, were
minor and worth going through to be able to enjoy the full experience of the
list. I suggest that the rarity of occurrences on my list, since 1998 are
still very good statistics. This must be accounted for on such a high
density of members on this list as well. This list is very open and very
patient, I know.  I don't know what exactly is going on here or what has
been said, I've been so busy that I'm not reading everything, I've only
caught bits and pieces. I just thought I would share my experience regarding
maintaining lists since they were mentioned. We discuss the big questions on
this list, for that we should be proud. There's nothing else like here
(there's no place like home!). Gina Miller`

Just a quick point of personal explanation (for the record):

At 08:22 AM 8/18/03 -0700, Robert wrote:

This might leave the impression that I agitated behind the scenes for
Mike's removal. On the contrary. In the OFFLIST email exchange Robert cites
above, I said this:

==================
[Robert:]
>Clearly in my discussions with Natasha currently

[DB:]
I assumed she was angered by Mike's outspoken attacks on her. That doesn't
seem at all the kind of reason for throwing someone off a list.

==================

Robert wrote:

so I sent him several examples, headed with the comment:

>(I say nothing on whether or not I find them *justifiable* or *censorable*)

And of course I had already made my sentiment clear at the outset, when I
wrote of Mike's then-rumored expulsion:

>Seems extreme, if true.

Wow

So Fraud on Enron's part is an excuse to blame the victims?
Because: anyone who misunderstands you is simply failing to be worthy 
of interpersonal communication.
?????

Really? Being new, I never met Mr. Mike, but I find it hard to believe 
that he was mentally retarded.

If you want to have a private list for the self-admirer's, fine, but a 
little boring.

I honestly came here looking for some practical notions - how are we 
really going to break the death barrier.  So far what I've seen is 
common to every list everywhere - infighting, hurt feelings, etc.  
Quality in lists should probably be about substance.  This thread has 
no substance.

People "have to go" on mailing lists.  That's all.  Tant pis.  I just 
hope someone offers the exiting members the opportunity to take the 
live-for-2000-7000-years pill when it gets figured out.

Anyone got any live-forever pills they'd be willing sell?

Best,

Robbie

With all due respect for Lee I would hardly call his (imho too hasty) 
departure a "disaster for the list" nor would I call the rest of the 
resulting noise a "disaster".    Thinks got shaken up a bit.  Why not wait

I'm on an American Bar Association moderated list where the discussion
topics range far and wide, but there are strict rules about politeness and
topics that are not welcome -- for example, controversial political topics.
There are sublists of the main list, and the rules allow members to
introduce, say, a political topic for the purpose of letting other list
members know that the topic is up for discussion on the sublist. But if
someone responds to the initial post on the main list, that person is gently
reminded to take it to the sublist. If the person persists in ignoring the
list rules, that person loses his or her posting privileges (interestingly,
I've never seen a female lose her posting privileges; it's always males who
can't seem to back down).

Mike was incredibly rude to Natasha, and I thought she responded politely
and diplomatically on the list. I'm not sure what I would have done in her
place, I know I would have been very upset if someone had talked to me the
way Mike talked to her. But I don't think he would have been asked to leave
if it had been only a personal matter. As Greg pointed out, if one doesn't
have fairly high standards, the quality of a list suffers, and the quality
of the list reflects on ExI itself.

It's a pity that Lee and others have chosen to leave rather than approach
the situation as an opportunity to make the list, and the organization,
better.

As you were the one that made a baseless insinuation out of my remark about 
your denial (that river in egypt), there is nothing further I need say.   It 
is apparent that you take personal umbrage with me, in part because I say 
that temporarily suspending Mike makes sense.   You haven't addressed what 
reasons I gave.   This is no surprise as apparently any offenses never seemed 
to be such to you at the time.     The long list general denial that anything 
is wrong and the unwillingness to do anything about it was what finally led 
Harvey Newstrom to leave, you might remember.   It is certainly not the case 
that taking action to enforce list quality is most likely to harm the list or 
lose good people.

I'm on record here as supporting the use of killfiles (I certainly use them
myself - as an aside, I've noticed that half my killfile has been unsubbed
or quit in disgust in the last day or two. ROTFL).

I support Mark's idea above; I think public killfiles are a great idea; it's
a strong decentralised alternative to moderation.

But I'd call it a filter; what you are doing, after all, is filtering the
list.

For an implementation, I'd actually like the option to receive all the email
from my killfile, but with a tag in the subject like "[filtered]" so that I
can have them automatically shunt them into a different mail folder, as I do
like to peruse my killfile occasionally.

Anyway, that's two thumbs-up from me.

No, it's filtering *people*. I don't know about your individual eagerness to
spread the memes of transhumanism. But If you already fail to listen to
people who were determined enough to subscribe to a transhumanist email
list, I wonder how much patience you will have with people who never  heard
of this meme complex before. From my point of view you (plural: all people
with killfiles) already fail at this very first step of a specific email
list, where people meet to talk about future development and how to realize
these ideas.

The very existence of killfiles and the very choice of this word might be
taken as an insult.

To refer to killfiles as a generally accepted internet custom does not
convince me. I always thought we wanted to make it better.

By the way, as far as I am concerned, I simply want to expand my knowledge.
That's why I am here. I am no missionary and I am not interested in gaining
power and influence in society to boost technological or transhumanist
development.

Honestly, I do not understand why you make such a fuzz about ist, adding
more control procedures, or urging list administrators to implement more
functions that might make the system susceptible to collapses.

Why don't you (plural again) just relax and let the news stream into your
computer and forget about control for a while  . . .

There was a very interesting program on the PBS TV tonight
pointing out a very interesting link between C.S. Lewis,
Tolkien and Hugo Dyson (whose relationship to Freeman Dyson
remains unknown to me).

I offer you:
  "There and Back Again: J.R.R. Tolkien and the Inklings"
  Rev. Maggie McNaught
  http://www.firstpaloalto.com/Sermons/2002/S08-11-2.htm

I like the document from the perspective of what it links together
and documents.  I particularly like the last third of the document.

I just have a few comments about the recent expulsions and exits of the 
list.

Somehow this is a very personal issue, but I really don't feel 
comfortable about discussing personal issues as it very easy becomes ad 
hominem. So I will try to keep it general.


As far as I can see, the problem with certain posters is not their 
political views. One side or the other.

The problem has allways been about skewing the direction of the list.

There is an infinite amount of subjects that can be discussed on a 
mailing list. But for it to be an Extropian mailing list, the subjects 
need some kind of extropian content.

Some subjetcs are clearly extropian some are clearly not extropian. And 
in between are subjects that are only sligtly extropian.

Some of these "fringe" subjects are of great interrest to some extropians.

As far as I see, some posters has a tendency to skew the comments they 
read, and lead them in the direction of their special interrest. So they 
reply to a posting on another subject and make it into a thread about 
their favourite subject.

Sort of "If you got a hammer everything looks like a nail."

Also they have a tendency to reply more often to other postings in these 
their favourite subject areas.

This has the effect that they kind of hi-jack the list and make it into 
a kind of special interrest group for something that is only slightly 
extropian.

So the list gets skewed.

And it is hard to put a finger on exactly what the problem is, as the 
subjects are somewhat extropian. But their "fringenes" and the amount of 
skewed subjects makes it into a general problem for the list.

Wich makes other people on the list frustrated.

Personally I saved several months of messages in an inbox. Then I sorted 
them by sender and evaluated who had made to many skewed postings in 
those months. My mailfilter then puts them into a special folder that i 
only view occationally.

The funny thing is that there was many entire threads that ended up in 
my "fringe" folder. Because some "groups" mostly comunicated with each 
other about the fringe subjects.

But I don't think that is the best solution. The fringe subjects DO 
belong on the list, just not in the volume that it can sometime be.

So I am all in favour of list moderation to keep the discussions in the 
center of the gaussian normal distribution of relevant subjects.

I agree that filtering is a better description and killfile just doesn't
sound pleasant. Another way to make the same point is to think of it as
individual customizing of the list--if you choose to filter out emails from
certain people then you are in effect subscribing to a proper subset of the
list. It occurs to me that the list could actually in principle divide into
two or more distinct groups--suppose persons 1-500 filter out the messages
from 500-1000 and vice versa. This would be an interesting result in social
ecology. Of course this will not happen because some have already stated
that they never use such filters. In any event, I see this as no worse than
when a party breaks up into the "kitchen people" and the "living room
people". Indeed, filters are no worse than avoiding those people at a party
who want to show you 700 photos of their kids at a little league tournament
and talk about the latest reality tv show.

Good idea. I've followed threads where someone is responding to someone who
I have filtered and it is sometimes very handy to be able to go back and
look at the original message.

Quotes:
The number of people with Alzheimer's could treble by 2050, say US 
researchers, as the population surges and existing patients live longer.
Scientists project that some 13.2 million older Americans will have 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) by 2050 unless new ways are found to prevent or 
treat the disease.

The US team, from Rush Institute on Healthy Aging, claimed that the huge 
rise could effectively bankrupt the country's medicare system, and 
called for more funding for research into treatments.

The primary cause of the rise is the fact that many more people are 
expected to live into their 80s and 90s in the future.

Beyond 80, as many as one in five people has some form of dementia.
Many require highly expensive health and social care, and it is possible 
that the disease will not greatly alter their lifespan.

End quotes.


The authorities seem to be depending on the hope that research will find 
a cure before these projections become reality.

Referring back to the previous thread about early retirement, it seems 
that not only will the working population have to pay for more and more 
pensions for people that are living longer, but they will also have to 
pay for more and more medical and social care costs as well.

Better retire soon, while you still can!

Baseless? Do you really want me to quote back your post where you invite me
to swim with the crocodiles? Or would you prefer the one you sent a few
hours later where immediately after explaining that personal insults are the
worse thing that could possibly happen to this list you say I am
tremendously uncaring, unobservant, dishonest and like to stick my head in
the sand?

    >I say that temporarily suspending Mike makes sense.

If so then please explain why temporarily suspending you wouldn't make sense
too. Please note I'm not pushing to expel anyone, I don't mind a few
insults, but you must see the inconsistency.

Exactly--and I know with acceptable probability that I have no interest
in, and will derive no value from, what those *people* have to say.

The way I don't have the time or the inclination to listen to the
pitch of every panhandler on my block on the way home from work (I
live on Haight in SF, so this is a considerable number of individuals),
I also have neither the time or the inclination to read the arrogance
and vitriol of certain members of ANY group forum like this extro list.
We all have to deal with a copious volume of personal communication.
Some of it is of value, some is not.

I'm not typically one for breathless technofetishism, but blessed be
the killfile.  It's a monstrously powerful and wonderful tool.

But actively spreading the meme complex isn't everyone's agenda (in fact,
by your own statement, it isn't even yours).  I'm here because it exposes
me to a lot of interesting developments in science and technology, because
I hope to live in a time where we see dramatic human life extension,
because I believe that humans should have the right to the access,
modification and extension of their own bodies, minds, genetic codes.

I don't assume that everyone in the world does, should or will share
these opinions.

Over my dead, decapitated, disassembled body.

In particular, without allowing for (8), you have no way of enforcing
the rest of the Cruithne Accord process.

Do you really believe that the NEO Adhoc or the Dyson Core Entelechy
will not take advantage of opportunities to grab the available energy
and subsequently the available mass?

The UN and the Martian Terraforming Network are at the bottom of
gravity wells and they have an inherent disadvantage should their
competitors decide to execute a coup d'etat.

My input in the META brainstorm:

1) One should not aim at fully explicit list rules.

By trying to discharge oneself of controversial choices through fully
stated rules, one gets simplistic, plain bad solutions. The owners
retain their freedom of appreciation and make use of it.

2) Participants in a private forum are guests and should behave as
such.

This is a well-known situation that doesn't require extra rules.
Spitting on the host, for example, or saying that the place stinks, is
not really an option. Except on your way out, of course, before to
slam the door. (In fact, what's the point of staying in a stinking
place anyway?)

3) Keep the list open and diverse.

What seduced me when I discovered extropians a few years ago was its
(intelligent) openness, and the resulting (rich, interesting)
diversity of participants and content. Moderation decisions, in my
opinion, should try to protect that.

I cannot ban you from the list. Also, if you would like to unsubscribe from
the list, you have to do this yourself.  It can be done from the website.

"You also said, "If this is a problem for anyone on this list, either 
deal with it or not.  But to continue harping on it and whining about it
and 
trying to further problems,..."  I have dealt with it.  So have a number of 
others -- in one fashion or another we have departed because the uneven
handling of the list has sickened us."

Many people left the list prior because they felt that sickened by what you
and others have written.  This is precisely why we are trying to find a
resolve and deal with the problems.

"So why am I replying?  Because I consider it despicable to continue 
attacking Mike in his absence.  As he isn't here to defend himself I have

What attacks against Mike?

Robert, just curious, but by preserve the 'death' meme, are you suggesting 
an afterlife awaits us after death? Or, is death simply oblivion?  Or, am I 
missing some other option you have in mind?

Thanks for clarifying this for me.  I hope I'm not asking a question that's 
been asked a hundred times before.

I'd like to point out an alternate strategy that has worked well for me:
I filter the list, but rather than "kill" posts from characteristically low
quality posters, I "promote" posts from characteristically high quality
posters to an email folder separate from the one that collects all the
Extropy, SL4, WTA, Fabric of Reality, etc. messages that I group together.
That way I see many of the most interesting posts in my priority reading,
and if I have the time or interest I browse through the rest.  You never
know when a person you would normally ignore is gonna go and say something
interesting.

I did that for a couple of years, and it was ok. Then I tried "filtering" it
a little, experimentally (in effect splitting the list in two, one which I
read almost all of, and one which I read sometimes, but not often or most
of). It improved my experience of the list considerably. 

I'm happy to stick with that, with personal filtering. However, I supported
Mark's proposal, as an alternative to moderation. Given that there have been
problems with the list because of the free-for-all approach (according to
others; it's never worried me personally), I'd much rather see a
decentralised solution to signal/noise and abuse problems than a centralised
one. I think that public feedback about filters is probably a very useful
tool in this regard.

However, I'd be more than happy for the list to remain unfettered; leave
each subscriber to manage his/her own data flood; it's the individual's
option.

While my similar division of the list into two groups was less methodical
than your (kudos, btw), I experienced the same situation. At the extropian
party, to poorly paraphrase Mark Walker, there seems to be a long-lived
group in the kitchen and a similar long-lived group in the lounge, and
little communication/transferal between the two.

I've never noticed this in Anders' graphs. I'd be interested in Anders'
comments on this.

I just did a free rendering into somewhat idiomatic English of the great
philosopher Kant's key essay (for a German newspaper) on the topic of the
Enlightenment. Of course, where I speak of representatives and elected
heads of state he was speaking of Frederick the all powerful ruler; he
meant Prussia where we tend to read the USA. His tone is somewhat
chillingly patronizing to most of his fellow citizens, but that isn't alien
to many posts on this list. What is disturbing is how little the rhetoric
and argument has changed in nearly a quarter of a millennium. 

The most hilarious line comes toward the end, where Kant mentions that at
least these pesky thought controllers don't try to interfere with our
choices in science and the arts. Maybe this was bleak irony, but I suspect
it was just that few people had access to either, and that the sciences had
not yet revealed their power.

When I say `idiomatic' I'm speaking loosely; the tone that comes through
still has a musty 1930s flavor. You can compare a more literal
interpretation at

Damien Broderick

=======================

IMMANUEL KANT
An Answer to the Question: "What is Enlightenment?" 
Konigsberg in Prussia, 30th September, 1784.

Enlightenment is our emergence from self-imposed intellectual submission.
By submission I mean the refusal to trust your own grasp of reality, bowing
to the dictates of authority. What's lacking in the submissive isn't any
raw capacity for understanding, but the resolution and courage to use it
without kowtowing to imposed direction. So the motto of enlightenment is:
Have the guts to use your own intelligence, to follow your own reasoning!
	Why do so many people happily submit their whole lives long to authority?
Laziness and cowardice! This allows a few among us, all too easily, to set
themselves up as guardians over the rest. It's so convenient to drift
along! If I can depend on a manual of instructions, a spiritual adviser to
serve as my conscience, a doctor to choose my prescriptions, all the rest
of it, I needn't make any effort. Don't think, just pay up and toe the
line; let others take over the tedious job of thinking for me. 
	Those do-gooders who generously accepted the task of running our lives
quickly made sure that the majority think any step in the direction of
self-command must be extremely dangerous and difficult. First they dumb us
down, then they lead us by the nose. In reality, the danger isn't so very
great. Despite a few early topples, everyone eventually learns to walk. But
falling on your face intellectually is intimidating, and usually frightens
us off from further attempts.
	Such self-imposed submission becomes almost second nature, so for an
isolated individual it's hard to work your way free. You grow fond of being
told what to do and think-it's nice to have someone else do the work for
you! When you've never been allowed to make the attempt, you lose the
capacity to exercise your own understanding. Dogmas and formulas come to
seem the automatic and rational default. In fact, they're a brake. Yet if
you wiggle free of those rules you find you're paralyzed, since you're
unaccustomed to moving by yourself. To date, only a few individuals have
cultivated their own minds sufficiently to free themselves from management
by others. 
	By contrast, an entire community stands a better chance of enlightening
itself. In fact, if people are left free to work things out for themselves
in a spirit of solidarity, enlightenment is almost inevitable. Here's how
it works: even among the elite, there'll always be those few who do think
for themselves. Once they make the breakthrough to enlightenment, they can
start to spread the spirit of rational respect for personal value, for the
duty we all have to think for ourselves. Strangely, though, a public that's
been under the thumb of self-appointed guardians is likely to insist on
retaining the status quo. Numbing routines of thought finally avenge
themselves on the very people who first established the rules (or whose
predecessors did so). A community can only achieve enlightenment slowly,
working against this inertia. 
	A bloody revolution may well succeed in putting an end to autocratic
despotism, to rapacious or power-seeking oppression-but it can never
produce a true reform in ways of thinking. Instead, new knee-jerk habits,
no better than the ones they replaced, will emerge to control the
thoughtless majority.
	For enlightenment, all that's needed is freedom of public speech, the most
innocuous form of all: freedom to make public use of your reason, whatever
the issue. Yet around the world we hear: Don't argue! The military roar:
Don't argue, get in line! The tax-official: Don't argue, pay up! The
clergyman, the rabbi, the mullah: Don't argue, trust in God! By contrast,
our own enlightenment culture says: Argue as much as you like and about
whatever you like, with one proviso: At the end of the arguments, obey the
law! 
	So there are restrictions on freedom everywhere. Yet while some
restrictions prevent enlightenment, others actually promote it. Here's the
paradox: the public use of reason must always be free, and by itself it can
bring about enlightenment. But private reasoning may quite often be very
narrowly restricted, without unduly hindering the progress of
enlightenment. The public use of your own reason is what we might call the
work of the public intellectual, addressing the community in informed
debate. What I've termed the private use of reason is the mental activity
required when you accept a task with which you're entrusted.
	For example, it would be damaging if a military officer on duty quibbled
openly about the appropriateness or usefulness of an order. He must simply
obey his superior. But he can't reasonably be stopped from commenting on
any errors in the military service, even putting these criticisms forward
publicly for judgement. A citizen can't refuse to pay taxes levied on him,
but he doesn't contravene his civil obligations by publicly voicing
objections to the impropriety or even injustice of such taxes. A clergyman
is employed by a church on condition that he will instruct pupils and
congregation in accordance with its doctrines. But as a scholar, he is not
only completely free but also obliged to covey to the community his
carefully considered, well-intentioned thoughts on any mistaken aspects of
those doctrines, and to offer suggestions for a better arrangement of
religious and ecclesiastical affairs. 
	And there is nothing in this division of rights and responsibilities to
trouble the conscience. He'll say: Our church teaches the following
doctrine, using the following arguments. He then extracts as much practical
value as possible for his congregation even from precepts he harbors some
doubts about, but which he can nevertheless undertake to expound, since it
is not in fact wholly impossible that they may contain truth. Of course if
the clergyman found anything opposed to the essence of religion in them,
he'd have to resign his post rather than teach against his conscience.
Conversely, as a scholar addressing the world at large through his
writings, the clergyman making public use of his reason enjoys unlimited
freedom to use his own reason and to speak in his own person. Otherwise
there is no means to break free of error, an absurdity which amounts to
making absurdities permanent.
	A social contract intended to prevent all further enlightenment of
humankind forever is absolutely null and void, however solemnly ratified.
One age cannot enter into an alliance on oath to put the next age in a
position where it would be impossible for it to extend and correct its
knowledge, particularly on such important matters, or to make any progress
whatsoever in enlightenment. This would be a crime against human nature,
whose original destiny lies precisely in such progress. Later generations
are thus perfectly entitled to dismiss these agreements as unauthorized and
criminal. To test whether any particular measure can be agreed upon as a
law for a people, we need only ask whether a people could justifiably
impose such a law upon itself. This might well be possible for a specified
short period as a means of introducing a certain order, pending, as it
were, a better solution. This would also mean that each citizen,
particularly the ethicist, would be given a free hand as a scholar to
comment publicly, that is, in writings, on the inadequacies of current
institutions. Meanwhile, the newly established order would continue to
exist, until public insight into the nature of such matters had progressed
and proved itself to the point where, by general (if not unanimous) consent
a proposal could be submitted to the lawmakers. 
	But it is absolutely impermissible to agree, even for a single lifetime,
to a permanent ethical constitution which no-one might publicly question.
For this would virtually nullify a phase in humanity's upward progress,
thus making it fruitless and even detrimental to subsequent generations.
For a limited period, you may ethically postpone enlightening yourself in
matters you ought to know about. But to renounce such enlightenment
completely, whether for yourself or even more so for later generations,
means violating and trampling underfoot the sacred rights of humankind. 
	But if people may not even impose such a restriction upon itself, still
less can it legitimately be imposed upon it by their leaders. Their
legislative authority depends precisely upon their role in uniting the
collective will of the people. So long as they see to it that all proposed
improvements are compatible with civil order, leaders can otherwise leave
the citizenry to do whatever we find necessary for our betterment, which is
our own business. The role of law-makers and enforcers is to stop anyone
forcibly hindering others from working as best they can to define and
promote their well-being
	Do we yet live in an enlightened age? No, but we do live in an age of
enlightenment. As things stand at present, we still have a long way to go
before people generally are in a position (or can ever be put into a
position) of using their own understanding confidently and well in ethical
matters, without outside guidance. But there are distinct indications that
the way is now being cleared for the populace to work freely in this
direction, and that the obstacles to universal enlightenment, to our
emergence from his self-imposed submission, are gradually becoming fewer.
In this respect our age is the age of enlightenment, the century of access
to knowledge.
	This spirit of freedom is also spreading globally, even where it has to
struggle with outward obstacles imposed by governments which misunderstand
their own function. For such governments now witness examples of how
freedom may exist without in the least jeopardizing public concord and the
unity of the commonwealth. Citizens will of their own accord gradually work
their way out of barbarism so long as artificial measures are not
deliberately adopted to keep them in it. 
	I have portrayed religious and ethical deliberation as the focal point of
enlightenment. Our political leaders have no interest in assuming the role
of guardians over their citizens in regard to the arts and sciences. But
the attitude of heads of state who favor freedom in the arts and sciences
extends even further, for they realize that there's no danger even to law
and order if the rest of us are permitted to make public use of our own
reason, even if this entails forthright criticism of current legislation. 
	It boils down to this, then: Argue as much as you like on any topic, but
obey the law! Considered in the widest sense, in human affairs nearly
everything is paradoxical. A high degree of civil freedom seems
advantageous to a people's intellectual freedom, yet it also sets up
insuperable barriers to it. Conversely, a lesser degree of civil freedom
gives intellectual freedom enough room to expand to its fullest extent.
What is special and singular in human nature, our inclination and vocation
to think freely, can develop inside these socially stabilizing constraints,
and gradually changes the way we view the world and our capacity to act in
it. Bit by bit, we become increasingly able to act freely. Eventually, even
governments learn that they can profit by treating men and women-who are
more than simple machines-in a manner appropriate to our dignity.

   US Has World's Highest Incarceration Rate

By GAIL RUSSELL CHADDOCK
Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor 

More than 5.6 million Americans are in prison or have served time there,
according to a new report by the Justice Department released Sunday. That's
1 in 37 adults living in the United States, the highest incarceration level
in the world.

[...]
If current trends continue, it means that a black male in the United States
would have about a 1 in 3 chance of going to prison during his lifetime.
For a Hispanic male, it's 1 in 6; for a white male, 1 in 17.

[...]
Justice Department analysts say that experts in criminal justice have long
known of the stark disparities in prison experience, but they have never
been as fully documented. By the end of year 2001, some 1,319,000 adults
were confined in state or federal prisons. An estimated 4,299,000 former
prisoners are still alive, the new report concludes.

In *my* mind the only real "salvation" would appear to be uploading
and then some post-singularity clever tweeking of the physics of the
universe to avoid those paths that currently do not look good.
But I am *not* suggesting that in typical conversations that one get
into these concepts or the concepts of an "afterlife".  If it facilitates
the evolutionary process, let people believe in an "afterlife", let people
believe in "death", and just move people up to the lifespan-extension bar.
(We are trying to be extropians here -- more people believing in some of
the core ideas is probably better than more people rejecting all of the
ideas.)

I am simply suggesting that one not *break* existing memesets by suggesting
that "immortality" is possible to people who are unlikely to believe it --
because in its technical sense "immortality" is very very difficult to
achieve and probably cannot be "proven" using our current understanding
of physics and the hazard function of the universe, galaxies, solar systems,
etc.

Far better to leave people "part of the way there", e.g. a healthy life
for a few hundred years or a few thousand years (depending on how much
their minds may stretch).  Because who knows what we may know at the
end of such periods?  People are much more comfortable extending trends
that their parents and grandparents saw (e.g. "gradual lifespan extension
is accelerating") rather than replacing them with a very different meme
(e.g. "we can become immortal").

It makes it much easier to attack someone like Leon Kass, by asking
"How much healthy life is 'enough'?"  Should one be forced to die at
80, 90, 120, 150...?  Why not 30 (an average age of death in pre-Roman
times)?  The news today noted work on a controversial therapy for Parkinson's
using gene therapy.  Should we *not* attempt that?  The bioethicists that
oppose lifespan extension are on a very slippery slope.  But what would
be useful is to get more people on board with the idea that they can attend
the birthday parties of their great-great-great grandchildren.

I do not believe it as been discussed in detail before, certainly not
a hundred times.

    IRAQ Has World's Highest Government Sanctioned Mass Murder Rate
 
By Concerned humanist
Staff writer of The Humanist Science World Monitor 

Excerpt 
 
"More than 300,000 Iraqis are buried in mass graves, according to a new
report by the Justice for the world Department released Sunday.  With a
population of 24 million, that's 1 in 80 people who end up in an
unmarked mass grave, the highest government sanctioned mass murder rate
in the world.  If the current trends had continued, then over the life
of the Hussien regime it is likely another 300,000 people would have
ended up in these mass graves.  The average Kurd had a 1 in 20 chance of
ending up on the death end of an IRAQ Government action, while the
average Shi-ite had a 1 in 10 chance of ending up murdered."

One wonders why, even though the US has the highest incarceration rate
in the world, its still ranked by non-partisan freedom groups as one of
the freest countries in the world?  Is this report on the entire world,
or post industrialized nations?  Is this based on official govt released
documents, and if so, should we trust the claims made by oppressive
communist regimes who routinely incarcerate or murder political
dissidents?)  

Any link Damien?

We agree that: Communists are awful. Terrorists are awful. Saddam was awful.

It's also awful that other things in parts of the world where we have a
direct influence are awful.

Well, let me be the first to welcome you to our minority viewpoint.
Glad you can admit it.  But don't say 'we agree' unless you mean merely
you and I, because other members of this list obviously do not agree
with that statement.  Because members of this list have argued in favor
of anarcho socialism, that the 'good guys' won in indochina, that Kuwait
wasn't a legit country because Saddam didn't recognize it, etc. etc. I
will continue to repeat that communists, terrorists, and saddam are
awful and present evidence supporting that statement until I no longer
see such odd statements on this mailing list, or until I come across
convincing evidence suggesting the none of those things are awful.

I know my anti-communists and terrorists articles are quite distracting
to your 'land of lets only talk about whats wrong with the US' possible
vision of this mailing list, but I'm sure recent developments in this
list will help to bring about such a vision.

> It's also awful that other things in parts of the world where

Indeed, it is.  At least in the US, though, the things that will get you
tossed in jail are pretty well established, documented, and supported by
the majority.  All one need to is not steal, assault, kill, or deal
drugs.  

And as far as influence, as an American my vote obviously was able to
directly influence the continuation of a murderous tyrannical regime.
But this begs the question, is there anything we truly do not have *any*
influence on?

I wasn't asking for the whole article to be reproduced violating
copyright, I would have liked to seen a link to the article to read more
about the study.  I would genuinely be interested to know how they
determined the incarceration rate in other not so open societies, like
communist ones, or tyranical dictator ones, or oppresive theocracies.
E.g. Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, North Korea, China, Cuba, Iraq, Iran, etc.
etc.

Excellent rendering, Damien. You know,  sometimes it's kind of a drag to
read Kant's original writings. You get the impression he should have had a
more self-confident editor to "enlighten" some of his obscure paragraphs. On
the other hand it's fascinating to experience the thoughts of a genius in an
age where publishing complex essays with months or years of delay seemed
to be the main medium to communicate.

Would be interesting to know the name of the newspaper you did that
rendering for.

USA is an interresting country. It is so full of contradictions. 
Contradictions make for good conflict and drama, and good discussion points.

Many of us, even us europeans find that USA is in many respects close to 
an ideal free society. But that does not mean we agree in everything, or 
even understand the way you choose to do things. So often the 
contradictions stands out to us.

But what many of you americans seem to not understand is that we 
non-americans most often *really* like USA despite it's many faults. But 
that will not stop us from mentioning the faults.

Think of us as a normal dysfunctional family. Constantly nagging, but 
couldn't dream of living without each other ;-)

That being said, I too found Damiens posting a bit "insensitive" in the 
light of the recent developments on the list.

I said that I find your denial of Mike being any problem at all on this list 
to be some variety of unobersant, willing refusing to see or being in denial. 
That is a perfectly reasonable remark that is not in the least an ad hominem. 
I am frankly utterly perplexed how you can hold the position you apparently 
do on this matter.  I don't see how it can be held honestly by someone of 
your intelligence.    I have experienced you in the past when people got hurt 
on this list copping the same attitude.  It is a pattern of yours.  I find it 
objectionable.   

Now that I have spoon fed something so simple to you can we get on with what 
we are supposedly here for?  Or do you wish to waste more time?

Because I have done nothing to deserve it.  Mike has.   There is no 
inconsistency.

Actually you can. Suppose replicators grow exponentially from a small
seed, producing an exponential amount of weaponry (A0 exp(lambda t)). As
soon as they are detected (at some spread threshold AT) caches of "blue
goo" devices (of whatever nature) come active and start enforcing the
accord, which takes time T2. If we for simplicity say that it takes an
equal amount of blue goo to deal with an amount of replicators, the
caches need only be large enough (B) so that in between detection and
arrival the replicators have not become too many: A0 exp(lambda
Tdetect+T2) = B where Tdetect = log(Adetect/A0)/lambda, i.e. B= Adetect
exp(lambda T2). If T2 and Adetect are small (many widely dispersed
caches, good monitoring) B can be made fairly small too, even without 
assuming replicating blue goo. 

If you want replicators, then you better make them citizens of your
polity. (Only veterans who have replicated for the defense of the Dyson
can vote? ;-)

That depends on cultural factors. In the general case where no such 
factors can be assumed, only game theory rules and the best strategy is 
some form of deterrence. But if you have reason to trust them 
reasonably, then the strategies change. That is really what the Accord 
is about: a decision of sharing the solar system rather than have some 
kind of free-for-all land rush. The fact that it was agreed on sends a 
strong signal to the other sides and internally about what is considered 
acceptable.

Yes. They are quite vulnerable. But why have the US not done a coup 
against the Amish?

Extropes -

Our new list moderators are Robert Bradbury, David McFadzaen, Amara Graps, 
Spike, Barbara Lamar and hopefully Brett Paatsch.  Brett is on vacation at 
this time and I hope he will join.

Max and the board are working on the new list rules and I will post them as 
soon as possible.

I'd like to thank Hal Finney for his efforts in moderating the list during 
the interim time when E.Shaun went back to school until now.  Hal really 
helped out in a crunch.

A quick Google finds,

http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0818/p02s01-usju.html

And here's the report with the 5.6 million figure,

http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/press/piusp01pr.htm

http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/piusp01.htm

Oddly enough, while it has all the data from the body of the CSM article, it
doesn't appear to have anything to say about US incarceration rates compared
to the rest of the world.

Google suggests that a common citation for statistics on world incarceration
rates is the Home Office's World Prison Population List,

http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs2/r188.pdf

In which the USA takes the top spot.

Twenty-five years ago my parents gave me a boxed set of 
The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, and a copy of a book 
titled "The Inklings." I don't remember much about the 
latter, since it made very hard reading for a six-year 
old. IIRC, that book also discusses the fantasist E.R. 
Eddison. I'm not sure if it's the same title as above.

Not in the least an ad hominem, not even a tinny tiny bit? Be honest with
yourself Samantha, suppose a few days ago I had said you were dishonest,
tremendously uncaring and I hope you encounter a swarm of carnivorous

If the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics is true, then in
some parallel universe you did make such an intemperate remark and
Samantha is drilling holes in custard tarts and boiling them in
cointreau in order to pacify the Rock Goose that's taken over one of
your brains, before the list moderator adds another node to the
flebsqux.

In some parallel universe I felt it was important to point that out.

Thanks Robert,

I agree with your assessment on the outset.  Your experience is extensive 
and your judgement sound.  Extropians seek to create a better world and 
your pragmatic advice is likely the best approach at this point in time. 
With a broad audience, starting from a common thread and then working 
outward by measured steps is logical.

On the other hand, how would you approach this topic when speaking to a 
group of people already in agreement that life extension is good, yet they 
are still not totally sure as to why living forever may be important?

As founder of the Immortality Institute, which hopes to be at the leading 
edge on this type of issue, I appreciate your help.

Yup, no more quibbling about it: the republicans are now the party of 
big government, big deficits, endless war, and religion for the masses. 
Libertarians need not apply. It's all laid bare in the Weekly Standard 
from necon godfather Irving Kristol:

<<The steady decline in our democratic culture, sinking to new levels of 
vulgarity, does unite neocons with traditional conservatives--though not 
with those libertarian conservatives who are conservative in economics 
but unmindful of the culture. The upshot is a quite unexpected alliance 
between neocons, who include a fair proportion of secular intellectuals, 
and religious traditionalists. They are united on issues concerning the 
quality of education, the relations of church and state, the regulation 
of pornography, and the like, all of which they regard as proper 
candidates for the government's attention.>>

http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/003/000tzmlw.asp

Comments on this manifesto are no doubt numerous, one can begin here:

http://www.antiwar.com/justin/j081803.html

Personally, I've always found Fascism to be fasionable, what with those 
black uniforms, lightening-bolt SS badges, emphasis on leather and 
little riding crops, etc. I've looked for neckties printed with tiny, 
almost subliminal swasticas; I figured these would convey a sense of 
power and expertise. And who can discount the coolness factor of a 
little ultraviolence? Check the latest Adbusters for cool Fascismo suits 
and sunglasses.

Seriously, libertarianism was always a cute theory, but it's time to 
face the inevitable...

A Black Hole Life Preserver

Authors: J. Richard Gott (Princeton University), Deborah L. Freedman
(Harvard University)
Comments: 6 pages, 1 postscript figure; submitted for publication to Phys.
Rev. D

      Since no one lives forever, all a life preserver can really do is
      prolong life for longer than would have otherwise been the case.
      With this rather limited definition in mind we explore in this
      paper whether in principle you can take a life preserver with you
      to protect you (for a while at least) against the tidal forces
      encountered on a trip inside a black hole.

John,
       That is the blind side of Samantha, etal.  I have had two leading 
members of the hierarchy address me on the subject of Mike Lorry's departure.  In 
both cases I commented on the chortling and personal comments made this list 
after he was gone.  One member attempted to draw an equivalency between 
comments made about a man that could not respond and comments made while he was here. 
 The other claimed no comments had been made.  Unbelievable.  Those comments 
exposed a one sided-ness I haven't seen in years.
       There have been two people on this list that have demonstrated to me 
they are even handed.  The first is Hal (I don't know his last name) and the 
other is Lee Corbin.
       All others have show a one sided blindness and in some cases a 
partisanship.

I don't see why that is odd, it's the *US* department of Justice, not
the World Department of justice.  They put the information together, its
up to others to compare it.  Which is exactly what CS Monitor and the
'home office' does, or at least superficially did.  Interestingly...

Interesting that on page 4, at the bottom, it says 

"No information on; Iraq, Afghanastan, Bhutan, Laos, East Timor, and
North Korea"

And at the end of the paper

"The list has a number of weaknesses.  Its lacks information on 17
independent countries"

So, in other words, the US has the highest prison population in the
world, not counting the notoriously worst countries in the world, which
wont bother telling anyone what their prison population is.  Not
surprisingly, this is not mentioned once in the CS Monitor article.

In doing some googling trying to find info on where some of the
countries that were listed came from, for example vietnam, I came across
this

http://www.hrw.org/reports/pdfs/G/GENERAL/GENERAL293N.PDF

"But the fact remained that violations of political and civil rights,
for the most part, were most severe in the countries where domestic NGOs
were not allowed to operate: China, Vietnam, Burma, Bhutan, Brunei and
North Korea. Elsewhere, there were areas which were also effectively
closed to domestic and international human rights investigators,
including East Timor and parts of Irian Jaya, Tibet, and Khmer
Rouge-held zones of Cambodia."

So where did the prison population figure for Vietnam come from, did
they just ask the "Peoples Democratic Republic of Vietnam" for a figure,
and were provided the figure of 77 in 100,000!  But who cares about
accuracy, as long as it makes the US look bad, right?

Of China, it says 

"Wu Shishen, an editor in the domestic news department of Xinhua was
sentenced to life in prison for selling a Hongkong reporter an advance
copy of a speech by Party Secretary Jiang Zemin."

"The Chinese government continued to arrest, detain and torture peaceful
critics and to interfere with freedom of expression, association,
assembly and religion. Releases of dissidents were carefully timed for
political impact, as exemplified by the release days before the Olympic
decision in September of writer and editor Wei Jingsheng after over
fourteen years of solitary confinement."

Etc. etc.  The stories go on and on, for vietnam, laos, Burma...

One wonders where they got the figures for Chinese imprisonment as well.

Well, first one has to acknowledge that "living forever" may not
*the* most important thing.  Particularly if it turns out we cannot
get out of, or shift, the laws of this universe and protons & neutrons
do indeed decay.  Then all bets are off.

So one seeks a life perhaps of "relative values".  I would say that
one might consider three possible motivations:

a) Reproduction.  This is the one most species terrestrial or alien
are probably programmed with.  It is essential for a non-directed
evolution and complexification of the universe (see (c)).

b) Fun.  This gets into Eliezer's "Fun Theory".  How do you maximize
the amount of fun you can have in life for however long you are alive?
[For me this seems to require that I reinvent myself from time to time.]

c) Complexification.  This is in line with the Extropy Institute's
principles and the desirability of defeating entroy to the greatest
degree that one can.  It is perhaps an "artistic" creation (or expression)
of advanced technological civilizations.  Conscious (directed) evolution
may be able to trump natural (undirected) evolution [e.g. (a)].

I don't know about others, but if I knew the Universe were going to
ultimately trump me -- I'd be placing a very high emphasis on (b) and
(c) just to be able to say "neener, neener, neener" to the Universe.

The reason that life extension is good is that it would seem
to provide for greater opportunities for (a/b/c) [with some limits
perhaps on (a)].

Others might provide additional interesting perspectives -- I would
doubt that my list is complete.  For example, "curiosity" might be
added to the list.  I know that things that motivate me include
what the 4 probes heading for Mars will discover?, what will Cassini
discover?, what *really* are the defects that cause aging?, whether
we will really one day construct a space elevator?, whether we can
construct an inside-out MBrain that finally figures out the "meaning
of life" as it hurls itself into a Black Hole?, etc.  Or one could
simplify things, e.g. Why would one *not* want learn to play every
musical instrument?  Why would one *not* want to master every known
sport? etc.

I'll close with citing the very first quote (by Heinlein) from my
quote collection [1].

Robert

It's hardly a minority on this list- in fact, I'd be willing to wager that
everyone on this list agrees with those sentiments.

Making an argument and playing devil's advocate are perfectly legitimate.
I've been arguing in favor of fascism in many of my Poli Sci classes, just
to provoke fights with other students.  My professors know that I'm just a
minarchist liberal, though, who is playing a game with my fellow students to
try to make them realize the contradictions of their own positions.

We can debate forever about whether or not the wars fought in Indochina were
ours to fight, whether they were winnable, etc, ect- it's a dead horse
folks- STOP BEATING IT!  I thought the Extropy list was about the future,
not the past...

Alright.  I'm going to start constantly posting messages stating that the
sky is blue and the grass is green.

Alright.  Damien posted a message reporting on how many people are
incarcerated in the US.  This is a major concern for many people here and
abroad.  Why does America have a higher crime rate than the rest of the
industrialized world?  What can we do about it?  How much of this "crime" is
victimless in nature (such as drug posession)?  How many people are falsely
imprisoned?  How many of the rich and powerful manage to get away with
crimes and plea bargains while the same offense would land your typical
young black man or native American in prison for years?

I'm from South Dakota, which has the highest rate of incarceration in the
country, thanks to the judicial policies put in place and the prison system
built by our former Attorney General and four-term Governor Bill Janklow,
now serving in congress.  Last week, our esteemed congressman, who has a
long history of speeding tickets and accidents, sped through a stop sign in
his '95 DeVille- and killed a motorcyclist.  He's had 10 speeding tickets
and been in several accidents in the last ten years- he should have had his
liscense revoked.  The area of the accident was blocked off for a mile in
every direction, and Janklow, although reported unconscious after the
accident, was not admitted to a hospital, but taken back to his home by his
wife and put under protection by the authorities.  In all likelyhood, rather
than going to prison for this occurence, he'll plea bargain his way into a
relatively small fine.

Another instance- drug posession.  I have, in the past, used marijuana.
Many of my friends have used it and posessed it as well- and many of them
have ended up in jail or prison because of it.  The funny thing is, all of
those who have gone to jail or prison were from lower-class and
working-class backgrounds, while the children of attorneys, doctors,
businessmen, and politicians never seem to be bothered by authorities, no
matter how much they posess or use...

There's definitely some hypocrisy in this system.

Or be falsely accused and unable to afford a decent attorney.  Or posess
some harmless drugs.  Or, in my home city, not be caught congregating
publicly in groups of eight or more after 10:00 at night, caught passing a
checkpoint more than twice after 10:00, or caught on a police camera going
through a red light (just like a certain congressman)...

China's incarcerated population is somewhere between 25 Million and 30
Million- higher than the entire population of Iraq, imprisoned without due
process, often for dubious reasons.  Yet, while we invaded Iraq, we instead
support trade deregulation with China and hand them our industrial sector on
a silver platter.  More hypocrisy?

Please define your terms.  What the heck is "corporatism"?  What precisely is 
the difference between selling one's labor/skills/knowledge to a 
non-corporate vs. corporate customer/buyer?

Doesn't reality itself give "economic pressure" in that on most places on 
earth food and other necessities, much less satisfaction of wants doesn't 
drop out of the sky?  If I want that which is not present for no effort then 
I must engage in efforts to procure it.  If it is a reasonably complex need 
then it probably will pay to specialize.   If enough people want certain 
things then economies of scale may be had by running larger companies.  Is it 
automatically "non-consensual violence" if I must either pay some others or 
some company for something  or work for them if they are the primary source 
of that something?    I am really unclear on what you do and do not include 
under "economic pressure".

What valuable resources?  Valuable to whom if Nike wasn't present?  How 
valuable?  Burma has a great number of reasons its economy suck that have 
nothing to do with Nike.

In part.  You will get no argument from me that some of the policies of 
WTO/IMF cause increased poverty and instability.   However, I don't think the 
formula is a simple as the above and I certainly don't think that having Nike 
go away from Burma would help their situation one whit.

What property is that?  The factories are not their property.  Off of their

However, I don't notice very concrete proposals or thought on what "nice"

Selling some system of throught that brings psychological comfort will not 
neccessarily address many real problems.   Doing the equivalent of triage and 
teaching  a little that is useful is of some help.  But it does not take a 
missionary to do that nor need it be sacrificial.  Starting a business or 
opening branches in such a country is one non-sacrificial way of improving 
conditions.

If Adidas wants more dedicated workers or to take the workers already trained 
by Nike, then Adidas will pay more.   In practice this is how real business 
works.

Do you seriously think there is that large a market for utterly untrained 
human labor?  Do you believe that trained labor will not increase in value 
and be competed for?

Sounds like his sentiments boil down to:

1) Don't be a jerk, you're not that cool.
2) It's the journey, not the destination.
3) If all your friends jumped off the bridge, would you?
4) Even the Mona Lisa is falling apart.
5) Move the hell out of your parent's basement.
6) Arrogant pretense makes you sound retarded.

All good advice!

Impressive! It makes sense, and it feels both modern and relevant. 

It is interesting to see how he links the psychology of enlightenment to
the sociology of enlightenment - we cannot easily become enlightened
alone, we need others to overcome learned helplessness and get the
exhilarating autocatalysis of active questioning and building.

A very good point, something Fukuyama and the others should consider.

Formulated like that, it sounds a lot like "Dear teenagers". Maybe that 
is the deep fear about posthumanity: that it is going to be a teenage 
humanity rather than an adult humanity. Of course, the innocence of 
childhood humanity is somewhat overrated.

Truly.

But, "posthumanity" is in an extremely infant stage, and yet it consists
of the (mostly) adult minds of its constituents.  Maybe taken as a
movement, group or meme complex, it will, in fact, have the clarity
and humility to carefully consider such perceptions, and take them as
indicative of its own motivations and how they effect its PR face.  :-)

Some Japanese scientists want a 30 yr program to develop a robot with
the capabilities of a 5 yr old.  Slashdot discussion link below
includes link to article.

Sounds better than the Apollo project, which it obviously is meant te

Nicq, do you know for sure that this is the case?  It

Correct me if I am wrong, but I was under the impression that you were
an Australian citizen.  Is that correct?  If so, what direct influence,
exactly, do you have over the justice system in the US?  Additionally,
seeing as Australia contributed troops to the Iraqi Liberation military
venture, and you are (maybe) an Australian citizen, wouldn't it be
reasonable to argue that you had much more of a direct influence over
your countries involvement in the ousting of a murderous tyrant than you
do over an entirely different countries incarceration policies?  

In fact, by your own ethical criteria, does that not mean that you are
required to focus your efforts on the things you have influence over,
that being events in your country or events your country is specifically
involved in, such as invading other countries?  Or is it just that you
readily abandon your ethical foundations at any chance to publicize
anything negative about the US?  

Note:  Ignore all of this is you are indeed an American citizen.

I do realize that, but what you who mention only faults don't realize is
that you are indistinguishable from the chomskyite
everything-the-US-has-done-is-absolutely-evil kind of person.  When you
hear nothing but criticisms, what evidence do we have to suggest that
you have anything to say other than criticisms?

Regardless, and just to clear this up, I think many of the complaints
waged against the US govt are valid.  I would most accurately be
considered a minarchist libertarian, so I obviously oppose liberal
paternalism and socialism, and conservative lack of respect for
individual freedoms.  Additionally, I oppose the war on drugs and
incarceration perpetrators of victimless crimes.  The occurrence and
presence of these things really bothers me, but so do the atrocities
that occur in other countries, which are often far far worse.  

As far as free countries go, I consider most of the post-industrialized
west close enough to not really be worth troubling myself over the
differences while other egregious differences are present in the
industrial and pre-industrial countries of the world.  If I could live
anywhere I wanted, Id probably first pick Hong Kong (but would end up
moving soon as the Chinese took control again) second would be a close
runner up between the US and Australia.  

> That being said, I too found Damiens posting a bit

I didn't find it 'insensitive' per se, just wanted to put perspective on
it relative to other world atrocities.  I found it very interesting that
the article was judging the incarceration rates of populations of the
world.  Interesting, I thought, I wonder how they got accurate data from
notoriously closed and oppressive societies?  If they were saying the US
has the highest incarceration rate in the world, surely they actually
looked at the rest of the world.  

Upon further investigation, that was obviously not the case.  As noted,
Iraq, Afghanistan, Burma, East Timor, North Korea etc. for a total of 17
countries had NO data present to compare.  Yet the CS Monitor did not
find this noteworthy enough to even mention in their article.  It should
have read "US has highest incarceration rate of the countries who would
tell us theirs, the notoriously worse countries incarceration rates are
unknown"

Jeff Davis, as I have all ready elaborated, said the 'good guys' won in
Vietnam.  Note those good guys, for the past 30 years, have been one of
the most oppressive regimes in the world, and killed more people in the
six months following the US abandonment of Indochina then died in the
entire war, and subsequently turned Cambodia and Laos into hell holes as
well.  

I am sure there are others who have yet to go on record.  Samantha, who
won in Vietnam, the good guys or the bad guys?

Those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it.  There is NOTHING
more anti-extropic than a communist government!  As a person who favors
extropian ideals, I would think other extropians should be concerned
about the single most murderous and anti-extropic form of government to
have ever existed on the planet.  The Extropy list is about promoting
extropian ideals, not specifically talking only about the future.  If
you do not like what I have to say, put me in a kill file, or complain
to the moderators, but do not pretend that events in the past have no
extropic relevance to the future.  In case you missed it, this murderous
expansionistic regime tried to take over the world over the past 50
years.  There is no extropianism in forced collectivization, starvation,
and poor ignorant peasant farming communities.  And currently a good
portion of the world still lives under these entirely unextropic
wretched conditions.

It is ridiculous, but it was said.  I was shocked of course, since when
did a succession from a parent country require the moral sanction from
that country?  Seems absurd to me, especially when parent country was a
murderous despotic tyrannical regime. But it was said.  Perhaps the
Extropy list subscribers are not as clear minded and rational as you
thought they were.

>Alright.  I'm going to start constantly posting messages 
>stating that the sky is blue and the grass is green.

If you consider the threat of communism equal in concern as people
arguing the sky is not blue, more power to you.  Personally, since
communism has killed 170 million people this century, and, as far as I
know, the 'Sky is not blue' cultists have yet to kill, maim, collective,
or oppress *any* its not high on my list of concerns.

Does it have a higher rate?  Or are its incarceration rates higher?
Perhaps we just catch more of the bad guys?  Perhaps certain stupid
aspects of American culture tend to re-enforce crime waves.  This issues
is very complex, though I would be the first to succeed that among the
free, open, west societies the US does have the highest incarceration
rates.  I just question the incarceration rate claims from notoriously
oppressive and closed societies, many of the worst of which we have no
data for whatsoever.

[snip various valid complaints about the US]

How many people are executed for speaking out about their government,
rot in solitary confinement for decades, buried in mass graves for being
of a ethnic minority or of an ethnicity simply not in power.  Condemned
to lives of hellish poverty because the wealthy free post industrialized
west could care less.  I agree with all your criticisms of the US, I
just consider them hardly noteworthy compared to the atrocities of the
rest of the world.  The vast majority of the world would DIE to have to
deal with our worst problems, in fact, many people in the world DIE just
trying to have the CHANCE to deal with our worst problems.  Do you think
the high incarceration rate of the US is a deterrence for Cuban refugees
setting out in shoddy make shift rafts or crowding 100's of people into
storage containers to try to smuggle themselves in?  

And furthermore, as is often ignored, our laws are firmly established
and on the books, arbitrary incarcerations, the norm in despotic
countries and communist ones, are few and far between in the US.  As I
said, don't steal, assault, murder, or deal drugs, and you have very
little chance of ending up in Jail in the US.

You can complain about the injustices in the US all you want, and I will
agree with most every one of them.  However, comparing those to the
Injustices of people in North Korea or Vietnam, you are not going to get
me very excited about it until those people have our troubles to worry
about.

As a motorcyclist myself, I say that sucks.  As an American, I further
say that sucks.  As an Extropian, I also say that sucks.  I don't see
any disagreement here, these are all egregious injustices.  But I ask
you, which sucks more, 300,000 people in mass graves, or a former

I certainly agree!  But while people are getting their eyes gouged out,
and tongues cut off, and children raped, and babies heads smashed
against trees, beheaded, starved, tortured, etc. intentionally by
governments, I will focus my concerns on those governments.  Once their
worse problems are going to jail for smoking pot, then Ill be the
champion of the decriminalize drug use movement.

That's true.  But replacing it with a progressive western market based

As Frederick Douglas said, one must do the most they can at that moment.
What do you think would happen if the US sanctioned China?  Would China
say 'ah, sure, we'll reform, we've been wanting to anyway'  

The only way China will change is through a great deal of time, or if
the Entire post industrialized west, the wealthiest and most militarily
powerful part of the world, which also happens to BE THE MOST FREE!
Stand united against the oppressive, tyrannical, and murderous regimes
of the world.  Given the recent events in Iraq, it seems unlikely that
the free, powerful, wealthy, post industrialized west as a whole will
ever give a shit about murderous oppressive regimes and the billions who
suffer under them.  By the time they do give a shit, it may be too late
to make a difference.

You mean 30 years for the Japanese to put a robot in the Whitehouse?

But seriously, 5 year old human equivalency in what? Go through it feature
by feature, ie do a profile of human vs. robot. Robots far surpass humans
now in some ways. Do the Japanese want to dumb down the machines to a 5
year level? No. So exactly how do they want to increase the level of the
robot in that profile?

Direct? None in the sense of voting or standing for office in that great
nation. But as a writer published regularly for more than 30 years in the
USA, and as a poster to this list where the majority of readers are
Americans, I do exert some small influence. It is possible that more
Americans read my words, conveyed in print and electronically, than read
those of anyone else on this list. I dare say very few Iraqi dictators,
communist commissars, terrorist bombers or anyone not in Poland, Germany,
France, Italy and anywhere where English is the common tongue would be
influenced by anything I have to say.

...Jeff Davis, as I have all ready elaborated, said the 'good guys' won
in Vietnam...

Michael Dickey



Michael, make sure you understood what (I think) Jeff was
getting at.  The west contained communism long enough for
it to collapse under its own weight.  In that sense, the
good guys did win in Vietnam, setting the stage for the
eventual victory of WW3, which petered out around 1990.

Sure there are some communist nations left, no-count
basket cases like Cuba and North Korea, and of course
the die-hard biggie China, but its only a matter of 
time before these collapse too.  Few who have access 
to information on this planet still think Marx was right.
China cannot keep the internet out forever.  

In the end, every life lost in Vietnam on both sides
demonstrated to the communists that they would 
have to fight for every step to world dominion.  This 
they could not do, but the damage they did in the 
attempt was appalling.  In the end, one could
argue the good guys did eventually win WW3, with
the battle of Vietnam being one stop along the way.

Had not the U.S. demonstrated to the world that we
would fight in Korea and Vietnam, most nations would 
not have attempted to resist the red tide.  Our 
entire planet today would be cold, hungry, gray,
driving Trabis or worse, choking in smog, listless,
everyone EQUALLY poor and dispirited, infrastructure
crumbling and no one caring since there would be no 
profit in actually doing anything, going thru our 
phony workdays like zombies, waiting for the 4 oclock
whistle so we could go home and drown our sorrows
in cheap vodka.  It would be a planet of Albania.

Indeed, the good guys did win in Vietnam, eventually.

Isn't it odd, that before anyone can even expel his breath in the foreplay
of making up his mind to ask the US for help, the US is already *there* with
some schwarzeneggered guys?

Must be some kind of a helper's syndrome, no?

Spike, I appreciate your comments, buts Jeff's statements were pretty
clear.  From an older post (I havent the time to dig out the specific
post reference)

1st, Jeff elaborates on what he feels is the correct interpreation of
the Vietnamese government.

And for Jeff's specific comments

For Jeff's actual statement -

BxYCN5VzJY speaking in reference to the winners of the vietnam war.

In point of fact we are all aware of a great number of crimes that should not 
be crimes that add to the incarceration rate.  Most of us are also aware that 
some of the automatic mandatory sentencing practices are unfair and also 
increase the active incarceration number.   It is least likely that we are 
better at catching scoundrels.  Our conviction rate and percentage of solved 
crimes lags that of other countries with a lower incarceration rate.    I 
hope we get a LOT better at know what is and isn't real crime and preventing 
it.

I guess this is a summertime news item? New stats for the
U.S. prison population get published.

I mentions this because it was a large news item almost exactly one
year ago. I read all of those articles from last year.
(Politics _do_ make a difference for where I want to live )

The Economist published an article about the U.S. prison stats
in the August 8, 2002 edition.

-------------------------------------------------
Justice in America

Too many convicts
Aug 8th 2002
 From The Economist print edition


TODAY is a special day for 1,600 American men and women: they are
being released from a state or federal prison. Tomorrow will be a
special day for another 1,600 people. As will be the day after that.
Some 600,000 inmates will leave prison this year-more than the
population of Washington, DC. After quadrupling its imprisonment
rate in just 30 years-America now has 700 people in every 100,000
under lock and key, five times the proportion in Britain, the
toughest sentencer in Western Europe-the world's most aggressive
jailer must now confront the iron law of imprisonment: that those
who go in almost always come out.

The result is a society that, statistically at least, is beginning
to look a little like early Australia. Nearly one in eight American
men has been convicted of a felony-and thus, in many states, has
been automatically deprived of numerous rights, including the right
to vote. One in 20 men has been to jail. [...]

There was news at this link too:
August 25, 2002
http://www.cnn.com/2002/LAW/08/25/jail.stats/

"U.S. correctional population  at record high" ...

At the time, one yr ago,I gathered some information on this topic
on the Web and found  some sources that said that U.S. has more
people in prison (per capita)  than Russia,  Belarus,  South Africa,
Thailand, England, China, France,  Italy, Japan and more.

I was really bothered at the time, but I cannot confirm the above.
Unfortunately I'm in a time crunch for other things, I don't  have
time now to retrace my steps.

Isn't it odd that we seem to have right at hand really intelligent people who 
get all defensive if someone points out anything that really is a problem in 
their country?   Shouldn't we more extropicly attempt to address real 
problems instead of getting defensive?  This sort of defensiveness is 
generally a sign of immaturity.

The Atom Project would be a humanoid robot with the physical, intellectual 
and emotional capacity of a 5-year-old.  It would have decision making 
attributes and self-induced motor activity.

I'm glad that they are choosing a 5 year old rather than a 2 year old. A 5 
year old has outgrown the terrible 2 stage of perturbation and erratic 
exploration, and spends his time learning and thinking in developing 
character. 5 year old want to identify with adults and are like little men 
and women. While any age has its ups and downs, I think it is an excellent 
age for the Atom Project.

I'm curious what standards and methods - whose/what AI designs - they will 
try to implement in developing intelligence/emotion.

Inspired by the above notice board at an Indian restaurant, I feel that
a similar notice board at the entrance to Extropians could be designed.

A database of prohibitions could be constructed, with the facility for
members to vote on their favorite prohibitions.

Votes for no prohibitions at all would be ignored, of course.

Footnotes could be added to explain the more technical prohibitions, as
'ad hominem' still seems to cause some comprehension problems.

As problems arise, we can add more prohibitions to the list.
An unlimited future of prohibitions opens before us! ;)

It sounds very much like previous Japanese projects of this kind. They
have traditionally had these huge industrial-academic projects, once run
by the famed MITI. The payoff has on the other hand been less impressive
given the amount of people and money (anybody remember the fifth
generation computer language project?). 


Real innovation cannot be planned, but you can try to set up a climate 
that benefits innovation.

Interesting, it looks like the SIRTF telescope *is* going
to be used to conduct a fairly large IR survey [1].  Not
quite as big as what WIRE was going to do but still probably
large enough to pick up MBrains at various temperatures.

The 24, 70 and 160 micron wavebands correspond to temperatures
of 121K, 41K and 18K respectively.  Certainly quite interesting
temperatures for moderately advanced MBrains (human body temperature
is 311K).

So let us all hope for a little bit of serendipity.

Robert

Is this a definitional claim or an empirical claim. When the American's
planned to go to the Moon by the end of the decade was this not a case of
"real innovation"? From what you say I guess not. Why not?

Hee hee... Yes, but you can't make a million copies of them for less than

5 year old minds have fearless curiosity, something that older children
into adolescents and adulthood tend to leave behind, misplace, or exhaust. 
The 5 year old also plays with words and makes up silly words and stories,
which could have entertainment value.

I think it is a little more subtle than this and depends on ones
definition of "innovation".  Does building a "bigger" rocket
require "innovation"?  Does building a more "reliable" rocket
require "innovation"?  Does designing a space suit require
"innovation"?  I would tend to lean in the direction that the
application of principles one already knows should not be
considered "innovation".  It simply requires the application
of sufficient resources to apply what one already knows.
The creation of something "new" would be classified as "invention"
The creation of something that one knows "in theory" but not
"in practice" should probably be "innovation".  Examples I might
consider would be the development of the laser, the formation
of a Bose-Einstein condensate, or the production of really
long buckytubes.

I suspect there is a range from the application of known principles to
really creative inventions and that innovation falls someplace in between.
Spike might be one of the better persons to comment since he is a "real"
engineer.  The questions, as posed, create raise interesting points
as to what would be "application", "innovation" and "invention" in
areas such as software development or AI development.

Perhaps, but it is hard to maintain that lack of awareness at this time
unless you are very very young.

If I understand this statement properly, I have toyed with this idea.
It would be the ability to leave behind and make available to others
all of ones knowledge, experiences and history separately from ones spirit,
consciousness or free will.  It is kind of like bequeathing "What you
are" but not "Who you are".  I would tend to view this as a reasonably
extropic action, particularly if the technology were available to allow
anyone to pick up the information base.  But I think that requires individuals
in an uploaded form and we don't know yet if that is really possible.

Actually, no. It isn't odd. Rather than simply complaining, maybe it would
be nice if other countries that receive help from us actually offered some
form of constructive criticism rather than just hating us.

That being said, I do have to admit that our foreign policy leaves a lot to
be desired. The problem is with the people. We've been brught into a cycle
of dependency where the masses have realized that they can vote themselves
money from their own treasury. People are more interested in what the
politicians promise to "give" them rather than the soundness of their
decision making abilities. Most voters are completely ignorant of our
foreign policy and how it affects the rest of the world. The decision makers
simply do what they feel they need to do to get re-elected so ultimately
there are bad decisions made only to increase the pocketbooks of the voters
accompanied by "feel good" actions that show the voters that we "care"

The only way I see to solve this is to have the majority of the people
properly educated. Unfortunately, most people seem to be satisifed with
their current (mis)understanding of the way the world works. They see no
benefit in increasing their mental abilities. And to make matters worse, the
less educated they are, the more likely they are to reproduce offspring and
raise them in the same way.

Popular culture only helps to intensify this. We have created a society
where people are proud to be a redneck. A society where Jerry Springer could
become successful.

Hopefully this is only a phase. I see that at some point, drastic changes
will have to be made in the way this country works. It will most likely hurt
many people. Maybe through that, the mentality of people in this country
will change much like the depression created a generation of people that
were extremely frugal with money. Maybe people will begiin to care about
their education and open their minds.

In the meantime, I would like to do something about it. I have some vague
ideas on how to do a small part at least. What I want to do is start a small
afterschool class in Natural science. Something kids can do besides sports
that would challenge their minds and ideas. It would be set up similar to
the way youth soccer is set up, with no government funding or intervention.
I am a long way from doing this as I am just now getting an idea of how it
would even work, but this is how I plan to help.

As Smoochie the Rhino said, "I can't change the world, but I can make a dent
in it."

Someone wrote me off list and asked about the death of the Inquiring
Skeptics of Upper New York. (I spent about four years as vice-president
of that group and one as president.)

I thought part of the lessons learned would be worth sharing.

I've given a lot of thought as to why skeptics groups die off and such
and might some day put something up on my website about it. What's been
holding me back is that I don't wish to waste time with a "he said/ she
said/ and they were wrong and I was right" sort of thing that would just
be stupid and childish. Much of what happened still makes the people
involved emotional. (including me.)

However there are lessons that I think anyone involved with a local
group should consider.

Part of the problem(s) I think are:

    1) Unlike many organization (such as boy scout troops, bowling
leagues, the Elks, etc.) nobody is quite sure what a skeptics group
should do. For instance, one issue was the desire of some to explore
haunted houses and do a firewalk while others felt this was totally
innapropriate to the extent that it should actively be prevented by any
means necessary.

    2) Since skeptics groups tend to be run by a few people who form the
group to do what it wants, and since ultimately people tend to get
burned out doing the same thing, and people who approach the group
hesitantly and then find out that it doesn't do the sorts of activities
they would like it to, tends to leave, the result is a small group of
people who drive the organization along to act along narrow lines and
then ultimately these people get burned out before they are replaced.
    Therefore if the focus of the group's activities is too narrow,
people tend to get burned out before they can be replaced.

    3) Since skeptics, as a group, pride themselves on their ability to
think logically, they sometimes tend to be a bit sure of themselves.
After all, compared to most people, they are more likely to be factually
correct in their conclusions than many people one meets. On the other
hand, some skeptics become overconfident in their thinking abilities and
feel they are "correct" when others disagree with them, when often the
issues under discussion do not fall within the "correct/ incorrect"
paradigm. (i.e. "Is it appropriate for a skeptics group newsletter to
list a planned bowling outing for its members?" This is strictly a
hypothetical example, but I think many of the people who are willing to
volunteer time to make a skeptics group work also assume there is a
correct answer to this question, when of course it is not a yes or no
question. OTOH, the fact is that ultimately one has to make a yes or no
decision if such an issue is raised or suggested within a skeptics
group.) 
    Therefore, many but not all of the sorts of persons who volunteer to
help run a skeptics group show rigid thought patterns.

    4) These problems, in my opinion, were not helped by the fact that
for much of the group's history, we did not hold regular officers
meetings and instead tried to manage things by using an e-mail list.
E-mail is good for some things. Face to face communication is required
for others, especially complex fuzzy issues (i.e. to repeat the above
hypothetical bowling issue, it could easily turn into a yes/ no --
right/wrong flamewar by e-mail.)

    Another problem with not holding officers' meetings is it makes it
more difficult to recruit people to get involved in helping the group
run. i.e. if you have officers meetings, it is relatively easy to say to
someone who appears quite interested in the group, "How would you like
to come to an officers' meeting? There's no obligation to do anything,
but you'll get a chance to see how things are run." Often you can get
such people to do something small that way and thus set the groundwork
for many things.  

    I think one reason there were not officers meetings is that many
people assumed from the beginning that all who wished to join a skeptics
group would agree with their logic and vision, and thus there would be
little to discuss.

    Enough said. I reserve the right to drop out of any discussions on
this issue, simply because I don't want to open too many cans of worms
and so on. Sometimes it's best to let wounded dogs fester (or something
like that.) and this can be an emotional issue for me.

Activists pounce on nanotech scare. Being an activist means always having to
find something new to complain about...A recent 72-page report from
Greenpeace warns of the dangers of nanotechnology. An introduction from
Greenpeace's Doug Parr sets the tone for the piece, claiming that
nanotechnology-created "materials should be considered hazardous until shown
otherwise." Huh? Abandoning technologies that can protect the environment is
hardly the most logical stance for a pro-environment group to take. The U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, for instance, is already looking into and
funding the development of nanomaterials that can reduce harmful emissions,
aid recycling and filter gaseous pollutants...Greenpeace goes on to invoke
the tired rhetoric of class struggle, arguing: "Is the future of
nanotechnology then a plaything of the already-rich? Will the much talked
about 'digital divide' be built upon, exacerbating the inequities present in
current society through a 'nano-divide?'" In reality, all new
inventions--from air conditioning to clothes dryers to
automobiles--initially are the playthings of the wealthy. Then, as
production costs fall over time and economies of scale take over, those
products become available to more and more people. Still, Greenpeace seems
almost reasonable when compared to organizations such as the Canadian
environmentalists at the ETC Group, which published a communique that calls
for an "immediate moratorium on commercial production of new nanomaterials."

UNT, TI team on nanotechnology. Researchers at Texas Instruments and the

The new chips would be about 500 atoms across, said Phillip Matz, a TI
researcher working on the project. By comparison, a human hair is about
100,000 atoms across. The goal is smaller, more powerful chips. About half
the money is a National Science Foundation grant. The other half comes from
contributed services from TI and UNT. Most of the grant money will go to

Roboblood...Back in June 1996, Chris Phoenix, a former student of nano-guru
Eric Drexler's at Stanford University, posted a question on the Foresight
Institute message boards: "What about replacing blood with a complex robot?"
This innocent inquiry led to a lengthy collaboration with Robert Freitas
Jr., author of Nanomedicine, the first book-length technical discussion of
the medical application of nanotechnology and nanorobotics. (Volume II is
coming out in hardcover next month.) The result was a 100-page paper in 2002
on what the duo termed a "vasculoid"-essentially a nanomachine that would
replace the human blood supply. Instead of having red and white blood cells
floating through your veins, some 500 trillion (it's not often I get to type

nanobots would fill the entire vasculature of the body, some lining the
blood vessels and some swarming through them. (USA news 8/8/03)

At the beginning of his paper (p. 2) Dr. Gubrud says: "Indeed, it is
plausible that a nation which gained a sufficient lead in molecular
nanotechnology would at some point be in a position to simply disarm any
potential competitors." (August 1,03) http://216.26.163.62/2003/lev8_01.html
(Part 2) On 8/7 I spoke on "The Bert Lee [Radio] Show" in Arizona about the
expected ability of nanotechnology, developed in China since 1986, along
with at least six other post-nuclear fields, to destroy the Western means of
nuclear retaliation and thus to eliminate Mutual Assured Destruction, that
is, to disarm the West. (World Tribune 8/15/03)

Small matter, big impact. In this little town, in the basement of a house at
the end of a dirt road, sits a large laser that will make really tiny
bubbles, that might just be the next big thing. The house, laser and patent
on the process to make the bubbles all belong to Mark LeClair, founder of
NanoSpire. His company is one of a few in Maine playing in the world of
nanotechnology, a field that involves building or manipulating matter on the
scale of anything smaller than one micron - one-millionth of a meter, the
thickness of a typical bacteria. LeClair, a Scarborough native, has theories
on how to work with matter at the atomic level that have drawn interest from
some big names in the world of super-small technology. If LeClair's theories
hold - and he'll be testing them out using the laser over the next few
weeks - he'll have created a platform technology, a device with which new
technologies can be created and traditional industries can be advanced.

Big questions for tiny particles. From clear sunscreen to self-cleaning
cars, nanotechnology seeps into daily life and starts to raise tough ethical
issues. In the days when the Beach Boys ruled the radio and bikinis were the
rave, beaches were populated by noses: big and slathered white with zinc
oxide to avoid sunburn. Today the big white noses are gone. Instead of
relying on thick goo, many manufacturers now use titanium-dioxide particles
so small the sunscreen looks invisible but still reflects away ultraviolet
light. Chalk it up to an early use of nanotechnology, where "big" is defined
as 1/1000th the width of a human hair and the possibilities look potentially
limitless. Yet even as nanotech goes commercial, environmental groups worry
about its effect on health and safety. Long term, analysts say, society will
have to confront a broad set of ethical and social issues as it deals with
humanity's growing ability to manipulate atoms, molecules, and biology's
genetic code. The real crunch may come if researchers manage to merge
nanotechnology and biotechnology. (csmonitor 8/15/03)

Researcher attempts to become a cyborg. Imagine a world where people make
lunch plans via telepathy, acquire genius-level mathematical skills in an
instant, and learn to golf by downloading the neural impulses of Tiger
Woods. According to Kevin Warwick, professor of cybernetics and researcher
at England's University of Reading, all of these things might be possible.
And that's why the 47-year-old researcher has chosen to become a cyborg:
part human, part machine. (The News Sentinel/Fortwayne 8/15/03)

3-D Printing's Great Leap Forward. Rapid prototyping is a concept straight
out of Star Trek. Feed an RP machine a 3-D blueprint of an object and it
will carve a model of that object out of metal, paper, plastic or starch,
just like the replicator aboard the USS Enterprise. Now, these RP devices,
also known as 3-D printers, are about to get even better. Engineers are
giving the machines the ability to build moving parts, not just block
models.

Scientists tout the potentials of nanoscience. Some scientists think the
world will be fundamentally altered within 20 years. To get to that new
world, they'll need powerful microscopes. Nanoscience - the study of the
infinitesimally tiny - incorporates chemistry, biology, physics, materials
science, engineering, ecology and national security. And it's poised to
change the way we conduct our lives. From preventing stains from sinking
into our pants to making sports equipment lighter and more durable to giving
our computers more oomph, nanoscience is already out there...And the federal
government will spend close to a billion dollars during fiscal year 2004 to
ensure its progress. (Aberdeen News 8/18/03)

Techsploitation: Nanophobia. Ever since I read Greg Bear's weird-ass book
Blood Music back in the early 1990s, I've been pretty excited about
nanotechnology. Bear imagines a future in which nanobots take over the world
by rebuilding humans on a molecular level and turning them into raw
materials for their bizarre, mystical new society, the noosphere...Luddite
pundit Bill McKibben seems to have bought into Bear's vision. In April he
published a nonfiction book called Enough, in which he argues (among other
things) that nanotechnology threatens us with dissolution as a species...ETC

Breakthrough: Nanotechnology. The Fantastic Use of Atoms, One at a Time. Ah,
the last doesn't seem so extraordinary. But they're all built on the new
nanotechnology that is using microscopic inventions to interact with the
human body, to transmit information in and out, to give it strength or
comfort. Ian Hunter and Lynette Jones, scientists at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, who are also husband and wife, work in
nanotechnology. Nano is Greek for dwarf. This "molecular manufacturing"
involves the manipulation of individual atoms. Small is not only sometimes
better, it is extraordinary. Hunter runs the Bioinstrumentation Lab at MIT
which builds scientific instruments and nanorobots required to generate
objects that are even smaller. (The American Reporter 8/21/03)

Giant helium molecules, containing only two atoms but assuming a size as
large as a small virus, have been created by researchers at the École
Normale Supérieure in Paris. At sizes ranging from 10 to 100 nanometers,
these helium molecules are the largest diatomic (two-atom) molecules ever
created by a factor of 5 (and comparable to the size of viruses, which vary
in length from 5-300 nm). What's more, helium is an inert gas that does not
normally form molecules. (Physics News Update 8/20/03)

=======

Leave it to Robin Williams to come up with the perfect plan... what we need now
is for our UN Ambassador to stand up and repeat this message. 

Robin Williams' plan...(Hard to argue with this logic): 

I see a lot of people yelling for peace but I have not heard of a plan for
peace. So, here's one plan: 

1) The US will apologize to the world for our "interference" in their affairs,
past &present. We will promise never to "interfere" again. 

2) We will withdraw our troops from all over the world, starting with Germany,
South Korea and the Philippines. They don't want us there. We would station
troops at our borders. No more sneaking through holes in the fence. 

3) All illegal aliens have 90 days to get their affairs together and leave.
We'll give them a free trip home. After 90 days the remainder will be gathered
up and deported immediately, regardless of who or where they are. France would
welcome them. 

4) All future visitors will be thoroughly checked and limited to 90-day visits
unless given a special permit. No one from a terrorist nation would be allowed
in. If you don't like it there, change it yourself, don't hide here. Asylum
would not ever be available to anyone. We don't need any more cab drivers. 

5) No "students" over age 21. The older ones are the bombers. If they don't
attend classes, they get an "F" and it's back home, baby. 

6) The US will make a strong effort to become self sufficient energywise. This
will include developing non polluting sources of energy but will require a
temporary drilling of oil in the Alaskan wilderness. The caribou will have to
cope for a while. 

7) Offer Saudi Arabia and other oil producing countries $10 a barrel for their
oil. If they don't like it, we go someplace else. 

8) If there is a famine or other natural catastrophe in the world, we will not
"interfere". They can pray to Allah or whomever, for seeds, rain, cement or
whatever they need. Besides, most of what we give them gets "lost" or is taken
by their armies. The people who need it most get very little, anyway. 

9) Ship the UN Headquarters to an island some place. We don't need the spies and
fair weather friends here. Besides, it would make a good homeless shelter or
lockup for illegal aliens. 

9b) Use the buildings as replacement for the twin towers. 

10) All Americans must go to charm and beauty school. That way, no one can call
us "Ugly Americans" any longer. 

Now, ain't that a winner of a plan. 

"The Statue of Liberty is no longer saying 'Give me your poor, your tired, your
huddled masses. She's got a baseball bat and she's yelling, "You want a piece of
me?"

Hubba Hubba Honda Honda 

By Brad Edmonds 

[Posted August 21, 2003] 

That title is from a Car and Driver article of the mid-1980s, about the results
of the editors' putting two engines into a little Honda CRX. The Hubbas are even
more fitting today, as Honda keeps building the best cars in the world, forcing
other automakers to work hard to keep up. Some are having more success than
others. How does Honda do it? 

In Honda's case, as with any corporation, much of what the consumer sees comes
from the top. Soichiro Honda, the founder, was a daring, hard-headed, friendly
entrepreneur and engineer. He thwarted the good-ol'-boy Japanese business
environment of the mid-20th century by working around government discouragement
and restrictions, ignoring social and business pressure, and making his little
machines. He began by manufacturing piston rings, moved to motorcycle engines,
then motorcycles, and then he took on the auto industry. 

Since he wasn't one of the good ol' boy corporations, he had to accept less
promising college and trade school graduates as employees. Soichiro attended
engineering school, but didn't bother taking tests or attending classes he
didn't want; he was already too busy attending to his new business. He told his
new employees he had faith in them, and if they didn't like the way he did
business, they could leave. This was exceptionaltraditionally, Japanese
employers viewed new hires as lifetime vassals. 

Soichiro put customers first, and he adapted quickly to customer input. He
introduced his motorcycles to the American market in 1959. The bikes quickly
developed a reputation for unreliabilitythey couldn't handle the hard paces
through which Americans put them. So Mr. Honda immediately improved his engines,
and by 1963 Honda was the best-selling motorcycle in the US. In 1960 he decided
to build cars, and within 5 years of that decision a Honda won the Mexican Grand
Prix. 

The company continues to damn the torpedoes. When the American government went
(more) protectionist against Japanese imports in the 1980s, Honda, along with
other foreign manufacturers, built plants in the US. Today, a Honda Accord's
"domestic content" for us is 97%, which makes the Accord less of an import than
the Ford F-150. 

The Marysville, Ohio plant that builds Accords is worth mentioning. Considered
the most efficient auto plant in the world, it is where the Honda people bring
young Japanese managers to show them how a plant should work. (Note that the
Marysville workers decided to go nonunion when the plant opened.)  Today, the
Japanese continue to outstrip American automakers in auto quality, performance,
and manufacturing efficiency. 

The big three American automakers habitually beg the government for protection,
and the Japanese just put on softer gloves and keep beating us up. Are Japanese
government subsidies a competitive advantage?  The Americans get subsidies, too.
As to whether the Japanese restrict American cars entering Japan:  Heck, suppose
the Japanese allowed no American cars at all on their shores. Should that make
us build inferior vehicles? 

Here's part of the answer:  An American, Edwards Deming, developed approaches to
measuring and improving quality and efficiency in manufacturing in the 1950s.
Deming was ignored by American manufacturers at the time, but the Japanese
embraced him and his ideas, and later named their national manufacturing prize
for him. From following Deming's advice, Japanese cars are the best in the world
for the money (my high-strung S2000, street legal but built to be raced in
amateur meets, needs its first full tune-up at 105,000 miles). 

Many Japanese cars are now better than even German cars. Just as one example,
the rear-drive Infiniti G35 is a four-door sedan that competes directly with the
BMW 5 series in interior space, amenities, and performance. The G35 can be had
fully equipped for about $33,000, the engine is good for 260 hp and 260 lb-ft of
torque, and the interior is the same size as the BMW's. The BMW 530i develops
225 hp and 214 lb-ft while it weighs 100 pounds more than the Infiniti, and the
BMW starts at $8,000 more. 

I would assume everything Honda manufactures (ATVs, engines for riding lawn
mowers, generators, motorcycles, outboard motors, personal watercraft, pumps,
scooters, and snow blowers) lives up to the same quality, reliability,
affordability, and style standards as their cars. Honda continues its record of
successful adaptation to external constraints and demands by leading the
industry in developing government-mandated alternative fuel vehicles. Their
Insight hatchback is the only consumer gas/electric hybrid vehicle you've
probably already seen on the street (the one with the rear-wheel skirts). 

Americans invented many of the biggest ideasHenry Ford made automobiles
affordable; Deming showed the way to continuing quality and efficiency
improvements; our marketers probably did much more than the Japanese to develop
the customer responsiveness the Japanese have mastered; and we invented SUVs,
pickups, and minivans. Engineering isn't the only issue, either:  Style matters
to car buyers, so some of the more expensive Japanese brands have hired American
designers in California to make their cars look so good inside and out. 

We invent great ideas, and the JapaneseHonda in particularadopt them and put
them to work. We should have the advantage in the auto industry, but our
automakers want profits without sweat. Hey, it's easier to get the government to
hurt the competition. One example:  In the 1980s, we passed a $2000 tariff on
Japanese minivans. Our automakers immediately raised our prices by $2000. It's
too bad for us that our corporations would rather stiff us than learn from their
own great ideas. Until they change their habits, get yourself a Honda.

I think Robert makes an useful distinction that fits with the meaning I 
was thinking (but not writing) when I posted. It is quite possible to 
construct something that you know can be constructed given a centralized 
project - perhaps the archetypal example would be the Soviet nuclear and 
hydrogen bombs. Implementing something that is likely possible and well 
defined as a goal, such as a space program, that is also rather amenable 
to planning. 

The real problem comes with planning true innovations in the sense of
devices or applications that have not been thought of before. By
definition they are unplannable, although they might be supported
afterwards. There were no plans for coming up with transistors, personal
computers or lasers. They were just the result of people playing around
with physics or building something which they wanted, and later useful
applications were found/invented. 

In the context of this thread, I would say Japan has been very 
successful in creating a climate for the more structured kinds of 
innovation - innovating towards a goal known to be feasible or even done 
before, as well as innovating within the context of a pre-existing 
technology. But Japan does not per capita/investment seem to get the 
same amount of fundamental innovations as the US. My guess is that the 
consistent aim at producing results have limited the amount of creative 
play needed to come up with the true innovations.

As for AI, I don't think it belongs to the category of known goals or 
improvements of current methods. We still need some radical new 
thinking, and that is hard to plan.

Tell us more.

If you want a Superhuman AI, the first question would be, Which human is
used for comparison? One with an IQ of 50? A 1-2 year old human? And which
of the many "capabilities" are we talking about? Handicapped people do not
have certain capabilities.

Not to mention, certain 5 year olds can do things
(like
learn how to use computers) that certain "normal" 50
year olds are incapable of.

Once again, almost total silence falls upon the list. So far today I've
received instead, 24 virus-laden spam mails. I wonder if that might have
something to do with it. Or has everyone stalked off in sympathy with the

Locus is the monthly insiders' zine about science fiction. In the August
issue, they have interviews with sf novelists Charlie Stross (a former
poster to the extropians) and Alastair Reynolds:

http://www.locusmag.com/2003/Issue08/Stross.html

http://www.locusmag.com/2003/Issue08/Reynolds.html

Both explain that they are not especially exercised by the Singularity
notion. This in itself seems a considerable breakthrough in memetic
penetration: there are many other candidate topics they don't bother saying
they're not interested much in.

About this time last year I was yacking on about wanting to go back to uni
to do a degree of in molecular biology, biotechnology, or anything else that
will put me on the technical track toward being involved (eventually) in
manipulation of dna and increasing control of the eukaryotic cell, and
eventually in the vicinity of molecular nanotech (as it begins to appear,
assuming that it does.

Last year I decided not to do it (mainly for reasons of finances &
overcommitment in other areas of my life), but this year I'm really going to
start. I'm contrained by work to distance delivery, and to doing it part
time.

I was considering another undergrad science degree, but then ran across
this. I'd like the opinion of knowledgable people from the field; what do
you think of this degree? Does it look like I could do serious work in the
biotech based on it, or is it more for becoming involved in
policy/management in related areas?

If people have alternative suggestions, I'd love to hear them. Bear in mind
I'm in Oz (in Adelaide), I work full time, I have a science degree (computer
science and some maths).

Many of us have seen those lists of nations
rated by various criteria: freedom, peacefulness,
charitable giving per capita, etc.  Many of the 
categories are subjective, so the results are 
actually a statement of the value system
of those who compile the ratings.

One of these lists recently posted had a category
which caught my attention: the consumption of
natural resources per capita.  The west, and
particularly the U.S. generally does poorly, 
greedy resource devourers that we are.  

Perhaps a better way to evaluate this is to add a 
category with positive points given for those 
nations which create unnatural resources.  For
instance, sand is a natural resource, but from
it is created computer chips, clearly an unnatural 
resource.  Iron ore is a natural resource, but
from it is created cars, bulldozers, road graders,
office towers, all manner of wonderfully unnatural
resources.  Coal and oil are natural resources, but 
when they are burned, a new substance is created, CO2,
which is a vital resource from the point of view 
of plant life.

A ratio can be calculated: the amount of unnatural
resources created divided by the amount of natural 
resources consumed.  Calculate it per capita, total
as a nation, it really doesn't matter.  If viewed
in this manner, it becomes clear that those nations
which consume the fewest resources per capita produce
*practically nothing* in valuable unnatural resources.  
By this criterion, many if not most nations on this
planet score a big fat zero.  Japan, on the other
hand, would likely end up on the top, followed closely
by the U.S., Sweden, Germany, Australia, England,
Canada.  

What do you suppose the greens would say about
this view of life?  How do you suppose the average
green would score in creation of unnatural resources?

It might be deep contemplation Damien, but in my case it's
just plain fatigue after 6 days of interstate conferences and 
sorting  through the accumulated email aftermath. 

Russell Evermore was right, 6 days away from a net
connection can leave one feeling sort of disabled. Time for
even this small t technophile to invest in net enabled laptop.
I reckon I should be able to pick up a serviceable unit for
around Aus$1500. 

Interesting things biotech conferences. The AusBiotech 2003
one I just attended in Adelaide is Australia's equivalent to
Bio (in the US) but scaled. Emphasis is on networking,
and the business side of biotech, but nano is sneaking in.

In these "mainstream" industry conferences the assumptions
about 8 - 12 years to run drugs through clinical trials and
that IP regimes will not be changing radically or quickly seem
to be almost universally assumed. 

I wonder why there is such a wide difference between the 
rates of change expected by scientists and commercialisers
in forums like the one I just attended and the folks on this
list many of whom I also know are well informed about 
multiple areas of technology?

I think there are perhaps two reasons. First, the "mainstream"
although deeper in their areas of knowledge are conservative
in their public statements to others outside their areas of 
expertise (but these expectations of relatively slow change 
can and quite probably will if not challenged become self
fulfilling prophecies) and the second, is that, imo, the average 
extrope/transhumanist list frequenter is perhaps more
appreciative of the possible synergies between technologies
such as biotech, infotech (including AI) and nanotech, perhaps
because some are not working in particular knowledge silos as
specialists, yet on the other hand by not being in the specialist
silos many may also underestimate how hard it is to accelerate
the changes in the areas of law (IP, legislation, contractual deal
making) and politics. 

Expectations of the rate of change built into planning schemes
by scientists, government planners, venture capitalists etc
all go towards imposing something of an upper speed limit
as well as a lower speed limit. I think there is truth in the notion 
that it is difficult to hold off an idea whose time has come but
it also seems true that that idea or memeset can be substantially
held back as well at least for a time. 

Poor old Ben Franklin if I recall correctly mused about the 
possibility of preserving people (himself included presumably)
in pickle barrels. Now there was a bright guy. How easy it is
for time (centuries and generations to flit past) and for even the
brightest and sometimes most lively flames amongst us to be 
snuffed out. Poor Yorrick.

The conference did feature some real sexy stuff by a materials
physicist from the Max Planck institute in Stuttgart Germany
showing (his computer modelling) on how nanotubes should
be able to be used to load dna molecules and then transform 
them electrostatically. The nanotubes themselves are altered
by a charge in various places and the dna apparently just 
screws itself in.

Brett

Really depends what you want to do. There is a shortage of 
bioinformatics skills around that is unlikely to go away soon. 
Most bioinformaticists are currently life science degree holders
that have taught themselves to be IT savvy. Its far less common
to go the other way, but obviously not impossible if one has the
interest.

Distance education puts limits on the sort of labwork you could
do. 

But really imo the biggest factor is not a particular course (if your
willing to pay and the one you nominated is full fees) there will
not be a shortage of opportunities for you to learn. Its a case
of tailoring what outcome you want.

I know Alan Trouson (mentioned as involved in setting up the
course) and have contacts involved in post grad biotech course
setting up at Melbourne Uni and RMIT. I'm happy to give you
some pointers if you want offlist as the short answer to your 
question is "it depends".

Regards,
Brett

What you are describing is essentially an efficiency measure: how 
much stuff can one liter of oil or kilo of sand be turned into, how much 
useful work can be done with the total energy input to the society. 
Phrased that way it sounds both much greener than "creation of unnatural 
resources" ("MUHAHAHAH! Behold! I have created *unnatural* water, 
Igor!") and easier to get good statistics about. 

I think your main argument is essentially right. From an environmental
standpoint it is also rather obvious that resource efficiency is
something that you want to optimize beside ecological footprints (I hate 
that silly term) - even if nation X has a smallish footprint it would be 
better if it was more efficient in using it. Unfortunately I think the 
current green movement often gets trapped in hunting footprints rather 
than efficiency.

Cultural evolution, the postbiological universe and SETI

Abstract

The Biological Universe (Dick 1996) analysed the history of the
extraterrestrial life debate, documenting how scientists have assessed
the chances of life beyond Earth during the 20th century. Here I
propose another option that we may in fact live in a postbiological
universe, one that has evolved beyond flesh and blood intelligence to
artificial intelligence that is a product of cultural rather than
biological evolution. MacGowan & Ordway (1966), Davies (1995) and
Shostak (1998), among others, have broached the subject, but the
argument has not been given the attention it is due, nor has it been
carried to its logical conclusion. This paper argues for the necessity
of long-term thinking when contemplating the problem of intelligence in
the universe. It provides arguments for a postbiological universe,
based on the likely age and lifetimes of technological civilizations
and the overriding importance of cultural evolution as an element of
cosmic evolution. And it describes the general nature of a
postbiological universe and its implications for the search for
extraterrestrial intelligence.

It is a powered exoskeleton, supposedly marketed to the elderly.  Coming soon 
according to this article:

http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?
tmpl=story&u=/afp/20030821/tc_afp/japan_robot_technology_030821084042


Excerpts and my comments below:

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

TOKYO (AFP) - Japanese companies are preparing for the commercial launch of 
a "robot suit" that helps aged or physically disabled people walk, get up the 
stairs or seat themselves to relax without a chair. 
   

Trading house Mitsui and Co. and some 30 other Tokyo firms plan to set up a 
joint-venture in April or May next year to market the powered suit developed 
by Yoshiyuki Sankai, professor and engineer at Tsukuba University, officials 
said Thursday. 

.............



The powered suit, code-named HAL-3 (Hybrid Assistive Leg), consists of a 
computer and batteries in the backpack as well as four actuators attached 
around the knees and hip joints. 


The motor-powered devices guide movement of the legs as the computer 
calculates the user's next motion by detecting faint electric signals from 
the muscle, the professor said. 
>>>>>>>>>>>

But I wonder how much of this was funded by US medical research?


>>>>>>>>>

With the equipment, the user can walk at a speed of four kilometres (2.5 
miles) per hour with little physical exertion and avoid the jerky stop-go 
moves of ordinary robots. 


As a first step, the new venture plans to lease or sell 10 prototypes next 
year, targetting hospitals and nursing-care facilities at home and abroad, 
Sankai said. 

>>>>>>>>>

I want one!



>>>>>>>>>>>>>
A mid-term goal for the project is to sell some 100 suits a year at a price 
of one million yen (8,440 dollars). 
>>>>>>>>>


$8K?!  Gimme!


>>>>>>>>>>>

The weight of the system will be soon reduced from the current 17 kilogrammes 
(37 pounds) to some 10 kilogrammes, while the projecting part of the 
actuators will be halved to five centimetres (one and three quarter inches). 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>


Extremely transhuman idea....

Alex's original statements seem to be getting scant attention:

and that surprises me, because it's a remarkable thing to be saying.
First, what sort of scrutiny should we regard as presently unwanted?
Second, I disagree that "detente" is productive -- or at least, that
it is as productive as more aggressive (but well-informed) aproaches.

Surely I am not the only person here who finds it quite easy to take
more or less any intelligent person who claims on any non-religious
basis that aging is a good thing and demonstrate to them that their
view is inconsistent.  (<http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/sens/why.htm>
summarises my usual approach.) The problem we face is not one of logic:
the logic is trivially on our side.  The problem we have is one of
psychology: of people's terror of coming to terms with the idea of
non-inevitability of short lives.  There is, in my view, only one way
to change that sort of mindset (whether in relation to life extension
or anything else): trench warfare, i.e. refusal to let people change
the subject.  For that purpose, the more hot-heads the better, I say,
if (with our help) they marshal their facts and arguments well.

Aubrey, this is very catchy, cogent, and just plain smart.  I like your
step-by-step approach to getting the point across from suicide, to homocide
and finally to genocide.

First of all, I'm thrilled that you are on this list Dr. DeGray! The more
practicing researchers participate, the better.

By productive detente I mean: we do science, they do science, and nobody calls
anybody else 'kooks', at least not in public. By moving *any* legitimate
scientific study forward, even people who disagree with my goals contribute
to them. Just some more directly than others. Active cooperation is best
of course, but I'll take passive cooperation over active opposition any
day. Heck, even in the field of aging I suspect most people view it as 'just
an interesting puzzle' and don't concern themselves with the implications.

With regard to logic being on our side. I agree, but a PhD does not
automatically confer rationality in all facets of life. I've been trying all
my life to understand the knee-jerk "hubris" reaction people like us seem to
provoke, and still cannot understand it. It's almost as if the majority of the
world is somehow programmed to want to die. The only useful thing I've learned
from years of debates on this topic is to circumvent the issue by focusing
attention on more 'mundane' aspects of the research.

Furthermore, there is one anti life-extension argument that I cannot accept,
yet also cannot fully refute: overpopulation. The basic rebuttals are...

1. We need to get off the planet anyway. The problem with this rebuttal
is that it assumes the cost of launching payloads will go down far enough
and quickly enough to outpace the rate at which the population grows and
thereby allocates resources away from space colonization toward day-to-day
survival. This *may* happen, but we cannot assume that it *will*.

2. Anti-aging treatments could be conditional on the patient opting for
permanent birth control. This would cause a massive cultural backlash in
most of the world. It also assumes one or a few discrete treatments that
could be controlled in such a manner by one or a few entities. It also
assumes that these entities would have the political will to impose such
conditions. Finally, there would be nothing preventing people from reproducing
first and then undergoing rejuvenating treatments, and their children doing
likewise, and so on... thus reducing the effectiveness of the permanent birth
control requirement.

3. The earth's carrying capacity is unlimited. The problem with this rebuttal
is that it's untrue. Granted, the environmentalists may be exaggerating
the immediacy of the overpopulation threat because of their own political
agenda. However at some point, be it in the next 50 years or the next 500,
*something* is *going* to become a limiting factor-- be it habitable land,
fresh water, or utilizable energy. Life extension will result in this
bottleneck being approached faster.

4. By keeping our geniuses alive longer, more concentrated expertise can be
brought to bear on all problems including overpopulation. Not impossible, but
highly speculative... we really have no way to even estimate the likelihood of
the overpopulation problem being solved in any given time frame.


Again, I'm not presenting my own views here. I'm presenting opposing views I
cannot refute, and am seeking suggestions on.


PS: I understand in general principle why the argument of death being "good
for the next generation" doesn't hold up-- group selection is a very weak
evolutionary force. Does anybody know of a rigorous, quantitative paper
explaining exactly what the limitations are on how much group selection could
have influenced evolution?

His position is that the hawkish US foreign policy along with 
oligarchical political and economic rules since the turn of the century 
have been leading to continual degradation in the quality of living for 
actual Americans as well as contributing to terror, despotism and 
mayhem worldwide.  I take it for the most part these observations are 
undisputed.  Now two family members must work to support a family of 
four.  Then only 1. Then, you could pay for a piece of land capable of 
sustaining your own family within 7 years by working.  NOW you're lucky 
to be able to afford a house within 30 years and THEN can expect to 
still have to work to pay for food and water.

As for despotic regimes sponsored by the US, the list of them is 
readily available, but the big names that come to mind are the obvious 
ones from your list - the Taliban, the Ayatolah, Saddam, Pol Pot, etc.

That's not "everything the US has done is absolutely evil" BUT it sure 
has done a lot of bad stuff.

Simply recognizing this along with the good makes a "fair and balanced" 
judgement of the moral stature of the US as a nation.

Well, I for one absolutely love In-N-Out (despite their obvious 
anti-extropian offerings - like french fries).  Family owned and 
operated, good business, fair prices, pay people pretty well, allow 
advancement from within, etc.  They don't buy "near-slave" labor from 
other countries and, I'm told, are nice people.

But this is really a veiled "Love it or leave it" argument, isn't it?  
The implication is "The US is better than every other country on earth 
so stop complaining."

You're right, the most despotic regimes are not listed there but is 
that supposed to make us feel better that we Jail people at a higher 
rate than all the rest of the "civilized" world?

There seems to be a point in researcher's lives where they come to the
conclusion they can't make any difference.  Just from my casual observations
I think Raj Sohal may have gone through a transition like that sometime in
the last couple of years.

(Of course the way to answer this is to point out cryonics, but then
you have to point out reanimation strategies (e.g. Ralph's paper), then
you have to explan nanotech to "disbelievers" when Nobel prize winners
say "it can't be done", etc.   Its a *very* long conversation.)

How about "Lord, grant me the strength to accept the things I cannot
change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know
the difference".

The "common sense" wisdom is that you cannot evade death.  And they
have 2 very real things going for that side of the argument (a)
"You cannot evade your hazard function"; and (b) "The universe will
someday be a very dark and cold place".  You trump (a) via something
like "interstellar travel" and/or "uploading" (of course these tend
to be only slightly less accepted than lifespan extension) :-;.  Then
you trumb (b) with something like Dyson's arguments, or Multiverse
arguments but they are on swampy ground as well.

Yep in the back of everyone's mind (or at least the educated people)
Malthusian concepts will creep into the discussion.

Usually at this point one brings up nanotechnology and planetary dismantlement
and gets even more raised eyebrows.

Personal nanotech allows it (cheaply) as would "public" nanotech, e.g.
space elevators (there is a company in Seattle working on this, NASA
*is* funding the research).  You can also argue that if you live long
enough, and invest wisely early enough, then everyone ends up sufficiently
wealthy that they can use 30+ year old Soviet technology at $20 million a pop
to get off the planet.  You could also probably manage it quite cheaply
with a large mass driver, though you might need to be either frozen
or have a fair amount of "in" board nanotech to deal with the G-forces.

This is similar to the argument that Tom Kirkwood makes at the end of
his recent book.  You can reproduce, but only if you plan to end your
"immortal" life.

Populations in Europe *and* Japan *are* declining.  The U.S. I think
is barely above the replacement rate.  (No legislation required at
all -- simply the means to control reproduction and perhaps a desire
to pass on more of ones intellectual or economic capital to ones
offspring.)

Plenty of habitable land if you look at the density of New York City
or Tokyo.  We just have to think in 3D rather than 2D.  (I have
lived in NYC (both a typical brownstone as well as classical Manhattan
high rise), San Francisco area (both suburban house and city house)
and in Seattle "neighborhood"s (both condominium complex as well as
a tall thin house) -- all of these were relatively high density.
Humans *are* capable of adapting to high density environments.

Plenty of fresh water if you can afford to remove the salt from it.
Plenty of solar energy as well as plenty of radioactive energy to do
this.  (Do you realize how many *tons* of plutonium are currently
being stored?)  And that doesn't even begin to tap the power we could
harvest from solar power satellites.  And don't get me started on the
the significant reductions in power per capita that advanced biotechnology
and nanotechnology will enable.

> Life extension will result in this bottleneck being approached faster.

So what?  More people means more bright and creative people means the
singularity happens that much sooner.  (Only argument against this that
I know of is one that suggests that scientists become less productive after
they get married.)

Phooey.  We *have* the technology to get people off the planet.  If it were
being mass produced it would be *much* cheaper.  We know there are probably
cheaper alternatives.  We do have the energy resources.  Long-lived people
*will* have the wealth.

> Again, I'm not presenting my own views here. I'm presenting opposing views I

The problem with all of my comments above is that they are based on a decade
or more of nearly continuous self-education in a variety of fields.  Most
scientists will not have the depth of experience in a variety of fields
to be able to evaluate many of the claims I make above.  I believe that Eric
Drexler entered MIT about the same time I entered Harvard (circa 1974).

  [Aside, Somewhere in the Multiverse there is a Robert Bradbury who went to MIT
  instead of Harvard, met Eric Drexler, and became close friends with him...
  That would be a very interesting universe to live in.]

Anyway, Nanosystems, which was essentially Eric's PhD thesis, was published in
1992.  That means it took 18 years for someone who is probably one of the
brightest persons on the planet to accumulate enough knowledge to devise
a robust picture of nanotechnology.  A "average" scientist is *not* going to
easily grok anything one says about nanotech given most of the crappy summaries
that the press produce.  Scientists would really have to get *into* it -- that
takes time that most people do not have.  So you can't even use many of the
"reasonable" arguments above.

Looks like Steve Austad has 4 pages on group selection in "Why We Age" (58-62).
I would start there.  The Gavrilov's might also discuss it but I can't lay
my hands on my that book right now.

I think you are doing a good job anticipating the responses -- I don't
know however if it is possible to have a "reasoned" debate due to knowledge
scale differences.

Depends on what you mean by the term "support".  If
one is satisfied with the standard of living they

to make it happen.  We expect more now, so it should
come as no surprise that it costs more.  Earning a
subsistence level survival is cheaper and easier now
than ever before, and getting more so all the time.
One needn't even work: standing on a city streetcorner

Today you can earn enough to support yourself in

Look around you, Robbie.  Farmland is as cheap as,
well, dirt.  It costs practically nothing.  If all
you need to do is eat, like the "then" people, it
is so simple even the hippies managed it, after
a fashion.  

But there is little need for all that effort.  Most
farmers will let poor people glean the fields after
a harvest today, and there is *plenty* of discarded
clothing available for nothing or nearly so, clothing
much more comfortable, durable, practical and even 
fashionable than anything the "then" people could 
have managed.

There is plenty of land in the U.S. which cannot
be farmed *profitably* for various reasons, but
which is still perfectly farmable for food production
on a family scale, as demonstrated by the Amish.
This land can be had for a few hundred dollars an
acre, all of it you want.  Granted, it might not
be near any cities or actual roads, but it has
water and good soil, land that the "then" people
would have gone to war to secure.

If you don't care for any of the luxuries that we
have today, the cars, the electronics, the internet, 
the medical care, the stuff that the "then" people
didn't have, earning a living has become so simple
as to be trivial today.  spike

No, it isn't in the least sufficient.  My dad managed to support a family of 7 
in the 60s on about $9K/yr.  We weren't well off but we ate and had a house 
and such.  I know of no way to support a family of 4 on the approximately 14K 
today that minimum salary would bring.  Certainly not anywhere around here 
(bay area) and nowhere I know of anywhere in the country.  Certainly not in 
my home town either.    If you know differently then please prove it.  It 
would be nice to know money could be made to go this far.  It would greatly 
shorten the time I can work only on what I most care about regardless of what 
I can get paid for.

Minimum wage is below subsistence levels for families with children.

> come as no surprise that it costs more.

Actually, we expect less.  For instance, it seems perfectly reasonable 
for people to pay 200-600k for a CONDO in West LA/Santa Monica.

Now, if you're a decent earner (90k-150k) that'll take you 
approximately 30-years to pay for assuming you spend less than half 
your earning on your home.

If you're a "not-quite-so-decent" earner and are in the "average" 
category, 40-60k, you can't afford to buy a condo in West LA/Santa 
Monica - EVER.  You can get the same kind of thing in Pasadena or 
something.

Now, compare to just 40 years ago - my Grandfather bought his VERY NICE 
house in Arcadia (kind of an upscale Pasadena at the time and now) for 
20k (which was A LOT).  He was a "decent" earner for the time and paid 
for his house inside of 10 years.

When he sold his house, he pocketed something like (I don't know the 
exact number) 500k (1990) but obviously couldn't afford to re-buy the 
same house with the money.  (He's happily retired in La Jolla just in 
case you were worried about him... 88 years old and still kicking!  A 
closet transhumanist, he's blind and wants to have his eyes replaced 
with artificial eyes, but can't because the FDA doesn't approve of the 
surgery...)

20 seconds on Google will show this to be false.

Well it depends on what you do.

Ebay - Real Estate, 40 acres (remember, 40 acres and a mule) with a 
house - farmable land.

Generally well over 150k.  I don't know about you, but earning and 
KEEPING 150k nowadays is a big deal "for most people".

> Look around you, Robbie.  Farmland is as cheap as,
> well, dirt.  It costs practically nothing.

More than 1000/acre generally.  You need about 40 acres to live on, 
that's 40,000.  I happen to have it, but then I make good money.  
"MOST" people are negative in the cash arena.

CF - http://ideas.repec.org/p/wop/jopovw/220.html

Mostly due to inflation, rising BASIC costs of real estate, 
consolidation of income at the top 5% of earners, and of course the 
personal factors - lack of education, foolish spending, etc.

"Most People" even though empirically are moving backwards in wealth 
creation still believe that they're saving money.  (If you put 2000 
into an IRA this year, you think you're saving money, but if you've 
incurred more than 2000 in debt, you're losing money generally by 9% or 
more.  "Most People" incurred more than 2000 in debt/negative finance 
last year.)

Where'd you pull this one out of?  My parents were "hippies" that lived 
on a commune for a short time.  Few of those succeeded.  Very, Very few 
of them made it for more than 10 years.  I doubt you could find more 
than 100 examples of "American Kibutz's".

I don't know what makes you think this, but if you go onto the Dole 
Pineapple farm in Hawaii, they'll shoot you.  And if you go into the 
Del Monte Tomato farms, they'll have you arrested.  "MOST" farmland 
that's producing now is owned and operated by major corporations that 
don't appreciate "gleaning".  I think you're thinking of the Biblical 
Law, but that was circa 4000 BC - TIMES HAVE CHANGED.

The Amish farm profitably.

Again, 20 seconds on google.

That's a few THOUSAND dollars/acre for farmable land.  Even Arizona 
desert land is up around 500/acre.  And you CAN'T farm that.

The "then" people did go to war to secure it.  But ALL of the land with 
WATER in it now has restrictions on the use of that water.  If you buy 
land with a stream running through it that currently doesn't have a 
farm, it's nearly impossible to get a variance to let you start farming 
it since, with near certainty, someone else downstream is already using 
that water.

I don't know about you, but I pay $40/month for my home DSL and you can 
buy a computer now for less than 200, plus another $100 or so for  
monthly.

On the other hand, food bills for a family of four are around 
$2000/month.  By FAR the biggest expenses are Rent/Mortgage and Food.

Speaking of health care - THEN there was a local doctor who would do 
house visits for $1 OR LESS.  NOW you can't get a doctor to do house 
visits and it costs upwards of $100/visit (even the copay IF you have 
insurance is 10-20).  For those of you who can count, thats 2000x 
inflation.  You might argue that the medical care is better - which it 
is if you happen to be among the wealthies 5% of americans - the rest 
of us are dying at alarming rates from some of the same diseases and 
injuries that were killing THEM THEN with much worse new ones 
including, by far, the largest killers - Accidental Death, Malignant 
Neoplasms and Heart Disease.  CF  - http://webapp.cdc.gov

And while the life expectancy has raised pretty significantly ON 
AVERAGE, just about nobody lives past 120, and most people still die in 
their 70s.

Consider:

http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4822a1.htm

Which states that great progress has been made in health since the turn 
of the century BUT it does it's survey based on coal-mining.  Now, coal 
mining while dangerous, is no longer as large an industry as it was in 
1900 and this study, while an interesting study of coal-mining related 
deaths, is just baloney WITH THAT HEADLINE.   The truth is, as it was 
then, MOST PEOPLE DIE of accidental deaths, followed by whatever the 
current flavor of disease is (polio, cancer, etc.)

And the Extropic point in all of this is that the bottom line is that 
the death rate continues to be 100%.  Now you can make yourself feel 
better about having better food (like In-N-Out) and better water 
(probably false) but making a case for an overall improvement in the 
quality and length of life is pretty hard when you actually look at the 
data.

NOT THAT things can't be potentially better, just that they are MERELY 
potentially better.

In any case, happy Saturday MORNING!

Best,

Robbie Lindauer

I think a lot of this is due to how people who already own houses are
able to keep people who do not own houses from building or placing
some sort of cheap residence (such as a mobile home) on property
nearby (which is the only way you can get utilities at a reasonable
price--live near other people).  Once again, our laws and regulations
model animal societies, in that they are created by and used by those
who currently have power and status in order to preserve their power
and status. We call it NIMBY politics, but it is really about those
who "have,"  keeping down those who "do not have."  Enforcement of
scarcity enriches those who "have," and they do the enforcing through
voting.

Well, I guess there is one way that living is cheaper today: our
agricultural technologies and market distribution systems are so
efficient that we can buy enough beans and rice to survive for
pennies. But where do you cook it?  NIMBY politics  precludes this
lifestyle through legal means.

Yep. THat is one thing I have noticed about some of the people on this

I really think that life is better than it was earlier this century,
mainly because of several important vaccines--polio, etc., and also
because of incremental engineering improvements and efficiencies that
have given us a huge and efficient infrastructure that brings goods to
market like never before.  When it comes to engineering, everything
seems to just keep getting better and better and better. At least in
the consumer marketplace.  But forget about organizations like
NASA--that is a joke....

Also, in combination with that, we have an accumulation of so many
middle class people which makes it very easy for products to be
developed and sold. This promise of potential profit from such a vast
market of consumers offers an irresistible attraction for capital
investment.  And we benefit from that in so many ways....

So in some ways, the extropian/freemarketeerism philosophy is correct,
in that it builds a better future--IN THE LONG RUN. But what about the
fact that in the long run, we are all dead? (or at least that is how
it has worked till now....)

 What I personally care about is making enough money to make sure that
I am cryopreserved in the best manner possible, and also while I am in
the dewar, that the USA is able to maintain a STABLE culture and
nation in the meantime.  I could go on, but I need to work on my
bathroom plumbing. WHy is it that women get so upset when the plumbing
acts up...some kind of evolutionary thing? How does this relate to
hunter gatherer lifestyles?....anyway....

I notice that a flaw which clouds a lot of Extropic thinking is the
sociological equivalent of repeatedly designing perpetual motion machines.

For example we obviously have the theoretical capability to send humans
to Mars right now, and probably have had that capability since the 60's
(some aerospace buff please correct me if I'm off on this). Why has this not
happened already? Is it because "people" are "stupid"?

Perhaps, but it's not a useful way of framing the question. If your machine
doesn't work due to minute impurities in the materials, turbulent fluid
behavior, moisture due to condensation, or frictional heat... you could by the
same reasoning say that it's the machine's own fault because it's stupid. But
that won't get you any closer to a functional design.

I propose that there's a difference between being
stubborn/irrational/superstitious/short-sighted... and recognizing that
stubbornness/irrationality/superstitions/short-sightedness are real phenomena
that must be factored in when trying to bring about any changes that involve
the participation of humans. What I'd love to see some social-science people
(shut up conservatrolls, economics is a social science too) attempt a rigorous
analysis of human resistance to change. Extrotopia just ain't gonna happen if
there's ideas but no money or favorable policy climate in which to implement
them... if there's a destination but no optimal path to get there from here.

During a discussion, I believe between Spike and Randy,
comments being made included:

I believe the 40 acres number may be using "typical" agricultural
practices.  You might want to consider reading "Square Foot Gardening"
by Mel Bartholomew (1981) (seems to also be a PBS series on the topic).

I would like to see someone cite some Google references on the actual
land area required to produce 2500 calories per day.  (There seems
to be a lot of hand waving going on here).

I also do not believe that Natasha thinks most list members are "rich".
However there are some list members who can at least "afford" to spend
a couple of hours a day online -- but this may not be too different
from spending a couple of hours a day watching television (which seems
to be feasible for many people in the U.S.).

I think one thing missing in the discussion is what happens in various
regional areas as we concentrate the houses in ever-expanding (cheaper?)
suburbs while concentrating the jobs in core centers.  An ever increasing
fraction of time and money must go into transporting oneself from the
far flung suburbs to the core centers.  I knew people that would spend
one or two hours (each way) commuting from the North Bay to the South
Bay.  Seattle is rapidly becoming similar.

Alex,
       Ponder this for awhile.  There has been a Saudi Royal Prince invited 
to ride our space shuttle and to go into space as an astronaut but you haven't 
been invited and it matters not how interested in space you are nor does it 
matter how much research you have done.
       You also said, "(shut up conservatrolls, economics is a social science

case please don't make that kind of comment.  I'll bet I study more economics 
than most do.  Almost every night I read myself to sleep with economics but 
occasionally with political science.

BTW, please do not even think of apologizing for that comment above.  You

Spike, I agree with you in theory. After all, I raised my daughter on
approximately $6000 per year. BUT! I started out already owning a tract of
land (in a remote location where no building codes were enforced), a pickup
truck, and some power tools. And I was able to earn my pittance at the rate
of $85 - $175 per hour (depending on the sort of work I was doing). So I had
plenty of time left over to scrounge free building materials, plan and
construct buildings, plan and install gardens, and so forth.

I challenge you, Spike -- I'm not kidding, this is an honest-to-dog
challenge -- next time you can take six months off from work, go out and try
living at the lower end of the economic scale. Here are the rules:

1. You cannot rely on your higher education or professional experience.
2. You have to leave your vehicle(s), credit cards, nice clothing, etc. at
home.
3. You cannot take money from your bank account via ATM, online or through
any other means. The only way you're allowed to get money is to earn it or
obtain it through begging. (by the way, I've been told by people who know
from first-hand experience that for the short term, you can do better by
begging than by getting a minimum wage job -- if you can position yourself
at a good intersection that isn't already controlled by others; you'll
probably find that the best locations are already staked out, and if you try
to set yourself up there, you'll be run off by the existing "owners"; but
you might be able to cut a deal with them where you'll pay them a certain
amount of rent each day for the privilege of using their intersection.)
4. You have to live like this for a minimum of six months.

Since almost everyone has a little money and a few possessions, you can take
the following with you when you leave home:

-- $1000 in cash (this is an *extremely* generous start-up allowance,
roughly equivalent to a month's take home pay for a minimum wage earner).
I'm setting it this high so you can make some purchases to get yourself even
with where a mimum wage earner might be at any given time (e.g. you could
purchase cookware, dishes, a few changes of clothing, toothbrush, safety
razors, materials to make a sign for begging (you can find cardboard or
pieces of plywood lying around, but you'll probably have to buy markers or
paint); if you choose to try to grow some food you could buy a few gardening
tools. But it takes approximately two years to get a "raw" piece of land
into condition to give you a high yield per square foot, and you'll have to
figure out some way to get compostable material to your garden plot (if you
can somehow find a garden plot -- most land owners won't let you use their
land, even if it's just sitting there vacant, because they want to be able
to maintain it by running a mower over it). A couple hundred bucks will go a
long way at garage sales or thrift shops; the problem will likely be getting
yourself to the garage sales and shops and getting the stuff to its ultimate
destination without a vehicle; you'll have to consider your purchases
carefully, as you will have spent most of your starting allowance on
housing -- unless of course you choose to live on the streets; and you'll
want to keep something for food, at least enough to live on until you can
get familiar with the best dumpsters -- but again, these will probably
already be claimed (you have to hit them at the right time of day, else all
you'll find is inedible garbage), and you'll have to come up with some sort
of strategy to get a share).

-- You glasses, if you need them (if you wear contacts, I would suggest
leaving these at home, since keeping them clean can be a problem if you're
living on the streets) and any medications you need (a *real* minimum wage
earner would probably not have the medication and might therefore be in
poorer health than you will be)

If you think the above rules are grossly unfair, feel free to suggest
changes, but the point is to start out with nothing more than the average
minimum wage earner would have at any one time.

I know it could be done, and you're probably smart enough to do just fine;
but I suspect you'd find it a lot more difficult than you anticipated.

I like to go for long walks, and I sometimes find myself hungry and thirsty
and rather far from home, with no money or credit cards. Although in the
city one can usually find an outdoor faucet from which one can drink, and
there are almost always edible plants growing wild in vacant lots and even
in cracks in the pavement, it's awfully hard to find anything with
substantial calories free for the taking.

> We expect more now, so it should
> come as no surprise that it costs more.

This is not entirely accurate, Spike. There are plenty of people (I speak
from first hand knowledge here, having interacted with such people and
having *been* one from time to time) who would be happy to live in the
simplest of dwellings. But city codes won't allow it. For example, to take
the electrical code alone -- these days in Luling, Texas, a small laid back
place where the codes tend to be less stringent than in the Big City, you
have to have (among many, many other things) a separate A/C circuit
dedicated to the smoke alarm system; arc fault circuit interrupters in every
bedroom; ground fault circuit interrupters every place there is a countertop
(regardless of whether said countertop is located in a "wet" area); and you
are required to install an electrical outlet at least every x feet (can't
recall exact figure, but it's pretty low; in other words, you're required to
put in lots of electrical outlets) throughout the dwelling, except in
storage areas). These items alone, if installed by a licensed electrician,
would cost more than the typical minimum wage earner would have to spend on
a house. Some counties have less expensive standards outside city limits,
but the typical minimum wage earner does not have access to a reliable
vehicle on a regular basis; and there aren't many jobs to be had in rural
areas, nor is it easy to get regular work as an independent contractor. So
they're pretty much stuck with living in town. For those a bit higher up the
economic ladder, there are mobile and manufactured homes. In central Texas
(where the cost of living and wages are somewhat below the national average)
the typical new mobile or manufactured home will cost more than $50,000 at
the *low* end for a 2-bedroom model (and of course, that cost does not
include the land and utility hookups). You can buy a really raunchy used
mobile home for under $3000, but you still have to buy land and pay for
moving and setup (the moving and set up will generally be *at least* a
thousand, and that's if you already have utilities hooked up and a septic
system in place; a septic system will cost you anywhere from $5000 to
$20,000+).

The only reason this works for some is that most people don't do it. Why
don't they do it?  The main reasons, aside from pride, are: 1. there are
only so many good begging locations per city, and these are generally
already taken; 2. One can do it for only so long before developing
respiratory and other health problems from breathing car exhaust for hours
each day -- and you do have to keep at it for several hours to get enough to
survive on, especially if you have kids to support; 3. Most cities have
ordinances that don't allow the solicitation of charitable contributions
without a permit.

Also, bare survival isn't enough if you have children. All states in the
U.S. have laws that allow the state to take away one's children and put them
into foster care if the parent is not maintaining living conditions for the
children that meet minimum state standards. The state standards require a
dwelling that meets city codes.

"Practically nothing" is quite relative. You can pick up land in the middle
of the desert for just a few bucks an acre, but most tracts of land on the
market are in the thousands of acres. Small tracts cost more per acre,
because you're paying for the costs of subdividing, plus the seller's cut
for putting the deal together, plus the agent's cut for marketing the land.
So you might end up paying $3000 for a five acre tract, but you'd get a
piece of land fifty or a hundred miles from the nearest town with no
water -- useless for anything other than sort-term recreational camping.

Even if this were so (and usually it's not), how one is to live for a year
on a grocery bag full of gleaned milo? Even supposing you could somehow
glean a year's worth of calories (for a small active person that would be
more than 6000 potatoes or the equivalent in some other crop --  [2500
calories per day / 150 calories per potato x 7 days/week x 52 weeks/year]).
Where, pray tell, are you going to store 6000 potatoes? Remember, food
production is seasonal.

One can actually glean a lot more food in cities than on the farm. Grocery
store and restaurant dumpsters are rich sources; and one can get
supplemental protein by trapping rodents and birds and eating insects (if
one can develop a taste for them, insects are probably the most efficient
sources of protein).

Long as you've got a digestive system of iron and you aren't too picky, you
can eat. The greatest problem is finding shelter. Most cities don't take
kindly to people camping out under freeways and in public parks.

The following items, possessed by the Amish, would cumulatively cost
thousands of dollars for the person just starting out: wagons and horses or
mules (or the internal combustion, steam, or electric equivalent) for
hauling compost, building materials, harvested food and so forth;
water-tight and pest-proof structures for food storage; fencing for farm
animals and to keep critters out of gardens (this is not a trivial expense);
source of water and means of getting water to where it's needed; shelter for
humans and farm animals; means of heating shelters in cold weather; tools
for cultivating land, constructing buildings, chopping and splitting wood,
etc.

Earlier this century? You mean, like, in 2001? :-)

I think life in the U.S. is better now than it was, say, in 1950, for people
who are smart and mentally flexible, or who are able to learn a skill that
can't be economically replaced by machines. For the not-so-smart or the
inflexible or the unskilled, life is probably a bit worse now than it was
for such people in the 1950's, and unless our culture changes dramatically,
it will probably get even worse in the future.

For the employer of highly skilled individuals, there is a significant cost
associated with each additional employee, including the cost of training; it
is cheaper to have one employee who works 60 hours per week than to have two
employees doing the same work. This is so, even though efficiency drops off
when a person works too many hours without a break. So even skilled workers
have a significant risk of being unemployed at any given time, unless they
can quickly learn a new skill when the need arises.

Just my own observation, no hard statistics -- looks to me as though people
are being sorted out, by various market and political forces, into two major
groups -- the smart and flexible; and the rest. The smart and flexible group
would be comprised not only of honest, productive people but also of crafty
con artists who can and often do acheive their goals by using {the rest} in
nefarious ways.

Yes. It's mechanically more difficult for women to discretely take a leak

Hello Robert,

Thank you for reading, responding.

Uploading, yes. But first need to refine/isolate the essential element 
of the 'stuff' to be uploaded. Matter transmutation: Not merely 
changing state: becoming something new. For example, Could body be to 
consciousness->'stuff' as uranium is to radium-> helium?

Current 'reality'? You mean the life-death encapsulated event 
assumptions: the rigidly narrow 'moment of death,' 'moment of birth' 
memes? Human gestation takes a minimum of 18 months - 9 inside, 9 
onside and then some. If life-death transitions are on a continuum over 
time, then might uploading be similar? Could uploading be occurring all 
the time? Could uploading efficiency and intensity increase between 
those persons who are most alike? As in 'like attracts like'? And the 
'meeting of minds'?

Of what 'stuff' dreams are made? Have our ancestors already been 
uploaded into us? If we can tune into that 'stuff' will we see so far 
back, we'll see Death dancing on the winds of time like an impotent 
buffoon?

Another factor worth taking into account is that a lot gets done despite
people being lazy, stupid and misguided. It is easy to fall into the
trap of assuming that everybody ought to be as smart and reasonable as
oneself. But it is also easy to think that everybody is an idiot - it is
mostly a matter of current mood and personality. In reality there is an
even mix of people, and no futuristic project based on assuming that
people are homogeneous has any real chance of working. 

Transhumanist discussion often assumes that transhumanists have a key 
position - as an avant garde leading the revolution, as the architects 
designing the posthuman future. But even if that vision were to be true 
it would have to rely on the masses. And in reality most of the changes 
in technology, economy and ways of living come from below rather  than 
from top-down leadership. Figuring out how to actually build affordable 
matter compilers, use neurointerfaces and live with life extension is 
something that will be done in a distributed manner. And it cannot 
really be planned, it has to happen. The best we can do is to show the 
way, make people interested, help to make it politically possible and 
acceptable and formulate overarching visions that hopefully provide a 
framework on which to build. But we should not be surprised or dismayed 
that people build what *they* want, not what *we* want.

I can't cite a Google source, but the best book I've ever seen on the topic
is *How to Grow More Vegetables* by John Jeavons. It contains comprehensive
charts with information on calorie yield per square foot, not only for
vegetables but also for grains and fruit and nut trees. The yields are given
for poor medium and high quality soils, so one can get an idea of what one
can produce the first year, and in subsequent years after one has had a
chance to build up the soil.

While many of the horticultural methods discussed in the book are excellent,
I find some of the "biodynamic" stuff silly, but the charts alone are well
worth the price of the book.

Three things local governments could do to move real estate development the
other direction would be to give tax incentives for inner city development,
impose higher taxes on parking lots and parking garages, and stop building
more freeways. The main reason for suburan development seems to be
economics -- at the moment, it's cheaper for the individual to live outside
the city and drive in than to live inside the city. Whether it's *actually*
cheaper if you include the externalized costs is another question, and I
don't know the answer.

Individuals and developers could, of course, reclaim inner city areas on
their own with no government incentives at all; and many people (including
Damien and me) are doing that.

Barbara,
       Yep, you have taken a look around and came to the correct conclusions. 
 The BELL CURVE and an author named Richard Epstein from the University of 
Chicago's School of Law have came to pretty much the same conclusion.  
Herrnstein and Murray in TBC concluded the bifurcation is due to our economy becoming 
increasingly high tech and in turn lifting up the top 5% of the Bell Curve for 
IQ.  In the last couple of chapters they seem to be describing a distopia 
(spelling??) for the bottom 5% of that same Bell Curve.  Richard Epstein see 
pretty much the same distopia forming at the bottom of our society.  RE sees the 
complexity of our legal system as one of the major culprits.
       In the meantime some folks look at America's prison population and 
wonder what is going on?  Part of the answer, part, is due no doubt to our 
increasingly high tech economy and the increased competition of illegal immigrants 
is squeezing our less fortunate citizens out of employment and onto the dole or 
eventually into crime and imprisonment.

Barbara,
       You might look at Agri-Forestry and Sustainable Farming.  Some 
scientists make much of agriculture having progressed by moving from one level of 
expertise to another.  One example is how my Indian ancestors had both the wild 
apple and the wild grape available for domestication but never did anything 
with either.  The agricultural scientists say the American Indians had not 
achieved the level of expertise required to handle moving up to the level that 
growing apples and grapes requires.
       Today it appears that Agri-Forestry and Sustainable Farming are the 
next level to be achieved.

To coin a phrase: it depends. It just so happens that we were discussing
something tangentially related to this across the street at wta-talk. Here's
the relevant part:

Is it possible to "close the loop" within
the confines of a city. By this I mean grow all the food for the city
residents and recycle all human waste.  Here's my back of the envelope
calculations to say
that this might be possible: Take central Toronto as an example of a densely
populated "modern" city.

Land area per person = 264 m2 (density of 3,788 per km2).
(http://www.demographia.com/db-toronto-ward.htm )

Food can be grown by using an aquaponic set-up. Aquaponics uses fish waste
to grow plant matter, and growing plants to clean the fish water. Based on
research (both theoretical and practical see www.permanentend.org ) it is
possible to grow enough food for a person in a space that is 6m2. So for a
single person you might have a 2000 liter pond filled with about 100kg of
carp or tilapia. Water from the pond is used to irrigate plants grown
hydroponically above the fish pond. The hydroponic beds are made of crushed
stone--no soil is used in the system. The energy for this sort of system is
quite minimal--the pumps use about 40/watt hr per person, which could easily
be supplied by solar or wind energy. This handles the inputs, our food, what
about the outputs? Based on calculations from
http://www.prismusa.homestead.com/files/Duckweed.htm (see for derivation
http://www.permanentend.org/home.html under resources) a 3m2 pond should be
sufficiently large to
process the waste of a single human. The idea would be to grow duckweed in
these ponds, dry
it, and then feed it to the carp closing the loop. Waste water that is
processed with duckweed is far cleaner than what comes out of modern sewage
plants. In fact the water is drinkable if you run it through a uv
sterilizer.

Bottom line then is that an optimistic figure of 9m2 per person to process
all food and waste. (Of course I'm not suggesting that everyone ought to
grow their own food--aquaponics lends itself to the division of labor and
automation even more so than traditional agriculture).

Of course this figure is optimistic in someways, e.g., even under glass (or
plastic) growth would be seasonal (without enormous external energy inputs)
in some cities like Toronto.
This could in part be ameliorated by increasing the size of food and waste
facilities and grow more in the warmer seasons. So even if the calculations
are optimistic by an order of magnitude it would still be possible for
Toronto to grow its own food and process its own waste in a closed loop
within the confines of its present geography. Obviously this would require
redesigning the city, e.g., houses might be built with roofs capable of
supporting an aquaponic facility. Roadways might be covered with a canopy to
allow sewage ponds on top to grow duckweed, etc.

As far as I can see, there is no principled biological or engineering reason
why such a city could not be built, really what we lack is the political
will.

Cheers,

Mark

I responded with a reference to John Jeavons's book but forgot to mention my
own experience. I've found that in central Texas, a person can grow most of
the food needed by two people on 1/2 acre. This includes raising chickens
and rabbits (I've heard that guinea pigs and iguanas are also efficient meat
animals). I had to supplement what I grew with purchased grain and
occasionally some purchased beef and fish in order to get enough calories
and protein, and I've never personally seen anyone grow 100% of their food
on 1/2 acre, but I've heard people (including Jeavons) claim that it can be
done (in fact, I believe Jeavons claims it can be done on something like
1000 square feet per person). I initially had a pond stocked with perch,
bass and catfish, but we had a severe drought. The level of the pond got so
low that the great blue heron who dropped by every day for breakfast could
wade across the whole thing. If I'd had a well stocked pond or tank, I think
we probably could have gotten along without purchasing additional food.
Ponds are incredibly efficient food producers, since the entire volume is
productive, not just the surface area. However, by layering crops, you can
achieve something of the same effect on land (e.g. growing lettuce and other
somewhat shade tolerant vegetable crops under fruit trees and by training
vining plants such as squash and melon on trellises or fences).

Seed crops, although they have a high calorie content per pound of grain,
are not square foot efficient (although some grain crops, such as hemp,
might be square foot efficient when you consider the fiber value as well as
the value of the seed [the medicinal or recreational value of hemp leaves is
artificially high and would be negligible in the absence of drug laws]). One
of the most square foot efficient calorie crops here is the sweet potato
(especially if the vines are trained up a trellis or fence). Irish potatoes
aren't bad either, although we have a limited growing season -- gets too hot
from May on, and you can't set them out in the spring until February,
because they're frost sensitive. Mesquite beans are also efficient if you
consider that the roots of the mesquite tree fix atmospheric nitrogen in the
soil, and the leaves produce a very light shade, so you can grow other crops
directly underneath. Of course agribusiness farmers consider mesquite trees
to be the work of the devil, because they're almost impossible to kill, and
they interfere with the heavy equipment.

Better for whom?

Assuming you meant the 1900s, and if by "earlier" you meant before the 1920s
... then how can you possibly say that life was better for women before they
got the vote?

How can you say life was better in the 1930s during the depression and
prohibition years?

How can you say life was better in the 1940s when we had segregated armed
forces?

How can you say life was better in the 1950s when schools, restaurants,
movie houses, cleaners, and drinking fountains were segregated (mainly in
the southern states of the USA), and "exclusive" clubs and "exclusive"
neighborhoods (elsewhere besides the southern states in the USA as well)
were de rigueur?

How can you possibly say that life was better for *anyone* before the civil
rights laws came into being in the 1960s?

And how can you possibly say that life was better for gays before the 1970s?

That takes care of all the decades in the 1900s by which you could have
meant anytime "earlier" in the century.

I would be curious to know what you meant by "life [being] better" in the
1900s -and for whom?

I have no doubt this, or some variation, would work. I've secretly
maintained grey water systems in two cities, using various plants for
purification (I've found that water hyacinths in combination with papyrus do
a good job, and the water hyacinths grow extremely rapidly and provide a
ready supply of mulch for the gardens). None of the neighbors has ever
suspected. There is not an unpleasant odor unless you pour something toxic
down the drain and kill off your aerobic bacteria. Even then, the system
recovers rapidly.

However, I've found that a more efficient and aesthetically pleasing means
of treating the byproducts of human metabolism (that is to say, shit and
pee) is to use thermophilic composting. There is no more odor than with a
conventional toilet; you don't need expensive fancy contraptions; the heat
kills pathogens, even worm eggs; the process takes up very little space and
is over with quickly -- in warm weather you go from excrement and sawdust,
dead leaves, or other high-carbon waste material to beautiful soil in a
couple of weeks. I have never used this process in town, but I used it the
whole time I lived on the farm. My cost to install the system was $15 for
the wood, lath and cement to make a base for the seat, $3.98 for two plastic
buckets, and a few bucks for cinder blocks to enclose the compost pile.

Yes. The technology has been around since the 1960s, but it wasn't until the
1970's before we started getting a bit of an idea of how long duration
spaceflight affected our bodies. Even now, we aren't totally sure how such a
long duration in space would affectpur bodies and minds. The isolation alone
could pose a problem to the mind.

Also, it could be far more dangerous than we know. Of all 8 landers sent to
the planet by the US and Soviet governments, only 4 have successfully
landed. Two totally disappeared without any clue as to why.

Still, there have always been people willing to go.

The problem is money. Most people simply don't see a real tangible immediate
benefit from going. It is too expensive for private companies to do. The US
government is too interested in getting re-elected and only supports
programs that will achieve that goal. Since the majority of people don't see
it as a priority, neither does the government. With such a lack of interest
in space, I am surprised the shuttle is even being returned to service.

Just imagine how different things would be if we had discovered oil on Mars
when the Viking landers went there in the 1970s.

Yes, I think "uploading" needs to be explored in much greater detail
as to *what* one uploads -- memories, experiences, strategies, awareness,
etc.  How much of oneself is one willing to "give away" vs. how much of
oneself one wants to restrict access to or even destroy.

I'm not sure I fully understand the question, but I would definitely
place a strong vote in the probability that many humans are facing
a "transmutation" of sorts.  I sum this up as "You must be willing
to give up everything you are for what you might become."  Everything
changes significantly when inter-consciousness bandwidth begins to
approach the ability to communicate the information content of a
consciousness in a relatively short period (e.g. seconds-to years --
right now it cannot be done in a current human lifespan).

> Current 'reality'? You mean the life-death encapsulated event
> assumptions: the rigidly narrow 'moment of death,' 'moment of birth'
> memes?

To a large extent that is what I mean.  Of course Brett is a better
person to comment on the "moment of birth" (a 32 cell embryo, a
baby delivered prematurely at 6-months, a 9-month natural birth,
a baby who is post the "terrible twos" who can speak and largely
deal with nutrition and waste disposal functions, etc.)  Regarding
"moment of death", it obviously a sliding scale.  One sees this
nearly every week on "Emergency Room" when they decide how long to
try and "recover" a patient.  If and when the first brain transplant
is ever done the "moment of death" is going to become really messy.

So we live in an environment where these "moments" are chainging.
People don't like that.  They had best get over it.

Quite possibly.  It would be a shame (IMO) if uploading turns into an
all-or-nothing situation.  It would be much more interesting if one
was able to selectively manage *how* much was uploaded.

> Could uploading be occurring all the time?

Yes.  Both Bostrom and Freitas have argued that the odds are we are in
a simulation.  I don't know if they are right, but if so, then uploading
and downloading could be taking place all the time.

> Could uploading efficiency and intensity increase between

I don't know.  Like-attracts-like probably promotes survival rates.
So you would probably have to setup an non-logical simulation (chaos
or anarchy) for LAL to not be the common pattern.

> Of what 'stuff' dreams are made? Have our ancestors already been
> uploaded into us?

If, and its a big *IF*, complexification is a worthy goal in the universe,
then probably one does not want to replay past scenarios.  So uploading
our ancestors makes no sense -- only playing out the game in future time
does.  (Now obviously one can start *multiple* games at various positions
of evolution -- so it *may* make sense if one has a highly unusual "spin"
one wants to put on reality.)

> If we can tune into that 'stuff' will we see so far back, we'll

Raises the question of whether we are in a simulation or not?  Which
also raises the question of whether or not one can "kill" your copies
if one recognizes one is in a simulation (and can impact the copies)?
I believe those questions are unresolved at this time.  If we are in a
simulation, and/or if we are in a Multiverse, making the problem worse
since we are but one of many simulations, then I would tend to view
"death" as a "buffoon".

Though I am not suggesting action based on these perceptions since this
approach to the physics of the universe may be very very wrong.

There is an interesting quote from one of the SETI conferences is something
to the effect of "If you give a physicist long enough they can explain
*anything*."  So it seems to me it would pay to be careful in what one
believes.

Robert

I remember Damien relating a while back how he used to get his head stuck
down a dunny (translation: toilet) in grade school. I'm guessing he's glad
it wasn't your type of toilet--but rather than speculating perhaps you
should put this to the test. I've looked at commercial units that sell in
the $500 range based on the same principles as you describe. While I won't
dispute the efficiency of the breakdown, it seems to me to yield a less
useable product. I use the duckweed to feed the carp and cichlids in my
system. Duckweed is amazing--it can double its own weight under ideal
conditions. I realize that you use the night soil to fertilize, but I think
using soil is ultimately less efficient than using hydroponics (actually
aquaponics)--soil is old school man. ; ) Thanks for the feedback.

Barbara, I have *some* experience with poverty in the
form of a summer in Seattle in a $50 a month "apartment".
It had no electricity or windows, but the four apartments
had running water in the common kitchen down the hall, and 
even a homebrew "shower" of sorts, plus an actual flush
toilet, so it wasn't as primitive as Gilligan's Island.
I've been rich and I've been poor.  Rich is better.  {8^D


... Here are the rules:

1. You cannot rely on your higher education or professional
experience...

I didn't have those at the time, just an incomplete
engineering degree and not the foggiest clue.

... 2. You have to leave your vehicle(s), credit cards, nice clothing,
etc. at home...

That was easy: didn't have a vehicle at the time,
unless you count a junkyard-refugee motorcycle I
managed to resurrect.  Didn't have credit cards
or nice clothing either.


... 3. You cannot take money from your bank account via ATM, online or
through any other means...


There were no ATMs in 83, but it didn't matter, since I
had no bank account anyway, nor any actual money to put 
in it had I had one.


...The only way you're allowed to get money is to earn it or obtain it
through begging...


The minimum wage was so high with respect to prices
in the early 80s that teenagers had to compete for
those jobs with actual adults.  I lost.  {8^D


... (by the way, I've been told by people who know from first-hand
experience that for the short term, you can do better by begging than by
getting a minimum wage job...


Funny you should mention that, for I just returned from
a motorcycle trip down to one of my favorite hangouts,
Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco.  I had to check
out the controversial new Hooters, make sure that the
young nubiles employed there were not being exploited 
by the evil capitalists, you understand.    (Oh my goodness,
if only I were an evil capitalist.  There were a number
of shapely young lovelies at that Hooters who I would 
cheerfully and repeatedly exploit.  {8^D  )

On the wharf, one can see a large number of unoccupied
ecological niches for those in the gray area between
working and begging, an occupation that may be generically
defined as "Will work for fooding."  Along with the usual
collection of harlots of both genders (and everything
in between), one will see various street entertainers, 
mimes, joke tellers, buskers, instrumentalists, card
tricksters, fire-and-brimstone preachers, etc, all making 
an apparently decent tax free living off of tips from the 
touristas.  

The will-work-for-fooders can make it by having a
schtick: pretending to have Parkinsons disease, for
instance.  Today I saw one dressed in fishing garb,
hip boots, lure encrusted vest, with a sign saying
"The worst day fishing beats the best day working."
He had a pole with a paper cup tied on the end of
his line.  Whenever a tourista would drop a few
coins in his cup, he would shout "GOT ONE!" and
reel it in.  

Of course everyone there was a Vietnam veteran, 
including those who were born well after the fall 
of Saigon and those older than Senator Strom Thurman.  
A notable exception was one whose sign insisted 
"NOT a Vietnam vet.  Went to Canada.  It sucked there too."  
The touristas gave him money.

The saxophone player got my attention, for I am
sure I can play better than he.  With my
scrawny build, I could set up a sign saying
"Starving Musician" and people would believe it.
I have never used any kind of dope, but I kinda
look like a heroine addict, so perhaps people
would withhold donations for fear that they
would be contributing to my downfall.  {8^D


...4. You have to live like this for a minimum of six months...


Interesting challenge Barbara, but I must decline,
for in my business, aerospace engineering, a six
month hole in the resume will result in one's losing
one's clearances, for the security people cannot
be sure one was not conspiring with the commies
during that period.  That small portion of aerospace
engineering that does not require clearances has
already been mostly outsourced to Russia, with
little chance of it ever returning.  A lot of
those who left the biz to chase a dream during
the dot.com boom were unable to get back in.  Im
not ready to retire, altho the possibility of
job loss in the next couple years looms large.


...Also, bare survival isn't enough if you have children...

This I freely acknowledge.  By the time the kids
get to first grade, they quickly learn that
poor is not sexy, and counterculture is not sexy.
I suspect that some of our best ruthless capitalists
grew up in antimaterialist homes.  But the media
soon bombards them with messages that wealth, glamour
and glitter is where it is at, brought to you by
glamour and glitter salesmen.  This is not a value
judgement on my part, merely an observation.

..."Practically nothing" is quite relative. You can pick up land in the
middle of the desert for just a few bucks an acre, but most tracts of
land on the market are in the thousands of acres...


My comment came from our family's experience with
my great-grandfather's farm in Greenup county Kentucky.
The family moved there in 1915 and they farmed it until
about the mid sixties, not very profitably I might add.
Then my grandfather and two of his brothers hobby farmed 
it after he retired on and off in the 70s.  The vacant
farm is still owned by one of my uncles but has been 
fallow for three decades.

Greenup county has fewer people now than at the dawn
of the 20th century, as most of the small farms up
thru there have been abandoned.  The soil is good there,
a stream runs year around, but it is hilly, so the 16
(or so) farmable acres are irregularly shaped and not
well suited to large farm equipment.  Somehow they managed
to raise six children on that land.  That farm and
others like it can be had for a very low price.  Many
of them are likely being held merely for sentimental
reasons, and arrangements could be had to rent those
farms for almost nothing.  

But none of the farms up that way have been operated 
for any real profit for a long time.  Tobacco is the 
only profitable product, but tobacco is a very labor 
intensive crop, so it would require a large family 
to make it go, and even then, most of the children 
would likely eventually conclude than a minimum wage 
job in twon is a far easier way to live.

Another example of a way to make a living without
begging or a 9 to 5 is found up along the Kern
River in Southern Taxifornia.  On the map, find
Ridgecrest, go west on 178 to Lake Isabella, turn
north up to Johnsondale and Camp Nelson.  There
are a few subsistence farms along the river, and no
one cares what the hell you do up that way.

Gleaning of fields: I have an old college buddy who 
raises potatoes in Idaho.  Every year people show up
with burlap sacks right after the harvesters
are finished, every year he gives them as many
potatoes as they can physically carry away.  He's
a generous guy: last year a vw bus showed up.  He
loaded them up with as many as it would hold, these
being potatoes he already paid to have harvested.
I figure it is only a matter of time before someone
arranges to step on some sharp object or somehow
"accidentally" injure themselves while gleaning those 
fields, so they can get themselves a free ticket in 
the lawsuit lottery.

Those who say it is getting tougher seem to want to
both live near a city and raise larvae, two tasks that
I would agree would be tough if one wants to drop
out of the rat race.  My contention is that if you
forgo all luxuries, don't smoke, drink or do drugs, 
then it is easier now to merely survive than ever before.

Still, I cheerfully opt for the modern rat race and 
everything that goes with it: the pressing crowds, 
the vanity and vexation, the endless search for meaning, 
the hurry, the struggle of constant competition, 
the pointless glory of it all.  

May the fastest rat win.

This thread strikes an interesting cord for me. In my opinion one of the 
unaddressed (and unintended) consequences of unbridled capitalism(*) is that 
over time natural resources, i.e. land, slowly ends up in the hands of a few. 
Carried to its inevitable consequence all the land is owned by a few very 
rich people who literally can deny life to the remaining population. For an 
in-depth exploration of one way to solve this pop over to www.henrygeorge.org 
and do some reading.

(*) I'm not so good at economic terms but what I mean by capitalism is a 
system where ownership of capital (i.e. land etc.) is fundamental to the 
economic system.

Yes. In this context, I'll post below (for discussion) a very slightly
modified version of an essay on the feasibility and desirability of direct
democracy, written in 1966 when I was more an elitist than I am today. I've
modified it slightly to take account of the reality of the Internet, which
I invoked as a futuristic possibility (`the Zeitgeist machine'), and some
other small details. My neuroscience was sketchy nearly 40 years ago, but I
believe still stands up in general terms. I start the piece with a long
quote from a Heinlein novella that I found creepy but compelling, and still
do.

This must be regarded as an unfinished project. I no longer subscribe to
the flourishing 1966 ending, where I said (smartarse that I was, and
quoting a friend's quip) that perhaps Plato was right in supposing that
what the people wanted was `a fuck, a feed, and a Fuehrer'.

	`We defined thinking as the ability to recognize data, store them,
integrate them, evaluate correctly the result and arrive at a correct
answer. Look around you. Most people do that stunt just well enough to get
to the corner store and back without breaking a leg. If the average man
thinks at all, he does silly things like generalizing from a single datum.
He uses one--valued logics. If he is exceptionally bright, he may use
two-valued, `either--or' logic to arrive at his wrong answers. If he is
hungry, hurt, or personally interested in the answer, he can't use any sort
of logic and will discard an observed fact as blithely as he will stake his
life on a piece of wishful thinking. He uses the technical miracles created
by superior men without wonder or surprise, as a kitten accepts a bowl of
milk. Far from aspiring to higher reasoning he is not even aware that
higher reasoning exists. He classes his own mental process as being of the
same sort as the genius of an Einstein. Man is not a rational animal; he is
a rationalizing animal.
	`For explanations of a universe that confuses him he seizes onto
numerology, astrology, hysterical religions, and other fancy ways to go
crazy. Having accepted such glorified nonsense, facts make no impression on
him, even if at the cost of his own life. Joe, one of the hardest things to
believe is the abysmal depth of human stupidity.'
	 `The idea is to skim the cream of the race's germ plasm and keep it
biologically separate until the two races are permanently distinct? You
chaps sound like a bunch of stinkers, Baldwin!'
	`Monkey talk.'
	`Perhaps. The new race would necessarily run things-'
	`Do you expect New Man to decide grave matters by counting common man's
runny noses?'
	`No, that was my point. Postulating such a new race, the result is
inevitable. Baldwin, I confess to a monkey prejudice in favor of democracy,
human dignity, and freedom. It goes beyond logic; it is the kind of a world
I like. In my job I have mingled with the outcasts of society, shared their
slum-gullion. Stupid they may be, bad they are not-I have no wish to see
them become domestic animals.'
	For the first time the big man showed concern. His persona slipped away;
he sat in brooding majesty, a lonely and unhappy figure. `I know, Joe. They

fifty years or so democracy, or something like it, could flourish safely.
The issues were such as could be settled without disaster by the votes of
common men, befogged and ignorant as they were. But now, if the race is
simply to stay alive, political decisions depend on real knowledge of such
things as nuclear physics, planetary ecology, genetic theory, even system
mechanics. They aren't up to it, Joe. With goodness and more will than they
possess less than one in a thousand could stay awake over one page of
nuclear physics; they can't learn what they must know.'
	Gilead brushed it aside. `It's up to us to brief them. Their hearts are
all right; tell them the score-they'll come down with the right answers.'
	`No, Joe. We've tried it; it does not work. As you say, most of them are
good. Yet there are bad ones. Reason is poor propaganda when opposed by the
yammering, unceasing lies of shrewd and evil and self-serving men. The
little man has no way to judge and the shoddy lies are packaged more
attractively. There is no way to offer color to a colorblind man, nor is
there any way for us to give the man of imperfect brain the canny skill to
distinguish a lie from a truth.'
	Gilead's brain followed Baldwin's argument and assured him that it was
true; his inclinations fought it. He was confronted with the sharpest of
all tragedy: two equally noble and valid rights, bitterly opposed...
		Gulf, Robert A. Hein1ein

	II

Government is one of the primary operational meta-structures of a complex
community. By `structure' I mean the network of roles that determine and
circumscribe the activities and relationships of individuals who comprise
the community.
	In simple societies, structure is generally derived from kinship and the
specialized kinds of craft skills and secret traditional knowledge that
people pass down from father or uncle to son, mother or aunt to daughter.
Structure is all; there is no need for meta-structure. In modern societies,
such simple structures become disrupted by mobility. Custom loses its
invariance. Anomie replaces order and expectation. Systems of communication
and control must be devised instead of found in some natural, traditional
order of things. Painfully, meta-structure comes into being. `Trouble
starts (governments). Their existence testifies to the fact that the
elementary and almost instinctive ways in which men ordinarily arrange
their joint affairs have broken down.'1
	So government is the mechanism through which conscious adaptive control
and co-ordination can be exercised in a de-tribalised community. Democracy
is the species of that genus `founded in the free responsiveness of the
state to the community'.2 Democratic institutions provide direct feedback
between the controlled and the controllers, ultimately and importantly
exemplified in the communal option to elect or depose the governmental
executives.
	Direct democracy  is the actual legislative formulation by the full body
of the citizenry, which decides by referendum what, when and how measures
shall be put into practice. James Madison, in the Federalist, used
`democracy' in this way, distinguishing it from `republic' or popular
representative government. It has been distinguished from `psephocracy'3
(rule via the ballot box), a synonym for republicanism which emphasizes the
wide gap separating contemporary `democracy' from direct, hands-on democracy.
	Psephocracy is a retreat from decision, from responsibility, from debate,
from self-direction. It boasts the forms of republicanism but, lacking the
substance, rarely employs them. Oligopolistic mass-media emasculate the
habit of free discussion not merely by censoring information but by
providing a simulacrum of open debate. Inflated xenophobia and patriotism
can swamp the educated habit-of-truth by presenting dissent as dangerously
close to treason.
	`In fact, the accepted view is that those who try, by pressure and
agitation, to prevent the government from taking actions which they
consider wrong are infringing the rules of the system and going back on an
implicit bargain. Their proper course is to keep quiet and vote the other
way when the chance comes round.'4 And the same pressures act, very
often-even in polities where elections do provide a real alternative-to
render the citizenry psychologically incapable of making that real choice.
	Procedurally, direct democracy differs from psephocracy in its frequent
consultation with the voters; psychologically, elitist objections to rule
by the people applies even more strongly. One would expect that at least
some decisions made by referendum would not be identical with those reached
after a debate of `representatives'. Nonetheless, there is no reason to
suspect that a vote decided by a majority of media--befogged citizens of
average intelligence would be more rational than one decided by
(presumably) more intelligent, party-bound `representatives' reflecting
sectional interests. It might be more popular, but so was bread and circus.
Is rationality a desideratum? If government is the mechanism of control and
co-ordination, it must primarily be a rational process; otherwise,
democracy becomes the apotheosis of the majority's whim-more properly,
ochlocracy, or mob rule.
	It has been urged that, it is futile discussing such a system in the
modern context, whatever the merits or demerits of direct democracy.5
Granted, the Swiss Confederation allows veto of constitutional proposals,
laws and treaties, and permits by popular resort to the initiative the
introduction and approval of constitutional amendments. Yet, `whatever
value we may set on the unique Swiss system, it is certainly far removed
from the turbulent direct democracy of the Ancient Greeks.'6 Moreover, it
is often declared, such a procedure would be cumbersome and slow,
impossible in a dispersed technological society.
	The Internet and mass communications are now sufficiently advanced,
however, to solve the technical aspects of such difficulties. What is of
greater concern than its empirical feasibility are the implications for the
human condition if computerized direct democracy were introduced.
Intelligence, sheer neuralogical capacity to assimilate and order data, and
creativity, the blend of brain and environmental which generates new
hypotheses, important as they are in this context, are by no means the
whole reason why direct democracy does not yet seem a terribly good idea.

	III

Laid down by John Stuart Mill, the ethical foundations of democratic
theory, are predicated on the moral dignity of humans as rational and
volitional beings. Mill's wonderful statement on tolerance7 leads directly
to the view which `defines liberty as an attribute of societies which
tolerate and facilitate peaceful reassessments and reforms.'8 In Ernest
Gellner's words: `Certainty enters only as a negative epistemological
thesis.'9
	Mill's faith `in the moral value of democracy was combined, however with
an acute awareness of the practical dangers implicit in mass action... His
great fear of the masses was that they would use their power to discourage
or prohibit uncommon lines of thought and action, forcing everyone to
conform to a common standard of popular mediocrity.'10 To avoid imposed
conformity, he proposed that democracy be postponed while `under the
tutelage of a liberal-minded minority, the masses could slowly acquire the
various skills needed for effective citizenship. As their education
progressed, their political responsibilities would increase in like
proportion.'11 Yet Mill felt that even when this had been achieved, the
best form of democracy would be represent-ative government.
	He would have agreed that democracy was the system of rule founded in the
free responsiveness of the state to the community-but only if that
community was educated and liberal, which on the whole would elect able and
rational representatives. Has that been the experience of the past century
and a half? One might doubt it, by and large.
	The bright, brave dreams even of sober optimists like Mill lie often
flayed and broken on the threshing-floor of history.

	IV

Perhaps a valediction to democracy is premature. Perhaps the dubious
triumph of psephocracy is merely a phase in the education to democracy, an
affluent adolescent extravaganza of complacency, as the Soviets use to
suggest the harsh communism of Stalin was in the long road to the withering
of the state. I'll tell you why I don't think so.
	Jacob Bronowski, in Science and Human Values, brilliantly and plausibly
demonstrated how the liberal, humane values of truthfulness, justice,
respect, independence, tolerance are generated as the necessary conditions
for the practise of science or any form of creative endeavor. When the
Hobbesian seeks to justify these virtues, it must be for their expedience
in the general self-interest. It is possible to do this-indeed, A. S.
Neill's remarkable successes in rehabilitating delinquents at Summerhill
showed how other-regarding values can be learned pragmatically-but these
are not the only values expedience can find. History is largely the record
of how human beings discovered the value of deceit, obsequience, brutality
and contempt. Laziness prospers well in psephocracy, and psephocrats
prosper because of it, as tyrants once prospered because of terror and in
some places still do.
	This is not a moral evaluation. Liberal (pluralist) values, on which
democracy of any kind and direct democracy in particular must rest, are an
interior necessity only to certain people. The politician whose
temperamental bent and inner drives are to power and its indulgence-rather
than to scientific, creative, philosophic curiosity and its indulgence-may
subscribe to liberal values only so long as they do not interfere with his
will-to-power. Humanist values are not necessary to the exercise of power,
as they are to curious and invention-or if they are, it is not obviously
so. Similarly, a neurotic introvert may prefer the values of
self-abasement, masochism and treachery to a truth-seeker's sine qua non
moral values.
	The human organism can be described as an input-processing-output system,
incorporating a hierarchy of cortical feedback loops that largely accounts
for reflectivity and thence self-conscious identity. Data input
(exteroceptive, proprioceptive and cognitive) is mapped on to associational
matrices or attractors. These matrices are largely phylogenetic, inherited
in prer-shaped form fro  our evolutionary ancestors. However, there is
comparatively great flexibility in the higher morphogenetic frameworks
(perceptual abstractions such as the visual constancies are innate, but can
be interfered with, `from above', by verbal suggestion), and the
cognitive/emotive matrices are enormously variable. These latter `human'
nets of data-response patterns are roughly what we call concepts. And the
larger matrix which subsumes an individual's concepts we might term his or
her `phenomenological mode'.
	All autonomic modes and, less directly, all phenomenological modes stem
from the individual's unique neurobiochemical organization. At its
simplest, think of somatotype, a classification of body shape introduced by
William Sheldon in 1940: thin nervy ectomorphs, muscular confident
mesomorphs, corpulent endomorphs. More significant, and not unrelated to
somatotypy, is the degree of inhibition or facilitation of afferent
impulses by the nervous system's ascending reticular formation. Evidence
suggests that this inhibition or facilitation is closely connected to the
individual's position in the behavioral continuum from extravert to
introvert. The extreme extravert is typically muscular, with high
inhibition of afferent or incoming nervous impulses, hence stimulus hungry.
The extreme introvert is thin, cerebrotonic, with high facilitation of
input, hence stimulus sensitive. The population mean, in America, is
shifted well towards the former classification.12
	Behaviorally, a culture's tempo takes a mean or average value, at neither
one extreme nor the other. Consequently, extraverts tend to experience
`stimulus starvation', so they act more boistrously to drive up the volume.
Moreover, central inhibition impedes conditioning; since social mores are
in large part culturally conditioned, extraverts can satisfy their stimulus
hunger with less concern than average for the law. Extreme extraverts do
seem to make up a large percentage of the prison-populations in Australia
and America.13 Introverts, on the other hand, receive a stimulus battering
in the normal context; they may respond by withdrawal and some can become
neurotic and even suicidal. Being readily conditioned, they are likely to
be `moral', although extreme introverts, being especially sensitive to
their deviation from the norm, are prone to alien-ation.
	We might divide contemporary phenomenological modality, very roughly, into
three very broad categories. Two of these were made famous in the middle of
the 20th century by sociologist David Riesman, in his surprisingly
bestselling The Lonely Crowd: A Study of the Changing American Character
(Yale University Press, 1950), which added a `tradition-directed' mode
typical of pre-industrial cultures.
	(A) The `other-directed' or conformist mode: `I am in that others respond
to me, recognize me, approve of me'.
	(B) The `inner-directed' self-driven mode: `I am in that I recognize
myself'-identity is mediated less directly than in (A), via an internalized
other-directed structure: the second `I' or the inner-directed paradigm
being the Word, the a priori, the Imposed Conscience or superego.
	(C) The `scientific' mode, not described by Riesman. This is less
precarious and more independent than `other-directedness', for here what is
given is the scientific methodology and its canon; or in the case of some
artists, the relevant artistic tradition and command of expertise. It is
also more flexible than pure `inner-directedness', with constant reference
to an other, the empirical facts. Nor does it closely resemble
pre-industrial `tradition-centredness', since its traditions and framing
theories continually modify any provisional constructs and certainties. 
	(A) seems congenial to, and perhaps somewhat predicated upon, extraversion
morphology, (B) to introversion, while (C) would seem to be more common
among less-extreme intro-verts, and perhaps approximates to the INTJ and
ENTJ temperaments on the Myers-Briggs scale. A study now half a century old
`has indeed shown that, as a profession, science attracts men whose
temperament is grave, awkward, and absorbed.'14 `There is one vital field
where scientists have made hardly any contribution,' Physics Nobel laureate
I. I. Rabi remarked decades ago, `and that is to politics-politics in its
practical sense of standing for office. Somehow the scientific education
diminishes the ambition for power and worldly influence.'15 I think it much
more likely that the motivational drives of the scientific modality make
the enterprise of personal satisfaction of curiosity far more appealing
than public affairs.
	If then, as Bronowski suggested, many key humane values are generated out
of the scientific mode as a necessary condition for its operation, what of
democracy? Ironically, democratic theorists have tended to share this
phenomenological mode with scientists, so the values they found
self-evident by introspection were quite naturally assumed to be latent in
everyone, hidden by a condition nasty, brutish and short. If this analysis
has any validity, we must recognize that the larger part of contemporary
western communities is morphogenetically other-directed, compliant and
complacently hedonistic. It might seem, then, that the immense task of
developing a truly humane, open and tolerant society cannot be entrusted to
most people's innate rationality and good will. Will-to-rationality and
open-minded tolerance might be nearly as rare (INTJs comprise perhaps 5
percent of the population) as superior intelligence (the top few
percentiles of IQ measures).

I am worried on how long the large middle class will continue
to exist in the current 1st world countries.  If the difference
between rich and poor people (within countries) keeps growing
like it has over the past decades, a large middle class might
well become a thing of the past.

On the other hand, housing + food + healthcare have become so
horribly expensive that high tech toys are just a drop in the
bucket in many of the richer country...

I'm not so sure.  Dole doesn't buy land in Nebraska because one generally
cannot grow pinapples there.  The land they own in Hawaii may be enough
simply due to constraints on how many pinapples one can market.  Refer back
to the conversation with comments by Damien and others regarding tariffs on
agricultural products.  Even if you owned the land in a lower cost producing
"state" one might not be able to sell the products (so it makes no sense to
own the land).  If this argument held together people would be snapping up land
in northern Canada and Russia and using genetic engineering to produce crops
that would grow there.  Or one would see massive efforts to build desalination
plants and pipelines to supply the U.S. southweast with fresh water.  And
of course there is North Africa and the Mid-east.  Yet one doesn't see
efforts of that nature.

Instead one sees a greater concentration of "wealth" in the hands of those
who own the "Intellectual Property" and "human resources", e.g. IBM, Intel,
etc.  But one only owns the IP for 20 years and the human resources are
generally free to move about.

The "land" is ultimately important if we get into a massive population
growth situation (say a world population of 20-100 billion).  But there
are solutions to this -- from more efficient agricultural methods (see
Mark Walker's recent post) to solar power satellites.

It is relatively accepted by economic theorists that as "natural resources"
are exhausted that substitutions occur.  I have not looked at the web site, but
if it does not examine (in detail) substitution phenomena, then it doesn't
have a grasp of the "big picture".

It was real innovation, but not completely planned in advance.

Arguably making available a large amount of money and telling
people something along the lines of "just do it, I don't care
how" would fall more along the lines of "setting up a climate
that benefits innovation" instead of a planned thing.

Letting companies send in their proposals for sub projects is
something that I suspect has helped the Apollo project a lot.
Imagine the current NASA bureaucracy trying to come up with
all the components of the Apollo project, from the top down...

Oops. Not that many. According to the table at

http://www.trytel.com/~jfalt/Tables/stats.html

INTJ males are 3.3% of the population, 0.8% of the females. (If true, that
could explain some aspects of this list.)

Lawyers, it's claimed, 

http://www.altmanweil.com/about/articles/article.cfm?ArticleID=157

are 13.1% INTJ, many more than in the population. Since elected politicians
often start as lawyers... (But they're probably the other ones, by and large.)

Oh, and to my amazement

http://www.trytel.com/~jfalt/Tables/stats.html

claims their sample of 3000-something people in the USA shows 49.3%
extraverts, and correspondingly 50.7% introverts. Were the extraverts all
out having fun instead of filling in the test? It's claimed adjustments
were made to compensate for such test bias.

...This thread strikes an interesting cord for me. In my opinion one of
the 
unaddressed (and unintended) consequences of unbridled capitalism(*) is
that 
over time natural resources, i.e. land, slowly ends up in the hands of a
few...


On the contrary, this consequence is intended.  This
demonstrates the beauty and power of unbridled capitalism.
Matt, when wealth is evenly spread over the population, it
is just money.  But when it is concentrated in the hands
of a few, then it becomes CAPITAL and it takes on a certain
POWER to create new wealth and make things happen.  This is 
because when money does concentrate, notice that it always 
seems to fall into the hands of those who know how to USE 
the capital to create more wealth, to the benefit of everyone, 
whether by creating jobs or by creating products to be 
purchased by the proletariat.

Contrast this to unbridled communism, which destroys the
value of land, since the government cannot be trusted to
not seize the land on a whim (so why pay much for it?).
Communism destroys wealth by reducing incentive to struggle
and take risks.  Take away the rewards of competition,
and people will not compete.  If people do not compete,
they do not achieve excellence.  They eventually get to
where they achieve practically nothing, living in a dingy
gray hell, struggling for mediocrity but not getting there.  
Russia will likely not recover from the curse of communism 
before the singularity.  


 
...Carried to its inevitable consequence all the land is owned by a few
very 
rich people who literally can deny life to the remaining population...



It would work that way except for the fact that land
is not a critical resource anymore.  In fact most
land is actually a liability.  Land in cities has a
great deal of value, and is increasing.  Intellectual
property carries value and is increasing.  Farmland?  Nah,
it's just dirt, and the tax structure of the U.S. is
making it harder all the time to make money from it.

My apologies to Randy ... I misread what you wrote, and went tearing down
the wrong road.

Since I've been on this list, many "things were better in the past" posts
have actually been written (insofar as small v. big government, i.e., from
the libertarian perspective) ... and when "life - better - earlier this
century" popped out at me, I took the defensive driving approach.
Needlesslessly.

I'm sorry, Randy.

I'm sorry but this claim that we are dying at alarming rates from old diseases 
if we are not in the top 5% is way over the top.  Facts and figures please.  
Accidental death is new?  Heart disease is new?   I am confused by your

I would suggest that a smaller lever is sufficient if you don't buy that you 
have to move great masses of humans to support your cause in order for it to 
happen.   A smaller lever might require for a fulcrum being able to work 
outside what the masses of humanity understand, know about or have 
sanctioned.    Another worthy fulcrum is escape from heavy taxation and deep 
government monitoring of gathering capital and resources.

Ref: The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Mothers and Fathers Are Going
Broke by Elizabeth Warren, et al
Release Date: September 2, 2003

The New Yorker has an interesting article about a new book which claims
that the cost of having kids is ruining the middle-class.
Another reason for the dropping birthrate?
The article also points out that having fewer children will mean big
financial problems in the future.

Also in the Financial Times (UK)
http://news.ft.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=FT.com/StoryFT/FullStory&c=StoryFT&cid=1059479217608&p=1037535656670

Quote:
You might, then, expect American families to be luxuriating in good
fortune. But, compared with people who dont have children, people who
do are in worse economic shape than theyve ever been in. The Harvard
law professor Elizabeth Warren and her daughter Amelia Warren Tyagi
demonstrate, in their forthcoming book The Two-Income Trap, that
having a child is now the best indicator of whether someone will end up
in financial collapse. Married couples with children are twice as
likely as childless couples to file for bankruptcy. Theyre seventy-five
per cent more likely to be late paying their bills. And theyre also far
more likely to face foreclosure on their homes. Most of these people are
not, by the usual standards, poor. Theyre middle-class couples who are
in deep financial trouble in large part because they have kids.

In the past two decades or so, the cost of having children has risen
much faster than the cost of being childless. Conventional wisdom aside,
this has little to do with spoiled kids, acquisitive parents, or
PlayStation 2. Instead, its the result of two things: housing and
education. According to the Federal Reserve Board, between 1983 and 1998
the price of housing for married couples with children rose seventy-nine
per cent in real terms, roughly three times as much as it did for
childless people. One reason is that houses are bigger now. But,
according to Warren and Tyagi, the real reason is that parents get into
bidding wars for homes in safe neighborhoods with good public schools.

Then, theres college. Thirty years ago, middle-class parents could feel
theyd done a good job of raising a child if he or she made it through
high schooldecent jobs for unskilled and semi-skilled labor were
readily available. Today, such jobs are much harder to find, and college
is considered a necessity. Needless to say, it is also extremely expensive.

The United States has $6.7 trillion in debt and forty trillion in
potential obligations to the elderly or soon-to-be-elderly, and were
sticking future workers with the bill. Even if the American birth rate
stays where it is, were headed for serious trouble. If it drops, look out.

End quotes.


Food for thought?

Ok, this sounds like a very *interesting* challenge.

Taking the standard diet that the FDA proposes:
  http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/Fpyr/pyramid.html
just *how* inexpensive can one make a healthy diet?

It is not completely necessary to consume all of the required vitamins and
minerals from dietary sources -- one can use supplements.  It would be an
extropic project to produce a set of weekly menus with some variety that
have the lowest cost and best "health" perspectives.  We could start with
"daily" menus and mix and match contributions from individuals.  One would
have to do some math based on the nutrition content of various meals and
prices from grocery receipts but it should not be *that* difficult
given information one is now normally provided with.

My sample calculation: 2500 calories/day / 280 calories/meal = ~9 meals/day.
(based on calorie content of Lean Cuisine "Sweedish Meatballs" dish).
Nine meals per day @ $3.35/meal = ~$904/month.  And that is based on
"pre-prepared" meals.  (There are some huge problems with salt
content of 9 such meals per day but it provides a frame of reference.)

Interestingly, if we had an "ideal" menu we might discover which
countries really are regulating agricultural imports in such a way
as to drive up prices and support their farm "lobby" at the expense
of the consumers.

When I was a young adult I worked two low-paying jobs for a while so I could
save money to start a business. Office job during the day, waitress job at
night.

Since I was trying to save money, I kept my food bill to a minimum by eating
brewer's yeast, bread, and vitamin C. .

I only did this for a year or so. Don't know what the long term effects
would've been, but during the time I was eating this way, I felt great and
never got sick. Both my food expense and prep time were almost nothing (I
bought already made bread rather than baking my own). For the sake of full
disclosure I should add that I supplemented this diet by eating leftovers at
the restaurant (I used to pitch the dishes I especially liked, in hopes that
the customer would leave some for me), but the leftovers made up a fairly
small % of my overall diet.

Water hyacinths also double their weight in an incredibly short time
(they're considered a horrible nuisance when they get loose in a lake,
because they quickly cover the whole surface). I totally agree that
hydroponics is more efficient than soil in many cases, and hydroponic
gardens can be as beautiful as soil based gardens (the visual aesthetics are
almost as important to me as the efficiency; I find that generally the two
are positively correlated). I believe even fruit trees are being grown
hydroponically these days.

My experience has been that while a pond or tank is extremely valuable and
more effficient at producing calories per cubic foot than soil, it's more
expensive to grow food such as squash, tomatoes, and broccoli hydroponically
than on soil (and I'm not even sure you can grow root crops such as potatoes
and sweet potatoes hydroponically), and that it takes less space to deal
with human waste using thermophilic composting (to quantify it -- for one
adult and one teenager, the space required for the compost pile was four
feet cubed -- this handled not only our bodily wastes but also kitchen
waste, waste paper, etc.), and that water purification is not as good at
getting rid of pathogens as thermophilic composting; but it's likely that
the techniques I've used for water-based purification are not the most
efficient, and you've inspired me to do further research and
experimentation.

I would suggest that a smaller lever is sufficient if you don't buy that you  
have to move great masses of humans to support your cause in order for it to  
happen.  A smaller lever might require for a fulcrum being able to work       
outside what the masses of humanity understand, know about or have            
sanctioned.                                                                   

I agree, and this is how science often is done nowadays. However, this is
not foolproof-- as the stem cell story, the banning of human cloning, the
crippling limitations on animal use in research, and the recent demise of the
DARPA futures market demonstrate.


 Another worthy fulcrum is escape from heavy taxation and deep government     
monitoring of gathering capital and resources.                                


I'm always on the lookout for ways to do this. Although, truth be told,
research in many fields is very, very expensive... so expensive as to put
funding out of reach of most individuals and into the realm of corporations
and governments. Even the few individuals rich enough to personally fund a
typical program project grant are not themselves scientists-- to get that
rich, they have to have specialized in making money from the beginning. As for
corporations, they are under constant pressure to deliver short-term profits,
and this is a disincentive to blue-sky research with high/unknown risks and
high/unknown payoffs. Furthermore, corporations face a free-rider problem from
competitors if they publicize the results of their research, yet without open
publication there is massive duplication of effort and the overall rate of
progress slows down. This may change as the lifespan and wisdom of investors
increases... but for the time being, what we're left with is government as the
main patron for many types of basic research.

I regard this as a major problem Libertarians have yet to offer a solution to
other than assurances that it simply won't happen once government gets off
everybody's back. Sort of a Friendly Market argument.

I do have some thoughts on how to maximize political leverage given the
short-term inevitability of government dependence, but am thinking about how
to phrase it so that it doesn't get used against us should people from the
list start taking this approach (remember, every single thing you say here is
placed in a publicly accessible archive on extropy.org). Private queries from
individuals interested in discussing this in the meantime are welcome.

Intuitively, the odds seem like they should be in the range of a 
thousand-to-one for any technological artifacts being spotted, so by the 
rule of calibration I'll offer a probability of 86% against.

> Better for whom?

Good points, all.

Here's a brief response:

Better would have to be defined as "amount of time the average person 
had to work to pay for their own subsistence, relative to the amount of 
time they were able to spend on the rest of, say, maslow's hierarchy of 
needs."

That is, let's define quality of life as the ability to bypass the 
subsistence level of living "plus sex".  We'll define "most" purely 
percentage wise.

I don't know ALL the details, but here's what I do know.  The relative 
chunk that "upstream pyramid" people take is relatively the same now as 
in 1900 "for most people" given that still, "most people" live in bleak 
poverty with little hope of moving past caring for their basic needs 
plus sex.

If you restrict "most people" to the united states, we can all agree 
that pre-slavery US was morally intolerable, but on the pure numbers, 
with slaves making up less than 10% of the overall population, while 
they had a tendency to drag the averages down, they didn't do it any 
worse than the poverty-level people of today.  (And I am DEFINITELY NOT 
blaming them for bringing the "average quality of living" down.)

As for women's suffrage, this clearly enabled fully half of our 
citizenry to potentially exercise one of the major rights of 
self-determination, the empirical question though is whether the 
overall effect was to give women and men together more 
leisure/self-improvement time or give them all equally, less time, and 
whether or not in fact more people were empowered politically by the 
movement.  I think both of those questions are objectively open.  It's 
not clear that with 20% of the people in the country continuing to 
control 90% of the resources that self-determination was served by 
women's suffrage (though once again the right to vote being denied was 
a morally intolerable state of affairs).

If there were any major improvements in the last 200-hundred years with 
objectively correlate-able effects to overall average improvements in 
leisure-time/self-improvement-time they were:

1)  The 40-hour work week.
2)  The minimum wage
3)  The child labor laws
4)  The unionization laws

Remembering that "most" eg 50% or more of the people are poverty-level 
and the next largest group are "middle class" the top 10% tend to not 
matter very much when doing calculations of overall improvement in the 
quality of life.  This means that major medical advances (heart 
transplants, curing glaucoma, etc.) tend not to matter very much in the 
equation.  Indeed, it's hard to see how the life of King George II was 
much worse than Queen Elizabeth's or whether how an 18th-century-duke's 
life compared to Bill Gates "matters in the long run".  The things that 
matter tend to be large-scale changes in the ways that people interact 
- paradigm shifts in how people are treated by each other.  And these 
changes tend to be power-shifts from centralized to democratized 
control.  (The ancient addage that people are too stupid to govern 
themselves having been given the lie by empirical evidence over the 
last 2500 years).

I would argue that these paradigm shifts tend to have the greatest 
overall and specific effects as well - with more average leisure-time, 
more effort is put into self-realization and likely neo-extropic 
activities (researching glaucoma) and because some of these problems 
are so intractable (like beating despotism worlwide) it takes a LOT of 
effort to make them happen, requiring a lot of parts of everyone's 
days.  I take it it's axiomatic that life-enhancement for the rich is 
not the primary concern of extropianism and even if it is the creation 
of a sustainable society should be one of the key elements in that 
concern.

Best,

Robbie

The question is whether or not this is anything new?  I don't think so.

As far as I can tell, the underlying property, means of production and 
right to "be in any particular place" continues to be largely "owned" 
by the rent-collectors backed by their military cohorts.

Not a significant change over feudal times.

Huh?  Microsoft owns a few acres over in Redmond and perhaps a few
other places -- can hardly be considered a "feudal" landlord.  It
probably has a large amount of cash (go look at its SEC statements)
invested in some combination of treasury bills (allowing the U.S.
to run a somewhat lesser budget deficit) and mutual funds (allowing
the U.S. to provide decreased capital costs to other companies) and
perhaps in VC funds (allowing the promotion of a greater rate of
innovation).

The Microsoft Empire was built in less than 25 years.  It started,
relatively speaking, from zero property and zero means of production --
it also does relatively little for the "military" compared with say
Boeing or Lockheed.  The same could largely be said for Oracle.  If
you want to take the discussion out of the software realm, one might
look at 3M or even GE.

The idea that the "rent-collectors" drive things now-a-days is absurd.

The survey is supposed to take a while (9 months) [1].
The resolution of the colder frequencies is *very* limited
(128x128, 32x32, 2x20) in the MIPS instrument [2].

As I think I pointed out in one or more papers, our current
IR detection capabilities pretty much "suck".  That will
probably not change until we get detectors based on bolometers [3].

But since the SWIRE survey [4] is supposed to be looking outside
the galaxy some interesting results might be produced.  As Milan
Cirkovic is the one who has proposed that advanced civilizations
such as MBrains may need to migrate outside of galaxies for the
greatest efficiencies (something Amara has provided some supportive
information for) then I may be proposing to him that one may want
to study the SWIRE data for signs of MBrains that have exited
stage left.  Whether or not the survey has the resolution to determine
this I do not know.  A very cold, outside of the galaxy, MBrain may be a
very difficult object to detect using current technology.  (As may
an inside-out MBrain dumping waste entropy into a black hole.)

Of interest to me will be whether an "accident" happens.  A very
unusual "accident" took place with the previous WIRE mission which
was supposed to do a complete IR survey.  So one working hypothesis
is whether or not missions may be "sabotaged" to prevent an increase
in our IR radiation knowledge.  Not highly probable I will grant,
but something to think about.

Eliezer, can you explain why you pick 1000-1 odds?  (You may want to
read my response to Robin's comments first.)  This would seem to
be pulling a number out of the hat.  It is beginning to look like
from the exoplanet searches that we are getting 1-in-50 solar systems
may have "Earths".  Lineweaver's work suggests that *most* of them should
be much older than our "Earth".  Dick's work (recently pointed out by
Anders) suggests we need to completely rethink when and where intelligence
may "live" due to the fact that much of it is much older than we are.
(I will suggest you may have conflicting investments in whether or not
there has or has not been a singularity within a single solar system
within this galaxy yet.)

So the Fermi Paradox seems in my mind to be getting *much* tougher
to resolve.

I would not disagree that our current state of technology may make
it extremely difficult to discover "artifacts".  But that does not
suggest an 86% level of certainty that they are not out there (at
least to me).

Robert

Subject: Red wine has 18 stimulants for CR pathway

Some 18 molecules are able to stimulate the effect of calorie restriction, one 
of the few things reliably shown to extend lifespans:

<http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&u=/nm/20030824/hl_nm/health_longlife_dc&e=1&ncid=>

"... Sinclair and his team have been looking for what he calls the Holy Grail of 
aging research: molecules that activate the enzymes that in turn influence the 
genes that regulate aging.

Now, they say, they have found those molecules.

Sinclair's team partnered with BIOMOL, a Pennsylvania company, to screen 
thousands of molecules to see which ones might activate the enzymes.

Not only did they find a group of 18 molecules that fit the bill -- resveratrol 
being just one -- but all of them came from plants and were produced in response 
to harsh environmental conditions like drought.

"We think we know why these plants make these molecules. We think it's part of 
their own defense response, and we also believe that animals and fungi that live 
on the plants can pick up on these clues," he said.

To illustrate that theory, Sinclair noted that red wines from regions with 
harsher growing conditions -- Spain, Chile, Argentina and Australia -- contain 
more resveratrol than those produced where grapes are not highly stressed or 
dehydrated."

I think this is like masturbation to reduce the risk of prostate cancer. The 
doctors' advice will be easy to follow.

And it might explain why vegetarians look so youthful and seem to live somewhat 
longer.

Since I was trying to save money, I kept my food bill to a minimum by eating  
brewer's yeast, bread, and vitamin C. .                                       


Wow! Barbara, how did you eat brewer's yeast? Did you mix it up with water to
make "brewer's mush" and spread it on the bread? I can't imagine just eating
that stuff dry.

Carried to its inevitable consequence all the land is owned by a few very     
rich people who literally can deny life to the remaining population. For an   
in-depth exploration of one way to solve this pop over to www.henrygeorge.org 
and do some reading.                                                          


Wow! Never thought I'd see tax scheme I don't find completely abhorrent. This
actually offers a handy way out for a number of dilemmas. Something to keep
in mind for a community living in an artificial environment-- a space station
or human-made island for example. In that case, whoever built the place is
really is the landlord and the government, and just charges everyone rent
directly. What tennants do on their rental property is then completely their
business, modulo a few common-sense rules embedded in their lease intended
to prevent violence/exploitation/coercion of fellow tennants and damage to
the space they are renting. To guard against abuse of power, the owner entity
could be organized as a cooperative where every tennant buys into an equal
number of shares upon moving in.

It's also interesting to think about what would happen if it was applied to
Anarchitect's contract-based plan for bootstrapping a Libertarian non-state
from within a non-Libertarian state. That plan seemed to keep struggling with
how to guarantee inalienable rights despite there being no collective property
or public employees whatsoever... if one were to add the observation that
land is qualitatively different from all other types of property, that might
simplify the whole thing and make the elaborate Free Zones unnecessary.

The Libertarian state plan I'm referring to above used to be on
http://www31.brinkster.com/anarchitect/ but it's gone now, and my
repost of it to this list has also vanished (it used to be here--
http://www.extropy.org/bbs/index.php?board=61;action=display;threadid=54105). 
If you have a mirror or an archived copy of that posting, I hope you repost
it.

Hello all,

      Some readers will see this post twice. If this 
bothers you, please accept the duplicate post as a 
challenge to improve your email filters. 



      Slashdot shows an interesting post today. The 
Distributed Library Project aims to create a group of 
people in a geographic area willing to act together as a 
library. 

Slashdot, with marginal commentary.
http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=75903&cid=0&pid=0&startat=&threshold=3&mode=thread&commentsort=0&op=Change

Distributed Library Project
http://www.thoughtcrime.org/software/dlp/index.html

      While interesting in general, I bring it to the 
lists' attention because it reminded me of an idea I had 
last year. Not everyone on the lists has good access to 
the various works listed in extropian and transhumanist 
bibliographies. Some people can't afford them; some people 
don't live near a good library. Yet others on these lists 
might have copies of interesting books gathering dust on a 
shelf. (I do.)

      Does this DLP show a good way to share books among 
our community? It seems designed for metropolitan areas, 
but I don't see any reason why one couldn't use the tool 
for larger regions. The requester might pay shipping 
costs, as with Inter-Library Loan. Obviously, it'll 
sometimes be cheaper to buy a book than ship it.

      One point of concern raised in the /. forum struck 
me. A person criticized the "eBay-style" trust metric and 
help up Advogato's method as a superior example. 

      Comments? Does interest in the ExI-WTA Lending 
Library exist? Can anyone intelligently judge the 
trust-metrics, or give pointers to methods for doing so?

If they're trying to camouflage themselves the chances are low that any
technological artifacts will be spotted, but they might well be *mottled*.

This strikes me as almost self-refuting. A system so ubiquitous would
hardly use so blunt an instrument as *destruction* of probes, when it isn't
that much harder to send us back misleading and soothing false data.

Anybody who claims that agriculture isn't as important any
more as it used to be 50 years ago should try living without
agricultural products for a year. ;)

It's not taxation that's making agriculture unprofitable.
Agriculture has all the properties of a free market that
make a farmer's life hard, and all the properties of a
regulated market that make a farmer's life hard. Companies
like Cargill make an easy profit of agriculture, buying
crop from farmers for near cost price no matter how good
or bad the harvest was.

Of course, you couldn't make agriculture a truly free
market, because then the unprofitable part of the earth's
population would no longer be able to get food!

Imagine the least profitable 0.5% of farmers or eaters
being left behind every year, like you would expect in a
truly free market.

Your last statement is undoubtedly true and is a fine example of what you
go on to say about being programmed to want to die.  However, the problem
is that the mainstream actively oppose *all* work that furthers real life
extension in the foreseeable future, on the basis that it's absurdly far
away and hence anything remotely goal-directed at this point is a waste
of money.  This is of course self-serving -- by accepting that it's time
to start doing genuinely biomedical gerontology, the researcher who does
purely curiosity-driven stuff implicitly acknowledges that their emphasis
is misplaced -- and I'm afraid that is part of why it's so hard to get
biogerontologists to actually study the relevant biotechnological fields.
(It's difficult to say that something is impossible when you've read the
literature by those who are already most of the way there, but it's easy
when you haven't and can thus maintain your illusion that any such work
that others may speak of is overblown or erroneous or whatever.)

My view, therefore, is that to a certain extent fire must be fought with
fire -- we must make such scientists uncomfortable (though in the nicest
possible way, of course).  The best way to make scientists uncomfortable
about their belief in a particular dogma is to challenge them to find a
hole in a position that contradicts that dogma.  That's why my "How you
can help" page (<http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/sens/how.htm>) says this:

   IF YOU'RE A JOURNALIST: write about my work, but most importantly of
   all please interview other mainstream biogerontologists (the more
   senior and high-profile the better) and ask them to explain why they
   don't think we'd cure aging any time soon by the approach I advocate.

I find that my colleagues' opposition to what I say is diminishing very
rapidly -- more so than I'd expected, honestly -- and I believe this is
largely because I've been saying essentially the same thing for a couple
of years now without my position being found glaringly flawed.  If other
people start saying it too, to senior gerontologists' faces, it may not
be long at all before the balance of opinion (and funding) tips sharply
in the biomedical direction.

Unfortunately, this circumvents the issue rather too thoroughly (see

You almost answered yourself here.  Since people are so overwhelmingly
fixated on the idea that making everyone live indefinitely is an awful
idea, the problem is not one of sociology, nor even philosophy, but of
psychology.  There is no appreciable prospect of making someone more
enthusiastic about life extension by describing how humanity might be
able to cope with overpopulation (or boredom, or loss of "meaning",
etc): as you point out, they can just say "but you're hoping for the
best -- it's safer not to go there in the first place".  No: what one
must do is ask them what they would do if given the choice between (a)
living for (say) the next year, but thereby (by some unspecified
mechanism) denying some unconceived person the chance to be born and
some other living person the right to procreate, or (b) giving those
people those chances, but dying in (say) the next year.  This is the
choice we will each be making, every day in one way or another, in a
post-aging world in the worst-case scenario where emigration off the
planet does not arrive (or does not appeal), birth rate fails to fall
fast enough, etc.  Thus, it is the choice we today give or deny those
who might be alive to have that choice if we develop real anti-aging
medicine as soon as we can but not if we delay.  (Those people may or
may not include some of us, of course.)  Putting the issue in these
personal terms is powerful, because the only way out of approving of
life extension while choosing (a) above (and while answering similar
questions about boredom etc similarly) is to argue that it's wrong to
give others a choice that one would take if one had it oneself, and
luckily that's a position that most educated people in the developed
world don't enjoy finding themselves taking.

Wonder how much of this reduction in the crime rate is attributable to the 
large increase in legal private gun ownership in the U.S., particularly 
legally carried guns.

Report: Crime rate lowest since 1973
Sunday, August 24, 2003 Posted: 11:53 AM EDT (1553 GMT)

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Violent and property crimes dipped in 2002 to their 
lowest levels since records started being compiled 30 years ago, and have 
dropped more than 50 percent in the last decade, the Justice Department 
reported Sunday.
The annual survey by the Bureau of Justice Statistics identified about 23 
million crime victims last year, down slightly from the year before and far 
below the 44 million recorded when studies began in 1973.
The rate of violent crimes -- rapes, robberies and assaults -- was about 23 
victims for every 1,000 U.S. residents 12 or older last year. That compares 
with 25 victims per 1,000 in 2001 and 50 in 1993.
For property crimes such as burglary and car theft, the rate was 159 crimes 
per 1,000 last year, down from 167 the previous year and 319 in 1993.
The study examined property and violent crimes except murder, which is 
measured separately by the FBI. Preliminary FBI statistics for 2002 
released in June -- based on reports from police across the country -- 
reported a 0.8 percentage point rise in the murder rate compared with 2001.
The Justice Department survey, however, found continuing decreases in every 
major property and violent crime, crossing all household income, racial and 
ethnic lines. Crime is down in cities, suburbs and rural areas.
Attorney General John Ashcroft credited citizens for being more willing to 
report crimes and said the numbers are a tribute to the work of police, 
prosecutors and judges across the country.
"But lower crime rates must not lead to complacency," Ashcroft said. "We 
must continue our vigilance and renew our firm commitment to protect all 
Americans, bringing swift and certain justice to all those who would 
inflict pain and harm."
Experts say a number of factors have driven the crime rate down, including 
a more mature, less violent illegal drug trade, a drop in gang membership 
and even improved home locks and alarms that deter would-be burglars.
Even so, the continuing drop in crime surprises some.
"Everyone thought the numbers would bottom out and then go back up, but it 
hasn't happened," said James Lynch, law professor at the American 
University Center for Justice, Law and Society.
Some criminologists think tougher prison sentences and more prisons are key 
factors, because they take more criminals off the streets longer. The 
Justice Department reported last week that at the end of 2001, more than 
5.6 million adults -- one in every 37 U.S. adults -- were either in state 
or federal prison or had done prison time during their lives.
Others say that theory is refuted by the government's own data. The Justice 
Policy Institute, a research group that favors alternatives to prison, 
pointed out that regions with higher prison expansion rates, such as the 
South and West, experienced more murders in 2002.
"We need to separate political rhetoric from sound crime and corrections 
policy," said Vincent Schiraldi, executive director of the institute.
The Justice Department figures on nonfatal crimes for 2002 are based on 
interviews of a nationally representative sample of 76,050 U.S. residents 
12 or above. The previously released FBI Uniform Crime Reports, which also 
showed an overall drop in crime in 2002, is based on crimes reported to 
state and local police nationwide.
Some highlights from the new Justice Department report:
-- From 2001 to 2002, the number of robberies fell by a remarkable 19 
percent, from 630,690 to 512,490, and is down 63 percent from 1993 to 2002.
-- Households with an annual income of $50,000 or more saw larger drops in 
property crimes than those with lower incomes from 1993 to 2002. Property 
crimes have dropped 52 percent over that span in rural and suburban areas 
and 48 percent in cities.
-- Households with annual incomes of $7,500 or less were far more likely to 
be involved in both violent and property crimes in 2002. For instance, 
there were about 52 burglaries per 1,000 households at that income level, 
compared with 32 per 1,000 for those earning between $7,500 and $14,999.
-- Men are more likely to be crime victims than women, blacks more likely 
than whites or Hispanics and people below age 24 more than those who are 
older.
-- Urban residents were victims of violent crime more often in 2002, at 33 
crimes for every 1,000 residents. That compares with 20 crimes per 1,000 
residents in the suburbs and 17 crimes per 1,000 people in rural areas.
-- Women and girls were most often victimized in 2002 by someone they knew, 
while men and boys had a greater chance of being victimized by a stranger. 
Of the female victims, 40 percent of offenders were described friends or 
acquaintances, 20 percent as intimate partners and seven percent as another 
relative.

Hello everyone,

I am desperately trying to find a "master list" of magazine distributors but with no luck.  I have found a few small ones but nothing really major.  And to top things off it appears the one small distributor we had an agreement with has dropped us.

I would ask everyone to please help me on this one.  Maybe my "googling skills" are just not up to the task, I just don't know.

thank you,

John Grigg

Interesting story. Look again at the institutional ownership of 
Microsoft.  Bill Gates managed to retain a significant amount, but not 
MORE SIGNIFICANT than Barclays which, as you probably know, is in fact 
run by the great-grand-son of a feudal lord who retains the title Lord.

And Microsoft HARDLY runs the world.  They are rent-payers

Well, this is an interesting take on it.  The original price of QDOS 
was either 50k or 75k, not sure which.  I understand that the story 
about how he acquired that money and the contract from IBM, then as now 
one of the biggest companies on the planet, is interesting and not 
officially published.

In any case, I wouldn't call 75k "NO PROPERTY" even today, certainly 
not 25 years ago.

Yes and no.  The military won't use windows because it's too crappy.  
But this doesn't mean that the Military isn't protecting Bill's 
interest.  You didn't notice the sudden shift in Microsoft's legal 
problems during the last two years compared with, say, the previous 10 
when it was being sued monthly for unfair business practices (and 
losing).  Now they might be considered the luckiest guys on the block - 
you can't use Linux for free anymore.  It's like God gave Bill a gift.

> The same could largely be said for Oracle.

You didn't notice the news about the unreviewed Oracle Contracts for 
the state of California?

You think that 3M and GE are somehow "outside" of the money nexus?

> The idea that the "rent-collectors" drive things now-a-days is absurd.

That you can point to a handful of billionaires that have shifted in 
some small way the power-structure in the short-run (Dell, Gateway, 
Microsoft, Oracle, Seibel) the long-money still controls just about 
everything.  Just because Bill Gates doesn't pay rent every month 
doesn't mean that the rest of us don't.  So that would be ONLY 
99.9999999% of people pay roughly half their money to rent-collectors.  
Is that your point?

In any case, obviously you didn't look at the institutional ownership 
list.  Here it is again for future reference.

http://www.thetip.org/snptotals.txt

Not very nicely formatted, but useful information.

The BANKS that own upwards of 40% of every company on the S&P 500 and 
control more than 70% are the rent collectors - they own both the 
companies, the underlying land, and the means of acquiring capital.  
They are protected by our government VERY WELL, better than the people 
are!  If you want to continue the metaphor to feudal times, the feudal 
lords had several kinds of knights - the warriors, the management and 
the tax collectors.  For the disney version, check out Robin Hood.

Since the advent of global capitalization (not to say Global Capital), 
the value of the management/banking people has increased, but the 
underlying threat of violence is still there, and nowadays not so 
veiled, cf. the thread on Incarceration rates in the US.

Best,

Robbie

Hi John!  - I'll check our files to see what distributors we used for
"Extropy" and send it to you.  Some may be out of business, but it will at
least give you possibilities.

I don't know much about all this, but I do know it can be hard getting
distributors to pay.

I'd be curious as to how much the expanded use of NAT in home and
small business networks is contributing to this slowdown in growth.
For example, my apartment has 6 net-connected hosts behind a single IP,
two of which are providing services to outside hosts.  Many of my friends
and professional associates have similar setups.

Note that he doesn't say his job is to bring justice to those who DO IN 
FACT inflict pain and harm, a shift of focus I'm sure we've all noticed 
recently.

Note the comparison of a derivative (the South and West have higher prison 
*expansion* rates) with the absolute number of murders, the lack of any 
data on statistical significance, and the abject confusion of correlation 
with causation.  Of course, at least some of this is probably the 
reporter's fault.

I'm not taking sides on the particular issue, just getting more and more 
annoyed with the total uselessness of all media-reported data.

The article mentions peanuts as another source, although I don't know how to
find stressed peanuts.  I think polyphenols are also in green tea.

A year ago I was heavily into _The Okinawa Program_, and its claims that
Okinawans were the only properly documented population of long-lived people,
thanks to Japan's bureaucracy.  An article I read recently -- I forget in
what, unfortunately -- listed Okinawa as yet another in a list of failed
claims (like the Caucasus.) and was claiming Sicily or Sardinia as the new
aging grail.   Does anyone know anything more definitive about this?

That was nice.  I'd worried about the reverse, that asking the
sperm-generators to divide and produce too often would cause prostate cancer.

Don't know if the articles mention this but... I've read that the "single
income family" of the 1950s was an aberration (and I'd suspect not fully
widespread anyway.)  The US had a working industrial economy, the rest of the
world was bombed out or agricultural, unions and corporations were strong,
manufacturing jobs were common and paid a lot (vs. manufacturing jobs in the
19th century, say.)  But the historical norm is for both parents to work.

Which is the other thing: housewives weren't idle, except in the 1950s, or in
the upper classes.  (And often not even there, depending on the upper class.)
Women's (and children's) helped support the home.  But these days, a person
staying at home in urban areas doesn't have much to do to economically support
the home.  There's cleaning and maintenance, but nothing really in
food/energy/clothing/income production.  To support the family as normal the
wife has to go get a job... but then you lose the benefit of relatively easily
taking care of the children.  Thus day care and second car expenses, and the
mother has to bring in not just her share of the income but extra income to
replace the 'free' benefits from working at home.

Yes, this latest news really seems to fit well into what has come before.  
Can't wait to see these compounds down at Walmart. 

ALso, did anyone see teh article about the Aussie boffins who worked out a 
way to include omega 3 fatties into bread loaves?  I was going to post that, 
but forgot.

Well, I am now off to drink some red wine, eat stressed peanuts, and peruse 
some porn....

I strongly suggest you try being a stay-at-home parent for a little while 
before suggesting how easy and unproductive it is.  Clothing doesn't just 
come into the house by magic, neither does food.   Childcare including 
carting the children (and often their friends) around isn't exactly a 
zero-time task either.   In the 50s housewives were most certainly NOT idle.  
I watched my mother pretty closely growing up.  She was quite busy from 
before we got up until we went to bed.    Of course there were 5 of us.  But 
larger families weren't so uncommon then either.

I found this paper to be very disappointing - it quoted a bunch
of things and reviewed standard issues, and then just ended.
It didn't defend any interesting claims as far as I could tell.

The problem with things like this is, they assume data
that's mostly been false, but is hard to disprove.

For instance, stating that economically viable natural
gas deposits are mostly exhausted: such a claim has
been made before, yet new discoveries opened up - and
a slight increase in profit (higher price from
scarcity, lower cost from new tech, take your pick)
made more discoveries viable.  But how does someone
not in the oil industry (and thus suspect to having
made-up data themselves) disprove this?

Or more simply: bluntly stating that wind and solar
can not, under any conditions, "replace even a portion
of hydrocarbon energy" - despite the fact that they
quite evidently have provided power that, had these
technologies never been invented, would come from
other sources, presumably including hydrocarbon
energy.

I don't know how many times I've seen this argument
before.  I don't know how many times I'll see it
again.

Still, there are some truths here, especially the bit
about transmission capability not being built.  Which
just argues more for home-ready sources of power, like
solar cells, that can be installed where the power
will be used.  (This can be in development, tax
credits, or other things that lessen the cost to the
end user.)  One of my 2050ish pipe dreams is for
helium-3 fusion, made possible in part by lunar
mining, to become economical for home use: a
completely automated fusion reactor capable of
powering a standard home, no larger or costlier than a
standard refrigerator, with enough fuel to last
several years between servicing.

If you search google for "resveratrol" you'll see that many companies are 
already selling it. I don't know how pure it is or whether it's absorbed. I 
did read that there's questions about it's effect on the liver (see 
http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/DSH/resveratrol.html). 
Another article on this discovery, a little more detailed 
(http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2003/08/25/in_lab_seeking_secret_of_youth/) 
says "in a surprising finding, the lowest concentration of the chemical 
appeared to afford the most protection, leading Sinclair to conclude that 
while a little resveratrol might be a very good thing, too much might be 
harmful.", and "Sirtuin deactivates a gene that suppresses tumors, fueling 
concerns that heightening the enzyme's activity might predispose humans to 
cancer".
So, I'd wait a few years until optimal dosage is worked out before you start 
taking it in any form other then wine.

I think he meant a significant portion. I don't know enough to comment on
this.

Nice pipe dream!

The biggest hole I always see in energy network setups is the lack of
facility for efficient storage of power generated in non-peak periods. I
suspect that's because no such facility exists. Imagine if it did, though...
solar power, for instance, becomes far more viable if you can actually store
it usefully for use during the night.

Why is storage of electricity so difficult? We seem to be plagued by it,
from the small scale (mobile devices, implants, always limited by cruddy
power storage capabilities), through to the large scale (no way to store
large amounts of power for when it is needed). 

I found some nice info about Flywheel energy storage here...
http://rpm2.8k.com/basics.htm
and here
http://www.asi.org/adb/04/03/03/flywheel-energy-storage.html

It leaves me wondering about massive flywheel arrays the size of
conventional power plants, run up to speed off peak, and drawn from during
peak times. Is this an entirely impractical notion? I imagine the tensile
strength at the rim would have to be phenomenal for a fast spinning 3
story-high flywheel. Also, imagine one of those babies breaking loose!

...The problem with things like this is, they assume data
that's mostly been false, but is hard to disprove...


I second that, Adrian.


...For instance, stating that economically viable natural
gas deposits are mostly exhausted...


Of course, as prices go up, economically viable sources
magically appear.  I grow so very weary of the nattering
nabobs of negativity.  A hydrocarbon shortage
would not stop economic growth, it would stimulate it.
In the U.S. and much of Europe, manufacturing is 
outsourced to cheaper places, and now we are outsourcing
software as quickly as we can write specifications.
Much of our "industry" is involved in redistributing the
wealth already created instead of creating more, examples
being the lawsuit industry and the real estate industry.

If we had an industry which creates wealth and cannot
be outsourced, such as blanketing the west with
solar cells, windmills and the infrastructure to
distribute all that free clean power, the economy 
would be stimulated to the verge of orgasm.  



...Or more simply: bluntly stating that wind and solar
can not, under any conditions, "replace even a portion
of hydrocarbon energy" - despite the fact that they
quite evidently have provided power that, had these technologies never
been invented, would come from other sources, presumably including
hydrocarbon energy.
I don't know how many times I've seen this argument
before.  I don't know how many times I'll see it
again...



To state that wind power cannot replace hydrocarbon 
burning is simply absurd.  We really can do it all with 
renewables: wind, water and sun.  Sure it would require 
a lot of costly infrastructure, but that is the beauty 
of capitalism: it gets things done.  Right now, so much
of our capital is idle, doing nothing but bidding up
the prices of each other's homes to absurd levels, such
as those seen in the Sillyclone Valley.  Let's cut that
nonsense and build something!


...Still, there are some truths here, especially the bit
about transmission capability not being built...


So lets build it.  The only thing holding this
world back is that there is still way too much
oil, coal and gas in the ground that needs to
be burned up.  spike

If resveratrol is #1 what are the other 17?
Perhaps quercetin, several tannins, anthocyanins, polyphenols, organometallic

Well, we can drive them on electricity produced by a variety of processes 
including wind, solar, biomass, SPS, nuclear... whatever.

I agree that wind and solar (at least at earth's surface before the advent of 
nanomaterial covering quite a bit of everything), isn't going to replace 
gas/petroleum.  But taking advantage of some of all available ways to crack 
out hydrogen and/or produce electricity and going to electric or fuel cell 
transporation is certainly doable and not horrifically expensive to gear up 
to.    If we count all the cost of our oil, including entanglements in nasty 
and costly messes, a percentage of the cost of fighting and cleaning up after 
terrorism and so on, the costs for our current choices is a good bit higher 
than what we pay at the pump.    Where is the profit in $40 billion 
dollars/month poured into the sands of Iraq?    How much more profit will be 
poured out when Saudi Arabia blows up in our faces?    As I see it, we cannot 
afford to depend on oil any longer for so much of our power needs.

Yeah.  Some of these are certainly worthwhile.

Oil is too bloody useful to simply burn for power even if you could stop being 
dependent on very politically messy MidEast sources.

Well, I've looked forward for awhile to paying off the Pontiac Grand Prix.  It 
gets an average 24.9 mpg.  Not terrible but I am seriously considering 
trading it in for a hybrid like the Prius.

Which reminds me of another point.  Synthetic oil is,
what, less than ten times as expensive as the real
thing?  Even if all the natural oil were to go
away...

Yeah, true, oil would then become a "secondary energy
medium" like hydrogen.  But some of the oil
manufacturing processes do involve primary capture of
energy, using natural solar technology
(photosynthesis); therefore, this would essentially be
a spur to wider-spread deployment of solar.

Probably easier to start by blanketing the cities,
western or otherwise.  Not as much need for
infrastructure until you've tapped out that vein.

Though, keep in mind that the actual blanketing can be
outsourced: cells can be manufactured overseas and
installed by imported labor.  But once it's
installed...

I resemble that remark.  You don't happen to be
running for governor, do you?  ^_^;

(I wonder if someone will seriously suggest this to
one of the leading candidates.  Fund it by tax credits
towards the installation of solar: most of the money
would come out of the energy companies' pockets, in
the form of lowered utility bills if nothing else,
and/or out of those we'd export solar cells to.)

Too much *cheaply accessible* oil, coal, and gas, thus
driving the cost of energy down.  But, yeah.  (Irony:
I was just discussing with a friend his fictional
alt-verse where the Tesla Generator actually worked,
producing essentially unlimited super-cheap
electricity starting just before 1900.)

You're right about the way things are right now,
including current prices.  If oil, gas, and coal were
not so cheap relative to renewable sources, then
renewable sources would be far more popular.

There are two obvious ways to address this: raise the
price of fossil fuels, or lower the price of
renewables.  Raising the price has its merits, and a
mass consumption of the cheap supply (thus naturally
raising prices) is already underway, but this results
in release of large volumes of environmentally less
than beneficial gases.  Plus, the rate does not seem
able to keep up with advancing technology, and
attempts to deliberately drastically increase the
consumption rate without getting useful work out of
the fuel, such as conducted a bit over a decade ago in
Kuwait, are extremely unpopular (for good reason).

Which leaves us with options for making renewables
much cheaper much faster.  The price of renewables is
falling relative to non-renewables, but if one were
inclined to devote one's working efforts towards this,
the solar panel manufacturing and installing business
is not the bleakest industry in the world right now,
especially after the northeastern US's recent
blackout.  More competition means cheaper prices
faster.  There are other ways, of course, including
such small efforts as merely purchasing solar power
oneself.  (Half of my roof has solar panels, which -
with a few other measures that were going to happen
regardless - cut my house's power bill from $400/month
to about $4/month.  I'd have to check the numbers, but
it is possible the system may have paid for itself
already; we had it installed a few months after
California's blackouts.)

With sufficiently large amounts of sufficiently cheap
electricity, one could economically desalinate ocean
water, then crack hydrogen from that; even today's
fuel cells would, with a good hydrogen distribution
network (which would be much easier to deploy with an
ultra-cheap hydrogen source), be able to at least
equal gasoline engines for most consumer purposes.

Note that just being able to economically desalinate
ocean water would be a revolution in itself.  The cost
of the vast amounts of electricity consumed by modern
facilities is the main (maybe sole) economic
impracticality of desalination today.  In certain
regions of the world in a decade or two, fresh water
is expected to be what oil is in most of the
industrialized world today.

Think theoretical.  He didn't give limitations.
Theoretically, it's possible to replace it all, and
all is a significant portion.  Practically...well, it
mainly delves down to factors of economics, but it's
not impossible per se.

<raises hand>  About half the cost of my solar

3-hour blackouts we were experiencing.

Not really, but the power generation companies have
thus far found it more economical to simply build
additional generation capacity.  That may be simply
because they are more experienced at power generation,
though.  A power storage facility would seem to be
pretty darn simple to operate, and to make a profit
from in variable-rate situations: buy power when
there's a lot of it (so it's cheap), sell power when
it's needed (so it's not so cheap).  I wonder what the
rate of return on capital investment would be?  I also
wonder what the ultimate limit would be (on a given
day, one likely could not sell more than the
difference between minimum and maximum energy usage),
and if this alone would make such storage economically
unviable.

So build banks and banks of smaller ones.  Safer,
cheaper to get started with, easier to expand capacity
as money allows.

No it isn't, I've done the math.  With respect to solar power

For "natural" gas deposits (within the North American continent)
his statements may be accurate.  But as Greg has pointed out this
just creates an opportunity for LPG tankers.

Spike, without being able to fully determine the negative impacts
of things like increased forest fires, potential for negative
agricultural impacts (esp. in the midwest), etc. you CAN NOT
assert that the decline of hydrocarbons, or more importantly
the associated increase in atmospheric CO2 as we consume them
and the probable global warming as a result, would stimulate economic
growth!  Down in CA the news may not be providing coverage as
we here in Washington watch parts of British Columbia burnt
to the ground (and it nearly happened to parts of a city nearby
to Seattle as well).  Unpredicted consequences in complex systems
*are* a reality.

You just don't have sufficient information for a model at this
time that would allow you to make such a strong claim.

Hardly spike.  The U.S. is mostly a service economy at this time.
That requires less infrastructure and more "trained minds".
Training such minds is not something one does "overnight".

The argument (made by the interviewee, not Spike) is *wrong*, just plain
flat out wrong.  I've done the math.  And it doesn't have to require "costly
infrastructure".  It can be done with low technology solar ponds that produce
methane on some large fraction of the "rangeland" in the U.S. southwest.

> ...Still, there are some truths here, especially the bit

This much I agree with -- there should be a long term project to build
up infrastructure such as high-temp superconductor energy storage and
transmission capacity.  It would be a wise move to adjust the regulatory
structure to support that.  Its just like building up the national highway
system in the U.S. in the '50s and '60s.

Unfortunately I have to agree now when I read more than the abstract 
(bad form of me to suggest papers before reading them in their 
entirety. Bayesian priors updated).

I think it is an important paper anyway, since it acts to make the 
astrobiology community more awareness of the postbiological 
possibilities. As Robert has pointed out, that is a very hard sell 
right now. 

I guess the proper response to a disappointing paper is to write a 
better one.

i read, so i tested:

"radius of the earth / c" tells me "radius of Earth / the speed of light
= 21.2750516 milliseconds"
and then I try:
"G * mass of the earth / radius of the earth squared"  gives me
"(gravitational constant * mass of Earth) / (radius of Earth squared) =

I'm inclined to think that your analogy here is a bit strained: for one
thing partially electric cars could solve some of the problems whereas it is
a little difficult to doing anything with a partial decent fusion reaction
system. For example, estimates from
http://www.e2i.org/docs/Plug-in_Hybrid.pdf suggest that a "plug-in" hybrid
vehicle would help reduce dependence on oil. The idea is that the batteries
would get you about 40 miles before they need to be recharged, so if you
need to go further than 40 miles the gasoline engine kicks in. Otherwise you
plug the car in and recharge the batteries. Most people take short trips
most of the time. Of course you still need to generate electricity somehow,
but the point is that it could be done by any number of generating
techniques, as Emlyn rightly points out. (Some European countries are now up
in the 20% range of electricity generated from wind.) I'm no engineer (as I
am about to prove) but I'm not sure why you couldn't make an electric
vehicle where at least some of the batteries pop out and are replaced by
charged batteries. Suppose for example when you bought your car you leased
your batteries from some company, say Exxon. (Gotta have something for the
poor multinational to do). A decent electric vehicle will get about 100
miles on a charge. Suppose on those occasions where you need to travel more
than 100 miles you could pull into an Exxon station and a little robot would
pull out your spent batteries and replace them with charged ones. Even if
only half the batteries could be pulled out in this manner this would still
give you an additional 50 miles. Since you are leasing the batteries from
Exxon they will be pleased to switch out the batteries and recharge them for
the next customer. Of course they will charge you extra for this service.
Obviously this would be inconvenient for long road trips--stopping every 50
miles for a battery change. In this case I suppose one would rent a trailer
that runs on fossil fuels and turns an electric generator to power the car.
In these rare times that I travel more than 100 miles in one shot this would
definitely not be as convenient. But this is at most maybe 6 times a year.
As it is now, I've got to make a weekly stop at the gas station, so this
setup would definitely be more convenient. I'd love to come home and simply
plug-in.

I think it may be important to note that Steven Dick has expertise
focused in the historic aspects of SETI research.  So I would not
expect to see much in the way of novel proposals.  The interesting
part of the paper is to see transhumanist ideas, e.g. citations of
Brin, Moravec, Kurzweil, etc. slowly creeping into SETI thinking.

He doesn't point out the work by Lineweaver regarding the probability
that most "Earths" are older than ours or consider the relationship
to transhumanism, but past and forthcoming work by Cirkovic and some
of the work by Bostrom has/will deal with those oversights.

The value of the paper is that it is getting to goals 5, 6 & 7 of
the astrobiology roadmap [1] which is of high interest to most
extropians.  (Interestingly, Steven Dick is, I believe, partially
responsible for defining the roadmap -- so he has some throw weight
within the community.)

Holy f***ing s**t!  I didn't believe this at first so I actually
tried it.  Alejandro is right.  It even does conversions, e.g.
  "J to ergs"
This probably effectively replaces the very old UNIX "units" program.

It doesn't do "time to dismantle the earth" (which is in my paper
on planetary disassembly) but one can't have everything (at least
not yet...)

wow! I thought you were joking, so I tried it. I Tried mach1.6 and got "mach
1.6 = 544.46400 m / s"

I tried "c^2="
and got "the speed of light^2 = 8.987 551 79 × 1016 m2 / s2"

Then I thought I would get silly and punch in some totally useless numbers.
I tried the following:
"pi*c^2/g=" just for kicks. It returned:
(pi * (the speed of light^2)) / gram = 2.82352267 × 1020 m2 kg-1 s-2

Finally I tried "75 fahrenheit=" and it returned "75 degrees Fahrenheit =
23.8888889 degrees Celsius"

Wow! That's all I can say!

One researcher (can't recall the name right now) attributes, at least in
part, the lower crime rates to legalized abortion. Having children you want
to have might imply better adjusted adults later on.

Makes sense to me.

----------------------

The question to ask is how many 18 to 25 year old people are 
unemployed.  The crime rate is directly related to the size of this 
population.  When young men are employed crime goes down.  When young men 
have no jobs crime goes up.  When the 18 to 25 year old population drops 
because of how much sex people had a few years back crime goes down.  These 
drops and rises are really not a mystery.

Jim R Feliciano

----------------------

Probably little or none at all. It's one of the Great Myths of the gun nut 
faction that your average criminal spends a lot of time worrying about 
whether his intended victim might be packing heat.

Dunno if it still exists, but there used to be a famous cop bar not too far 
from LAPD main headquarters. It was run by a retired cop, it's where 
virtually all the patrons were off-duty (or even ON-duty) cops. It had a 
cop bar name, something like "Code 40" or whatever, it had cop car lights 
and police department patches decorating the interior. It was *really 
obviously* a COP BAR.

And yet, one, two times a year, some jagoff would burst in waving a 
fearsome weapon like a 4-shot .22 pistol and yell, "this is a stickup!"

Dave Palmer

---------------------

There's a gun store here in town with an indoor pistol range.

Let's be clear about this...it's a gun store.  The employees are armed (they
openly carry handguns in belt holsters).  They are, at any given time within
arms reach of several handguns and/or rifles and/or shotguns, plus boxes of
ammunition.  At any given time, there's an unknown--possibly as high as
10--number of customers in the store, WITH LOADED WEAPONS IN THEIR HANDS,
firing them at targets.  Some of these people are no doubt daydreaming about
plugging some burglar or gang member or something as they do so.

And this place has been robbed at least twice in the last 10 years, both
times resulting in the robber being killed.

I'm tempted to believe that people who try to rob cop bars or pistol ranges
during business hours have simply got to be trying to kill themselves...but
then I'm reminded how colossally dumb many criminals really are...

Kevin

----------------------

My first day in law school my civil procedure teacher, Jon Waltz, spent 
half the first lecture period in civ pro class telling us "war stories" of 
his times as a practicing lawyer (probably to impress us that he was "cool" 
or something), and  as a part of that presentation he imparted a piece of 
wisdom that has remained with me years after my legal career ended:

"Criminals are stupid. That's why they get caught."

Len Cleavelin

----------------------

They didn't teach that in law school, I had to learn that from experience.

It is, in a way, unfortunate, but my experience of cops in law practice was 
such that were a cop to tell me right now that the sun is shining (it is, 
FWIW) I wouldn't believe him until I looked out the window and verified it. 
As you might imagine, that made life interesting when I married my second 
ex-wife and thereby picked up two cops as brothers-in-law.

A better answer is that the population is aging.  The late teens-early 
twenties are always the high crime years.  As a smaller fraction of the 
population is in that age brackett, the amount of actual crime diminishes.

I also have a question as to the techniques for measurement, but such 
quibbles aren't needed when placed against the population ages.

If one were to take that mythos seriously, then this
answer has been well and thoroughly transmitted into
space already - if not literally this answer, then a
likely equivalent somewhere in the musings and
ramblings of 'Net dialogue that have been
transmitted.  (If nothing else, in little bits
leaking past the satellites the data streams were
relayed through.)

Which would mean humanity has served its purpose, and
is free to do what it wants, at least until its
resources are needed for something else.  One could
take that as a reward, or simply a statement that
it's not worth the bother to blow up the Earth just
yet.  Regardless, it's an excuse to muse on, "So
humanity had a mission.  That mission is complete,
and there are no more missions.  Now what do we do?"

There are means being developed.  They do not become
economically viable with zero starting investment,
but it has been argued that with varying non-zero
starting investments, they can become economically
viable enough to recover at least the monetary
portion of said investments.

Economic viability does not depend purely on the
technology available, but also on the infrastructure.

### I liked your exposition and of course I have no substantive
disagreements with you, but, to act as the advocatus diavoli:

Points 8 and 9 rely on a somewhat idiosyncratic definition of genocide -
"killing a lot of people of a particular race". This is more properly
characterized as mass murder. Genocide, especially as used by thinkers with
a collectivist bent, is an attempt to eradicate a nation, race or culture.
"Genus" is Latin for "race" or "kin", so for a collectivist, genocide is
more than just killing a lot of people - it is killing a superhuman entity,
and therefore worse than just killing humans. What's more, a nation denied
access to techniques of rejuvenation will not die, and some might even claim
that the attrition of its constituent parts is necessary for progress, akin
to shedding of human enteric epithelial cells.

Such quibbles can be used by a wily opponent to advance his position against
the transhumanist, perhaps under the pretext of "saving the spirit of the
society", or similar gobbledygook. It might be better to stick to the
simpler argument - killing a lot of people by denying them rejuvenation
treatment they want and can afford, is mass murder, and as such prima facie
bad, even if not genocidal.

I think the rate of crime among teenagers has also been dropping, though,
which is indepenent of the age fraction*.  Don't know about the twenties.

* Except that there are more adults per teens, now.  So they're getting more
care?

The standard keyphrase for this is "distribution
system".  Put simply: how do you get those stations
set up in the first place?  (Yes, there are gas
stations now, but how do you pay for refitting those
with the robots you mention prior to enough people
having these cars to make it economically viable?  A
chicken-and-the-egg type problem.)

Much the same problem faces hydrogen-powered fuel
cells, which have much the same characteristics as
batteries (at least as matters to cars: fuel cells
breathe air, but this matters not in this
application; they exhaust water vapor instead of
nothing, but this also makes no diff to cars) except
they have higher power storage densities (thus
allowing longer trips between refuelling).

Having operated an EV1 before they were scrapped, I
can tell you that your dream - in this regard - is
right-on.  Granted, I had to plug in every few nights
(battery range over 100 miles, daily round-trip
commute under 50) or I'd be out of fuel, but it was
an easy habit to get in to.  (I still remember a
friend's joke about the power meter: an 11-bar gauge
showing how full the battery was.  "Bars of power"
sounded a little like I was powering it with cocaine
or similar, but what else could one call it, simply
enough for daily usage?)

One of the problems was, most people apparently did
(still do) much more than 100 miles of driving per
day, and in many cases, the only practical place to
plug in was at home.  There were other chargers, but
not even 10% - probably not even 1% - as many per
unit area as gas stations, and charging was a slow
enough process that it really had to be at some place
you were going to be at for several hours - which
usually meant work or home.  Battery swapping robots
would have solved the latter part of that, but then
you get into liability issues if a broken battery
gets swapped in which doesn't fail until you're 10
miles from civilization and 40 miles from a charger.

I read somewhere a few years ago about a guy that came up with an electric
vehicle design augmented by a flywheel engine. This design was supposed to
keep the same power available for quick, high-power takeoffs since the
flywheel was always running.

Does anyone remember reading baout this? I think it was Discover magazine.
What ever happened to that? It seemed at the time to be the solution to the
problem of electric cars ebeing under-powered.

Personally, I have always had a "hunch" (nothing substantial to back me up)
that crime rates are simply another "fashion" item.
For a time, being a "bad-ass" is popular among the youts of America. Then as
the next generation grows to replace them, it becomes unfashionable. The
next group to grow up sees them as a bunch of pansies and crime rates go up
again. I'm sure that if you dig deep enough you can find a correlation
between a type of clothing such as t-shirts, blue-jeans etc. or something
else and crime.
No doubt some politician will find this and claim that that item "causes"
crime, and when the next reduction comes along, the party in power will
claim that it was the result of their policies and use that as a basis for
re-election.

Unfortunately, there is no way to actually chart this. My "hunch" also says
that crime reporting also varies from generatin to generation. When a couple
of boys spray-painted a garage or got into a fight, many years ago, it may
have never been reported simply because
the grown-ups (grups) would have thought of it as "boys being boys" and
handle the problem personally by contacting the parents, wheras now, someone
would promptly call the police to handle it.

Any opinions on my "hunch"?

There is *more* than enough energy stored in plutonium

At the same time one must consider that we may not get to

This is important to keep in mind -- both from a production
standpoint and a cleanup standpoint.  One wants a total
cost solution.

Just so you know the numbers (read em and weep (perhaps)).

In terms of Enriched Uranium, the U.S. has 645 *tons*
while Russia has 1,050 tons.  In terms of plutonium
(which can create smaller bombs), the U.S. has 100 tons
while Russia has 160 tons.  According to my calculations
that translates into a potential for 194,000+ nuclear weapons.

Please note that I am talking *tons*, while when one talks
nuclear weapons sizes one talks the vicinity of dozens (or less)
of "pounds" or "kg".

The material is not allocated in a "maximal number of weapons"
pattern. (e.g. minimal weapon yield per quantity of weapons class
material -- so the probable number of weapons is lower due to
the desire to produce weapons of greater destructive power).
Also, much of the material is probably in storage as weapons are
dismantled.  But make no mistake -- we (the U.S. and the Russians)
have significant capability to set humanity back for dozens to
hundreds of years should "something" happen -- perhaps long
enough to allow an asteroid or a gamma ray burst to wipe out
humanity entirely.

According to:

http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Answer_to_Life,_the_Universe,_and_Everything

humanity's purpose wasn't to find the answer, but instead to discover
the question that had been lost and forgotten.

Of course, as Douglas Adams points out, we never achieve the goal.
That's in line with humanity as I see it ... ;-)

I agree this is a problem, but it is a political problem not a technical
problem as was  the suggestion in the original post. Given the extant
political economy, I would favor some heavy tax brakes to help the
bootstrapping problem and let the market work out the details. Of course, I
imagine that there would be less of a need for such battery stations as
compared with gas stations, since most refueling would take place at home or
work. In this way, the infra structure heavily favors batteries over
fuel-cells.

I was under the impression that many of the ev1's (the lead acid ones) had a
110 charge option, which would mean you could plug in anywhere with outlet
where you could borrow a few amps? No?

Agreed.  But just because it's a political (and
economic) problem doesn't mean it's an easy one to
solve.

Yeah, that's one common solution.  Problem: where
does the money to pay for this come from?

Related example: if you could suggest a way for
California to fund more solar power production, in a
way likely to bring higher tax revenues within one
year (*maybe* two), there are a hundred-odd people
over here who might like to co-opt your idea for
actual use (and for furthering their bids).  One
possibility: make the power companies pay for any
and all excess generation that homes actually do
(possibly up to some limit: homes are homes, not -
primarily - power generation substations), but tax
said revenues.  Then, put tax breaks on installing
solar such that solar panels become a reasonable
investment.  The ultimate source of money?  Power
exported to other states.  Problem: would the tax
breaks actually tax away more money themselves, than
would be generated as revenue in the short term?
(Political calculations unfortunately don't always
allow for long-term considerations.)

I see what I wish for, and I strive to achieve it
where I can.

Besides, I just happened to need a new car about the
time the second generation came out.  ^_-

Yes, but that was the first generation - max range
around 60 miles.  Much less usable.  Generation two
could not accept the 110 charge option, in exchange
for roughly double range.

It was useful for moment-to-moment energy storage, but
the real problem of electrics was overall power
storage.  Commercially available flywheels can't
store that much more power than batteries at the
moment - though I emphasize *commercially available*.
There are promising solutions in the lab, but if you
can't get your hands on one - even if you're a car
manufacturing megacorp - you can't use it in your
products.  (Perhaps better: if you can't get bulk
orders of them delivered to your factories...)

It's good not to get too deeply involved in reality and the meaning of  
life and death, because you might discover that what you want is not  
physical immortality at all.

Cf. Reasons and Persons, Derek Parfit
http://search.barnesandnoble.com/textbooks/booksearch/ 
isbninquiry.asp?isbn=019824908X

Parfit isn't a True Believer but he still gives good reasons, for  
instance, not to always do whatever you believe to be rationally best  
for yourself.  Even though those things might sound "prima facie" good,  
it's not clear that they are.  Parfit isn't a sophist.  This would  
include things like preventing potential genocides and your own death.

But you may have a moral imperative to die.  It may be the best  
possible thing you could do - to actually be brave.  There certainly  
are prima facie obvious cases where bravery would demand self-sacrifice  
and if one took bravery to be among the highest of human moral  
abilities, then one would think that making a world in which people  
could be brave would be a high moral priority for people who are trying  
to decide whether to make a world in which people live forever or in  
which they die.

If you think it's sophistry, try to rewrite human morality without  
bravery and say genuinely to yourself that you want to want THAT.

Best,

Robbie

The Cryonics Institute has been ordered by to stop freezing bodies.

State orders Cryonics Institute to stop freezing bodies
Associated Press

LANSING, Mich. - The state on Tuesday ordered a company to stop freezing 
bodies after media reports surrounding the death of baseball legend Ted 
Williams alerted regulators that the practice was taking place in Michigan.

Considered a founding father of cryonics, Robert Ettinger has proclaimed the 
possibility of freezing and unfreezing people to extend their lives. He is 
president of the Cryonics Institute in Macomb County's Clinton Township 
north of Detroit.

But an investigation by the state's Department of Consumer and Industry 
Services found that the Cryonics Institute, which has frozen both people and 
pets, is operating an unlicensed mortuary science establishment and a 
non-registered cemetery.

"We are extremely concerned that people from around the world have invested 
their trust and finances into this facility to preserve their bodies for 
eternity, yet this facility continues to knowingly operate outside the scope 
of the law," CIS Director David Hollister said in a statement.

David Ettinger, Robert Ettinger's son and a lawyer for Cryonics Institute, 
said the state's action is without merit and the company plans to fight the 
order.

"What we do is not what a mortuary does and not what a cemetery does," he 
said. "We've been doing it openly in the state of Michigan for nearly 30 
years."

Cryonics is the practice of freezing corpses in liquid nitrogen in the hopes 
that future technological and medical advances will allow for a second shot 
at life. The state has ordered the company to preserve the bodies in its 
care but accept no new ones.

In Scottsdale, Ariz., at what could be one of the only other cryonics labs 
in the United States, the body of Ted Williams reportedly is waiting as his 
children squabble over his body. The case has been publicized by Sports 
Illustrated.

Robert Ettinger opened the nonprofit institute in 1976 with two founding 
members who are now frozen in the lab's storage area. The first patient, in 
1977, was Robert Ettinger's mother, Rhea. The next was his first wife, 
Elaine. His second wife, Mae, also was frozen.

With apologies...

Fly me to the Moon,
And let us build a ship to Mars.
Let me see what spring is like,
When from weather we're afar.
In other words, leave this land.
In other words, set us free.

What was that old saying?  "The best way to predict

while, and perhaps most people of Earth won't get to
go up, but you said "we", which includes a number of
people crazy enough to do just that.  ^_-

Can we put that stuff into nuclear power plants and do something useful with
it?

I think that's an opportunity, maybe, not a problem. To make pure electric
cars, one might want to go via hybrids, and get small infrastructure going
for battery swapping by partnering with someone who already has distribution
sites. It could be any company with lots of drive in locations, not just
petrol stations. eg: Supermarkets (trolley boys swap your batteries??),
macdonalds?? I'm sure there's a lateral solution there somewhere.

The point is, distribution is doable, if you can convince someone with a
close enough distribution network to buy in to your electric car
architecture (or at least into supporting some lead-acid battery standard).
Probably you need a car maker, distribution network partnership, to push
these things. Appropriately architected hybrids might let you move slowly,
with opportunity to pull back if it looks like being a flop.

That's because you need units at that point. Try:

(planck's constant * c / pi ^ 2 * G) + 0.0000000000000000000000000000000001
m^6/s^4

Well, that's no wonder.  2 is a dimensionless quantity and what's inside 
the parentheses is not.

Google quite satisfyingly handles:
(electric constant * magnetic constant * c squared) + 2

names and addresses of people to write letters to in the Michigan state
apparatus? Suggestions on the form of those letters is also taken
gratefully. This sort of political grandstanding and interference always

In what terms?  Some of the fasters dragsters on the planet are all-electric.   
The limiting factors here are not in the fact that it is electric per se.    
In many measures of performance an electric is quite competitive.  And dig 
those maintenance cost differences!   100 years ago we did not have the 
knowledge to even produce dependable electricity or even have electricity in 
many parts of the country.   Battery technology is an important aspect of 
electrics.  Battery technology did not do much new until relatively recently.  
Light weight materials are also a plus.   It is hardly a worthwhile argument 
among extropians to put down something just because it hasn't already been 
done!

Sigh.  I wish analogies would be banned.  An electric car is orders of 
magnitude simpler.    We are literally down to engineering problems and fine 
tuning and, of course, building the infrastructure for fast charging of 
electrics.   For personal transportation at least there is nothing I know of 
that makes an electric unviable.

In what way is it anywhere near as difficult as getting a working fusion 
reactor though?

We are to some extent -- e.g. converting HEU to LEU.  See [1].

Here's a weird idea...

Could you create a corporation for the purposes of making such a market
legal? All people  who want to trade or see information become part of the
corporation in some way, and the entire thing becomes internal. You could
join people up online, so that it'd behave exactly as though it was public
access, but everyone who ever accessed it would become, technically, an
employee or shareholder or something, on first access.

There are particular causes that are more important to me than avoiding death.

Putting off or not pursuing the ability of people to live forever because one 
is afraid of losing a certain type of physical bravery in the face of death 
is ridiculous.   One can still be brave in a world where the default is to 
live indefinitely long.  There are many, many forms of bravery, most of which 
are much preferable to charging into certain death for the 
physical/emotional/adrenalized/solemn glory of it all.   Just because one has 
the means to live forever doesn't mean that nothing can come up where one's 
more or less infinite life is forfeit to an important enough value.  

I submit it takes a bravery of high order to step beyond the deathist thinking 
and all that proceeds from it and actually seek and end to mandatory aging 
and death and actually seek out and live all the internal and external 
changes necessary to make it real.  It takes a high order of bravery to face 
life and continued responsibility, creativity, and living of it indefinitely.

Your argument is spurious for the above reasons, because bravery is orthogonal 
to immortality and because bravery is not even a primary human virtue.   I 
would be quite happy to rewrite human morality to remove many of the inane 
things we call brave which are actually adrenalized mass stupidity.

Mass letter writing and protest against the State telling citizens how they 
wish their bodies (not necessarily corpses) treated on their supposed demise. 
Beyond that, tell the State to go jump in whatever way we can in order to 
practice a freedom the State has no rational right to deny us.

How much electrical, motive and so on power does this much fissionable 
material translate to, roughly, given current reactor and space engine 
designs whether those designs are in production at this time or not?  I have 
a hard time sinking my teeth into the peaceful possibilities of such tonnage.

What's the speed and range on that thing?  I've always
like the idea of the bicycle as an electric vehicle. 
It's the minimalist/leanest solution to the motorized
transport formula because of the way that chassis
weight, cabin weight, battery weight, engine weight,
and passenger weight all feed back into one another
making rapid rate of weight increase a problem with
individual motorized passenger transport.  The range
dependence on heavy batteries is a killer. 

I would expect very high numbers for the efficiency of
an eletric bike, miles per kilowatt hr.  I'd be
curious to see the numbers for an upright electric
bike, fully fared, and for comparison the same numbers
for a recumbent.

Imagine trying to do this trick to let people bet on football games, and
that thousands of people join up.  Prosecutors would jump all over you and
claim that you were just trying to let people escape ordinary gambling laws.
And they would win.  Because that is how our law works - it is *not* a set
of clear technical rules so that if you meet the rules you escape punishment.
It is a bunch of fuzzy general principles that give people excuses to punish
those who do stuff they don't like.  If it smells to an ordinary person like
morally-repugnant gambling, then it's illegal.   Welcome to democracy.

I've been trying to work that out Samantha -- the best number I've been able
to come up with thus far is that 1 ton of U-235 (which varies from a few
percent in natural uranium, to perhaps 60-70% in highly enriched uranium,
e.g. weapons grade) translates into about 1 Giga-watt-year in current reactors.

I do *not* know how accurate that figure might be.  But given figures I've
seen regarding natural energy reserves of uranium, I suspect they exceed
those that would be provided by coal (and would certainly exceed oil
and natural gas).

The recent History Channel program about the path to the moon landings,
Failure is Not an Option was really awesome IMO. Did anyone see it? I really 
like the part about the special switch on Apollo 12. NASA needs a new mindset
and could learn from these people.

We need to land on Mars. Get rid of Bush and deficits, and go for MARS!!!

Tomorrow is the great close approach for the last 60, 000 years. Look in a
telescope or at least binoculars. Its cool but I believe there were really
oceans with two different levels due to cometary impacts and periods of
relative stable Earthlike atmosphere.

'They' (Bush/Cheney and the Carlyle Group) want war, not serious space
exploration, due to where it might lead.

Where might it lead? Your thoughts, please!

Hmmmm... but then how do we "get away" with futures markets and
other forms of derivatives.

Looks to me like there is some "bias" against games where it
is agreed that the "public" *will* lose some fraction of the
time (e.g. gambling on slot machines, roulette, etc.), but
not where there may be some more sophisticated strategies
involved (e.g. what the yields will be on wheat, corn or
pork bellies).

The general situation is that everything that looks like gambling is
illegal, expect that certain areas have been carved out as exceptions
for certain purposes.  These include stocks, commodity futures and
insurance, each allowed in order to enable certain sorts of risk
hedging.  The regulators for these exceptions are on the lookout
for people trying to slip ordinary gambling under their label.

Electric bikes seem to be getting rather popular.
"In 1998, worldwide sales of electric bicycles exceeded $200 million,
making it the most viable of all consumer EV markets, as well as one of
the fastest growing transportation markets today. Market analysis
suggests that the demand has grown to more than 100,000 units annually."

Google on 'electric bicycle' and you get lots of places you can buy them.

The Alternative Fuels Data Center has a page on them:
http://www.afdc.doe.gov/afv/bikes.html

The US Department of Energy has a comparative table with all the data
you want. See:
http://www.ccities.doe.gov/vbg/progs/search_type.cgi?7

I would expect them, like electric cars, to be more popular in a warm
climate like California or Florida.

The limit seems to be 2^1024.
2^1023 works, 2^1024 doesn't.
170! works, 171! doesn't.

This limit seems to correspond to 32-bit double precision real arithmetic.

speed of light in knots is OK
infinity doesn't work !?

Dividing by zero doesn't work. Bah!

furlongs per fortnight is OK

### I'd perfectly satisfied with a world without a single brave person, if
bravery means willing to die for a cause. Hot-heads are a nuisance.
Competent performance of contracts is all I would ask for.

You make a strong point here, but I think the best refinement of what
I currently have is different from yours.  Yours has two problems: (a)
that "mass murder" is simply not strong enough (after all, it is used
to describe the murder of merely hundreds of people), and (b) the use
of "genocide" as you (accurately) describe it has exactly the correct
character of talking about eradicating a "nation", because "nation" is
an appropriate term for any very large group of people with a common
characteristic that leads to common interests.  Re (a): even though we
accept that mass murder is bad in general, we are familiar with cases
where it has been deemed the lesser of two evils, so allowing others
to categorise delay in developing real anti-aging medicine as "only
mass murder" may invite wily challenges.  Re (b): in the same way that
it makes sense to refer to (e.g.) "the Arab nation" I think it is fair
(and even useful) to note that the set of people worldwide born in a
given range of years has a common interest (viz., the development of
real anti-aging medicine in a given range of years) that distinguishes
it somewhat from the corresponding interests of those born at other
times.  Hence they can reasonably be described as a "nation" for this
purpose.  I think your point can thus be met by a clarification of
"genocide" rather along the lines of my clarification of "homicide"
-- i.e. an acknowledgement up-front that I'm stretching normal usage,
but a justification of that stretching.

Comments please, before I revise the existing text.

My only disagreement with this statement is in respect of the use of
the word "discover".  My position is that no one can adequtely know
whether they will want to live in a world with indefinite potential
lifespan until they experience it, nor whether others will want to.
Introspection is useless -- we have NO IDEA what we will think of such
a world.  All we can do is give ourselves the option.

My only disagreement with this statement is in respect of the use of
the word "adrenalized".  Most early death in wealthy nations from
violent causes has, until the past 58 years (fewer for the US), been
due to war, i.e. the conscious, considered, collective decision to
sacrifice huge numbers of people in the national interest.  My view
(hope, anyway) is that the success of wealthy nations in not going to
war with each other for far longer than has been seen since as far back
in history as I can establish may very well have resulted from a larger
value placed on human life these days than when adventitious mortality
from peaceful causes (such as infection) was much higher.  It is this
point that leads me to the opinion that we have a very good chance of
avoiding world wars indefinitely, without which my well-publicised
estimates of future life expectancy could not be fulfilled.

"the State has no rational right to deny us."
Who ever said the state had to be rational?

I consider this attempted murder, nothing less.

It is *so* interesting to see what Eliezer gets upset about...
(As normally he is rather calm and composed...)

Of course one of the points of the new calculator feature
is to see what "breaks" it.  How else are the programmers
who developed it going to improve it?

I've tried to get in touch with the manager of the project
so I could give them some high praise, but google appears
to have their phone "firewalls" set too high.  I've done a
couple of *really* cool programming tasks in my life -- it would
be nice to let the people responsible for the calculator
know that what they have done is *really* cool.

Hmmm... Perhaps I could take out a google ad to compliment
the google programmers.  Something to think about.

Depends, how big a problem is this actually? Is it more than 
just publicity chasing political opportunism and media baiting 
(or responding to media story bush beating) by CIS Director
Hollister or someone else I wonder? Disengaging the facts from
media speak is always something of an exercise and to be honest
I'm not really convinced its worth my taking the trouble in this case.
Is CI even looking for help or do they have everything under
control? 

I am not a lawyer and I know less of the American legal system
than I do of the Australian system but a couple of points stick
out to me from this article and I recall a little backgrounding I did
on cryonics a few years ago.

First there is a paper accessible from the cryonics site entitled
"Declaration of Dr. Fahy", http://www.cryonics.org/fahy.html
where in California (not Michigan) "the cryonics people won
the case (in the Superior Court) and the coroner was enjoined
against interfering with the cryonics operation." 

I don't know if California and the Michigan have the same or
similar (ie. essentially duplicated) Departments of Consumer
and Industry Services, but if they do, or if they are not notably
different on point then my guess is that the Californian decision
should at least have persuasive power in Michigan. 

Second, I have not drawn out the legislation or bylaws that
Hollister is apparently invoking, (what would be the point he
seems to refer to no particular clauses or legal points -
what references are made are made by the reporters, whom
Hollister may or may not be accurately represented by.)
 
Hollister is quoted as "expressing concern that people from 
around the world have invested their trust and finances into
this facility to preserve their bodies for eternity yet this facility
continues to knowingly operate outside the scope of the law".

Well what a sweetie. That he in the state of Michigan, should
be so multinational in his "concern".

"Operating outside the law" is not necessarily the same
as "operating illegally" though many political spinners and 
media types would recognize that such a distinction may be
lost on many readers (and some reporters). 

Consider if there is no legislation on the matter of having
a favourite color is one "operating outside the law" to have
a favourite color like blue? Does favoring blue mean one
is operating outside the law. Outside could mean the law 
has no jurisdiction on the matter.

Third, unless the CI has said or Hollister and can show 
that the CI institute has promised to "preserve ..bodies for
eternity" (a statement which strikes me as a little surprising
having had some brief email contacts with Bob Ettinger a
few years ago - he did not strike me as that foolish), then
the implied deception - to preserve for eternity - is very 
much moot.

And if as the reporter in this link says 
(STATE Orders Local Cryonics Institute To Close - WDIV, MI
http://www.clickondetroit.com/news/2434929/detail.html  )

"The facility, .... is being ordered to preserve the bodies 
currently in its care; however, it will not be able to accept
any new contracts or bodies." How is such an "order" not
logically contradictory to the point against preservation being
made? 

The same article goes on ...

"Hollister said CIS is encouraging the Cryonics Institute to
take the necessary steps to come in compliance with state law.
The Cryonics Institute may become licensed either as a funeral 
establishment or registered as a cemetery; however, current law
would prohibit the Cryonics Institute from being able to do both.
The law stipulates that bodies cannot be prepared at the scene
of a cemetery, however the institute could make arrangements
for the bodies to be prepared in a licensed funeral home, 
according to CIS."

If I was at CI I'd want to see exactly what the state law said
rather than read about it in general terms in the media. I imagine
Bob Ettinger has that well covered. I'd also suspect that wiggle
room would be left in the definition of separating cemetery from 
funeral home (how much separation is enough etc?) and perhaps
even in the notion of what is a body - perhaps see the Fahy 
argument above. Hollister and co could well be just "bending"
with the prevailing political wind or responding to media story
making and CI may well respond accordingly.

Of course, the media prefers stories that are more rather than
less dramatic and confrontational. And what better way to find
"news" in a quite period than to make it by muck raking on an
issue that seems to have become topical (with Sports Illustrated
and Ted whats-his-name - hey we're not all baseball fans).

I can see lots of potential solutions and courses of action 
depending on details that are not included in the articles but 
there are also *lots* of other things to spend time on, so
seriously how big is the problem?

This is just warning to list members that the SPAM
situation is going to get worse before it gets better.

Apparently a distributed denial of service attack has
taken out one of the major source points for lists
of systems distributing undesirable emails [1].

In addition, most of the major worm/virus/security detection
services are predicting that the recent "sobig" virus instance
is just a build-up to a massive SPAM distribution system [2].

So, be aware that if you do have a Windows system without the
latest updates -- or do not have an email filtering system --
you *WILL* be vulnerable.  So expect your system to fill up with
junk mail and expect most of it to be "dangerous" if you open it.

Where to place blame: Microsoft & the SPAMers

You should be aware that there seems to be a real "war" out there
only it seems to be being conducted at the software level.

ZDNet confirms:
"Osirusoft, one of the largest anti-spam black-list, has been shut down 
by its operator following a barrage of massive Distributed Denial of 
Service (DoS) attacks that have crippled the service."

But there are many people who don't like 'spam blacklists' and never use 
them. I agree with the opinion that says they are more trouble than they 
are worth. They are notorious for blacklisting the wrong people. Most 
people will have had incidents of email lists going missing because they 
were wrongly blacklisted.

Bayesian logic and whitelists are much better methods for controlling 
spam. Getting an industry-wide whitelist, though, is probably 
impossible. But each user can have their own whitelist to junk all the 
spam that arrives in their mailbox.


I am not so worried about the spam nuisance as I am about the suspicion 
that organised crime is behind these virus attacks. See:
http://news.zdnet.co.uk/0,39020330,39115886,00.htm

Quote:
"An antivirus expert claims Sobig is the work not of 'script kiddies', 
but of sophisticated criminals who want to take control of PCs
"Sobig smashed all the records in terms of pure numbers, but that's not 
nearly the whole story," said Simpson. "This is the sixth in a series of 
controlled experiments. This isn't about some kiddy writing viruses in 
his bedroom -- this is really a very sophisticated example of organised 
crime."

Simpson explained that the purpose of getting Sobig onto the computer is 
not to cause damage or purely to drive wide and rapid spread, but to 
gain control of machine, by downloading a Trojan and gain access to 
information such as bank details for the purpose of fraud. Such tactics 
effectively hand control of the machine over to the virus writer.

It will also enable unscrupulous marketers to disguise the source of 
spam by abusing victim's computers and identities.
End quote


This means that users have to get as serious about protecting their PC 
as they are about protecting their car and their house.
Locks, anti-theft systems, alarms, gates, scanners, the whole lot has to 
be installed and kept up-to-date to keep the thieves out.


Not a very pleasant prospect, really. :(

I am probably not the best person to construct this templaty as many here are

Well, yes.  But do remember that one of the signs of the singularity is 
the more frequent occurance of unexpected, but predictable, events. 
Like this.

Focusing on e-mail and spam is focusing too narrowly.  In a broader 
sense this kind of activity will increase over the coming decades.  Some 
we'll like, and some we won't.

Actually, I consider the onset of the singularity so dangerous, that if 
it weren't for the dangers posed by lunatic govt.s (including ours) that 
I would support doing everything reasonable to slow things down to a 
managable level.  As it is, however, I feel that the very 
unpredictability is our only possible salvation.  The govt's seem to 
have taken to heart the old saying "If the government doesn't like it's 
population, it should elect a new one."  With every authoritarian 
pronouncement I am more and more grateful for the unpredictable future, 
because if they could predict it, I feel it would soon become a 
nightmare.  CyberPunk wouldn't be in it.

But the future sure isn't what it used to be.

A Note to Director Hollister

http://www.cis.state.mi.us/insidecis/director/note_to_mayor.htm

I sent him an earlier draft of the following missive. 
Use it however you will: as is, or modified/edited, or
as a jumping off point, or not at all.

(You may find the hostility toward religion
impolitic.)

Best, Jeff Davis

   "My guess is that people don't yet realize how
          "handy" an indefinite lifespan will be." 
                            J Corbally 

            ---------------------------------

Dear Director Hollister,  

I am a member of the Cryonics Institute.  I need to be
assured that their services are available to me when
the time comes.  Your interference with their
operations is uncalled for, represents ignorance of or
indifference to the scientific basis and the
life-saving intent of the practice, violates the
fundamental right of each individual to self-defense
and to the right to choose one's own medical care, and
violates both the freedom of religion and the
separation of church and state.  On a more personal
level, setting aside the broad and egregious assault
on my human rights, it constitutes a direct threat to
my life.  

The vast majority of individuals who are signed-up
with cryonics organizations are among the most
technically sophisticated people in the world.  They
see the possibilities the future holds, in stark
contrast to the rest of the population of the
"civilized" world, who are almost completely ignorant
of even the basics of present day science and
technology.  This is the same science and technology
which, since the time of Galileo, has struggled to
promote truth and rationality against the forces of
mysticism and prejudice. The same science and
technology and truth and rationality has given us the
very civilization we today celebrate and enjoy:
unprecedented levels of material abundance, comfort,
safety, freedom, and, to enjoy it, a healthy lifespan
two and a half times greater than the brief and
brutish span of the jungle from which science has
lifted us.  Everything we are, everything we have
built proclaims that science and rationality delivers,
mysticism and prejudice destroys.

The same vast majority of people who consider cryonics
to be a sham, due so not on the basis of scientific
training, but rather on the basis of cultural
prejudices, superstition (which they call religion),
and a slavish adherence convention.  Fine for them. 
This is their protected right, founded on this
country's tradition of freedom of religion.  No matter
the foolishness, no matter the dogma, the funny hats,
or the arcane rituals, as long as it's in the name of
some "sky Santa" (ie god), it's politically pandered
to and protected.  Fine.  I stand resolute in defense
of their rights.  By that same standard I absolutely
require for myself the same right to personal belief
and practice.  I place my faith in science and
rationality.  I do not reject religion for any who
care to believe, but I most strongly protest when my
preference of science in favor of religion threatens
to make me a victim of those whose religious
prejudices conflict with my rationalist preferences. 
And that is precisely what you are up to, Director
Hollister, in your present assault on the Cryonics
Institute.  

I do not know if your action arises out of political
pandering to the religious majority, personal
religious prejudice, a lack of technical
sophistication, or if it is simply a bureaucratic
blunder, but you need to stop it now, and return to
looking for something socially constructive to do.  I
dare say there are plenty of REAL problems out there
that could use your attention.

If you need someone to help you understand what
cryonics is about--and judging from the actions you've
taken, I'd say you do, and desperately--I offer my
assistance.  But I prefer to make this "offer" more
forcefully.  You are, either capriciously or in an
uninformed fashion, carrying out what amounts to a
life-threatening assault on a minority whose beliefs
differ from yours and those of the social majority. 
As such, I feel entitled to require that my views be
heard in this matter.  You have already violated the
legally protected rights of others.  The proper course
of action now must be to cease and desist, and to make
yourself available to those who can provide you with
the information needed to understand why what you have
done is a violation of rights, and how in future to
adhere to the principle of protection rather than
violation of rights.

I am not the only person qualified too help you in
this matter, but I believe that my depth of experience
with cryonics makes me among the most skilled
proponents of the practice.

You will find my personal information below.  Please
contact me as an expert in these matters--a
"cryoethicist" if you will--and notify me as to any
public hearings, commissions of inquiry, and most
importantly any legal proceedings related to this
matter.

This in combination with WAP-based access is going to make testing 
impossible.

If you do get in touch with them, try to get them to include logic, 
metalogic, number-theory and proof-theory!

Wouldn't it be great to have a machine which could  give proofs for 
completeness given a set of axioms and inference rules and/or give a 
set of axioms/inference rules given a set of truth tables.

Then you have a world full of cowards.

I hope you can see why this is unrealistic.  In a world full of 
cowards, evil brave people take advantage.

Only the honorable, genuinely brave people provide a reasonable defense 
against the evil brave.

To see why it's important, remember the American "Give me Liberty or 
Give me death".

If you'd like a world in which 90% of the people are imprisoned and 
enslaved by 10%, then encourage people to be cowards.

If you'd like a world in which people come together to jointly improve 
their world, promote bravery and goodness.

Best,

Robbie Lindauer

So, yes, smash it.  Break it.  Shatter it into a

Yes, definitely the handlebars. But that's not the issue, so much as having
your hat blow off or increase drag.

I have an engine which I add to a normal bike. See it here...
http://www.zapworld.com/dx.htm

I bought it a few years back. It's required no maintenance, and I've moved
it across about 5 different bikes now I think.

It's range is not too bad under ideal conditions; one lead-acid battery
(From website... BATTERY: Sealed, maintenance-free, lead acid dry-cell
twelve volt, 20 amp-hr battery is approximately 7" x 7" x 3" and weighs
about 12.5 pounds) will keep me going for about half an hour of riding. If
there are some hills, it'll be juiced more quickly. In a very hilly,
bike-unfriendly region, it's hopeless (so I couldn't use it when I lived in
the adelaide hills).

In the wet, it's range can just about halve, because of poor traction
between the spindle and the tyre (you have to clamp it down tighter, which
increases friction I think). I've been experiencing that a lot lately, but I
think with some adjustment of the placement of the engine I can fix it
somewhat.

As to speed, check the URL above. All I know is, it'll accelerate me very
quickly (with a bit of pedalling added in), and get me to a speed I'd get to
by pedalling pretty hard at fairly high gearing; quite fast. Also note it is
addive, so your pedalling adds to it, which is excellent. You can work at a
fairly lasy rate, putting in a little effort, and pass the spandex clad
cycle nazis, which is funny. It's almost silent and pretty unobtrusive, so
people don't notice it until you show it to them. 

A couple of years ago, I used to ride an hour to work, and took a second
battery with me (using both up on the trip). Those things are heavy! Now my
trip is twenty minutes to half an hour, so it's just perfect.

The best thing about it is that it's not technically a motor vehicle, so
I've got no registration costs, insurance, or much in the way of regulations
besides having to wear a helmet. I can use bike paths (which are through
very pretty parkland) instead of congested roads.

I have a "third wheel" (a long bar which joins to the seat pole and has
another seat, set of pedals, and back wheel, turns you into an articulated
tandem) which I use to take my three year old to child care, all of which is
heavy (third wheel + boy who doesn't pedal), but the engine sorts that out.

I think some of the purpose built electric bikes might be more efficient
than the engine kits like mine; I test drove one a few years back that
looked like a vesper with pedals. My only problem with those is that I think
they are perceived more as a motor vehicle than a bicycle (and then you may
as well get a motorbike).

But I just noticed what I *really* want for my bike; a VTOL kit from
Moller...

But it's the high-performance of the *spurs* that reinforce the brakes.

An Aussie has come up with something innovative along these lines:

http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/ss/stories/s916760.htm


        Broadcast Saturday 16/08/2003 

        Electric Bicycle 

        Summary: 
        After producing a solar car Dean Patterson began work on
        an electric bicycle, and now he's had an order from India for
        3,000,000. Robyn Williams watched a demonstration. 

        Transcript:
        Dean Patterson: This is an almost final version. Were
        making two prototypes now to be tested and were asking
        people to break them if they possibly can. Im a classic
        professional breaker of bicycles and things.

        Robyn Williams: Well, it looks like a normal bike, the
        normal size and its got a lumpy bit down on the front wheel
        which is not too cumbersome, and the idea that I had that it
        was going to be a pretty weighty impediment evaporates
        immediately.

        Dean Patterson: Yes, we originally designed it as a retrofit
        kit; that is, youd take your normal bicycle and just replace
        the front wheel, put a couple of instruments on the handlebar
        and clip in a battery. And yes, the front wheel has a rather
        larger hub that youd expect and we now have got the mass
        of the motor down to about three and a half kilograms.
        Weve also managed to get all of the electronics into the
        front wheel, you can actually see it.

        Robyn Williams: And a mini computer screen on the front.

        Dean Patterson: Yes, absolutely. Were talking to
        manufacturers in Singapore, now to Taiwan to produce a
        more sophisticated version, something that looks like the
        little cat eye that you put on bicycles rather than this large
        chunky device we have.

etc.

Of course, Texan bicycles always use solids for innertubes.

The oversized wheels, fat tyres, and the big pickup tray on the back tend to
lower your efficiency too.

This is also an interesting Science Show piece on the big galactic hole. 

http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/ss/stories/s917636.htm

I was struck by one question (astro experts might care to comment):

>        glow and were fortunate because the black hole at the
>        galactic centre seems to be absorbing this matter but at a

But hang on... yeah, it bends light behind it *away* from us, but equally
it should bend some of the light coming at it sideways *toward* us, no?
more or less exactly compensating for what we'd see were it not there?

I mentioned the other day that the anchor on a classy Aussie news program
(SBS news) bizarrely confused astronomical and astrological in her
announcement of the then-impending Mars-Earth opposition. Last night was
much worse. 

After some touchy-feely shots of kids and parents swarming over telescopes
in local parks, and a talking head astronomer saying yes it was awfully
exciting but no, actually we won't learn anything until the probes arrive
in December and January, they cut to a lengthy assessment of the import of
it all by an actual dyed-in-the-wool astrologer, who told us that Mars was
traditionally the god of war, so this explained all the recent strife, but
luckily once the planets had pulled apart from their fatal proximity we
could anticipate a new epoch of peace and tranquility. 

This was not presented as comic relief; no, folks, this is pluralist
respect for different opinions in action. (There was a lot of reiteration
of how Mars was now `five times closer than usual', which must have made
people think it was hovering right overhead, perhaps ready to crash into
us, rather than 67 million km away. (In fact, it's only 30% closer than the
average opposition.) No faintest notion of scale, none of the elementary
fact that the two planets come into opposition every couple of years, none
of the insignificant difference in gravitation effect in being this little
bit closer. 

I was deeply hurt that they didn't also include a snippet with a
spokesperson from the Flat Mars Society (there must be one somewhere).

In all the discussion of alternate and renewable
energy sources, the problem of energy storage is
brought out.  A quiet assumption runs thru all
the discussion that I have seen, the assumption
that the price of electricity must remain nearly
constant.  Do think about this however.  Energy
supplies may be controlled by allowing the price 
of power at any given time to float to whatever
levels necessary to reduce demand.  On sunny,
blowy days, the actual price of energy might fall
to practically nothing, whereas it might be very
expensive on dark still days, when the power would
be supplied by expensive peaker plants.

By insisting that power prices be nearly constant
*we all pay more* since peaker plants are costly
to operate and produce very pricy power part time, 
which the market mandates to be sold at the same 
price as non-peak power, and the supply must always be
sufficient to cover the demand.  Result:  everyone's
total power bill is higher than they would be if
we would collectively tolerate wildly fluctuating 
prices and occasional shortages.

If power were to be sold at the real-time price
it costs to make it, then the proletariat would
adjust its collective behavior, charging batteries 
when power is cheap, and turning off the air 
conditioners when power is expensive.

That's a sensible sounding suggestion, but we (consumers) don't have enough
information to make it work. I've watched power prices fluctuate when I was
working in a power station, and I've seen them temporarily increase by a
factor of 60 at extreme times. 

For consumers to be able to weather true deregulation, we need to be able to
know the price at any moment. Maybe a website would be ok, except you need
to use power to access it :-) I'm not sure how to deliver this information,
but the alternative is that you consume a product whose price is entirely
unknown to you (and currently unknowable I think, in realtime), and which
can move so quickly and extremely that you could be severely disadvantaged
(wiped out maybe!) by normal market fluctuations.

5% a year improvement in wind power production efficiency seems
pretty good to me.  It may not be cost effective everywhere yet,
but step by step...

But there is no reasonable way to slow things down and certainly not to a 
"managable" level.  Today's level shows strong evidence of being unmanagable.  
Which modern conveniences, inventions, technologies would you be not only 
willing to forgo, but actively and most likely violently suppress?  Not 
reasonbale indeed.  Even if you could peaceabhly roll back the clock, what is 
reasonable about all the suffering and death of every single human being in 
all too few years, generation upon generation?     No, as I see it our only 
hope of managablitiy or more generally, survival,  is to build something 
smarter than us and trustworthy/friendly and/or augment ourselves quickly 
enough.

You build a false dichotomy as I already pointed out.  People who have no 
intention of dying can and do act with considerable bravery and dedication 
none the less.  They are also likely to act a great deal more rationally when 
their goal system is not mucked up with some wild notions of bravely dying 
being nearly the most noble thing.

We can promote "goodness" with great dedication without glorifying dying as 
being "brave".

Well, I don't think it was "boundless enthusiasm" and I wasn't really speaking 
generally about development of robust alternate technolgy in this case.  I 
was speaking about what makes electric cars more possible today.    This is a 
much more delimited subject.  

To get general for a minute though, OF COURSE we can develop robust alternate 
technology in many different areas of our current infrastructure as better 
computation and materials, particularly toward the nanotech scale along with 
better techniques become available.  This is a no-brainer.  What is more 
questionable is only which technology areas are going to be subject to a fair 
amount of change how quickly.

Sooner or later some of them  obviously will come on the scene as real 
alternatives unless we so severely screw up as to scrap technological advance 
or do ourselves in.   

I am curious what benefit you believe this particular pessimism holds for you.

I see no reason that we need to be subject to such fluctuation in available 
power for something so simple as air-conditioning.  I certainly see no good 
technical reason we should have to stop our activities periodically for 
brown-outs much less black-outs.    Such lack of dependable power is a 
serious fault in our infrastructure  and must be remedied.

Hmm, is it just my swedishness, or are the tone of these letters a bit
aggressive? Also, pointing out that cryonicists are technologically
sophisticated and using the Galileo card sounds downright cultish.
Especially in the US I have the distinct feeling that suggesting that
religion is a superstition is not on average going to predispose people
kindly. Could it be that we are reacting a bit too reflexively?

Maybe the core issue should be stated more calmly: yes, this is a 
practice some people see as pseudoscience or yukky, but almost any 
practice, be it cremation, the use of antibiotics for appendicitis or 
acupuncture is viewed as pseudoscience or yukky by *someone* (or even 
most people). That still does not mean it should be hindered unless it 
actually hurts somebody. A society which cannot tolerate diversity and 
unusual ideas is going to end up impoverished and intolerant.

I wonder if one could get some of Richard Florida's ideas about how the
creative class moves in here. Essentially, if a place like Michigan
shows that it does not tolerate the unusual (by banning cryonics and
tounge splitting) it sends a signal to many of the cultural creatives
that increasingly form the core of economic growth that this is not the
place to be. It does not matter that most never would even consider
getting a suspension or split tounge, they know that their own
particular interests or views might be circumscribed and that the area
is less likely to attract other interesting people - so they go
elsewhere. Is that a desired signal?

And speaking of the Great Filter:

http://www.abc.net.au/catalyst/stories/s934318.htm

	Its the next GM. For the last
        ten years, scientists have been
        working behind closed doors to
        genetically engineer viruses.
        Now, theyre seeking
        permission to let them out.
        Their dream is that these
        viruses will provide a humane,
        self spreading means of
        controlling some of our worst
        pests  mice, foxes and rabbits.
        The trouble is, Australia isnt
        the only country thats created
        a GM virus. In Spain, theyve
        also developed a rabbit virus.
        And it does the opposite of
        ours. The Spanish want to save
        their rabbits, which are
        threatened by myxomatosis and
        calicivirus. So theyve engineered a virus to act as a vaccine against
        these rabbit killers. In New Zealand, theyre working on a genetically
        modified organism to eradicate possums. What if these viruses got
        here, or our virus got there? Have we tried to solve a local problem,
        only to create a global one? These are some of the questions
        scientists are asking as Australia decides whether or not to
release the
        GM viruses

While you may have "no intention of dying" in order to simply maintain 
your own desired freedoms (I assume you desire these) it's likely to 
become necessary to defend them.   If you're unwilling to defend them 
with your own life, you're likely to loose versus an opponent that is 
(unless you're much, much smarter and better than they at warfare).

Nobody thinks that dying is great.  The claim is that fighting with 
abandon to protect core values (family, freedom, etc.) is necessary and 
good and that if you fight with abandon, you might get killed.

As a father, I know that if the wrong person came into my house with 
bad intentions I'd be willing to kill them, it'd be my duty (even 
though I'd identify myself as a pacifist).  Once you're willing to use 
deadly force, you have to assume that your opponent will be too.  This 
is not to glorify dying but just to point out that in certain 
situations it may be the right thing to do.

Would you recommend that if someone came into my house and attacked my 
family that I simply run away?  That would be cowardice.  I may 
actually be a coward (never having had this happen to me) but I 
certainly won't say that it'd be good if I was.

Best,

Robbie

I stayed on a farm in Aussi that once that worked on a primitive variant on
this idea. Power was cheaper at night so our friend had a big electric
hotwater heater that would heat at night and then "coast" all day. As a city
slicker it was a bit inconvenient to have to get up early to shower, but for
farmers getting up early was no problem (besides which, showers are hardly
de rigueur for farmers).

One way to handle this would be to have your computer manage your
electricity consumption. You could then say to your computer, "It would be
good if the dishes were done by tomorrow morning but they must be done by
tomorrow night, unless power is above .30kwh. The voice recognition software
would then translate your preferences and figure out when to run the
dishwasher. The computer could monitor the price of electricity on the net
as well as the "electricity forecast"--projected cost of electricity for the
next few days. Similarly it could switch on your washing machine, dryer, and
charge your electric vehicle in nonpeak times (when prices are lower). Like
my Aussi friend, there would be incentive to use fairly low tech means to
"coast" as well. Extra large water tanks that might take advantage of cheap
rates. Another low tech possibility would be to use your airconditioner to
cool say a 1000 gallon tank of water in your basement when rates are cheap.
When rates go up you take advantage of the cold water to cool the house for
a few hours. Freezers set a few degrees cooler could also coast through peak
times. Such a system seems a natural for renewables which tend to be more
cyclical than conventional means of generating electricity. Being a bleeding
heart, I would like to see some provision for making sure that the
electricity providers don't act like an oligopoly. In the long run this
should be obviated when there are more electricity suppliers, e.g., where
homes and business are covered with solar cells.

I agree. 
Maybe it is because I am an Alcor member, not a CI member.  Maybe I
would be more strident if I felt more directly threatened.

I think a variety of letters is probably the best way to go.  Diplomacy is 
best, but sometimes an aggressive stance is good - and anger expressing 
something that hits a nerve is meaningful.  Although I don't think it is a 
good idea to insult.

I think you are right about local issues, although Alcor had a hard time in 
Southern California early on, but that changed.  Cryonics might do best in 
high tech locations.

Isn't that Arizona your talking about?  Hey -

The National Transportation Safety Board recently divulged they had funded 
a project with the US auto makers for the past five years. The NTSB 
covertly funded a project whereby the auto makers were installing black 
boxes in four wheel drive pickup trucks in an effort to determine, in fatal 
accidents, the circumstances in the last 15 seconds before the crash.

They were surprised to find in 49 of the 50 states the last words of 
drivers in 61.2% of fatal crashes were, "Oh, Shit!"

Only the state of Texas was different, where 89.3% of the final words were, 
"Hey hold my beer and watch this!"

### I fully agree with the above (maybe it's my Polishness). There is no
need to antagonize an official who may not be totally an enemy, and even if
he is, sounding too strident is in bad taste. By all means, those who wish
to contact Hollister on CI's behalf should try for a reasoned if firm tone,
along exactly the lines of Ander's thinking.

### A coward is a person who does not fulfill expectations it terms of the
willingness to face danger, including a failure to perform according to
previously assumed obligations. A world of persons who fulfill contracts
would not be a world of cowards.

### Only the calm, smart, relentlessly rational, long-term thinkers are a
defense against the brave, the stupid and the good-intentioned. Such people
will assume risks according to a rational analysis of possible outcomes,
design societies and themselves by recourse to game theory, ruthlessly
destroy defectors and face death if needed - but only if needed.

The brave will run headlong into battle as soon as some manipulative
politico pushes his "special cause" buttons - mostly tribal loyalty, and
fear of the unknown.

Death to the brave!

### No, I run scared of bravery and goodness.

Whenever you project the outcome of "goodness" far enough into the future,
it becomes either identical with self-interest (however defined), or else
descends into incoherence. Calm rationality, and a long-term outlook are all
we need to make the best world there can be.

Even as Alcor members, it does affect us.  Cryonics organizations have a
responsibility to their members to do provide a reliable suspension and be
in accordance with rules and regulations as a medical facility of sorts. 
Alcor's recent problem with Larry Jackson proves that we are very
vulnerable.  People ride high on negative press and will look between the
cracks in hopes of discovering any possible areas in which cryonics has a
flaw in its business practices and suspension practices.

In the cryonics community, we might do best by holding a sense of valued
responsibility.  Maybe not.  This depends on its practices.  If CI does
have bad business and suspension practices, then it would not be wise to
support it.  Conversely, if it is reputable it would behove us to be
supportive of it in a sense of coopetition.

Yes, well, looking at the background (and possible motivations) of this 
fellow Hollister (in charge of the MI govt branch that has shut down CI), we 
see that he is a former mayor of a city in MI. So, it is probable that he is 
looking to use this issue to leverage his way to statewide media exposure for 
himself, thus opening a path to possible statewide political office.  Give 
him a way to finish this conflict that makes him look good, and he will take 
it. What that is exactly, it might behoove CI members to determine.  Fight it 
out in court?  In the media? Portray cryonics as a "belief" which hurts no 
one and is entitled to freedom to practice from the state? Or accomodate and 
change CI as he deems?

Not only that, but it is my "backup plan." And a cheap one, too!  It is hard 
to see how CI is going to come up of this with the same prices......

A good point. 

Maybe what is missing in transhumanist circles at present 
is an appreciation that "hanging separately" may be the
consequence of not "hanging together". Of not stepping 
forward soon enough and of not fighting on the logical
memetic fault lines. 

There are some transhumanists whom I do not think will
survive if cryonics is not an option for them. Better options,
for some, almost certainly will not arrive in time. 

I don't know that cryonics will work, but I think it is a
smarter choice than burial or cremation and I can see
no legitimate grounds on which people should be denied
the freedom to avail themselves of that choice.

Robert Ettinger more than any other person that I am
aware of is responsible for working to make cryonics
a practical option. 

*If* the Cryonics Institute or Robert Ettinger need support
to whether a political storm I think it would be a mistake
for any prospective cryonaut to regard either as an 
acceptable loss.

The following is a straight excerpt from Robert Ettinger
on the cryonics list.

The bottom paragraph on how to help seems worth the
repost.

Subject: Michigan issues

The Cryonics Institute is surprised and disappointed by the
orders issued by the Michigan Department of Consumer
and Industry Services, which it believes are completely
unjustified.Since we have had the orders for only 24 hours,
we are still considering the precise courses of action that 
we will take, including whether to proceed with litigation. 
However, the Department's orders, which prohibit certain
activities pending resolution of the licensing issues raised
by the Department, do not in any way affect the care of
our current patients. Moreover, while we strongly disagree
with the Department's actions, we note that the Department
has stated that it does not wish to prohibit our activities, but
desires that they continue under the Department's licensing 
process.While resolution of these issues  proceeds, CI will
continue to protect the interests of its members. We will
promptly keep you apprised  as to further developments. 

 In the event of litigation, we would welcome support in the
form of affidavits from cryonicists with academic credentials
as well as any CI members. Please contact David Ettinger
(dae@honigman.com) if you are interested in helping.

Yes, this happens, but not enough to compensate.  There are a couple of
ways to explain it.  The more literal one is that the compensatory light
rays are emitted at a narrower range of angles than the ones shifted away,
hence there is less light.

Another way to see what is happening is illustrated for example at
http://www.astronomynotes.com/relativity/s4.htm, which shows how a
gravitational field can deflect light coming from being it.  The net
effect is a spatial distortion where objects move outward from their
actual position, and are seen as farther from the center of the nearby
object than they are.

Now imagine this happening to a uniform grid behind the gravitating
object.  The dots near the object will be displaced outward; those far
from the object won't be affected; and in between there will therefore
be a ring with a higher density of dots.  If we think of the dots as
uniform light emission, we see a darker area near the gravitating object
and a brighter ring surrounding it.

If you imagine this happening to a uniform light behind the nearby object
(like the BH accretion disk, which is uniform in one dimension, anyway),
the effect is the same, that the image is distorted and shifted outward.
This means that more light comes from a ring around the BH and less from
the immediate apparent vicinity.  I think this is what they mean by its
"shadow".

I'm mostly in agreement with Anders and Rafal, but....

It has been my experience that when rationalists use a
measured rational tone when confronting emotionalists
or politicians, the latter 
interpreting this as weakness, are emboldened, and the
former get eaten for lunch.  The essence of political
professionalism is to be polite even 
while they slip the knife between your victims ribs. 
Now, I am aware of how inflammatory this sounds, but
frankly I'm pissed.  And I think that sometimes it is
necessary, as Shakespeare said, to: 

Beware of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.

I'm perfectly thrilled to have all the silly people
with their favorite silly belief systems frolic to
their hearts content.  I'm even ready to stand in
solidarity with them to protect this right.  But I'll
be damned if I'll stand idly or POLITELY by while they
strip me of the same rights, even to the point of
marching me into the grave or cremation chamber. 
There is a time for "aggressive", and when that time
comes, sooner--as in "nip it in the bud"--is better
than later.

Now, regarding my letter being used as a template, I'm
flattered, but I think that idea should be discarded. 
Natasha asked for a template, but 
frankly, my letter ain't it.  It has all manner of
flaws for such usage, not the least of which is that a
slew of similar letters would look like some kind of
cultish activism with me as the cult leader, and I 
really, really, don't think we want to go there.  I
know I don't.  But as I said, if you find some useful
bit in any of my ranting, feel free.

If you want to do a good cop/bad cop whipsaw on this
Hollister creature, I'll be happy to be the bad cop.

Finally, what I find astonishing and particularly
infuriating are (1) that Hollister may be using the
Cryonics Institute as a "soft target" for his personal
political advancement, and (2) that the underlying
"religious" fanaticism that fuels this whole business
is --un-flippin-believable-- the religion of,...wait
for it....

                ***!!! BASEBALL!!!***

I'm sorry.  

I gotta die for flippin baseball???!!!

Hold me the fuck down--pardon my French-- 'cause I'm
seriously gonna be losin' it. 

Best, Jeff Davis

Aha, so google is a Meta-God.  Given how "broken" the current
reality is (people starving, global warming, oil spills, yada,
yada, yada) clearly it is not perfect.  And all that stuff
about the apple and falling from grace -- that is just a
rationalization from when we were completely clueless as to
what might really be going on.  So clearly its an experiment to
discover the one perfect future (just like Trance says in Andromeda).

So, GOOGLE, is not a god -- *YET*.  But anyone who knows the contents
of 3,307,998,701 web pages is pretty darn close in my book.

I wonder if the tipping point is when Google becomes more perfect
than reality?

And if anyone saw the Tonight show rerun last night with Jay Leno
interviewing two young people regarding some reasonably common facts
(that they were clueless about) the tipping point is far far closer
than most people on the list would suspect.

Forrest didn't have it quite right.  Instead of "Stupid is as
stupid does", it should instead be "Stupid is as stupid is".

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

FWIW, here's a recent post to another list by Dr Evan Harris Walker, a
quantum theorist with radical ideas:

==============================

The recent visit to the tooth fairy to find quick fixes to recent
difficulties with the proposed "inflation" modification of the well
established Big Bang theory gave us dark matter. And now the latest trip to
that tooth fairy to fix the fix gives us dark energy. 

Both dark matter and dark energy hypotheses arise as quick fixes to problems
relating to the well established general relativity of the very early Big
Bang universe. These data arise because of the application of one of our
cornerstones, general relativity, to a particular problem under development
that lies outside the domain of mesoscale physics. The properties of both
dark matter and of dark energy are such that they do not play a role in
mesoscale physics. The dark matter because it is believed by those who
propose it that it was made during the first moments of the universe when
the temperature of the universe was at energy levels some 13 orders of
magnitude higher than anything achievable on earth today, and represents
leftover non-interacting debris. Dark energy is believed to be an effect
that has to do with the hypothetical cosmological constant that comes into
play when very vast regions of space are involved, or when we are dealing
with very vast amounts of matter, many galaxies at a time, or when doing
things in the early morning of the universe. Though these are hypothetical,
the physics constraints are still present. These hypothetical animals of
cosmology are themselves as constrained as to what they can be allowed to do
as is the physics of the matter in the brain.

Translate any of these into their effects on the mesoscale, and they vanish.

Neither dark matter or dark energy mitigate either general relativity or
quantum mechanics to the slightest degree. The proposed particles lie
outside the standard model, but they also lie outside the realm of the
energy ranges achievable in any interactions on earth, even in billion
dollar accelerators -- a limitation I expressed early on.

Now, I have spent about 15 years studying the problems mentioned here, so my
remarks are not off hand. Dark matter was proposed because inflation theory
needed more matter than was seen. The universe seems rather flat, but
flatness requires something like 10^-29 grams per cc (as I recall the
number) matter density in the universe based on general relativity. There is
observationally a 95% short-fall in this number (the exact number varies).
Since that matter was not seen, it was hypothesized to exist anyway -- sort
of the way invisable pink elephants are introduces, or that Harvey friend of
Jimmy Stewart.

I have proposed that the reason for this density short-fall results from the
first generation of stars that formed when the universe first cooled to
about 1000 degrees at 300,000 years of age. At that time, 1,000,000 solar
mass stars began to form. The heat restricted what size stars could formed
to this million solar mass size. The portion of matter forming these is
calculable: 4%. Because of their mass, these stars burn and collapse very
fast. Because the universe does not spin, these stars are different from
most present stars and when they collapse because they immediately collapse
into black holes; within a millisecond, they reach their endpoint.

Now non-rotating black hole stars pose something of a problem in physics.
The matter must go to a singularity -- infinitely small, infinite density,
infinite temperature. As they collapse, they retrace the steps in the Big
Bang.

I made the proposal that as this happened, the "inflationary" episode of the
Big Bang would be retraced inside that Black Hole mass, and that would mean
that rather than matter coming out of the vacuum as happened during the Big
Bang inflation, the matter would go back into the vacuum. This is based on
somewhat generally accepted Big Bang inflation-era physics.

If we suppose that to be the case, then the following happens:

1. 1/3  the mass of each supermassive star, or about 1.3% of the mass of the
universe would vanish (this is based on details as to how black hole
collapse happen in supermassive stars. The collapsing "stream" breaks into
segments).

2. This would send out a gravitational pulse detectable in the Weber-style
gravitational wave detectors at the rate of about 12/day seen by Weber (his
observed rate was 17/day). But Weber had been discredited because he was
seeing things that could not be there! Those of you who were at the Dallas
(as I remember) Texas PA meeting may recall Feynman ridiculing Joe Weber,
and may remember I stood up to take issue with him, both about Weber and
about his trite remarks about parapsychology. "Professor Feynman, I know
Professor Weber. I am sure if he were here, he would be able to adequately
defend his work. I am sure that I speak for everyone in saying I am
disappointed with your talk. I was hoping you would talk to us about
something you have expertise in, namely theoretical physics. Many of the
people here have more knowledge in experimental design than you have and
probably know more than you about statistical procedures." At the time I had
worked out some of the details having to do with this proposal I am
discussing here.

3. This would also result in the gamma ray bursters seen at the rate of
1/day (the rate is calculable) with gamma rays at 300 Kev red-shifted  down
from their original neutron-mass energy of 300 Mev. (The red shift comes
from the fact that they are at the edge of the expanding universe.) This
1/day rate is lower than that of the gravitational pulses seen by Weber
because the gammas can be absorbed and scattered in the dense environment of
the early universe while gravitational effects are not. The difference given
here is a calculated result.

4. The loss of matter would mean that the density of the universe would go
immediately from 100% of critical density for flatness to 98.7%.

5. As time passed, this 1.3% short-fall in density at universe-age of
300,000 to 1 million years would become a 95% absence of matter at present,
about 13.8 billion years. Because astronomers cannot find the 100% matter
for critical density needed for flatness, they have invented dark matter to
make up for what is missing from their theory.

6. As the density dropped further and further from criticality for flatness,
the expansion would accelerate (as I said back in 1990), giving the
impression of an accelerating force, or dark energy.

7. When the 1.3% mass was lost, the rest of the 4% in these superstars, 2.7%
of the mass of the universe, would be expelled in the resulting explosion as
mass-loss resulted in the loss of gravitational confinement.

8. This 2.7% would come out as neutron star matter and decay into the 2.7%
of the now observed 3% heavy element content of the universe, the remaining
0.3% being formed later by stragglers and more recent supernovas.

9. The proposal removes the so-called "bounce problem" having to with
understanding how supernovas work in detail. (It is presently proposed that
this comes about from turbulence -- a catch-all.) Actually, the mass loss
that happens at the end of the black hole formation when the mass vanished
into the vacuum results in a loss of gravitational confinement in the
supercompressed left-over neutron star.

10. There happens to be a gap in the way super-massive stars behave when
they collapse. This gap comes between 500,000 solar masses and 750,000 solar
masses. The result is that the distribution of the gamma ray bursters would
be bi-modal. This is an otherwise unexplained aspect of the observed data
for gamma ray bursters.

This is hardly exhaustive. I
could go into further details of the Robertson-Walker-Friedmann model of
general relativity and how that mathematics gives rise to these effects and
the development of the universe, but more of that can be found and read at

So according to you it's acceptable to be brave ONLY when fulfilling 
contracts.

Will it be your (15th century) opinion that citizens have a contract 
with each other implicit in their organization as a country by virtue 
of their birth?  Dusting off the REALLY old books, huh?

Apparently not.  Don't watch the news much, do you?

In any case, I'm not advocating stupidity, but bravery.  Bravery and 
cunning are both virtues of a warrior.

Right, they'd be brave.  Not only would the face death if needed, but 
they would kill if needed.  We agree, you just don't like to call a 
spade a spade - These "calm, smart, relentlessly rational, long-term 
thinkers" who are willing to "face death if needed" are just brave.

Maybe it's a language thing.  You seem to be thinking of the word 
"Foolhardy" not "Brave".

That's awfully hotheaded of you.

Will you be giving a formal proof of this or do you have it on God's 
authority?  Well, you did leave "self-interest" open to be defined any 
way you want so your statement here could be equivalent with "Whenever 
you project the outcome of goodness it becomes identical with goodness" 
which is clearly so, but not apparently what you're claiming.  To give 
this any sense at all you're going to have to define self-interest.  
It's doubtful that you could do this without reference to goodness.  
cf. Principia Ethica.

Doubtful.  Calm rationality and long-term outlook has made this world 
the way it is NOW.  Is this the best world there can be? (in something 
more than a tautological sense.)

Hello,

As one of the several list moderators, I noticed this morning several
replies where messages were quoted largely intact with brief responses.
This proves to be burdensome because one actually has to spend time
scanning the message to find the actual response and then puzzle over
perhaps what points in the original message/conversation were being
commented on.

We all have limited bandwidth.  I am certain that there are some list
members that tend to scan based on message size (small messages get
read, large messages don't).  It helps the list <significantly> if,
when one writes a reply, one takes the time to trim a response to only
include the most significant part(s) of the message being responded to.
We have the list archives as well as the Javien forum -- it is very
easy for people to go to these sources to determine the context of
a response if it is unclear from any quoted parts.

Thank you,
Robert

This note is about life from another 'world', still on Earth.

http://www.educeth.ch/stromboli/perm/lengai/index-en.html

"Introduction

Ol Doinyo Lengai is an extraordinary stratovolcano in northern
Tanzania (2.751°S, 35.902°E, 2890m, map) producing
natro-carbonatitic lava, very rich in sodium and carbonates. It is
highly fluid and emerges at 500 to 590°C only. It glows dull red in
the dark and is the «coolest» lava of any known volcano. Major ash
eruptions were observed in 1917, 1926, 1940 and 1966-67 (image).
Since April 1983 lava has been extruded and gradually has been
filling up the summit crater[...]"

A friend of mine returned from here recently, and now his
photos are online. His images of this volcano from August 2003
are at the following pages.

This reminds me of a question posed by maternal grandfather
(not for the first time I'm sure) and despite being a theist so far
as I could tell.

If God can do anything can God make a rock so heavy he
cannot lift it.

A bit glib in a way but it gets at the essential contingent nature
of the world as we experience it. What is light without dark.
Pleasure without pain. Victory without struggle. Heroism and
nobility without the freedom to fall short of such.

One could refrase as Damien S does, that indeed if google can
be broken, google is (by most notions) not god.

Not so Robert. Not if we are to engage sportfully in the the weaving
of economical plausible myth, a passtime that I'd hold has been
a rationalising function since time immemorium.

The theist does not need to posit many worlds merely two. On in
which all that appears nasty and petty in this one (merely half of the
whole) stands as a challenge to heroism and nobility of character
in its participants. It is not, so far as can see that suffering and
hardship cannot be part of a best of all possible world it is only that
these things cannot be mitigated. Simply posit as some religions do
that there is an acounting at the end of ones life and that justistice is
metered out before one is usured into the alternate half of the universe
with appropriate karmic adjustments for good and bad performance
and you have a system (it seems to me) where all suffering and struggle
can be a means of elevating and promoting that which is good and
noble within us. This world alone cannot be the best of all possible
worlds, but this world plus just one other, not multiple others would
seem to permit a situatiuon where karma can carry across the two
worlds and real heroism and nobility can exist perhaps precisely
because we cannot know that justice is done in the one necessary
other world. Yet justice *could* be done in that one other world.

Just a simple playful musing, from an amateur mixer and melder of
myths. But one in which all things including evil things in part of a
world could be seen as good to god if they stimulated complexity and
if all pain is mitigated in this world is mitigated or justified in that
other
world and is part of the necessary challenges of this one.

Didn't see the show so ya lost me in the last bit about the

"Stupid is as stupid is" *is* pretty hard to argue with ;-)

A "resume" for GW Bush currently circulating on the web, worth reprinting 
here, I think:

I spent the U.S. surplus and effectively bankrupted the U.S. Treasury. I 
shattered the record for the largest annual deficit in U.S. history. I set an 
economic record for most private bankruptcies filed in any 12-month period. I 
set the all-time record for the biggest drop in the history of the U.S. stock 
market. I am the first president in U.S. history to enter office with a 
criminal record. I set the the all-time record for most days on vacation in 
any one year period. After taking-off the entire month of August 2001, I then 
presided over the worst security failure in U.S. history. I attacked and 
overtook two countries, promised to rebuild them and have not yet done so. I 
am supporting development of a "Tactical Bunker Buster" nuke, a WMD. I am 
getting our troops killed, under the lie of WMD components, then blaming the 
lie on our British friends and the CIA, where, coincidentally, my daddy used 
to lead. I set the record for most campaign fund-raising trips by a U.S. 
president. In my first year in office over 2 million Americans lost their 
jobs and that trend continues every month, leaving us in higher than ever 
unemployment.

I set the all-time record for most foreclosures in a 12-month period. I 
appointed more convicted criminals to administration than any president in 
U.S. history. I set the record for least amount of press conferences than any 
president since the advent of television. I signed more laws and executive 
orders effectively amending or ignoring the Constitution than any president 
in history. I presided over the biggest energy crisis in U.S. history and 
refused to intervene when corruption involving the oil industry was revealed. 
I presided over the highest gasoline prices in U.S. history and refused to 
use national reserves as past presidents have done. I have cut health care 
benefits for war veterans and support a cut in duty benefits for active duty 
troops and their families -- in war time. I allowed non-compete oil contracts 
to go to my VP's company (where he is still employed, but on "deferred 
compensation") and won't answer to anyone about it. I have set the all-time 
record for most people worldwide to simultaneously protest me in public 
venues (15 million people) shattering the record for protest against any 
person in the history of humankind. I've dissolved more international 
treaties than any president in U.S. history.

I've made my presidency the most secretive and unaccountable of any in U.S. 
history. I'm proud that the members of my cabinet are the richest of any 
administration in U.S. history. My "poorest millionaire," Condoleeza Rice, 
has a Chevron oil tanker named after her. I am the first president in U.S. 
history to have almost all 50 states of the Union simultaneously suffer 
massive financial crisis. I presided over the biggest corporate stock market 
fraud of any market in any country in history. I am the first president in 
U.S. history to order a pre-emptive attack and the military occupation of a 
sovereign nation, and I did so against the will of the United Nations and the 
world community. I created the largest governmental department bureaucracy in 
the history of the United States.

I set the all-time record for biggest annual budget spending increases, more 
than any president in history. I am the first president in U.S. history to 
have the United Nations remove the U.S. from the Human Rights Commission. I 
am the first president in U.S. history to have the United Nations remove the 
U.S. from the Elections Monitoring Board. I removed more checks and balances, 
and have the least amount of congressional oversight, than any presidential 
administration in U.S. history. I rendered the entire United Nations 
viewpoints irrelevant. I withdrew the U.S. from the World Court of Law. I 
refused to allow inspectors access to U.S. "prisoners of war" (detainees) and 
thereby have refused to abide by the Geneva Convention. I am the first 
president in history to refuse United Nations election inspectors (during the 
2002 U.S. election).

I am the all-time U.S. and world record-holder for receiving the most 
corporate campaign donations. My largest lifetime campaign contributor, and 
one of my best friends, (Kenneth Lay, former CEO of Enron Corporation) 
presided over the largest corporate bankruptcy fraud in U.S. history. My 
political party used the Enron private jets and corporate attorneys to assure 
my success with the U.S. Supreme Court during my 2000 election decision. I 
have spent more money on polls and focus groups than any president in U.S. 
history.

I garnered the most sympathy for the U.S. after the World Trade Center attacks 
and less than a year later made the U.S. the most resented country in the 
world, possibly the largest failure of diplomacy in world history. I am 
actively working on a policy of "disengagement" creating the most hostile of 
Israel-Palestine relations in at least 30 years. I am the first to have a 
majority of Europeans (71%) view my presidency as the biggest threat to world 
peace and security. I am the first president in history to have the people of 
South Korea more threatened by the U.S. than by their immediate neighbor, 
North Korea. I changed U.S. policy to allow convicted criminals to be awarded 
government contracts. I set an all-time record for the number of 
administration appointees who violated U.S. law by not selling their huge 
personal investments in corporations bidding for U.S. contracts.

I failed to fulfill my pledge to capture Osama Bin Laden, dead or alive. I 
failed to capture Saddam Hussein. My family is very close with the Saudi 
Royal family, and have been for years, so I kept the pages out of the report 
on 9-11 that may put the Saudi's in a bad light. I failed to capture the 
anthrax killer who tried to murder the leaders of our country at the U.S. 
Capitol Building. I have no leads and no credible suspects. Following the 
World Trade Center attack I have successfully prevented any PUBLIC 
investigation into the biggest security failure in the history of the United 
States. I removed more freedoms and civil liberties for Americans than any 
president in U.S. history. In a little over two years, I created the most 
divided country in decades, possibly the most divided since the Civil War. I 
entered my office with the strongest economy in U.S. history and have turned 
every single economic category downward -- all in less than two years.

Records and References: I have at least one conviction for drunk driving in 
Maine. My Texas driving record has been erased and is not available. I was 
AWOL from the National Guard. I refuse to take a drug test or even answer any 
questions about drug use. All records of my tenure as Governor of Texas are 
now in my father's library, sealed, and unavailable for public view. All 
records of SEC investigations into insider trading or bankrupt companies are 
sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public view. All records or minutes 
from meetings that I, or my Vice-President, attended regarding public energy 
policy are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public review.

(Apologies to the original author...couldn't find any accreditation for the 
above piece.)

This seems Extropic...

MIT Everywhere
Wired Magazine, Issue 11.09 (September 2003)
http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.09/mit_pr.html

I do highly value the "standard" educational process
(I've had a few professors that won Nobel prizes -- and
some that didn't (no nobel prizes for "history") who were
still outstanding).  But I believe that at $41,000/yr
(is that what MIT really costs now???) quality education
may be "overvalued".  Given the number of hits they are
getting it sounds like they could charge a lot less to a
lot more people and get a higher income.

Raises some interesting questions as to whether or not
the entire "university" system is now, or is about to be,
"broken"?  I'd much rather do distance learning (if the
technology supports it) from the best 500 teachers in the
world than attend lots of classes from mostly so-so professors
or teachers.

Then of course one gets into the question of whether the
way to decrease educational costs (and indirectly taxes)
is to make all public school systems use distributed learning.
If a teacher can teach 10,000 instead of only 30, why not
allow them to do so?  (Of course some adjustment would be
required for "support/question" activities, but MIT seems
to have resolved some of that.)

Robert

You know what's funny here is that when things go bad, we blame it on the
president. When things go well, we give the president credit. But I hardly
thing that the President really has enough power to really change theses
things or create these problems.
Yes he has spent a lot of money on the military.
No he hasn't stepped up to the late on energy.
But really, the economy is it's own monster. It was slowing down prior to
Bush taking office. Sept. 11 didn;t help matters.
Sept 11 may have been an intelligence failure, but nothing is 100%. How many
tips do they really get on terrorist plots? How many turn out to be real?
How much can you change an organization like our intelligence community in
the 9 months that he had? You can;t shut down the airlines every time
someone threatens to attack our country.

I don't think what we did in Afganistan was wrong. They had it coming.
Iraq is a different story, Saddam is a bastard who kills his own people by
the thousands. He has needed to go for a long time. The world will be a
better place without him. Do the ends justify the means? I don't know.

Tax cuts are not bad. It's simply a matter of letting everyone keep a bit
more of their own hard-earned money rather than confiscating it. If we need
to balance the budget, we should be doing it by reducing our expenses.

I'm not a big fan of Bush, especially the way he invokes "God" at every
opportunity, but I think that this "resume" is rather juvenile and only
serves to polarize those that already dislike him. The President only does
what he thinks he needs to do to get re-elected. That's the way the country
was set up. To fix our problems, we need to change the way the people think,
not sit around and complain about our leaders.

Have you been actually listening to what the man says?  If he doesn't have the 
power then he certainly doesn't disagree with much of anything that is being 
done.  Quite the opposite.  If you believe the job has no real power then why 
do we even bother with presidental elections?    Ever head of executive 
orders?   The president actually has a great deal of power and it can do a 
great deal of damage in the hands of the wrong person.

The point is that Bush administration didn't do anything that helped either.

There is more than a little material out there that his administration was 
briefed that something like this, something very much like 9/11, was in the 
works.    But in any case his administration has actively suppressed full and 
impartial investigation into much of 9/11.

I won't go into the rather strange "they had it coming" at this time.  Nobody 
said Saddam was a nice guy.  But spending the US into oblivion to kick butt 
in various parts of the MidEast to little good effect hardly seems the mark 
of a good leader.

Actually it is not at all 'juvenile'.  What is juvenile at best is refusing to 
wake up and smell the coffeee.  It goes far beyond "dislike".  The man and 
his administration have objectively done much that lead to the reasonable 
conclusion of that they are a tremendous menace to this country, to the world 
and to all our fondest extropic goals. 

How do you "fix how people think" without putting out viewpoints such as this 
one you just called "juvenile".  It was intended to get people to think and 
question.

Maybe I was a bit too vague. He has executive powers, yes. But the "resume"
seemed to want to blame him for anything and everything that is going wrong
today, including the state of the economy. I really don't believe the
president has enough power to tank the economy, and if he did, why would he
do it?

This is a matter of hindsight being 20/20. The government cannot protect
anyone from a single nut or a bunch of fruitcakes that decide to murder
people. Any belief otherwise is simply a false sense of security. Freedom is
a double-edged sword. They may have made mistakes, but they are human and do
make them occasionally. We all do. I think this would be a similar problem
in any admistration, not just Bush.

One can hardly say we are spent into oblivion. We are here. The 1980s showed
that we can function quite fine with deficits and debt. But yes, I do agree
with your point that it has had little affect and as such hasn't been a
smart thing to do.

I disagree. I don't see them as a tremendous menace. More like a thorn in my
side. They are pretty much like the others before them. I see two menaces,
an educatinal system that fails to educate and a religious majority. Until
these are fixed, our leaders will continue to make decisions that hurt us.
And they won;t "fix" these because that is where their power comes from. It
has to come from us.

OK. If that was the intention, I'll grant that. It just seemed to me to be
more of a superficial attack rather than an informative piece. It doesn;t
get into the details very much.

### It is necessary to be brave only when fulfilling contracts, a subtle yet
important distinction. Non-contractual bravery may not be demanded - only
freely accepted obligations, such as in a contract (by definition, a
contract exists only in the absence of force or fraud) can be enforced.

### No, I explicitly reject the idea of the social contract. A contract may
exist only between sentients, to a much lesser extent between groups of
sentients, never between monopolistic (state, oligarchy, etc.) wielders of
power and individuals. A contract must be explicit to be enforced.

### I'd rather think that what I refer to is not bravery, just rationality.
"Bravery" is a term too burdened with tribalistic, gory images. The
Invariants in "Golden Age" (John C. Wright) are not brave, merely calmly
rational, incapable of fear, incapable of bravery. This is my ideal.

### It is not my prerogative to define other sentients' self-interest for
them. I can however hypothesize that it is, similar to mine, the achievement
of whatever goals they act to achieve, ideally in the presence of sufficient
information needed to evaluate those goals in reference to other goals they
strive for. Therefore, "goodness" is for me getting what humans really want,
and the ideal society is the one that best serves the achievement of the
average Rawlsian human's goals, including my own personal goals. Goodness is
then defined in the context of my self-interest, not the other way around.

The best teacher in the world, on disk, no appointment
necessary, no geographical limitations, and for only
pennies (charge more and the disk will be pirated. 
Get over it.)

That's the new era.  Hurrah!

Just a few days ago I googled up some cytology and
histology.  A full bore cirriculum with links galore
and graphics.  I did the same several years back, and
it only gets better by the day.

I would think the business model would be built around
gathering the appropriate links for a comprehensive
cirriculum, then testing, then certification.  Maybe
an online forum for that P2P personal touch.    

Best, Jeff Davis

Technically, she is correct.  There is a reason we
call our desired state "transhuman" or "posthuman": it
is not humanity as we currently know it.  The
difference lies in the valuation: she values humanity
in and of itself, presenting the unknown and imperfect
as intrinsically worth saving in their present state.
We reject that point of view, at least with respect to
our own lives.  (If others wish to remain in the dark,
that in itself is their right - though it does not
excuse any actions they may take out of that ignorance
that harm others, and we may view education to remove
the igorance as the most expedient way to prevent such
actions.)

PowerPoint Is Evil. Power Corrupts. PowerPoint Corrupts Absolutely. PowerPoint

There's always a choice between treating well-phrased nonsense kindly and

The case is a lot stronger than hindsight being 20/20.  Why exactly would his 
administration purposefully thwart a full public investigation of 9/11?   
This doesn't make a lot of sense to me unless there is something highly 
untoward or embarrassing.   The "national security" dodge doesn't cut it as 
it isn't that difficult to do a satisfactory public report that does not 
expose critical information about our intelligence and counter-terrorism 
abilities.  

Bush and company not only made mistakes but are working diligently to not let 
them come to light.  So much so they are eviscerating normal review process, 
FOIA, and other checks.    This is out of order for any American 
administration and must stop.

Ah, I wish to hell we had only as much national debt and only as large 
deficits as we had in the 80s!   It was pretty damn obvious going in that 
Iraq did not make a lot of sense.  Afghanistan could "almost" be excused as 
reaction.   But there is no sign we have really learned at the official 
level.  What very expensive stupidity will it be next that we do that we 
later excuse as "just being human" and making mistakes?  Of course Iraq never 
was about WMD and certainly was never about freeing the Iraqi people from 
Saddam.   The most rational explanation (I am not fully sure this 
administration deserves that much benefit of the doubt) is that we greatly 
fear the coming blow-up of Saudi Arabia and what it will do to utterly 
devastate our economy.  So we needed a reason to grab some fall back reserves 
and to set up a strong military presence next door.    It would be nice if 
they just said so next time instead of causing so many people to turn 
themselves into intellectual pretzels attempting to buy or deny the official 
story at face value.

Then watch and learn.  I hope you learn quickly enough to make a bit of a 
difference.   This administration is cashin in on a lot that has gone before 
plus 9/11 in order to take the gloves off and do publicly much that would 
never have been tolerated eariler.  The menace is both what they have already 
done, overtly and covertly AND what the next group in power will do starting 
from that base.

I agree very much that those in power want and need unthinking and religious 
excuses for unthinking.   But we need to expose what they want to use these 
blank checks for in order to stop them.  Until we do we will not be able to 
turn the unthinking ignorance around.   It takes time to train minds, time to 
eschew the poor programming we ourselves have suffered and reprogram.   I 
doubt we have enough time for this effort alone to be sufficient.

I think it was meant as a summation.  Most people do not have that long of an 
attention span.  They forget parts of the pattern and how and when many 
things became as they are today.   They hear the current soundbites and do 
the predicatable reactions as planned to those soundbites.

There is a woman in Nigeria who may be stoned to death
for extramarital copulation.  If she is, do you suppose 
the rest of the world will stand idly by and let that happen?  
If we do, will we be able to face ourselves in the mirror?  
Should we not rush in there and topple the "government" 
that would carry out such an reprehensible act?

Yes, we will after speaking our minds to whomeever will listen and perhaps 
supporting legal efforts on her behalf.

Yes again.   We face ourselves in the mirror every day knowing that countless 
atrocities and senseless barbarisms are being carried out all over the world.

This is spectacularly interesting simple technology:

http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/08/18/1061059764568.html

Technology developed by a team of Sydney physicists holds the
 potential to generate huge savings on lighting by channelling
 daylight into offices and workplaces deep within buildings. 

 The daylighting unit, which has been patented, uses a sandwich of
 fluorescent dye-infused plastic material as the medium for carrying
 the natural light. 

 The collector, as demonstrated to reporters in Melbourne today, is
 compact and light is chanelled into flexible polymer sheeting,
 which carries it to wherever it is needed. 

 Natural light can be distributed into the darkest recesses of
 buildings via what can appear to be conventional light fittings or
 sculptural mouldings.
[etc]

==========================

It blocks the IR and UV components yet lets through a spectrum that looks
like sunlight; even though only 7% of the light gets through, it's enough
to emulate a 60 watt light bulb. Run it down to the cellar, get rid of
those SAD blues.

They expect something to be on sale in about a year.

This is non-shrill, but it's the more profoundly chilling for that. What
sort of pleasantly non-shrill lunacy is this? How would, and should, we

Why would they wish to do so if the goal is so repellant?

There was an Amnesty International petition I posted to the
list back on August 14. They claimed that a previous petition
had saved another woman from the same fate. 
http://www.extropy.org/bbs/index.php?board=67;action=display;threadid=56774
The 27th of August seemed to be a key date according
to the petition organisers.  I'm now note the hearing has been
posponed until the 25th of September so folks can still sign it 
if they want to do something concrete on a personal basis.

I don't think it is useful for us to think in such broad terms as
"the rest of the world". As individuals we have, or can have,
more power than that.

No Spike "we" shouldn't. Not in my opinion. Not unless we
understand the wider ramifications. The wider ramifications
of usurping the UN and the sovereignty of countries is not
something we should do unless we know what it is that we are
doing. 

I do not think the majority of people who "supported" the US
led invasion of Iraq understood what was being given up. Probably
neither did the majority of those (in the world) that opposed it.  

We can't triage well unless we can see the costs as well as the
benefits. 

I did not think the US should have invaded Iraq against 1441
and the UN because I did not think the end justified the means.
I still don't. 

I spent quite a bit of time messing about (or actually I was being
quite serious) trying to find game theoretical solutions to the Iraq
problem as it was unrolling. I thought I found it but I could not
communicate it. The problem in communication was in part
because the issues were complex and peoples emotions were
up, but in large part it was because most folks (including me until
too late) did not have a sufficient understanding of the UN charter
and of the nature of sovereignty to weight the arguments properly.

If we are going to start asking ourselves how we will look at
ourselves in the mirror if we don't take action maybe we also
start asking ourselves how well we appreciate such important
topics as say the US constitution (and the UN charter though
I think the UN charter is pretty much a dead duck now). If we
are not ready, and cannot bring an adult understanding to such
topics then our emotions and prejudices are unlikely to equip
us to do the triaging that is necessary.

Without having a view on international law that has some 
coherence, I can't see that one can responsibly advocate either 
rushing in against international treaties and the principle of 
sovereignty or not doing so. 

I think it behoves those who are intellectually, economically
and geographically able to inform themselves of at least the
basic principles of existing international law and of the US 
constitution so that they can be better lobbyists and triagers
within the system that currently prevails. 

Regards,
Brett

On the contrary, I see this planet as entering
an era where humanity may in fact intervene against
any nonnuclear government to put a stop to basic human
rights violations, such as this blatant example.

I would certainly hope so.

I very much agree that there are real dangers in what the NEXT
US administration or any US administration coming after the
current one may find and feel itself empowered to do. 

I do NOT see President Bush as an evil or Hitler-like character,
but I DO think that the US is now riper and more receptive for
the rise of a genuine Hitler-like regime than ever before.

Couldn't I be brave solely in relation to familial and filial 
relationships and be a complete coward when it comes to fulfilling my 
contracts?

Example: if I fail to deliver a piece of equipment to you on monday 
because some troglodytes were cutting off the road and I didn't feel 
like running the gauntlet, then according to your moral system I should 
be blamed because obliged due to contract?

>  A contract must be explicit to be enforced.

However, lacking any explicit agreement with my children about when I 
will be there to save them, if II fail to pass the road due to 
cowardice on my part and my son dies as a result with my full 
knowledge, I'm not to be ashamed or blamed?

But we're very close.  There is a familial and filial contract implicit 
in human-being but state-enforced contracts almost always arise as a 
result of coercion.  Similarly economic contracts tend to be backed by 
force and coercion either explicitly or implicitly.  An example of an 
IMPLICIT form of coercion might be forcing people to take minimum wage 
jobs and drive three hours to their work because that's the only work 
available for them - and because the education system set up to provide 
them with necessary skills to either provide for themselves or get 
better jobs has utterly failed them, but apparently deliberately.

Have you heard of the "Learn to Work" program?

It's another word-game, apparently directed at emotivism.  I suggest 
that your attempts to curb the use of emotionally laden words in this 
context is just ridiculous.  Cowardice and Bravery and Goodness are 
emotionally laden terms.   If we didn't CARE about what we were doing, 
then there would be no good, no bad, no cowardice, not bravery, not 
even any "calmly rational".  All words are value laden, some of those 
values are more emphatic than others.

All you really do by setting up such dichotomies is to change the word 
game, the question then becomes WHY are you changing the word-game?  
What does it gain you to change the word-game?   Why not adopt bravery 
and help people see bravery "your way"?

Getting what WHICH humans really want?  If your predictive statement 
"Goodness is what tends to produce good results in the long-run" is to 
have any force, you're going to have to say which humans, since 
different humans want very very different things.  It doesn't help to 
move it up to "on the average" at the societal level since it may be 
that 1)  people don't have large-scale agreements about what is good 
and 2) "on the average" what people want isn't very good.

"Most People" want to gain at other people's expense.  It's the first 
rule of capitalism - buy low, sell high.  We can call this the modern 
equivalent of original sin.

"Most People" don't agree about what they want - shoot, most people 
don't even know what they want themselves.  But just about EVERYBODY 
can tell you whether or not you should torture children.  Good is much 
more concrete than this abstract "what people want" thing.

Definitely.  On the part of a few very wealthy and powerful people who 
have had and continue to have extraordinary power.

It's the explanation for why the same group of people, generation after 
generation, enjoy privilege and rank while their counterparts though no 
less intelligent, talented, ambitious and cunning, fail to ascend to 
the ranks.

This group of people changes occasionally during revolutions (usually 
followed immediately by an equally terrifying bunch, sometimes by the 
same terrifying bunch that was just ousted), but by-and-large, yes, 
calm, collected, coldly rational self-interest drives the ruling 
classes methods for controlling the rabble.  This is why, for instance, 
George H.W. Bush didn't have his son sent to war but was perfectly 
happy to send lots of other people to die there.

Best,

What do you think "Shock and Awe" means from below?

The pretty pictures you see on TV of nice lights lighting up the desert 
sky are really, every one of them, horrifying, evil and atrocious acts 
of murder.

That we are not ALL completely horrified that there were two wars that 
didn't need to happen is a sign that in fact we are already living in 
Die Neue Reichstadt and that a Hitler-Like character has already taken 
over.

Ouahou*! Nice indeed. The web site is at http://ocw.mit.edu/

One reservation, though. I browsed some courses I was interested in,
and couldn't find actual course materials. Syllabus, yes, Calendar,
yes, Readings list, yes, Assignments, yes, Exams, yes, Related
resources, yes, but where are the actual contents?

After some more frustrating clicking and wondering what obvious thing
I could be missing, it turned out that, unless there is a "Lecture
notes" entry on the left, no actual course materials are included,
only the "meta" stuff. Based on my tries, most courses have no lecture
notes, and within the minority that have Lecture notes, most have only
a few items (like, lecture 1, 2, 7, 14 and 16).

I loudly applaud (shouting a bit, too) to the fantastic initiative,
and just hope it comes into existence on a larger scale. (In the
meantime, they should make this more explicit.)

(And, they could go one step further by granting commercial use. For
scientific content largely based on collective effort, it might make
some philosophical sense.)

I try to stay out of discussions of contemporary partisan politics on this
list, because I think they have only limited relevance and it's extremely
hard to manage the risk that they will spiral out of control into
personalistic flame wars.  But I feel compelled to speak up here.  I will
*NOT* engage in any kind of tit-for-tat discussion or argument about the
subject of this thread, but I feel the need to note my distaste for the
original message in this thread and the tone of posts like this.

I've worked in the legal system of the United States every day for the last
19 years.  I've also studied the rise of fascism and other totalitarian
systems in the 20th century as a major personal interest for over 30 years.
With that base of experience and knowledge, I find that likening the Bush
administration to Nazis utterly *absurd*.  Yes, there have been some
curtailments of civil liberties in some very, very few cases that have an
arguable connection to *foreign* terrorism.  That I know of, there have been
no real curtailments of civil liberties in wholly domestic cases.  None.
Might the cases involving suspected foreign terrorist activity be the first
trickle in some kind of tide that would roll back the main body of civil
liberties in the United States?  I personally doubt it very seriously,
although I'm glad they are taken seriously.  But they bear no resemblance to
the kind of wholesale destruction of civil liberties that accompanied the
rise of real totalitarianism to which this post makes a comparison.  Thus I
feel that calling the Bush administration "Die Neue Reichstadt" baseless.

Simply because it's been done to death here and serves no useful purpose *on
this list*, I won't address the points about U.S. foreign military activity.

Nah Robbie, if it makes sense to put horrifying on any sort of
sliding scale I think there have been some acts in wars that 
were more completely horrifying than those of the second 
gulf war and of Afghanistan. The concentration camps in 
WWII were more horrifying, and more depraved imo. I think 
it is important to keep our sense of proportion.  

Bush does not have Hilter's political and media savvy, not by
a long shot. I very much doubt he has Hitler's degree of single
minded ruthlessness either. But Hitler came to power in a set
of circumstances and using a background of propaganda and
fear that some astute political observers of modern American
might find provocative. Bush is a bungler, that he has done 
great harm is because he has great power and poor judgement
not because he has great malice.

Imo Bush intended and expected to get UN support for a 
second resolution. He expected to unearth WMD's. He did not
have the savvy to differentiate two key issues at the diplomatic
level and as a consequence he put many in the world offside
that might have been onside and the UN was wrecked at a time
when a brighter President might have re-invigorated it. 

The problem of Iraq and the UN (after resolution 1441 was
unanimously agreed too) was two problems not one. 

The second problem was the specific problem of Iraq, the 
great mistake made was in seeing that as the first problem.

The first was that the Security Council was the only body 
with the authority to authorise a go to war decision under
the special circumstances that prevailed. Yet the Security
Councils permanent members had no standard in place by
which any criteria to go to war in the interests of international
peace and security could be made.  It still has none. Chirac
was going about saying we will never, never go to war. Such
a statement made in the context of being specifically asked
as a permanent security council member for a practical 
standard would have been patently untenable in the court of 
world public opinion. And Bush would have been right to 
threaten to revoke the UN Charter on that basis and to
actually do it if it came to that. 

A murder trial even in France must balance the risks between
sentencing an innocent man and letting a guilty one go free.
Jury decisions acknowledge this when they are asked to 
decide guilty or not guilty of murder against a standard, in
this case against the standard of "beyond reasonable doubt".

The UN Security Council including France was obliged 
under the terms of the Charter to make a judgement in the
interests of international peace and security and yet Chirac
of France was able to not decide because Bush did not
challenge him to come up with a standard of proof for
any go to war don't go to war to apply both to Iraq and
for the UN in the future. Had Bush pushed for such a 
standard and Chirac not come up with one Bush could 
have argued legitimately that the UN could not function 
in its current configuration because one of the permanent 
security council members, France would not agree on a 
practical standard that balanced the risks in the new world
that includes terrorist organisations and actions of the scale
and sophistication of September 11. Bush had the move 
(if he had the sense to play it to isolate Chirac but he did 
not play it). 

Pushed to come up with a standard for UN go to war, 
no go to war decision Chirac would have had to come up
with a standard. A practical standard for a practical 
problem. The standard could have been fair and it could 
have been rational but in its absence the security council
cannot perform its task of maintaining international peace
and security.

Say the standard that Chirac had come up with was "on 
the balance of probably risk". Then the various countries
could have applied that standard, the risk of a go to war 
against Iraq, verses the risk of not going on the basis of 
information available and factoring for urgency. Information
which could have been provided in camera.  

Chances are, in hindsight, with such a standard, that the 
US would not have been able to make its case for a quick
invasion as it didn't have evidence of weapons of mass 
destruction. But had there been such evidence then the case
should have been able to be quickly. And the UN would
have had a working standard for dealing with Iran and 
North Korea and other rogue states.

Imo history provided a moment to a US President to put 
real teeth in international law, and to give the UN, in the 
interests of the US as well, real power. But through poor
diplomacy Bush blue it. He missed the shot. No other 
national leader was in a position to call for a standard
because Bush was controlling the clock, he had the military
in place and he was setting the timetable. He got the UN
to resolution 1441 and that is too his credit.

Only Bush could make the UN better, or if need be break
it in good faith in front of all the world because the French
or some other permanent member were being hopelessly 
intractable in refusing to even come up with a standard. 

Of all the options Bush could have chosen he chose the
absolute worst. He chose to keep the UN but breach 
the charter. And international law has been in a state of 
conspicuous farce ever since. Bush has the US in the
situation where it appears to respect international law only
when it suits it. And the world knows this. America 
historically has been better than that.  The world looks at
the mighty US military and thinks potential or actual
"protection racket". 

The reason that Iraq was not worth the price was that
the price was America's word in international law and
the final reduction of the UN to a farce by one man. 
President G. W. Bush. America still needs the UN but it
cannot imbue that body now with legitimacy as President 
Bush through diplomatic incompetence (not malice imo -
he did too many other things that make malice or deep 
planning a plausible explanation) took the principle role
in destroying it. It continues to exist now as a facade, that
few will dare to speak of burying but the logic of its charter,
the trust that nations especially permanent security council
members will abide by the Charter has been rent.

Not necessarily, Robbie.  The actual causalty count from that
initial bombing was remarkably light.  The midnight guided
bomb attack was targeted mostly on empty buildings and 
artillery batteries.  The Iraqi commanders (many of whom 
were sympathetic to the US) had enough sense to order 
their men away from those targets they knew would be 
destroyed.  There were a number of U.S. sympathizers or 
Saddam haters on the ground in Baghdad with cells phones 
and GPS, guiding the shots and reporting the outcomes.  

Of course, Saddam and his crew placed the SAMs and 
artillery among civilian population centers and
used Soviet GPS jammers to try to turn the bombing into
horrifying evil atrocious acts of murder, but the
sophisticated guided weapons still found their marks. 

The real horrifying evil and atrocious acts of
murder are yet before us: the Muslim world seems
bent on a civil war of utter self destruction, as 
demonstrated by yesterday's assassination of the 
Shiite cleric al Hakkim.  Over 100 innocents murdered 
as collateral damage, just to get this one guy.  

Watch in the next few weeks.  I fear we will see a 
murderous tit-for-tat in the middle east, one holy 
site after another blown to bits, a clear expression of 
homicidal Muslim self-hatred.

So you believe it is right and reasonable to have a rule of thumb that we will 
go in and impose our will, because of course we know best, on any supposedly 
soevereign nation that does anything at any scale that we find offensive?  
With the one caveat being that the nation we would impose our will upon 
cannot adequately defend itself against us?    Really?   

So Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan and so on had the right idea - put all 
the world under one authority?    This supposed right to intervene anywhere 
and everywhere that you would use today for a human rights violation, what 
would stop it being used tomorrow to enforce anything at all that the nuclear 
haves might consider advantageous to them?   On what principles would some 
things that we know better about be separated out from others as actionable 
offenses?  

When the US becomes unlivable for extropic values where will you go where you 
may carry on your work and your live with less interference?  Will you be of 
the same opinion when it is you and what you believe in that has the sword of 
anywhere-anytime force over your head?

I know all the freemarketeers here will love this essay from:

http://www.tradealert.org/view_art.asp?Prod_ID=879

Here is an excerpt:


Lower Import Prices Haven't Lifted Living Standards After All
Alan Tonelson
Tuesday, August 26, 2003

 With even normally free-trading Republican Congressmen up in arms
about globalization-related job loss, America's globalization-happy
economic establishment is preparing its counter-attack. Among the
trade-extremist bromides we're likely to hear most often is that
today's monumental import levels are blessings for all Americans
because they reduce consumer goods prices and thus raise real incomes.

America's working families, we're told, benefit most because, as U.S.
Trade Representative Robert Zoellick argues, "When trade is
restricted, hard-working fathers and mothers pay the biggest portions
of their paychecks for the higher costs food, clothing, and appliances
imposed through taxes on trade."

Unfortunately, there's no serious evidence to support these claims. In
fact, when you look at the effects of trade not only on consumer
prices but on wages and employment levels, it's clear that current
trade policies and their impact have been undermining American living
standards for decades.

Take the biggest picture macroeconomic data. American economic history
has long been a story of strongly rising real wages  that is, wages
adjusted for the effects of inflation. These wages  the best measure
of an American worker's value in the global labor market  were
critical engines of an equally strong rise in American living
standards. But during the 1970s, these engines stalled out.

Real wages for all private sector workers peaked in 1973 at $9.08 per
hour. Today, they've fallen to $8.33 per hour  more than 8 percent
lower. Two points stand out from this development. First, as Zoellick
has noted in speeches, this thirty-year period witnessed a more than
doubling of trade volumes and returns on international investment as a
share of the U.S. economy. Second, inflation-adjusted wages by
definition take into account the widely documented and dramatic fall
in the prices of most imported goods during this period.

The only reasonable conclusion possible: Even though trade has helped
bring lower consumer prices (along with more efficient production
methods and a continuing fall in the prices of most raw materials,
whether domestic or imported), wages have fallen even faster for the
typical American. And the onset of wage stagnation coincides almost
perfectly with the onset of the American economy's dramatic
internationalization.

Your distaste is duly noted.  However, I disagree.  It threw out a few talking 
ponts and gathered some of what I see as real problems with the current 
administration in one place.   Pure and simple.   I do not see what you could 
object to about that.  However, I do find some types of responses distasteful 
myself although only one so far in this thread.

You do not consider a very soft and flexible defintion of "terror" and "aiding 
and abetting terror" and the wholesale denial of fundamental rights once the 
label is applied (without formal proof) to be a real danger?  How is it not?  
You don't consider the government granting itself the power to search any of 
our homes with far fewer constraints than ever before and without our 
knowledge to be dangerous and against the intent of the Constitution?   You 
don't consider the possibility of being accused of terror for whatever 
reasons, stripped of all assets (even including citizenship), detained 
indefinitely, without trial or legal counsel to be a real danger?   Then 
what, pray tell, would you consider dangerous?

Obviously not.  It's an amazing part of the "Modern non-ideology" that 
it simultaneously makes absurd claims like yours below while claiming 
to be impartial and cooly objective.

The "Tit-for-tat" as you put it are the DETAILS on which any argument 
should be based, right?

That you find the likening to Hitler absurd is well, absurd.  Were you 
watching very carefully as our government bombed two relatively 
defenseless countries to smithereens while invading them in order to 
install puppet governments.

This is pretty precisely what Hitler did to middle-europe.

And apparently you don't notice that we are propping up a government 
that is bulldozing racially-identified houses while the occupants are 
in them and is holding upwards of 1 Million of "THEM" in "Camps".

I never even mentioned the civil liberties issue - you changed the 
subject.  What I said was that we bombed to smithereens thousands upon 
thousands of people in two countries while the American nation 
"appeared to applaud" like you're doing here.  What that means is the 
MORAL implications of killing someone has been sufficiently blurred by 
the propaganda machine of our country that "lots of people" think it's 
okay to use the Shock and Awe strategy.

But as long as you bring it up, ever heard of Jose Padilla who has been 
imprisoned without being charged for two years now despite several 
court orders?  Apparently they're considering moving his trial "out of 
the country" so that he's out of the jurisdiction of our courts.  After 
all, he is an American Citizen.  Then there's Sherman Austin.  The list 
is not small.

And then, of course, there's this one:

Fair enough, I won't say another word about it if you won't.  But 
controlling the discourse is rule number one isn't it?  I suggest "The 
Power of Ideology" by Istvan Meszaros as an interesting introduction to 
why political ideology is relevant for any utopian and ipso facto 
extropian subject matter.

I've seen people object to throwing "credential" authority around on the
list before, but I'm going to play lawyer here -- like I do in a courtroom.
When someone says a law says something, I (and the judges I practice before)
demand that I cite to specific language to support that assertion.  Here
you've made two specific assertions:

1) applying the label of "terror" and "aiding and abbetting terror" results
in a "wholesale denial of fundamantal rights" under PA and PAII.  What,
specifically counts as a "wholesale denial of fundamental rights" under the
cited statutes?  I'm particularly interested in ways in which *citizens* are
subject to such a result upon mere application of the cited labels.

2) Even more seriously, in the last list of horrors you provide, you say
that someone can be stripped of their citizenship without counsel or trial.
Again, I'd like to see how the laws you cite work that way.

Thanks.

How many people is it okay to kill for no apparent reason?

The latest number from: http://www.iraqbodycount.net/ is Min 6118, max

You think that the US occupation of Iraq and support for Israel's 
occupation of the West Bank has nothing to do with this?  That somehow 
it's THEIR FAULT?  That's called blaming the victim.

If you look at the material underpinnings, you would see the necessity 
of the war and of the backlash.  We need their oil (for now), if it 
becomes expensive, we take it because it's better for the 
military-industrial complex in the long run to have wars and take oil 
rather than pay for it.  With oil reserves running visibly low (most 
aggressive estimate I've heard is 17 years of oil left), it's no 
surprise that we're very very interested in the large oil producers 
right now.

This list has just gone through a paroxysm of anger and hurt over discussion
of current political issues.  Before continuing with this thread, please ask
yourself whether this is the right forum for discussions of this sort.
There are literally thousands of places on the net to discuss contemporary
political issues.  Other than those that bear DIRECTLY on the transhumanist
agenda, this isn't one of them.

I know it's hard -- I did it myself today; and I'm already very sorry that I
did.  I just got back from a trip to the grocery store and the short time
away from the house gave me time to think.  Nothing I write here about
current political issues is going to change the minds of anyone who posts
something that I find so problematic that I'm moved to post on it.  The most
that I get from such a post is the momentary venting of partisan anger.  I
have a blog where I can do that and, if anyone is interested in what I have
to say about politics, they can go there.  I know there's a feeling that one
must say something, lest what one finds to be an outrageous statement go
unchallenged.  But nothing is really accomplished by that -- everyone knows
there are multiple sides to the current issues, and nothing is accomplished
by making a small mark on a scoreboard to note that "here's someone on THIS
side of the issue."

I've given up on the idea of encouraging "civil dialogue" on contemporary
political issues: There will always be people who will push the rhetorical
heat up beyond what a civil discussion forum can tolerate.  Draconian
policing of the list is a last resort.  So let me please enter a plea to
simply leave off from discussion of the hot-button political and ideological
issues.

Extropes,

If a permanent member of the security council commits
acts which others see as justifying a
charter-authorized military response, and the
appropriate protocol is implemented so as to effect
such military response, is there any way for the UN to
get around the veto power of the offending member?  Or
to put it another way, does the law not apply (as in
"above the law") to permanent members of the UNSC
council?

One possible work-around that comes to mind is that
any act of such nature as to justify military 
"correction" by the UN would likely also be a charter
violation, and as such 'nullify' a state's
membership/voting privileges.

I can't answer the question exactly as asked, because I don't know what is
meant by "wholesale denial of fundamental rights." But I can tell you the
aspects of the PA's that disturb me. I'll start with a specific incident
that occurred around three months ago. A certain CPA was informed by the FBI
that he must turn over all the papers he held relating to one of his
clients, and that he would be in violation of the law if he informed his
client that the papers had been taken. The CPA, shocked at being told he
could not inform his client what had happened, called his own lawyer. The
lawyer himself had never heard of any such law. I had read the PA and told
the lawyer that, yes, amazingly enough, under this law the FBI could seize a
person's papers without ever informing the owner of the papers and could
even prevent the custodian of the papers from telling the owner. The owner
of the papers bore no resemblance to a terrorist.

In fact, Justice Department spokesman Bryan Sierra was quoted in the
Washington Post as saying "We would use whatever tools are available to us
to prosecute violations of any law," in the context of discussing the PA,
and the wording of the PA is such that it could be used against just about
anyone.

The 4th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution says: "The right of the people to
be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against
unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants
shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and
particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things
to be seized."

If you look at British common law from the 1600's on, and at U.S. case law
since the 4th Amendment, it's clear that secret "fishing expeditions" of the
sort that are being conducted under the PA are exactly the sort of
government behavior the 4th Amendment was meant to protect people from.

Here are some of the other provisions of the PA's that could be used to bad
ends:

--People can be detained in prison without charged with a crime and without
being allowed access to a lawyer and obviously, with no trial.

-- Bank accounts can be frozen without a court order.

--Information can be obtained about subscribers from ISP's, libraries, and
stores.

--Phone conversations can be monitored without a court order.

These broad powers invite fishing expeditions and invasion of privacy. I'm
rather sensitive about this, since my own property was invaded by the
police, without a warrant, under the direction of the BATF -- because BATF
agents flying over my land in a helicopter saw a Vitex tree growing on my
land and mistook it for marijuana. A very nervous young man held me at
gunpoint and could easily have made a mistake and blown me or my daughter
away. We did not even remotely fit the profile of "drug dealer" or "grower"
or any other sort of criminal.

As Lord Acton wrote in 1887, 'Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power
corrupts absolutely.' When there are laws on the books that give tremendous
power to one group of people over another, the power will surely be abused
in at least some cases.

Whether such abuses of power will be helpful enough in preventing terrorist
attacks to be worth the price is another question. I think not, particularly
when I see how laws that existed before the PA's were not and are not used
effectively. Based on the history I've read, I would predict that the
ordinary person will still be in about the same amount of danger of
terrorist attacks as he or she was before the PA's but will now be in danger
of acts by overzealous police as well.

... then why are the authors listed at the Extropy Shop - those that may not
have a DIRECT bearing on the transhumanist agenda per se - have a
right-wing/libertarian bent?  If I were new to transhumanism and went to the
Extropian site for the first time, I would observe some semblance of
politics (and why not? it's difficult to separate humans from politics).
Except, the Extropian site is not impartial - otherwise, maybe H.G. Wells
would be represented along with Ayn Rand:

http://www.extropy.org/shop/index.html

There are many shades of transhumanism, and some of them bear directly on
its agenda:

e.g. Transhumanist Socialism:

I say, what we need here is more levity.

Forgive me, as it may not have a direct bearing on the transhumanist agenda,
but Dave Barry once wrote ...:
"The Democrats seem to be basically nicer people, but they have demonstrated
time and again that they have the management skills of celery. They're the
kind of people who'd stop to help you change a flat, but would somehow
manage to set your car on fire. I would be reluctant to entrust them with a
Cuisinart, let alone the economy. The Republicans, on the other hand, would
know how to fix your tire, but they wouldn't bother to stop because they'd
want to be on time for Ugly Pants Night at the country club."

There is *no* charter-authorised military response against
a veto holding permanent security council member *unless*
that country does not exercise its veto in its own defence. 

It would be effectively impossible under the UN charter 
to invade any of the big 5 as they would veto it. Any
invasion even legitimate (morally) would break the charter.
(Please note I am not saying that there are no circumstances
where the Charter should not be revoked. Indeed I think
any country could (with morality and honor) unilaterally 
withdraw from the Charter if they stated that in their view 
the UN was unable to achieve its purpose under article 1
which is to maintain international peace and security.
- but that is a personal opinion based on logic and philosophy
not law.) There is no higher international law than the UN 
charter where it has jurisdiction (which is *not* everywhere,
eg. it does not have jurisdiction in domestic matters -such 
as stonings), the signatories to the charter itself agreed to
this in the charter.
 
> Or to put it another way, does the law not apply (as in

Not in the conventional sense. The UNSC is the highest
authority in UN. It is the force behind the UN and behind 
the UN World Court. There is no action that can be taken
against a UNSC member veto and still be a legitimate UN
action. Period. That is the strength and perhaps the 
weakness of the UN as it is currently configured by its 
present Charter.

Its a strength because its disperses the power of the UN
across 5 strong countries rather than just say one or two.
If China, Russia, the UK, the US, and France are in agreement
that's not a bad indication that something is geneuinely widely
supported in the world community and that was the case
with resolution 1441 relating to Iraq.

Its a weakness because when any of these 5 are themselves
playing up or violating the charter there is no mechanism
within the charter to expell them (because they can veto
their expulsion) and there is no force that can be legally
assembled to oppose them (as they would of course
veto the formulation of such a force). Much of the 
historic disastisfaction with the UN and its preceived
inconsistencies go back to that much misunderstood 
veto power of the big 5. The 5 victors of WW11.

Not clear what you mean here. Under article 51 any
country can defend itself against aggression until such
time as the UN gets involved. On this basis the pursuit
of the September 11 terrorists into Afghanistan would 
have been lawful in my opinion though a bit of a stretch.

And the UN may not get involved if one of the UNSC
members vetos involvement.

What made 1441 special was the US a permanent member
got the UN involved with Iraq and thereby waived any 
right it might have to attack Iraq on exactly the same 
grounds as the UN was considering action against Iraq.
The US, in my opinion, tried to do the right thing and
breath life into the UNSC and act lawfully. But in doing
so they went where they had never been before. They
put themselves, and their sovereignty in respect to one
particular domain under the UNSC voluntarily. Then they
stepped out when they didn't like the outcome. The stepping
out was unprecedented. A fabric of legal nonsense was
erected to try and avoid the perception that the stepping
out and acting without UNSC approval was not a breach.
It was a breach. But the breach ironically would not have
been a breach (or at least not a breach of such serious and
unprecedented consequences - a charter breaker if you will)
had the US not at some point been genuinely trying in good
faith to breath life into the UN. There is some tragedy there
(and for the US as well). The diplomatic failure was avoidable. 
Simple, but serious human error, (Bush's), at the highest level,
not malice in my view, brought about the current dispensation
where all international law is farce.

Brett Paatsch

I am sorry but as long as the discussion remains civil I thought it was 
perfectly fine to discuss political issues especially if they have some 
bearing on our abilities to accomplish our goals and retain our freedom to 
work toward those goals.  

Are you now requesting that I don't reply to your question asking for details 
of where these laws are in fact dangerous to some of our fundamental civil 
liberties?    I am confused by your getting so riled up.

To which Brett Paatsch responded:

Not clear what you mean here.

[Me again, to clarify]

As you observed,... 

[you]   "What made 1441 special was the US a permanent
member got the UN involved with Iraq and thereby
waived any right it might have to attack Iraq on
exactly the same grounds as the UN was considering
action against Iraq.

...the US signed on to resolution 1441, then went on
to attack Iraq unilaterally, and arguably in
violation--you used the term "breach"--of the charter.


Could such a breach be cause to impeach, nullify,
censure, limit, revoke, place on probation, etc, the
US or its power within the UN organization, and
thereby deprive the US of its UNSC veto power?

Realistically(to me anyway), in terms of realpolitik
this is far fetched to the point of absurdity, like
GWB being impeached by a republican-controlled
congress (House of Reps lays the charge, Senate
conducts the 'trial'.  Yeah, right.), for blatantly
fabricating a case for war, but I was just wondering.

The following excerpt from an article in Science magazine
of 29th August suggests there could be opportunities for 
some novel suggestions on which genomes could be most
usefully sequenced next.

-------------
Sequencers Examine Priorities
Jennifer Couzin

"Now that genomes can be decoded quickly, researchers are
debating how to choose which organisms to sequence next"

"...with all the "obvious" organisms--including the human, the 
mouse, and the rat--now sequenced, or nearly so, the genetics
community and NHGRI, its principal funder, are weighing how
to proceed. The country's three massive sequencing centers,
fearful of becoming mere factories churning out base after base,
are lobbying to preserve influence in choosing which organisms
to sequence and analyzing the genetic data they produce.
Scientists who mobilized around beloved animals, from the 
honeybee to the chicken, and won them a spot in the sequencing
queue are now wondering what they will target next.

The 30 to 40 prominent researchers who attended the meeting,
many of whom commented with surprise on its collegiality, 
agreed that sequencing should now be driven by biological 
unknowns rather than popularity contests. "We should turn
to using sequencing capacity to answer scientific questions 
that are of seminal importance," wrote Princeton University
President Shirley Tilghman in an e-mail message. And if that
means sequencing an organism "that by biologists' standard is 
obscure," she added, "so be it."

....

"Implicit in the choice of which genomes to sequence lies a 
greater uncertainty: If genomes should be selected based on 
the biological mysteries they could help solve, which mysteries
top the list? That was something last month's collegial meeting
steered clear of. "It delayed the hard issues," such as whether
to award one vertebrate at the expense of 40 Drosophila, with
their much smaller genomes, says Green. Which ones win out,
at least in the short term, will be a topic for another day."
-------

I used to have the view that sequencing whales and elephants,
animals with large numbers of cells, as cells are roughly the
same size in all organisms, and big beasts have more of them,
might tell us something useful about aging, dna repair and 
cancer avoidance. I seem to recall that Aubrey de Grey was
not convinced that this would shed all that much light. 

I wonder what folks interested in the aging process like Robert
and Aubrey would choose if they could get the genomes they
wanted sequenced soonest?

Regards,
Brett

No. Not there is simply *no* mechanism within the 
charter for censoring or expelling a permanent security
council member.

All resolutions moved to such an effect would not pass
that permanent members veto. There is *nothing* more
powerful in the UN Charter than a permanent security
council members veto as such can prevent any security 
council resolution. To find more power one has to
step outside the UN process and one can only do that
(in my opinion) by revoking the charter itself (and that
could only be a wholesale not piecemeal revokation). 

[The Charter can be found btw at
http://www.un.org/aboutun/charter/index.html ]

There is provision in the charter for expelling member
nations under Article 6 which states:

"A Member of the United Nations which has persistently
violated the Principles contained in the present Charter
may be expelled from the Organisation by the General
Assembly upon recommendation of the Security Council".

So the Security Council would first need to "resolve" to
expell a member before it could recommend the action
to the General Assembly. The veto of a permanent security
council member would prevent any such resolution being
made. 

There is no explicit provision within the Charter for 
winding it (the Charter) up. I would argue though that on
grounds of logic any agreement made between parties for
a purpose can be dissolved upon manifest evidence of 
prior bad faith in honouring the agreement by other parties.

In practice the US has the might to revoke the charter and
their would be no higher court of appeal, but it does not
need to. It has embarked into new territory where it just
disregards its obligations under the charter if it so chooses
and their is not higher mightier power to oppose it (not 
within the UN Charter). If the US (or any one country that
happened to be a security council permanent member)
went to far other nations might band together to form a new
force but they'd need to do it outside the UN umbrella.
Needless to say they'd be very careful about doing so.

At the risk of belabouring a point the US is a great country
with a fine history of jurisprudence and fairness but it has
made an error. The citizens of the US in my view (and not 
only them the citizens of the UK and Australia as well) 
were asleep on matters of international law when our 
governments were purporting to act on it. 

The reason for labouring this is that we should not fall asleep
again. International law matters. It is damn hard to do much
internationally without it. It must rate very highly in any
triaging exercise that we (educated humans) do. And it is not
necessary for countries to say they don't trust America or the
UK on matters of international law for them not to trust them.

My message is that Americas should be vigilant and look to
their own precious constitution, 
http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.overview.html
that they should take seriously their right and opportunity to 
vote and to speak their views because if they do not they may
find they do not retain them. More precious than your wage is
your vote and your right to try to persuade others of your views.  

The gulf war was a phenomenal display of the power of 
governments to control and direct the media to shift and shape
public opinion. In my view no single politician played that game
better than Australia's own PM, John Winston Howard though
he played it from a less important and less powerful position.

I'd sequence a large (really large) number of microbial genomes,
mostly from soil bacteria and fungi.  This would greatly speed up
the discovery of genes encoding enzymes that can break down stuff
that we can't (lipofuscin, A2E, oxysterols, amyloid, etc.), whose
administration (mostly by gene therapy) will be an indispensable
component of reversing aging.

Barbara, I have a lot of respect for your opinion, but I'd like to raise a
few points in response.

In connection with the first case, two comments.  First, presumably there
*was* a warrant issued by a court.  Did the CPA take the warrant to the
lawyer he consulted?  Did you see it? The second comment takes a little
explaining, but I can best illustrate it with a crack a federal judge made
in one of my cases.  One party was complaining about the actions of the
equivalent of FBI agents in the country of which my client was a native in
questioning some of my opponent's witnesses about an unrelated matter
(claiming, with no evidence, that acts of the state security police had been
instigated by my client).  Rejecting this, the judge said "That's what
police do -- they're always sticking their noses into places they don't
belong."  My point?  Liberty isn't self-executing and never will be.  If he
felt it wasn't justified, how active was the CPA in challenging the
investigation?  Police forces are *always* going to bump up against the
boundaries of their legal authority, even when they have only good motives.
It takes some push back *in individual cases* to keep them in line.  No
amount of legislation can make up for that -- although doctrines like
Miranda and "fruit of the forbidden tree" can help.

My second point is to ask whether the specific items you mention at the end
of your post are from the current law or the so-called "Patriot Act II."
The latter is a dead letter politically, as far as I'm concerned.  It'll
never get out of committee.

Finally, as I've said before and as you well know, Barbara, the machinery of
the legal system runs at its own pace, and people can become impatient while
that machinery does its work.  Challenges to actions under the enacted
Patriot Act are working their way up through the courts (I note that the
ACLU only filed their first, tentative challenge to core elements of it this
summer, nearly two years after it was passed).  But that's how law works --
it is only related to but isn't the same as politics, which works on a much
shorter time scale.  It takes time.  And I don't see any indication that the
courts won't enforce the Constitution when push comes to shove -- just look
at the recent shenanigans in Alabama (Nehemiah Scudder to the contrary,
Damien :-)

Let me see if I can make my ideas clear.  The *tone* of the original piece
in this thread was grossly partisan.  As others pointed out, the first part
of it was waaay over the top in ascribing problems with the economy to
George Bush.  Yesterday morning I heard an interview with an economist on
fairly left-leaning NPR (can't recall his name) in which the economist
pointed out that the over-all performance of the economy was a much larger
factor in the current recession and projected federal government budget
deficits than the Bush tax cut.  The recession was well under way when Bush
was elected and had so much more to do with the bursting of the dot-com
bubble than Bush fiscal policies that the kind of rhetoric in the original
piece was just silly.  The problem is that to those for whom a Republican
administration isn't automatically offensive, such silly rhetoric is
offensive and sets off partisan alarm bells.

The parts of the original piece about foreign policy are, as I said
yesterday, simply rehashing something that has been deeply problematic here.
To extreme partisans on both sides, it doesn't seem possible that a
reasonable person of good will could disagree.  Thus U.S. military action in
the Middle East gets called "Nazi" by one poster and  people on the extreme
of the other side consider opponents of military action Chamberlain-esque
pollyannas.  As I wrote last night, I honestly don't think it's possible to
have any kind of meaningful dialogue between the extremes on these issues.
(As an indication of where meaningful dialogue *is* possible, I give as an
example a group of my close personal friends who maintain a mailing list.
The list includes newspaper publishers, academics, state officials and many
lawyers.  I've known most of the people on that list for over 30 years, and
most of them are members of the Democratic party -- some very active in
politics.  We've discussed U.S. foreign policy without interruption for most
of those 30 years, the last two years no exception.  There's been
disagreement, but no lack of civility.  Interestingly, the majority of the
left-leaning Democrats on that list wholeheartedly supported -- and continue
to support -- U.S. intervention in Afghanistan, but opposed action in Iraq.
What I've never seen on that list of extremely well-informed people are
accusations of "Nazism" against the Bush administration, despite some pretty
powerful unhappiness about the 2000 election.)  The bottom line is that I
thought the original post was so extremely partisan that it *began* the
discussion in a way that discouraged civility.

I responded to your posts about the Patriot Act for three reasons.  First,
it happens to concern a subject about which I have some professional
expertise, so I'm genuinely curious how it is that my perceptions are so
different from yours.  To restate, I see the day-to-day workings of the U.S.
justice system all the time, and I don't see signs of a significant erosion
of civil liberties.  (To give one example, I'm working on a case now that
federal prosecutors have an interest in and that is "high profile,"
generating a lot of pressure on prosecutors to *get results*.  I don't see
prosecutorial misconduct or infringement of civil liberties, despite the
fact that the U.S. Attorney's office wants convictions *very* badly.)
Second, I specifically suspect that much of the "attitude" to the Patriot
Act derives from the draft of the terrible so-called "Patriot II"
legislation.  If I thought there was a chance that that legislation would
pass, I would be upset, but I don't.  As I said in my reply to Barbara
Lamar, I think the justice system in the U.S. is just beginning the
deliberate process of reacting to the first Patriot Act, and I expect some
significant limits to be placed on that legislation.  Finally, I also
suspect that much of the negative reaction to post-911 legal matters derives
from a failure to distinguish between the civil rights of citizens versus
those of non-citizens.  In responding to your post, I was trying to
determine to what extent opponents of the law were arguing that the full
Bill of Rights should be applied to non-citizens, a novel legal theory and
one I'd be interested in seeing arguments for, if they exist.

Whew! Treading on dangerous ground, Spike, asking people to make jokes
about libertarianism. Especially on this list. ;)

Dave Barry IS a libertarian - see:
http://www.theadvocates.org/celebrities/dave-barry.html
so he may be a bit reluctant to send them up.

Or, at least, he used to be a Libertarian. I found one comment on the
web "I think Dave Barry used to be a Libertarian, but since they have
become the Blue-Skinned Alien Abductee Party I haven't heard much praise
of those loons from him."


His humor is very much against big government.
But if he was to have a go at libertarianism he might say:

A libertarian would stop beside the man with the flat tire but only to
explain that emotionally he would really, really like to help him, but
it would go against his rational libertarian beliefs. He would explain
that it is for the man's own good to learn that occurrences like this
should be dealt with by self-reliance and advance planning via insurance
policies and contracts rather than ask for adhoc assistance as and when
required.

As he waves cheerily and drives off. a wasp flies in the window and
stings his ear. In shock, he waves frantically at the wasp, his SUV
veers off the road and rolls over, throwing him out. The man sits up,
just in time to see his SUV bouncing down the ravine to finally explode
in a ball of flame. He pauses, thoughtful for a moment, then looks 
round at the man with the flat tire and says 
"I think I can help you change the tyre now."  :)

Notice here that the content of the original piece is not judged for 
its veracity, just the "tone".  As for it's being "grossly partisan", 
just consider the other options:

"pleasantly partisan"
"commendably partisan"
"absolutely true"
"well thought-out"

>  waaay over the top in ascribing problems

Again, here, without going into the details of the actual facts of the 
matter (6.4% unemployment increase month after month for the duration 
of the Bush administration, exactly mirroring the negative unemployment 
from the previous administration). The term "waaay over the top" is 
well, "waaaay over the top".

So far that's "waaay over the top, grossly partisan" for the substance 
of your post.

> fairly left-leaning NPR

Here again "fairly-left-leaning" is a meaningless adjective.  What is 
"fairly left leaning" in detail?  Is it like a color-ascription?  From 
my point of view, NPR is a state-run apology machine for the 
liberal/conservative dichotomy which is itself just a propaganda 
technique for oligarchical control.

You may mean, as people often do, by "left-leaning" people who care 
about politics from the point of view of the citizenry and who attempt 
to explain the observed behaviour of politicans and political figures 
objectively in terms of their material grounds.  In that case, NPR is 
surely NOT left-leaning.

In any case, that's "fairly-left-leaning, waaay over the top, grossly 
partisan".

> Bush fiscal policies that the kind of rhetoric in the original
> piece was just silly.

Here again, we have a combination of half-truths "The recession was 
well under way" as if "the recession" is something objective, some 
single state of affairs that happened like a firestorm when it gets too 
hot.  "The Recession" if anything is the continuing lack of investment 
of capital in new ventures in the American Economy coupled with an 
unbearable tax burden and talent/resources drain of a war.  The lack of 
investment of capital in new ventures can be directly correlated to the 
perceived weakness in corporate debt which can be directly correlated 
to the terrifying failures on the part of the regulatory committees to 
keep the thieves in line.  The Banks simply don't want to pay for any 
more Ken Lay's and so they've redirected their debt portfolio to 
low-interest real-estate backed consumer loans.  This strategy is 
outlined in a Federal Reserve Bank circular which can be found at the 
new york Fed site.

Now we have "silly, rhetorical, fairly-left-leaning, waaay over the 
top, grossly partisan".

> silly rhetoric is
> offensive and sets off partisan alarm bells.

Who knows?  I think people appreciate just hearing the facts, the 
rhetoric is mostly transparent on both sides.  There's no doubt that 
people find Republicans offensive, whether or not they find knowing 
that there's a month-after-month increase in unemployment of more than 
6% shouldn't be offensive, people have a right to simply know.  Drawing 
conclusions from those facts isn't necessarily a partisan issue.

Economists generally look at the Material Basis for political impact.  
If you just do THAT nowadays, you get the "partisan alarm bells".  
Well, people need to be able to analyze their economic and political 
situation.

Now we have "offensive, alarming, silly, rhetorical, 
fairly-left-leaning, waaay over the top, grossly partisan".

> To extreme partisans on both sides, it doesn't seem possible that a

The keyword being "extreme".

Now we have "extreme, offensive, alarming, silly, rhetorical, 
fairly-left-leaning, waaay over the top, grossly partisan".

Maybe.  Why not try?  Let's start by not calling each other extremists.

You mean where the well-educated nice "lefties" hang out, as opposed to 
us mean-spirited, silly, fairly-left-leaning extremists?

> There's been

Civility is simply what the people in control want.  You have to ask 
yourself why the people who are NOT in control don't want civility.

When you have a genuinely open forum, it gets ugly and useless 
sometimes, but civility is just not an issue.  People should learn that 
debate of genuinely important issues is both - important, necessary and 
civil IN ITSELF and that sometimes it gets ugly.  The other option - 
silence - is simply unacceptable as it is just a transparent rhetorical 
tool equivalent to plugging your ears and saying you won't listen.

In any case, it's now:

  "un-civil, extreme, offensive, alarming, silly, rhetorical, 
fairly-left-leaning, waaay over the top, grossly partisan".

>  the majority of the

Now:

"minority, un-civil, extreme, offensive, alarming, silly, rhetorical, 
fairly-left-leaning, waaay over the top, grossly partisan".

opposite for wholeheartedly, half-hearted?

"half-hearted, minority, un-civil, extreme, offensive, alarming, silly, 
rhetorical, fairly-left-leaning, waaay over the top, grossly partisan".

Well, this other "dream-list" of well-informed civil democrats who 
uniformly and wholeheartedly supported the Afghan conflict sound like a 
bunch of (insert wimpy expletive here).

They're the "Good Left" as opposed to us "extremist, ignorant,

Now these are the bad-words you've used in this one post to describe 
people who don't agree with you.

The question you should ask yourself is WHO is responsible for the 
"extreme, offensive, alarming, silly, rhetorical, contentious, 
obstructionism, waaay over the top, grossly partisan dialogue."

That said, if you'd like to discuss the FACTS of the matter, we might 
have a place to begin.

Genuinely not meant contentiously,

In my opinion, the current jobs recession, like most recessions,  is
mainly about perceptions about whether it is wise to increase or
decrease or maintain spending.  These perceptions are very powerful
force vectors. When the November 2000 presidential election popular
vote/electoral vote crisis was ongoing, Bush (or his spokespeople)
began to speak about how the crisis needed to be resolved quickly (a
quick resolution being in his favor).  

During the height of the crisis, Bush said that unless the crisis was
resolved quickly, a recession might be precipitated. Well, his own
words (or those of his partners in crime) about a possible impending
recession were perhaps the initial get-the-ball-rolling force vector
that began the jobs recession we now have.  Bush's words --
disseminated worldwide by a media feeding frenzy--fueled nascent
perceptions of an impending recession,  

Bush and his GOP henchmen, like Gore and his Democrat henchmen, see
our nation simply as a pawn in their lust for power.  As far as I can
tell, this attitude runs rampant in the Halls of Power in a completely
BI-PARTISAN fashion.  

Yes, there were other vectors involved in the genesis of this  massive
jobs recession (the dotcom bust, Enron, loss of confidence in stocks,
Sept 9-11, etc.), but Bush -- in his quest for power--started the jobs
recession with his threats of an impending recession unless the
resolution (and the vote recount) was hurried .  If the
electoral/popular vote situation had been on the other shoe, I have no
doubt Gore would have done the same.

Power corrupts, etc. When did we forget this?

Just my ever-humble opinion....

Gimme a break!  I'm sorry, I know you're going to say I'm "controlling the
dialogue," but I can tell we're so far apart that any dialogue would require
more effort than I'm willing to devote to the task.  I'll simply note that
you're post is a classic example of pomo focus on "text" and, if I cared to
engage in this dialogue, I would probably be drawn into asking whether my
suspicion that you've been thoroughly imbued with pomo ideas is correct.
I'd also have to work very hard to keep from being drawn into an insult
match; I checked out your ISP and found that it was promoting Chomsky, Jim
Hightower and Michael Moore.  I'm afraid we're so far apart that the effort
to remain civil is wasted.  Why don't we just agree to disagree and leave it
at that?

Randy,
       Finally someone I almost totally agree with.  But I don't see this as 
starting on Bush's or Clinton's watch.  IMHO we are suffering from an 
accumulation of bad law and government decisions that go back as far as forty years.  
Just notice, the corporations are moving overseas because they are tired of 
dealing with the IRS, CIO, AFL, OSHA, and all the other agencies.
       Look at what happened to the tobacco companies when they quit donating 
to the Dems after the 94 election.

Hi Extropes

I wonder what are the latest thoughts regarding Aristotle's "lost" second
book on comedy ?

Apparently Aristotle alluded to his writings about laughter, but since
very little by him on that topic is known/found, his written work on the
topic of comedy and laughter are thought to be "lost". At least that is
what I have discovered in briefly following up this subject today.

Does anyone have more up-to-date information about Aristotle's lost
book on comedy/laughter?

Amara

Right, because you'd have to get involved in a detailed analysis of a 
very difficult to defend position.

Just the facts - Did we drop bombs on civilians in Iraq and Afganistan? 
  Did we HAVE TO?  Is it okay to drop bombs on people if we don't HAVE 
TO?

So now I'm a "pomo, unoriginal, contentious, opponents of the law, 
obstructionist, un-informed, un-happy, half-hearted, minority, 
un-civil, extreme, offensive, alarming, silly, rhetorical, 
fairly-left-leaning, waaay over the top, grossly partisan"

> pomo ideas is correct.

Thanks for actually asking.  No, I'm a naive realist - all there are 
are the facts, nothing but the facts, all of them objective and 
objectively knowable and provably so.

But I am aware that controlling dialogue with value-laden terms is an 
effective rhetorical method used consistently by the right wing to 
control the context of dialogues.  This is why such conversations tend 
to drift quickly into how unoriginal, contentious, uninformed, unhappy, 
half-hearted, uncivil, extreme, offensive, alarming, silly, rhetorical, 
left-leaning and liberal anyone who doesn't believe everything they 
hear on Fox News or Ayn Rand said is.

When confronted with someone who's aware of this technique an attempt 
to abort the dialogue usually ensues immediately after the 
name-calling.  You were good, you name-called and made the attempted 
abortion.  Good work.

I'm happy to abort too if we can agree on the factual points I made in 
my original post to which you found it important enough to respond:

1)  We dropped bombs on civilians in alarming numbers, killing upwards 
of 6,000 Iraqi Civilians and an as-yet unknown number of military 
personnel.  I don't have the numbers on Afghanistan handy, but I 
believe them to be as significant and we can bring out the FACTS of the 
matter on this too.

2)  It's wrong to kill people needlessly.

3)  We didn't HAVE to go to war in Iraq, no one forced our arms, we did 
it "pre-emptively" to use the official language for the action which 
means "we went because some subset of 'we' wanted to".

4)  That subset is profiting immensely from the current action both 
immediately in terms of military and military-related expenditures and 
long-term in terms of higher national debt and resulting future 
taxation increases.  Haliburton's expected revenues from the Iraqi war 
is upwards of 1.6 Billion.  Cheney still takes approximately $1M/year 
from Haliburton as a "CEO Emeritus".

> I'd also have to work very hard to keep from being drawn into an insult

That's what I've been trying to avoid by just pointing out what you 
SAID.  Those are your "rhetorical" words up there, not mine.

> I checked out your ISP and found that it was promoting Chomsky, Jim
> Hightower and Michael Moore.

My ISP?  Check the whois on it.  If you want to see REALLY uncivil 
conversations, check out the forums there!

http://www.thetip.org/forum.php

don't only read Ferguson and Keynes, that's a very limiting perspective.

> I'm afraid we're so far apart that the effort

I guess I just can't let the factual parts go.  I'm willing to ignore 
the name-calling.  But if extropianism is "Pro-life" in the 
non-abortion sense, then isn't it against needless killing?  Then isn't 
it essentially against hawkish, imperialistic foreign policies?  
Doesn't the PNAC describe itself in precisely these terms?

Still genuinely not trying to get into a name-calling match.

Robbie

I don't think that is going to work Aubrey.  Is it know for example
that existing stomach enzymes don't break down the materials that you
mention?  The problem might end up being a lack of specificity or an
inability to work at "normal" PH.  In which case I don't think having
more enzymes is going to do the trick -- it seems unlikely that nature
would have evolved enzymes to deal with the specific materials but rather
enzymes that are capable of breaking specific types of bonds.  In which
case their use might produce rather nasty side effects.

One might have to resort instead to "directed evolution" of the type
that Maxygen does to get enzymes with the desired specificity.  Or
finally one might just have to do the enzyme tweeking "by hand" as
was done to several of the DNA polymerases to get them to function
more effectively in sequencing applications.

I think one may need to devote more attention to what lipofuscin really is
(perhaps to the extent that they have studied what amyloid is) before
one can effectively begin to take it apart.

Interesting. I did a google probably much the same as you would have
I expect, (or probably less adeptly), and I'm not ever sure its more than
an "old" urban myth.

http://www.bbk.ac.uk/eh/eng/skc/artlaugh.htm
Seems to be at least an academic paper on the subject written in 1998.

A find on "lost" pulls up the following paragraph.

"Up until the middle of the eighteenth century, an Aristotelian conception
 governed theories of laughter. Not that Aristotle had much to say on the
 subject. It may be that the medieval rumour that Aristotle had written a
 now LOST book on comedy is true: but judging from the little that Aristotle
 has to say on the subject of comedy in the rest of his work, it does not
 seem likely to have been a very substantial work. Aristotle shares with
Plato the idea that laughter is derision, or the expression of superiority.
Aristotle saw laughter as proceeding from `the joy we have in observing
 the fact that we cannot be hurt by the evil at which we are indignant'.
 Insofar as we tend to laugh at the lowly and the undignified (what is ugly
 without being offensive, as Aristotle says, in an interesting prefiguring
of
 aesthetic language), laughter should be kept within bounds, since laughing
 too much at what is ridiculous or unbecoming starts to put your own
dignity on the line. Aristotle is here in concord with Plato, who
recommended the banning of depictions of gods or heroes doubled up
 in laughter on the grounds that it was unbecoming and conducive to
disrespect for the divine."
-----

How far did you get towards concluding there might actually have
been such a book?

For some reason that I don't get, the formal study of laughter has never
really intrigued, as much as it should. The last time I heard of "a theory
of emotion" Schacter was it's proponent. Curiously he argued (if memory
serves) that we sense "something" as a sort of arousal then look around
to the world for context on how to interpret or label that feeling of
arousal
back to ourselves. This creates an opportunity for quick suggestive types
like comics and rhetoricians.

When rhetoric was in vogue in Rome and Greece the study of the power
of ridicule in debate must have reached a pretty fair level.

Based on Schacter's notions I reckon a very good way to move a
crowd inclined to laugh at ridicule may be a quick rejoinder that moves
them instead to another emotion like pity or regret.

Consider Mark Antony's speach in Shakespeares Julius Ceasar. "I come
to bury Ceasar not to praise him" etc. Antony seduces a crowd to action
with words that are superficially accolades about "honorable men" yet
plants the suggestion incrementally that the honorable men are anything
but.

I reckon something may turn on the way we mentally process "nots" and
"negatives". We consider propositions in the affirmative and then it takes
another "CPU cycle" to add the "not" or the logical reversal in there.
Maybe the switch is dramatic from one part of the brain (imagery) and
yet subtle from another (linguistic) and laughter thus comes as a release
as the parts come together.

Or maybe not :-)

Regards,
Brett

I can imagine a researcher merely 15 years ago who, if
you described this situation, would respond, "To
*have* such problems..."

It is an issue that needs dealing with.  But it's also
a rose worth smelling.  ^_^

No -- because I'm sick to death of hearing the same things over and over and
over again and, much more importantly, this just isn't the place to argue
about whether the Bush administration's foreign policy is right or whether
they are "Nazis."  That's not hard to undertand, is it?  I'm sure you've got
lots of opportunities to make your point in fora that are devoted to
politics.  Why here?

Please -- neither side of the left/right dichotomy has any kind of monopoly
on the use of value-laden terms.  Some of my friends sat through "struggle
sessions" in the Cultural Revolution in China.  Don't you think there was
"dialogue control" with "value-laden terms" going on there?

Please see the recent criticism of Fox at my blog.  The list of things I
disagree with Ayn Rand about is pretty long, too.  The problem is that
discussion of subjects like the one in this thread tends to push people into
characterizing their opponents as 2-dimensional icons.  I did it.  You did
it. It sucks.  We've got better things to do here.

> I'm happy to abort too if we can agree on the factual points I made in

We most certainly CAN'T agree, which is why this discussion is pointless
here.  Imagine the volume of text it would take for each of us to set out
our positions in detail on these matters.  Imagine the effort it would take
to refrain from name-calling, and the consequences for the list when we fail
to do so.  Now compare that to more productive discussions we could have
here that we're unlikely to have elsewhere.  The volumes of text and the
name-calling can be found lots of places; discussion of human augmentation
can't.

The ability of such things to be broken down in the stomach has not
been explored, no, but the place where their breakdown is attempted
and fails is the lysosome, which is a lot more acidic than the rest
of the cell (albeit not as acidic as the stomach).  The specificity
problem sounds ominous, but in fact not: the reason bioremediation
is so successful is that wherever there is a high abundance in the
soil of something that's organic and energy-rich, micro-organisms
find a way to live off it -- the evolutionary pressure to do so is
strong, because if you're a slow-growing species you need something
that the faster ones lack.  That's why you can find bacteria at the
roadside that can eat tyre rubber, for instance.  So, graveyards are
quite likely to have microbes that can break down recalcitrant human
remains (except bone, of course, because bone isn't energy-rich.)
And then, of course, the specificity problem applies to the microbe
too -- it has to be impervious to its own enzymes.  Of course there
will be times when something that's non-toxic to its host is still
toxic to us, but then we just keep looking for other enzymes.  There
is also unlikely to be a pH problem with fungi, because they have an
equivalent of the lysosome.

Both agreed, especially for baterial enzymes where the pH optimum is
likely to need changing.  But one still needs to find the promising
enzyme to begin with -- and that's where the genomes can speed things
up.

Maybe, but maybe we'll find that evolution has given us the solution
without our needing to know how it did it.  Same as for Chlamydomonas
nuclear-coded mitochondrial proteins that are mt-coded in animals.

I believe there was a warrant based on information previously obtained
without a warrant; and the warrant was worded very broadly -- no specific
crime mentioned. Section 203 (b)(1) authorizes sharing of information
between various federal employees or agents, including any attorney for the
U.S.; for example, information included in a federal income tax return could
be communicated from IRS to the FBI, which could then use this information
to apply for a warrant; my understanding is that the information on the tax
return could be something as innocent as an entry on Schedule B, Form 1040,
of interest received from a foreign bank account.  Section 213 of the PA
authorizes what amounts to indefinite delay of notice.

No.

This is one reason I find the PA so troubling: see, it wasn't the CPA's
problem, beyond the need to cover his ass if the client later complained.
And the client was not given the opportunity to challenge the investigation,
because the CPA was not allowed to inform him (prohibition of communication
from CPA to client is authorized by Section 213 of the PA).

Right. But if the police can act in secret, they can clean out the barn
before the farmer is even aware the door's been opened.

They're in the Patriot Act that was signed into law in October, 2001.

As I mentioned in my last post, this is not the first time such problems
have arisen with laws passed in haste to address a crisis. There is no
reason to get hysterical. But I do think people need to be aware that
certain rights we tend to take for granted are being threatened.

APOLOGY:

This post, which I initially thought I could keep relatively short, soon
began to get way out of hand, both in terms of my time and in terms of what
most people want to read on an email list. I think I need to put it on a web
page where people can access it if they're interested.

I'll post only the beginning of my analysis of the Patriot Act here.

I have pasted in quite a bit of code language below. Codes of law, like
legal contracts, are meant to be applied in an uncertain future. Therefore,
they attempt to cover as many contingencies as the drafters can foresee.
If've often wished one could use mathematical notation when drafting legal
documents; but since it's customary to use the written form of the spoken
language, one must make do. To make matters worse, the final bill is a cut
and paste job representing compromises necessary to get it passed by both
the Senate and House. The result can be pretty nearly incomprehensible, and
often NO one understands what the heck the thing means, not even the members
of Congress who voted on it; so the courts interpret it as best they can.

Greg wrote:

I'll throw in my observation here as well. When a person uses vague terms
such as "wholesale denial of fundamental rights" I don't usually pay much
attention to what they've written. I would be much more interested in which
fundamental rights of which poeple are being denied, who is denying them,
how they're being denied and so forth. I think one reason people start
shouting and foaming at the mouth over politics is that they've got their
brains set in Emotional Mode reather than Thinking Mode.

To put the PA's in perspective here, this is not the first time the U.S.
Congress has felt it necessary to curtail certain freedoms in order to
preserve others. In fact, the first time this happened was back in 1798. The
Sedition Act of that year says in part:

==========================
I Be it enacted . . ., That if any persons shall unlawfully combine or
conspire together, with intent to oppose any measure or measures of the
government of the United States, which are or shall be directed by proper
authority, or to impede the operation of any law of the United States, or to
intimidate or prevent any person holding a place or office in or under the
government of the United States, from undertaking, performing or executing
his trust or duty; and if any person or persons, with intent as aforesaid,
shall counsel, advise or attempt to procure any insurrection, riot. unlawful
assembly, or combination, whether such conspiracy, threatening, counsel,
advice, or attempt shall have the proposed effect or not, he or they shall
be deemed guilty of a high misdemeanor, and on conviction, before any court
of the United States having jurisdiction thereof, shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding five thousand dollars, and by imprisonment during a term
not less than six months nor exceeding five years; and further, at the
discretion of the court may be holden to find sureties for his good
behaviour in such sum, and for such time, as the said court may direct
=======================

Okay, now let's look at the law known as "Uniting and Strengthening America
by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism
Act"  aka the USA Patriot Act (signed into law by President Bush in late
October, 2001).

The specific sections that concern me are:

106, which expands the circumstances under which the president may issue
Executive Orders to confiscate the property of non-US citizens, by amending
Section 1702 of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (Title 50,
Chapter 35 of the US Code) [I think such a provision may well be useful in
combating terrorism, but I would like to see more involvement by the courts
here. As written, I think this provision will harm foreign trade. An example
of what can happen was recently reported in the NYT. An importer of oreintal
rugs had already paid for a shipment from China, and the shipment was
enroute when that State Department published the following notice in the May
23 Federal Register:

==================
SUMMARY: The U.S. Government has determined that a foreign entity has
engaged in missile technology proliferation activities that require the
imposition of measures pursuant to Executive Order 12938 of November 14,
1994, as amended by Executive Order 13094 of July 28, 1998.

EFFECTIVE DATE: May 9, 2003.
================

As this is not considered a "taking" by the U.S. government, the U.S.
importer will not be compensated and has simply lost the $100,000 he paid
for the rugs, as they were required to be destroyed by U.S. customs agents.
Note that these particular executive orders were issued under prior law, not
the PA.

50 USC 1702 as amended by the PA, now reads (in part) like this (portions
added by the PA are in [bracekts]:

=======================
Sec. 1702. - Presidential authorities

(a) In general

(1)

At the times and to the extent specified in section 1701 of this title, the
President may, under such regulations as he may prescribe, by means of
instructions, licenses, or otherwise -

(A)

investigate, regulate, or prohibit -

(i)

any transactions in foreign exchange,

(ii)

transfers of credit or payments between, by, through, or to any banking
institution, to the extent that such transfers or payments involve any

============================

The language in 50 USC 1702 (a) (1) (C) give the president the right not
merely to regulate or block transactions but to seize assets for the benefit
of the U.S. As long as this provision can be applied only to non-U.S.
citizens, it only has the potential to damage citizens that are engaged in
foreign trade or who wish to transfer money or assets out of the country.
This is somewhat disturbing in itself to someone like me, married to a
non-U.S. citizen. What's even more disturbing to me, though, is the general
direction we seem to be headed.

If one could be 100% sure that such provisions would be used ONLY against
bad guys, I'd say fine, go for it. But people make mistakes, both innocent
and not so innocent. Even basically good people are often corrupted when
they're given too much power (I've seen it happen over and over during the
16 years I've been a CPA/lawyer).

I'M GOING TO END HERE, SO AS NOT TO TRY THE PATIENCE OF OTHER LIST MEMBERS
WHO MAY NOT SHARE MY FASCINATION WITH LEGAL CODES.

To anyone who's interested in why the CPA mentioned in my previous posts had
no incentive to challenge the investigation:

===========================

SEC. 215. ACCESS TO RECORDS AND OTHER ITEMS UNDER THE FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE
SURVEILLANCE ACT.

Title V of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1861
et seq.) is amended by striking sections 501 through 503 and inserting the
following:

`SEC. 501. ACCESS TO CERTAIN BUSINESS RECORDS FOR FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE AND
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS.

`(a)(1) The Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation or a designee of
the Director (whose rank shall be no lower than Assistant Special Agent in
Charge) may make an application for an order requiring the production of any
tangible things (including books, records, papers, documents, and other
items) for an investigation to protect against international terrorism or
clandestine intelligence activities, provided that such investigation of a
United States person is not conducted solely upon the basis of activities
protected by the first amendment to the Constitution.

[...]


`(d) No person shall disclose to any other person (other than those persons
necessary to produce the tangible things under this section) that the
Federal Bureau of Investigation has sought or obtained tangible things under
this section.

`(e) A person who, in good faith, produces tangible things under an order
pursuant to this section shall not be liable to any other person for such
production. Such production shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of
any privilege in any other proceeding or context.

Sounds like this prevents one from lobbying to repeal the PA or parts thereof.

Now *that* is a pretty slick piece of legislation -- who the hell drafted
this thing -- Ashcroft & Co.?  If so they are bad/evil people.  It goes
against the fundamental principles the country was built upon -- the Minutemen,
Paul Revere's efforts (one if by land, two if by sea), Freedom of Speech, etc.
I'm sure Greg could comment on what components of Jefferson's or Franklin's
perspectives this violates (at length).  It would seem to allow taking every
demonstrator who demonstrated against the WTO a couple of years ago in Seattle
and hauling them off to jail.  They *clearly* were "conspiring" to
disobey "laws" of the U.S. (though I'm not clear if that phrase would
or would not include state laws).

Also, to put a transhumanist spin on this, it would seem to make it illegal
for American citizens to lobby for independent enclaves within the
U.S. or promoting the formation external enclaves (e.g. nanotech island based)
that might threaten the economic interests of the U.S. -- [if government officials
can't get paid its a bit difficult for them to "execute their duty".]

What a mess.

In  MCA, et al. v. Ashcroft and Mueller / Complaint for Declaratory and
Injunctive Relief, filed July 30, 2003, which is concerned with Section 215
of the Patriot Act.

You can read the complaint here:

http://www.aclu.org/Files/OpenFile.cfm?id=13247

I urge everyone concerned about the transhumanist agenda to take the time to
read at least the portion headed STATUTORY LANGUAGE AT ISSUE.

Here's a hypothetical to illustrate why Section 215 is relevant to the
transhumanist agenda:

On April 3, 2005, Sam Trostle, a 78 year old U.S. citizen, gets the bad news
that he is suffering from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which will continue to
erode his brain until he dies. There is no known cure. Sam wants to undergo
cryonic suspension, but if he waits until he dies, there might not be much
of his brain left to save. He has done research on the typical course of the
disease, and it looks as though his last months will be highly unpleasant,
both for Sam and his family. Sam learns of a facility in China that has
developed a promising suspension process that is considered a medical
treatment under the local law. Sam and his wife begin making plans to go to
China, where Sam expects to spend his final days before being suspended. In
May, 2005 Sam makes a payment of $60,000 to the facility. Sam's bank duly
makes a Suspicious Activity Report (see US Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by
US Patriot Act). The FBI uses this report to get a secret warrant to search
Sam's office and home. There they find literature about doing business in
China and filing tax returns as a U.S. Expatriate. They also find evidence
indicating that Sam has visited a doctor who advocates physician assisted
suicide.

Sam sends in his passport for renewal on June 8, 2005. His application for
renewal is denied, because Sam is under investigation. Sam hires an
immigration lawyer to try to find out what's going on. By January, 2006, Sam
is no longer able to talk coherently. The lawyer is still working on the
case but has made little progress. In March, 2006 Sam's wife tells the
lawyer she no longer wants him to pursue the case.

On July 4, 2006 Sam dies in Birmingham, Alabama, never having had the chance
to leave the U.S.

Here's a bit more on the 1798 acts. Few people today would doubt that the
acts were motivated (at least in part) by domestic politics, although the
excuse made by the Federalists was that they were needed to protect the U.S.
against nasty foreigners. Note that the Republicans of that time were more
similar to the Democrats of today than to present-day Republicans.

Barbara

======================
http://www.bartleby.com/65/al/AlienNSe.html

1798, four laws enacted by the Federalist-controlled U.S. Congress,
allegedly in response to the hostile actions of the French Revolutionary
government on the seas and in the councils of diplomacy (see XYZ Affair),
but actually designed to destroy Thomas Jeffersons Republican party, which
had openly expressed its sympathies for the French Revolutionaries.
Depending on recent arrivals from Europe for much of their voting strength,
the Republicans were adversely affected by the Naturalization Act, which
postponed citizenship, and thus voting privileges, until the completion of
14 (rather than 5) years of residence, and by the Alien Act and the Alien
Enemies Act, which gave the President the power to imprison or deport aliens
suspected of activities posing a threat to the national government.
President John Adams made no use of the alien acts. Most controversial,
however, was the Sedition Act, devised to silence Republican criticism of
the Federalists. Its broad proscription of spoken or written criticism of
the government, the Congress, or the President virtually nullified the First
Amendment freedoms of speech and the press. Prominent Jeffersonians, most of
them journalists, such as John Daly Burk, James T. Callender, Thomas Cooper,
William Duane (17601835), and Matthew Lyon were tried, and some were
convicted, in sedition proceedings. The Alien and Sedition Acts provoked the
Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions and did much to unify the Republican party
and to foster Republican victory in the election of 1800. The
Republican-controlled Congress repealed the Naturalization Act in 1802; the
others were allowed to expire (18001801).

The book also figures in (slight spoiler) Umberto Eco's _Name of the 
Rose_, where it is discussed. Most likely Eco knew about the medieval 
rumors and played with them for his story (very well worth reading). 

Given that Aristotle's text were little more than lecture notes compiled 
by others it is hard to tell what he might have said or not.

I think the usual reason is that it was considered somewhat irrelevant;
while we enjoy laughter, "real medicine" should deal with major
illnesses and core issues of the mind. It is just recently the 
neuroscience of emotion has become popular, and the psychology of 
positive mental states is also just getting started.

I know there are many other humor theories. Freud had some important
early ones distinguishing between "innocent" and "tendentious" jokes,
where the later have a sexual or aggressive content. Raskin had a theory
that we laugh when we encounter something that is dompatible with two
different semantic scripts which are opposite in one of a number of
particular ways. Veatch suggests a theory where the semantics of the
situation is normal but the affective context is absurd
(http://www.tomveatch.com/else/humor/paper/humor.html)

And Sasha had an IMHO nicely cognitive theory where we laugh due to the 
surprise when a cognitive set is transformed:
http://www.ethologic.com/sasha/articles/humor.html
(I remember him explaining it to me when we were driving through 
Boston)

Mark Twain had a theory about this:  'Studying humour is like dissecting a

Well, ok, but I've been here long enough to know we almost never talk about 
human augmentation.  We talk occassionally about a lot of far out things like 
uploading, running dups, whether we are in a Sim, SAI and FAI but very little 
about IA.   Not to pick a nit,  I'm just a bit curious as to why.  

On this other matter one thing we MUST learn in the process of IA is how to 
talk with each other without dissovling into name-calling and such.   If we 
aren't in part about learning it here where we have some more focused reasons 
to do so then where?

Hence the lack of jocular frogs, I guess.

I did it with three questions.  Maybe you could do it with three

Were we FORCED to go to war?
Is it BAD to bomb people without Necessity?
Didn't "we" do that?

It's not like I'm asking you to analyze the structure of human freedom

Perfection is valueless without moral perfection.  I would say, the 
only worthwhile augmentation pursuit would be the moral one and that it 
OUGHT to have longevity-producing and human-improving side effects.

Oh boy, you folks are going to have a field day with this.

Marshall Brain has written an article called "Robotic Freedom":
  http://www.marshallbrain.com/robotic-freedom.htm

It outlines the problems that modern economies will have as
robots start to significantly displace individuals in the
work force.  (Mind you I don't completely agree with his
predictions/time-frame.)  But this goes back to points that
Moravec has made in his books, e.g. "How does the economy
function when robots do most of the work?".

The interesting suggestion that Brain makes is that the
government should literally give money away.

So, question -- does or does not the knowledge of several
lawyers on the list require "real" artificial intelligence
or could their arguments be presented by a robot with
a "simple" logical argument component with a very large
memory?  (E.g. essentially a legal "expert system".)
As background, I'll simply point out that expert systems
that diagnose certain diseases have been built (and IMO
would probably do a much better job than several physicians
I've encountered over the last year).  This relates to the
question of precisely *when* do many of the service jobs
go to the robots in addition to the physical labor jobs.

(To the lawyers -- no offense -- I'm just trying to fuel
the debate of "what are robots" and "what are AIs" and how
trends may dictate how people should prepare for the future.)

I think there are two problems here; (a) there are very few people trained
in the art of "logical debate" (making it difficult for logic to outweigh
emotions) -- thus "name-calling and such"; and (b) we are "thin" with respect
to the quantity of individuals who could seriously debate IA.  If you had
Anders and perhaps a few of his associates who attend neuroscience meetings
and combined them with people like Aubrey, Brett and their associates who
understand the technology and throw in people like Marvin Minsky or Eliezer
who have a great depth of knowledge in AI -- *then* one might get a really
interesting debate on IA.

I don't know of a list with those aspects however.

Fine, if it will make you feel any better, you can have my answers:

Yes
Yes
No

Is knowing my opinion on this subject of any value to you?  It hardly seems
so.  Now you *might* be interested in the *book* I'd have to write to
explain myself to you.  But then there's the bandwidth thing.

But, really, you are, because that's the only way I can explain my answers.
And such an exercise is precisely what I'm saying isn't really appropriate
here.

Now in this we're in perfect agreement.  How we'd go about defining morality
to be perfected, aye, there's the rub.

Barbara, I'm now sandwiching a legislative history review of 50 U.S.C. secs.
1701 et seq. into other stuff I've got going on this weekend.  I note that
the original bill was passed in 1977 during adminstration of <humor> that
dreaded imperialist and well-known oligarch, Jimmy Carter </humor>:

http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/1701.notes.html

The link above is interesting.  As I'm sure you've noted, the entirety of
sec. 1702 is premised on the authority defined in sec. 1701, which in turn
defines at least some limits to the exercise of presidential power.  Such
limits are the first (but I'm sure there are many more) bases I see as an
advocate upon which to craft challenges to the application of the law.

Also worth the long, slow download is the complete text of all the Executive
Orders signed under authority of the law since Pres. Jimmy.  With this much
material, I see the second element upon which I'd write my brief (if I had
to get one to the courthouse by tomorrow): These supply a body of practice
against which to judge any particular order.  It's interesting to note the
wide variety of situations to which this law has been applied, from the
Balkans to Central Africa.

How is it not a "taking"?  Maybe I missed something (I'm reading quickly, in
between other chores).  If it is indeed authorizes the seizure of a
citizen's property with no legal recourse, then you'll see me signing up to
an amicus brief to find it unconstitutional.

I agree completely.  I want to see legal action to challenge any
unconstitutional law or executive action, and I spend a little here and
there to support public advocacy groups that do just that.

Since you're almost a *tax lawyer* for crying out loud, you've got an unfair
advantage over an old courtroom ham like me, but I'm now committed to
working my way through this stuff.

I guess I'm interested in knowing the meaning of "forced" you have in 
mind here.  I know time is short, what's the 30-second version?

I guess maybe I AM asking you to analyze the structure of human 
freedom.   I realize time is short - if you want me to chase down some 
isms - determinism, objectivism, etc., I'm perfectly happy and capable. 
  Hopefully it's possible to explain how we were "forced" without 
dragging down some really big heavy books.

Great, it sounds like we have a lot of common places to start.  And it 
even sounds like it's an extropian issue.  The question can be a 
hypothetical one if you prefer it:

Would a risk-averse morally-ideal-machine-person have a pre-emptive war 
strategy, would they be pure pragmatists, would they be peaceniks?

In modern GenX terms, what would Brian Boytano do?

If emails about subject matter carnivore is not interested in and material
with just the right word/context to make it subject to scrutiny are sent is
it possible to detect
carnivore by looking at time delays between send and reciept.

I sent some emails to the same location  with excerpts of the patriot act and
some rather inflammatory  deliberate references to cannabis and police
state.  Those took 2 hours longer to pop up at the recipient site than
ordinary emails sent the same time to the same location.  Ones simply sent to
myself poped up in minutes.

The major problem with this article is that where any actual economic
thinking is actually going on (as opposed to knee-jerk anti-progress,
anti-technology, pro-forced-wealth-redistribution thinking that permeates
this thing), it's all Keynesian. Especially that giving money away business;
shades of setting the people to work digging holes and filling them again
because that makes everything better if you believe Keynesian economic
theories. (Bah). That's not even to start on the candlemaker fallacy part;
apparently we must stop progress because some industries will suffer. Narry
a mention of the job creation in new industries, just the same old zero-sum
protectionist nonsense based on the assumption that people are owed security
and a livelihood with no effort on their part, funded by the wealthy via
forced redistribution of wealth. Even the anti-capitalist, anti-free-market
arguments in this thing are tired and by the numbers, pushing the effects of
government intervention (no5t labeled as such, of course) in trade and
markets as reasons for more government intervention. It's sad, sad, sad. And
stupid. Massively, massively stupid.

I'll pipe in with a point (c) on this, which is that, even though, in my
view
this list does have a good spread of subject matter experts or aficionados,
its an international list and sometimes it takes 24 hours for a subject to
coincide
with the waking/reading cycles of those who have the time and know-how to
contribute. I know I've sometimes seen and wanted to post further on
threads that were of  clear interest to others but one does not always get
the
time to address them properly on all occasions. Because of the international
time cycle, sleep cycle thing, and with weekends not aligning exactly,
topics
once posted can sit on the list tantalisingly drawing quick heated responses
that can be fired off much faster than the more enlightened ones take to
prepare. To some extent just plain old list dynamics work per se work
against us. This is no excuse just something that I think that supports the
contention of trying to be courteous and following the few rules that we
have.

Regards,
Brett

I don't suppose anyone here has yet read Stephen Jay Gould's final
postmortem book THE HEDGEHOG, THE FOX, AND THE MAGISTER'S POX? The long
closing chapter is an attempted assault on Ed Wilson's allegedly
reductionist account of consilience--the goal of unity between all
disciplines--in familiar Gouldian skeptical terms that invoke the veiling
force of emergence and contingency, in the overarching context of his
suggested principle of NOMA (Non-Overlapping Magisteria, or teaching
authorities, that include the sciences, the humanities, religion/ethics,
aesthetics, and perhaps others unspecified, possibly including baseball.
That last was a joke. I think). I strongly suspect NOMA is a cop-out. (And
I can't even work out why it isn't NOM, unless his original formulation was
Non-Overlapping Magisterial Authorities.) I'd be interesting in hearing
opinions on the book.

Umberto Eco wrote a novel set in the middle ages about Aristotle's lost book
and the church's attempt to suppress it called "The Name of The Rose". They
made a movie out of it too by the same name.

Gee--now there's an astonishing brand-new idea for dealing with robotic

Or maybe he read THE SPIKE back in 1997.

Greetings Extropians,
 
I for one would sequence the Galapagos tortoise Testudo elephantus or the ocean quahog Arctica islandica, a long-lived clam. Both species can live between 150 - 200 years. It may be helpful to compare their sequences with their less long-lived relatives' (another species in the same genus for example) genomic sequences to determine what precisely the genetic component to their longevity is as opposed to enviromental factors. (such as being endothermic or living in cold climates). This seems a bit more to the point than shotgun sequencing a whole bunch of microbes to find some "magic" enzyme that will lengthen life as that is a bit too much of a "fishing expedition". Not that "fishing expeditions" don't give rise to good science but often the answers one gets are not to the questions one asks.

Sequencers Examine Priorities
Jennifer Couzin

"Now that genomes can be decoded quickly, researchers are
debating how to choose which organisms to sequence next"

"...with all the "obvious" organisms--including the human, the 
mouse, and the rat--now sequenced, or nearly so, the genetics
community and NHGRI, its principal funder, are weighing how
to proceed. The country's three massive sequencing centers,
fearful of becoming mere factories churning out base after base,
are lobbying to preserve influence in choosing which organisms
to sequence and analyzing the genetic data they produce.
Scientists who mobilized around beloved animals, from the 
honeybee to the chicken, and won them a spot in the sequencing
queue are now wondering what they will target next.

The 30 to 40 prominent researchers who attended the meeting,
many of whom commented with surprise on its collegiality, 
agreed that sequencing should now be driven by biological 
unknowns rather than popularity contests. "We should turn
to using sequencing capacity to answer scientific questions 
that are of seminal importance," wrote Princeton University
President Shirley Tilghman in an e-mail message. And if that
means sequencing an organism "that by biologists' standard is 
obscure," she added, "so be it."

....

"Implicit in the choice of which genomes to sequence lies a 
greater uncertainty: If genomes should be selected based on 
the biological mysteries they could help solve, which mysteries
top the list? That was something last month's collegial meeting
steered clear of. "It delayed the hard issues," such as whether
to award one vertebrate at the expense of 40 Drosophila, with
their much smaller genomes, says Green. Which ones win out,
at least in the short term, will be a topic for another day."
-------

I used to have the view that sequencing whales and elephants,
animals with large numbers of cells, as cells are roughly the
same size in all organisms, and big beasts have more of them,
might tell us something useful about aging, dna repair and 
cancer avoidance. I seem to recall that Aubrey de Grey was
not convinced that this would shed all that much light. 

I wonder what folks interested in the aging process like Robert
and Aubrey would choose if they could get the genomes they
wanted sequenced soonest?

Brett

I noticed the annual September single topic special 
edition of Scientific American is about human augmentation.
I haven't read it, but there is one bioethicist arguing
that it is ethical for us to augment our brains, if we
can give everyone equal access.  (We can't, but thanks
for the blessing anyhow.)  Has anyone studied that issue?

Hmm. I replied to Robert Bardbury's

>>The interesting suggestion that Brain makes is that the

>Gee--now there's an astonishing brand-new idea for dealing with robotic
productivity.
>Or maybe he read THE SPIKE back in 1997.

(Now that I've skimmed those url'd pages, I see that he hasn't--although
his $25,000 suggestion for a guaranteed income exactly matches my own (and
the late Robert Theobald's).

Roughly simultaneously, Reason cried out in pain:

I'd demur on that `massively, massively stupid', obviously. Reason, I think
you're jumping the gun. Brain's case is precisely that there *can't* be
much in the way of `job creation in new industries' for the robotically
downsized (unless I'm reading that in). I found his suggestions most
laughable when he tried to give his prescription a `turbo-capitalist' spin:
selling advertising space on the rear of greenbacks, under public bridges,
on the Washington Memorial. Pure '50s Pohl&Kornbluth parody. But if his
remedies are incomplete, that's where people like us need to step in with
some imagination.

As for `funded by the wealthy via forced redistribution of wealth', I
believe Brain is saying that redistribution BACK to consumers of large
amounts of Danegeld forcibly stripped FROM them by insanely hungry and
sometimes grossly law-breaking CEOs is more the style of the funding proposal.

In general terms, here is my own apologia from THE SPIKE:

=======

The run up to the Spike will deepen today's dreadful problems, but also
ease their solution, if we keep our nerve and use our brains. 
	A corporation that downsizes its work-force today, in favor of robots, is
surviving as a beneficiary of the human investment of the past. Its current
productivity, after all, are the outcome of every erg of accumulated human
effort that went into creating the economy and technological culture that
made those robots possible. 
	So let's not look at a guaranteed income as a `natural right', like the
supposed innate rights to freedom of speech and liberty. Rather, it is an
inheritance, something owed to all the children of a society whose
ancestors for generations have together built, and purchased through the
work of their minds and hands, the resource base sustaining today's
cornucopia. 
	Committed to the present structure of society--a prejudice doomed in any
case, as we have seen, by the on-coming Spike--some people believe that
most of their fellow humans won't work without an external goad. Others
agree that incentives are required, but hold that these can spring from
within, and need not depend upon the threat of hunger and destitution. In
the short run, this debate can be avoided, for a guaranteed income would
abolish severe poverty more effectively than current schemes that tend to
act as a disincentive to taking up part-time work.
	And while a guaranteed wage would ensure you the bare necessities, your
craving for luxuries and a higher standard of living would hardly
disappear. Few of us now are content merely to earn a subsistence income.
Those who are--the `shiftless scoundrels' who live their rudimentary life
of ease on the dole in sunny climes--will continue to do so, but without
costing society the extra burden of trying to hunt them down and punish
them for refusing to take the jobs that don't exist.
	What we must hope, as the juggernaut of technological change rolls onward,
is that material incentives alone really are not more important than other
driving forces of the human spirit. The artist and the scientist are two
celebrated instances of a deep human hunger and enthusiasm for creative
activity, the kind that draws people together while being intensely
rewarding to the individual. It's very likely, no doubt, that some arduous
jobs traditionally the domain of depressed and excluded groups would find
no takers if survival were no longer at stake. In wealthy nations like the
United States, bordering less well-off countries, a constant influx of
illegal migrants testifies to the reluctance of citizens with high
expectations to do the sweaty work. 

...

	The anthropologist Conrad Arensberg claimed that every successful adaptive
innovation, social or biological, always has a further effect than the
immediate and conservative: `the opening of a vast new door, a splendid
serendipity'. It is impertinent and finally futile to try to anticipate
serendipity, but it seems fair to assume that the adoption of a general
right to a share in the inherited productivity of the human race will be
liberating, more often than not, to the spirit. 

Pre-paid lunch

Surprisingly, the laissez-faire writer Robert A. Heinlein placed that
sentiment in the mouth of a utopian judge condemning a reckless rugged
individualist: `From a social standpoint, your delusion makes you as mad as
a March Hare.' But it was Heinlein himself, coiner of the libertarian
slogan TANSTAAFL (`There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch'), who, as
narrator, offered the most stinging commentary:

	The steel tortoise gave MacKinnon a feeling of Crusoe-like independence.
It did not occur to him his chattel was the end product of the cumulative
effort and intelligent co-operation of hundreds of thousands of men, living
and dead.

Granted this perspective, how should we arrange our affairs during the
disruptive decades ahead? The ways in which science and technology were
(ab)used in the last century powered a catastrophic erosion of
biodiversity, and in doing so damaged human communities as well. The global
economy is still felling rain forests, polluting the skies and scything
through the diversity of species. In the long run, in a world of televised
fantasy living and virtual reality simulation--let alone the Spike's
machine intelligence and nanotechnology--such traditional methods will be
altogether unstable. Should we put an end, for the moment, to conspicuous
consumption? Yet it is exactly the economy of relentless and often
trivialized consumption that drives the technologies that will peak in the
cornucopia of the Spike.
