Why all of a suddenly did the big bang occur,if so has this replicted 
across the the universe, I mean it is infinite? Is there something 
missing in this big picture? Are we part of some zoo experiment or are we 
the space in between neutrons & electrons.surely the universe is not 
infinite, there must be some external influence to allow atoms to 
congrugate within.what is at the edge of the universe some sort of plasma 
field holding it together. It dosn't compute.

I will try evaluate the possible terms of morphological and gradual
uploadings.

In 1946 one MIPS cost about 150 M$, in 1981 - 10 k$, in 1995 - 10 $. After
simple calculations I have got, that mean annual coefficient of computational
power growth was:
1.32 times/year  - during 1946 - 1981 years period,
1.64 times/year  - during 1981 - 1995 years priod.

I believe, we can affirm that brain power is between 10^13 and 10^18 sinapses
per second. Let us assume, that 1 sinapse processing require 10-1000 floating
operations. So, the necessary computation power will be 10^14 - 10^21 FLOPS.

If we would take 1981 - 1995 coefficient (1.64) and most powerful current
computer (2*10^12 FLOPS) we will got that brain power computer will arose
between 2005 and 2039 years.

The brain power computer is not sufficient condition for morphological uploading,
of course. Scaning, decoding and ethical problems can very postpone these
possibilities. But for humanoid AI (according to Carl Feynman classification)
these problems will not so bigs. In this case, we can expect, that human
power AI would arose earlier than uploading possibilities. I have some doubts
about slow evolution human and fast evolution AI co-existence possibility.
I think that during 10 - 20 years such co-existence the human society would
have a big danger of degradation.

So, I think, the full human uploading should be possible during 2005 - 2060
years. In other case we have a chance, that it will not be possible never.

More optimistic I see the gradual uploading perspectives. We have a good chance,
that sufficiently brain - computer interface will be created during 0 - 10
years (if even one current project will be successful). The necessary computer
power would be lessen than in the morphological uploading case. In any case,
I think, the gradual uploading will not be implemented later that humanoid AI.
It can be implemented almost at once after necessary computers creation (I
believe about 2015).

Still more, already now we can expect some seriously results concerning
gradual uploading to the other brains. Let the brain-brain interface is
incomplite, let these experiments would be with animals only, some urgent
results is possible in the nearest future.

Best regards,
  Algimantas

The problem here is that human emotion and cognition are largely
mysterious, at least to the individual.  Any computer program is going to
be obviously deterministic.  Since it would be a relatively
straightforward, if tedious, task to tell what math the emotions are based
on one could assume that the computer is simply following the logical
course of action as set forth by its programming. Of course, saying that
emotion cannot be logical would also rule out human beings assuming there
were other beings capable of seeing all of the deterministic processes that
lead to emotion.  You could tell this being that you are unaware of these
processes.  A computer could tell you the same thing.  In the case of both
the computer and the human, we have a finite number of calculations taking
place in a finite space.  Therefore, to a more complex observer, everything
appears logically deterministic.

To write a program for cognition and emotion one needs to know the process
behind thought selection.  I do not and I doubt anyone else does. 
Therefore, we run up against a wall of not knowing enough about ourselves
to create mind children, at least through design.  Alife is an entirely
different story.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding you two.  What I hear is "We no longer need
centralized military coordination because we can just run away when
attacked."  But this seems crazy to me.  Even if a single firm loses
30-50% of their value in such a move, groups of firms could lose much
more if they failed to coordinate to all move to the same place in
such a way as to preserve their business relations (based in part on
geographic proximity).  Also, individuals would lose houses and
personal possessions, communities would lose roads, shopping centers,
etc.  It seems to me we are far from the point where the losses from
moving are less than the losses from defending via central military
coordination.

When it comes down to it, your own feelings are just as abstract as the
computers, relative to everyone else.

You are not feeling it feeling the data.

As do you when you receive sensory stimuli. With proper reprogramming,
you can be made to find pleasure in pain, joy in sorrow, and art in
ugliness.

As do you label sensory stimuli as "good" or "bad", "pain" or "pleasure"
as you have been programmed to do.

You are not participating in its own joy, just as you are not
participating in mine. What is the difference in the ego separation
between you and I and a computer programmed with human level
conciousness?

Only because you are only existing in the now. You automatically assume
because your computer is not programmed to do these things now, that it
will never be programmed to do these things. There is your error.

Exactly my point, so you acknowledge that we, as animals, operate

I do not see where he says this. Sounds like he is saying it isn't happening
now, and he sees no evidence that you or anyone else has  found a way to make
a computer have emotions. It is not a matter of saying it if is POSSIBLE, it
is how is it to be implemented. And whether our own cognitive brain functions
are understood well enough to speculate or build upon this knowledge.

I am still waiting to hear how the installation of emotion into computers
will occur.
I see it 100% desirable if we are to have cognitively functional machines.

WHile running away per se is not my own cup of tea, the first mandate of
maintaining a viable insurgency (i.e. successful guerrilla camapaign,
not necessarily being centrally controlled) is establishing sources and
routes of supply and relief outside the zone of conflict. In any such
conflict, while con-combatants in the current sense are much like serfs
tied to the land in the feudal sense, in a high tech battle, anyone with
a brain is a combatant. The rules of war dictate eliminating the enemy's
ability to sustain combat, and barring that, denying victory in denying
the victor the spoils. I.E: If you can't win, make sure the other guy
pays dearly for the victory.

WHile the prospect of losing house and home is not fun, a sorched earth
strategy allows for at least denying the invader the profit of use of
the assets you lose. Boobytrapping anything and everything are mandated.

Since the free rider effect occurs in governmental as well as private
solutions to the public goods problem, the cost of a central military may
only need to be a significant fraction of the cost of a military loss for
defunding of the military to occur.  That fraction is merely
somewhat smaller for the voluntary as opposed to
the coerced centralized solutions, but smaller enough so that 
coercion has usually triumphed.   Decentralized security will, when
it is a viable and widely recognized technological option, have far greater 
funding, and thus the possibility of  winning even in the face of substantial 
battlefield inferiority.   

Think of regulatory arbitrage, with taxpayers using various kinds of
mobility, in some cases of their investment funds, in some cases of their
persons.    A person evading taxes incurs negligible increase risked of foreign
invasion due to the absence of their own tax payments in the pot.   They do
incur increased personal risk from the tax collector.   If they can use 
decentralized security services to make that risk small enough to be worth
the savings, they will come out ahead of the game.   Enough people come 
out ahead of the game, and centralized coercively funded militaries are 
history.

In the U.S.,  tax rates are typically 30-40%, but military funding
represents less than 4% of GDP.   So we have a 10:1 advantage for excludable 
military technology, even before accounting for the efficiency gains to be had
from a competitive market instead of a legal monopoly, and before taking
into account the free rider effect, that in the decentralized case the customer
benefits directly from their expenditure, rather than benefiting at the
insignificant margin.

So, the question for futuristic analysis is how a decentralized voluntary "military", 
which might take the form of cryptography, untraceable payments and 
communications, cooked books,  offshore corporations,  hit squads to deter 
tax audits, and so on, can fare against tax collectors.   We see right away
that traditional centralized military solutions are useless in combatting this 
decentralized threat.   You won’t make a tax-evading Wall Street investor
pay by nuking New York City in front of the world’s TV cameras.  Whether tax 
collectors can find other solutions in  this futuristic scenario is an interesting 
question.   The mortgage deduction is one powerful solution that has been 
found for pinning people down on big chunks of fixed capital.

Of course, I don’t expect very many people working for a taxpayer-funded 
institutions argue in favor of such tax defunding scenarios.  There will
be a substantial lag between technological capability and cultural
realization.

Onwards,
Zylof

In the morning paper here in San Diego where the cult suicides are still
for some reason considered newsworthy, there was a passing reference to 
extropians.  Evidently one of the suicides had a copy of 'The Extropian'
in his possesions ( at his parent's home - not at the scene ).  It was
referred to as the writings of a "Santa Monica based internet cult",
which advocated, among other things, "Cryogenics, smart drugs, and 
upgrading".

A few other tidbits:

In the words of a cult 'expert' who was interviewed, "...the 'singularity'
prophesied by extropians is a example of the 'Impending Doom' technique
frequently used by cult leaders..." 

"Extropian literature names no date for the event, and Los Angeles county 
and Santa Monica city authorities reported no group suicides recently, 
but sources in the L.A. County Sherriff's office confirmed that the group
was being investigated."

Someone (Eugene?) noted that the future would be more like Vinge than
Banks.  The neat thing is that apart from AI and other Zone effects,
there is no conflict; the Culture could easily be some civilization in
the Beyond, and the Beyond isn't too different from the galaxy of the 
Culture.  True, the Culture dominates the scene in a way that no Beyond
civilization does at the time of AFutD, but it is still only part of a
chaotic whole (and rather chaotic itself.)

Assuming that the Culture is possible at all; I doubt Banks' view of
economics.  Still, it may well be -- simply so rich that trade is rare
and money falls out of use.  Maybe.

But one thing I like about his universe is his merger of the Big Bang
and continuous creation: imagine the universe not as an expanding
balloon, but as an onion of expanding balloons.  The source singularity
is eternal, ever putting out new universes which expand endlessly.  (Or
perhaps collapse, with more complex topology, but I've failed with his
doughnut.)  Existence is infinite, but chopped up into finite parcels.

May never be an option on Earth.  Banks' Culture was born this way: in
mobile space habitats.  Ships and portable land.  Not the situation we
face.

The Dutch, Venetians, and Swiss all have had semi-republican governments
for a long time, or at least had aberrant relations with feudalism.  The
Netherlands and Venice are swamplands -- poor or even nonexistent land
(dikes) and bad areas for heavy chivalry (glug glug).  Swiss mountain
valleys are hard to attack as well.  The Appalachians are said to be
somewhat reclusively independent, certainly from "revenooers", but are
dirt poor, unlike the three afore-mentioned republics.

Property tax.  Poll tax.  Visible wealth tax -- most people won't find
that Swiss bank account very useful if they can't buy anything with it.

This is a good, important point, and it is probably the main part of the
secular trend that is bringing about the end of the nation-state.   In most
industries geographic proximity is  becoming less important, slowly but
substantially over the long term.  

For  example, steel mills can now  operate on scrap and electricity, 
they no longer need to be located near coal sources and alongside 
railroads to raw ore mines.   

Telecommuting is growing far  more slowly than enthusiasts would like, 
but  it is nevertheless a substantial long-term secular trend that will likely 
account for two-thirds of earned income (that it does not involve the majority
of workers is irrelevant)  by the middle of the next century.   A "phase transition" 
in telecommuting  comes when the benefits of worldwide teams based on 
specialty instead of  proximity come to outweigh the remaining lower-touch 
nature of team interaction.   The "touchiness"  available from teleconferencing  
is increased, and  more social/institutional workarounds to lack of touchiness 
are discovered, and these trends meet  the growing realization of the value 
of worldwide-deployable teams.

Commuting by airplane, worldwide, is also substantial long-term secular growth
trend – it is a commonplace for a growing band of executives, salesmen, 
and technological hyperspecialists.  By 2050 most 
of the world’s high earners will consider the planet their workplace, not
a particular geographical subset of it.    As this occurs, geographical 
proximity becomes more particulate  (e.g., being next to an airport, any
airport, leads to more high-touch interaction than being in the same province) 
and less important (the telecommuting phase change).   Geographical 
boundaries, quite useful for extorting from peasants tied to land or industrial
plants tied to railheads, become ludicrous for extorting from global information
workers.

The the same conferencing and commuting technologies, communities are
slowly becoming worldwide communities of  interest, with geographical 
communities slowly diminishing into quaint backwaters.

>Also, individuals would lose houses and
> personal possessions, communities would lose roads, shopping centers,
Ø etc. 

The threat of major media exposure, combined with lack of substantial
benefit from undertaking the effort to capture this mass (which will be dead
mass, having  been stripped of its information capital value), will be
a sufficient deterant in nearly all cases.

We had a long discussion about this many months ago; certain
activities may no longer be taxed, but taxes in general are quite feasible into
the indefinite future.

I have no idea what you mean here.  Prop 13 in Calif did it by putting
a big taxes on moves.  But the mortgage deduction in general?

Hey, Hara, have you checked your hot-tub for bugs or hidden cameras?
They might find out something incriminating, like that I wear boxers.
I suppose I can take comfort in the realization that the more intrusive
and powerful the government becomes, the more incompetent it becomes
to actually /do/ anything with that power.

There once was a famous writer that said:

	There is no such thing as bad publicity

Who knows.  Maybe hundreds of people will flock to the extropian ideals
just because they finally found out that we actually exist.

The whole cult thing will blow over like a bad memory but the ideas that
extropians stand for will still be plastered on the inside of their
craniums!

Let the masses hear our ideas!
You know the Romans made their biggest mistake when they crucified
Christ!

According to you, 2 * pi is Digital.
IMHO, digital is defined by being EXACTLY representable by a FINITE
number of bits.

I prefer the word discrete for the way you use digital.

I used to visit their lab at SRI. Targ never did release the raw data

No, one isolated reading is neither Digital or analog, it's just a value.

If some physical property comes in units, 1n, 2n, 3n, 4n, ... then that  
property is digital, the constant n can be pi, e, or any real number except 
zero. The absolute value of one unit is not important, the point is that the 
difference between one unit and the next comes in steps, integers.

To each their own, it's just that I'm not very good at euphemisms.

Last Thursday some of us in Washington, DC, attended a National
Geographic lecture by astronaut Shannon Lucid about her 6-month stay
aboard the Russian space station Mir.

Some highlights of the lecture and discussion were (1) the biggest
problem for space travel seems to be radiation exposure, (2) work on the
new international space station is being hindered by economic
transformations in Russia, (3) Mir is past its expected lifetime now and
the cosmonauts spend almost 90% of their time on maintenance.

Afterwards we met, appropriately, at the Luna Cafe.  Also appropriate,
Kathryn shared some ideas about transhuman survival in alien
environments from a story she is writing.

Anyway, in light of the above, a few snippets from a story called "A
Killer Commute, Nasty Gamma Rays, But What a View!" by Robert Steiner in
today's Wall Street Journal might be entertaining:

The subtitle is "Japanese Builders Plan Condos on the Moon; Is it Lunacy
or Foresight".

"Three of the biggest construction firms [in Japan] have spent an
estimated $40 million on moon projects over the past decade. Shimizu
alone will spend $3 million this year....

Nishimatsu Construction Corp., which builds dams and tunnels on Earth,
plans to build Escargot City on the moon. It's a high-rise resort
development with three 10-story towers that each look like a cross
between a snail and a beehive.

Kazuo Kurihara, a senior Nishimatsu researcher, shows off a scale model.
Each floor is an inflated ring, designed to repel pesky asteroids; the
centerpiece is Hotel Nishimatsu with its conference halls and flashing
neon sign.  Dr. Kurihara says his lab is working on a secret
antiradiation wall material that will protect guests from the moon's
killer gamma rays....

Japanese companies have dozens of engineers working on lunar
construction projects. By comparison, the U.S. National Aeronautics and
Space Administration has 'somewhere between zero and two,' says Wendell
Mendell, a planetary scientist at NASA's Johnson Space center in
Houston, 'depending on the day you visit.'"

I'm somewhat disappointed by the sorts of responses that were sent to
Anonymous' original message about extropians who "talk the talk but
don't walk the walk", and my subsequent message on the same topic.

There were a couple of what I term knee-jerk objectivist responses
(which I was not entirely shocked to see), and a couple of platitudes
like "selfishness isn't measured in dollars".

However, it doesn't appear that many people have been able to
contradict the fundamental premise, which is that many (though
certainly not all!) extropian types don't seem to actively work
towards their long term financial self interest, or their long term
physical survival.

I suppose that since I "knew" the correctness of my position (who
doesn't believe their own ideas?) I was not expecting to learn that in
fact virtually all extropians are taking care of their health and
finances and such. However, I suppose I was expecting something more
spirited than the kind of reply that one could readily have expected
from Ayn Rand when defending her decision to keep chain smoking even
though it was obviously killing her.

I personally try to maintain a very flexible outlook on
life. Dogmatically clinging to one's views because they are one's own
has a great deal of psychological appeal but it isn't very survival
oriented -- one has to be skeptical of one's own views as well as
those of others.

Years ago, when Tim May gave me the "if you're so smart, why aren't
you rich" speech, I took him seriously, accepted without letting my
ego get in the way that I'd been screwing up my finances for some
time, and decided to work on that problem instead of wasting time
posting messages to the net all day. I have not yet entirely succeeded
in my goals in this area, but I've made substantial progress, and
would not have made any had I not recognised that a problem existed.

I would suggest that many people here would be better off consciously
applying Popperian pan-critical rationalism to their own lives rather
than treating wake up calls like the one "Anonymous" posted as foreign
concepts to be rejected by the ego's immune system without
consideration.

Doubtless, the knowledge that one might harbor behaviors antithetical
to one's self interest is painful -- but are not the consequences of
persisting in such behaviors far worse?

If you thought your finances were screwed up, and that you weren't
getting much value from posting, then of course you did well to change
your priorities.  But why must you assume we share your problems and
values?  Maybe most of us are making reasonable tradeoffs between
health, wealth, and enjoying life.  Part of enjoying life is
participating in communities such as this one.

What, you expect claims of perfection in the population?  Those who
aren't so working can't contradict you; those who are have no knowledge
to speak of others, and apparently there isn't enough tribalism to call
out a defense of "extropians".  The only way to refute you would be to
do a thorough study of how many extropians were being extropic, and no
one seems to care enough to do so.  Can't imagine why.  Maybe they're
too busy being extropic to hold polls for the sake of arguing with you.
At any rate, you won't get much challenge whether you're right or not.

Well, it's not.  Or doesn't have to be.  Would I be faulted for not
working to be a millionaire if doing so would interfere with my
intellectual pursuits for the next two decades?  Admittedly a 100 grand
stake would be nice, but at the moment I think I'm better off living on
6-7 grand a year (so much for the poverty level) and figuring out what I
want to do and what I might be able to get people to pay me to do.  And
I am living on so little.  (I'm waiting for my credit limit to exceed my
income.  That'll be amusing.  Not that I'd use it like that.)  Or if
someone took a job they liked at half the salary of one they could hold,
but wouldn't like, and which wouldn't let them retire that much faster,
would they be insufficiently concerned with their financial well-being
then?

What anonymous specifically said about physical survival is even more
problematic.  I'm rather ignorant of any strong evidence that vegan
diets are good for health and long life-span.  I'm aware of evidence of
what bad diets are, lots of saturated fat and no fiber, etc., which
being vegan would avoid by default (unless done badly itself), and aware
of evidence for calorie restricted diets increasing lifespan, at least
in other mammals (is it true that mammals all have about a billion
heartbeat max lifespans, except for humans at 2-4 billion?)  So I can
well avoid bad diets while (at 21) letting other volunteers have fun
debugging CR diets.

And while I'm not physically reckless myself, I hardly see why it need
be un-extropian do go skydiving, or whatever, carefully.  There is a
legitimate quality of life question.  And early space exploration will
no doubt be rather risky; will it be unextropian to be among the first
space colonists?

6-hour a week web manager might be too far in the other direction... in
the long run.  Or if I mismanaged my finances.  

You and anonymous posted diatribes basically criticizing someone,
somewhere, for doing something wrong.  No doubt someone was.  Probably
someone was screwing up in the ways you were thinking of.  So what?  You
expect the list to deny that anything's wrong anywhere?  You expect a

Consider Phlebas about that very thing: a conflict between a kind of
hold-out-for-individualism culture and the Culture?  Those Culture AIs
are just too damn bossy!

Actually there is something rather stirring about the idea of the
Culture as the final fulfillment of Marxist prophecy.  ("Imagine, the
old guy was right after all!")  It is also terribly Scottish, a Scottish
form of socialism, that Banks upholds.  I know this because I was once
of exactly the same mind.  There's something about Scottish people in
general that is kind of naturally collectivist, voluntarily collectivist,
in a friendly but robust way.

Certainly, the key point about the Culture, its tremendous technological
ability, its power beyond measure, couldn't be *arrived at* by a
socialist path, since technological *progress* is a function of the kind
of utility testing that only capitalist cultures allow.  But perhaps
something like the Culture could be maintained once a given technological
lift off point had been attained (esp. in AI), and could progress well
enough. I suppose competition effects could be modelled in networked AIs
beyond a certain stage of development: for example, imagine that there
were subroutines that used spare resources across the entire network to
model competition process continuously, reporting results every now and
then to the AIs that set the processes in motion, so they wouldn't even
have to think about it, just let the processes run.

Darwinism all the way up and down.

I suppose if we're going to get machines to look after us and drop the *
necessity* of work, the Culture's as good a vision of that as you could
hope for.  But Banks is always wrestling with the inherent boringness of
such a situation.

But isn't it all a matter of where you decide to draw the boundary between
mind and other?  What do you see the limbic system doing, processing input
and turning it into emotion, or packaging input into a form that lets the
brain turn it into emotion?  I don't really know much about the limbic
system, so it may well be true that a lot of the necessary processing for
emotion gets done there.

I regect Gregory's arguement that emotion is non-cognitive, distinct from
"thought".  I suspect that what Gregory is calling "cognition" is only the
stuff that he is aware of, that sounds like language in his head, that
seems coherent and algorithmic.  Cognition is really a matter of
multitudinous processes acting on a wide variety data input, much of which
never percolates up to what we call consciousness.  If vision is part of
this process, there's no reason to think that emotion isn't.  Emotion is
just one way the mind/brain chooses to represent and respond to some of the
input it gets.  If we replicate the brain, I bet we replicate emotion.

On the other hand, I also bet that it's critical that an uploaded mind gets
enough sensory input, and that it's of the right format.  If I were
uploaded into something that replicated my brain, I wouldn't be worried
that I couldn't feel emotions.  I would be more worried that I wouldn't
have enough to "think" about to stay sane.  That's the nice thing all those
nerves in the body and spinal column provides: lot's of information about
the world.

I thought it was obvious that 'anonymous' had an axe to grind regarding
certain individuals, and also found it odd that she/he thought we needed to
veganize.  If you find merit in critiques of such a broad sweeping nature,
 than great! I find fingerpointing useless.

All the talk about cognition and emotion got me thinking as to the role
that emotions play in humans and the role emotions could play in a computer
(not an upload).  

With human beings, and other animals, emotions are simply the equavalient
of commands or instructions.  Without emotion, a human being is nothing. 
Contrary to what some think, there is no grand meaning of life that
trancends beyond the merely human.  There is no such thing as pure
rationality.  Without emotion, one would not care whether one existed or
not.  Since a person with no emotion would have no reason to do anything,
not even a reason to think, they would, for all practical purposes, be
quite dead.

Computers, on the other hand, are given instructions, in my opinion just
simplified emotions. These instructions motivate the computer to do
something.  Without instruction, the computer does nothing and for all
practically purposes, can be considered inactive.  The computer without
instruction and the human without emotion produce the same output, nothing.

It is agreed that at least some other animals have emotion.  Therefore,
emotion must have evolved in a continuum.  Bacteria obviously do not have
emotion while human beings obviously do.  As the creatures become more
complex, more complex control mechanisms are nescesary.  Hence the
evolution from mere instruction, or instinct, to emotions.

With computers the brain power of insects we have no need to program
emotion.  As computers become more powerful and are entrusted with more
tasks, the instructions we give them will probably start to look more and
more like emotions.  You can easily imagine a robot scurrying away from an
explosion, or even from a loud noise (cockroach level).  Think of a
computer in increasing complex scenarios and they may show even more
behavior indicative of emotion.  The simulation of emotions is all that is
need to have emotions.  This is simply the emotive equivalent of the Turing
test.

Um... no.  I've just read _Consider Phlebas_ ("a minor spoiler consists
of knowing that it _is_ a 'Culture book'") and that's not how I'd
describe the conflict.  Unless you consider the Idiran religious drive to
expansion and domination of weaker races, including nuking their cities,
a "hold-out-for-individualism" culture.  The protagonist is a mercenary
of principle who doesn't so much agree with the Idirans as he opposes
the Culture as a machine-worshipping cancer in the galaxy.  The Culture
seems to be rather high on ability to realize individual potential,
frankly; that's the whole point of the utopia.  The question is the
productive underpinnings.

True, you might not be able to realize your potential as dictator of
some Third World planet.  This is partly because the members of Contact
will be realizing their individual potential to interfere with you.

Banks seems to consider money just "an inefficient form of rationing".
As I understand it money can be considered a form of rationing, but one
mathematically proven to be efficient under ideal circumstances.  Not
that Earth has any ideal governments to outcompete the real markets.  In
the Culture production mostly is automated, supervised by people who
want to as a hobby.  I've never seen the distribution system; I'd guess
you ask for something, and a robot is sent by the Hub or ship Mind to
deliver it.  Rationing doesn't seem to be necessary for any "reasonable"
need; anyone can have what they want.

No one seems to ask for a mole of widgets.  Possibly because everyone in
the Culture is supposed to be sane.  I'm not sure what happens if you
demand a mole of widgets.  Presumably the local Mind says "no."  But the
Mind would give you a ship (no AI) and factory stuff, so you could go
out and make your widgets out of junk no one claimed.  Unless your
widgets were thrall-AI warships, in which case someone might stop you in
self-defense.  For which I can hardly blame them.

Thing is, there's no reason there couldn't be money in the Culture.  But
money facilitates trade, and there isn't enough regular trade to support
money.  Stuff gets grabbed and turned into things.  This isn't a
socialist economy; it's a slowly-growing frontier economy.

Also, if the Culture was run (or admitted being run) by the Minds, it
might be able to claim having an ideal government.  The number of
components of the Mind in _Consider Phlebas_ seems to imply that single
Minds can outthink the population of Earth.  And his numbers are
probably conservative, given the technology he's playing with.

I don't know what that means.  Just about nothing is actually forbidden
in the Culture, certainly not experimentation.  Competition for
scarce resources gives an incentive for improvement, and competition
allows diversity.  Progress would happen in the Culture via play; no one
has to work for a living, but people want to explore and try new things
to keep boredom away.  And the Minds have an efficiency fetish and
curiosity built in.  Such viewpoints certainly shouldn't seem odd to
anyone on this list.

Boring to write about, yes.  That's why all his books deal with abnormal
circumstances.  Boring to live in?  Hah.  Only for those who don't know
what to do with their lives, but never have time to worry about it
because they're too caught up in or exhausted by working for their

idea about emotionality in computer-extropians etc, was based on mythology -
in fact I can see that the emotions may be even more intense when the
lifestyle is not a dramatic expression. 
But what about sensuality?

I don't claim to be a neural expert, but I believe both the above parties are
missing out on something.  All physical sensations, emotions, and thoughts
actually occur in the brain itself, regardless if it seems that our arm
"hurts", or our stomach "aches".  Is it not the brain which feels these
things, and emotions as well?  The brain "thinks" the arm "hurts".  The arm
does not actually "hurt".  The brain does, and it perceived the "hurt" being
located at the arm.  Am I making any sense?

{I think I'll respond to the original post, since we seem to have gotten
off on a tangent about emotional programmers. Geoff will have to forgive me
if I steal his words.  And since this is related to that thread on Proton
Pseudo-Translation, here I'll argue against the point I made in that thread.}

  Just because emotions were evolved earliest doesn't mean they will be
easier to replicate in human-designed computers.  Much of the impetus for
the 80's work on connectionism was the interesting fact that we had made
computers that could deal with all the very difficult "thinking" of
academics and scientist but that couldn't do what a 18month-old could (like
walk, see, recognize Mommy).  With all those various brain structures
devoted to who-knows-what, it could be that feeling requires far more
computational power than thinking or seeing.  And integrating feeling with
the rest of cognition may be pretty tricky or require a whole new
computational model.

Mind you, we've gotten pretty far since then, using programs modeled after
neural systems, in replicating vision and motor functions.  Just because it
isn't easier than replicating the higher functions doesn't mean it's
actually hard...

If you mean *at all*, that doesn't include me, so I can't speak to it.
If you mean *enough*, then define enough.
Else you're being vague--no wonder we're all yawning.

But I'll stay awake a little longer in case you'd like some hints:

Sounds like Tim pointed out something that was actually an issue for
you in particular, at that particular time.

Since most people think that ego is one of the main motivations that
drives rich people, maybe you could explain how it can do the reverse.
Do you think others might have similar problems involving ego?

>would not have made any had I not recognised that a problem existed.

Perry, recognition like that that actually effects a person's life
is rare.  Something made it possible for you to see your life differently.
Probably, you already saw your life differently from the way any of us
see our lives.  If you think you have clues that would change our
lives, I'm all ears.  Maybe Tim's mere badgering did it for you but that
isn't usually sufficient for most people.

You mean she *wasn't* spirited about that!?  Jerome Tuccile said she

that sort of absurdity gets credit for Rand-style spirit?
Funny, trying to imagine Rand giving a disspirited response

That tells me that our naive notions about what is easy and what is difficult 
are wrong. Today's computers don't have much trouble with higher math but 
with more mundane things like pattern recognition, manual dexterity and that 
grab bag of skills and knowledge we call common sense. Only recently has much 
progress been made. One surprising thing computer science has taught us is 
that an enormous about of brain -power is needed to perform an apparently 
simple task like moping a floor. How do I pick up the mop? Is that dirt on 
the floor or is it a shadow? Should I move that obstacle or go around it? 
How long should I try to get rid of that stain before I give up? 

These problems don't seem hard to us because we're very good at them. Natural 
selection gave a big advantage to those who were good at spotting the pattern
of a saber toothed tiger hiding in the bushes, but no advantage to those who 
were good at solving differential equations. It is not mere rhetoric to say 
that in an absolute sense a janitor has a more intellectually challenging job 
than a professor of mathematics.

I don't see how. Even with his tiny brain a rat can feel, and I can find no 
evidence that his emotions are inferior to ours, even though our brain is a 
thousand times larger. I can find lots of evidence that a rat's thinking is 
inferior to ours.

Good point. Maybe this is the reason many think computer people are
unemotional - they don't appear very sensual. In my opinion, much of the
scientific and computer world is more directed towards an epicurean form
of pleasure (the seeking of truth, friendship, understanding, elegant
structure etc.) than a sensual form of pleasure (with notable individual
exceptions, of course). But I don't know if this is just my perspective 
or a more general view.

The title story of Banks' recent collection of Culture short stories,
'State of the Art', and a few of the other stories in there, are all
about this.  (There's also a great anticapitalist rant in State of the
Art itself!) 

It's not so much that there's a lack of things to do in the Culture,
it's that there's a lack of any *reason* to do *anything*. Everything's
too easy, or has already been done; while  part of the fun of life is
overcoming the world's 'resistance', having something to*push against* -
a cliche, I know, but nevertheless true. (Have you come across the work
of a psychologist called Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi?)

As we are now, struggle and all, we might say it's a fair trade: give up
the dubious Daoistic blessings of life's troublesomeness for the
tangible benefits of the Culture.  But, as Banks toys with in State of
the Art, people who have lived in the Culture might see it the other way.

(Interestingly reminiscent of theological arguments about evil, this!)

At any rate, I stand by saying that the Culture, while a possible peak
in cultural design space, isn't a peak we could get to by a socialist
(planned/skyhooks) path, but only by a capitalist (Darwinian/cranes)
path. Actually I think that's Banks' only delusion, and that the Culture
is, pretty much as you say, a possible Beyond type of cultural form, and
on the whole an attractive one.  In my criticism of it, I was mixing up
a critique of Banks' fervent anticapitalism with a critique of the
Culture as a possible social design.

The rule of thumb I always use is this:- you know how we *seem* to have
emotional communication with our pets, like our cats and dogs, and
it*seems* like it's reciprocated? Well, there really*is* emotional stuff
going on there,and it's precisely the limbic system which we share with
our pets that allows us to communicate in that way. (It may not be as
fully anthropomorphic a communication event as pet lovers imagine, but
it's definitely there.)

As I understand it, the limbic system controls all those *bodily
reactions* (e.g. tears, flushing, anxiety, excitement, etc.) that go to
creating the complex entity we call an 'emotion'.  For us, certainly,
there are lots of 'thoughts' strictly so-called mixed in with all those
bodily reactions, so we as humans can hardly think of emotions separately
>from thoughts, but as the pet example shows, that is not a sufficient
distinction.  

Emotion in the strict (cross-species) sense *is* those bodily reactions
to external stimuli. They *are* cognitive - especially they are
cognitive in the sense that they serve to allow mammals to cognise the
'internal states' of their fellows - I believe that is their main
evolutionary raison d'etre.  Empathy co-ordinates.

(If you think about it, mammals are much more social creatures than
lizards and such - even cats have a high degree of sociality, though not
as much as dogs, which are pack animals to the core. I mean 'social'
while being highly complex as individuals too, of course - birds and
fish are highly social too, sometimes, but are not nearly such complex
creatures as mammals.)

They may also be at the root of mimicry, which is the foundation of
culture.

I agree with you.  I think Gregory is right that emotion is part of
fully human experience, and would need to be duplicated somehow in any upload
-capable system that claimed to replicate human experience; but since
Anders' reply to my post, I now see that replicating emotion would
actually be a good place for AI researchers to start, primarily because
it is, in fact, a primitive form of cognition- it's like, just as they've
discovered how valuable it is to model simple cognitive systems like
those of insects, as things progress, they will move onto modelling reptilian
control systems, then lower, then higher mammalian control systems, and
only then will they be starting to get some handle on the way the
neocortex functions.  (Who wants to bet that it's Darwin machines all the
way?)

This is what I would call the "fluidity problem" - you could in principle 
become or feel anything, so how to avoid getting trapped in an attracting 
but useless motivational state (100% bliss or a fundamental belief that 
you present state is the ideal state and should never be changed, no 
matter what)? 

I think playing around with our senses like turning on or off pain or
pleasure can be dealt with using some safeguards (like having reminders
pop up in the mind etc), but the more general changes are harder to deal
with.

I think that a major problem with the emotional and very much the
sensual side of programs is lost by the way that computer programming is
set up.  It is set up into organized structures,  they don't always have
to be elegant.  And Anders I agree with you that it has been lost to
scientists and computer scientists the more emotional and sensuous
aspects of life.  Times are changing and more Artistic people are
getting on the computers and learning to programs.

Things are becoming more free form.  I can't wait to see what will
happen with the new merger of science and artistic creativity that has
begun on the computers!

This is a good point. But it is a good METAPHOR, not really a fact or a
truth, in any concrete sense. Emotions are still not exactly "planned"
instructions, so the analogy falls a bit short. How these emotions come to
us, unbidden, is still not fully explained by cognitive science- nor is a
model of it avalable for computers, yet.
Also the emotions, unlike a series of computer commands, are known by our
mind to  give sometimes  faulty instructions, and are subject to us
overriding them in cases where emotional acuity exists, and where, with
foresight,  we can determine a poor outcome. 
However, emotion *does* play a critical part in creativity, and links
thoughts together in a way logic cannot, and these processes  do produce
output of the nature you describe.

  I think it makes sense here to draw distinctions
between perceptions, feelings, emotions, urges, and
expressions.

  Perceptions, including physical, may cause emotions,
or may not, or emotions may arise without physical
perception (e.g., you figure out a solution to some
problem, or remember something).  The fact that
perceptions may cause emotions doesn't mean they are
equal.
  Perceptions may also cause feelings - e.g., cold,
or itch - those are different from emotions.
  Urges are things like hunger, lust, etc.
The difference between urges and emotions, IMO, is that
urges are born on a level of an organ/subsystem, and
express its needs to the rest of the individual; emotions
are born on the level of the individual, and _may_ be
expressed socially.   Expression is not the emotion though.
Example: anger is an emotion; frowning is an expression.

The need for emotions, as I see it, arises in primitive
systems that are unable to figure out causes and effects
and plan their actions intelligently.

Suppose you want to program a rabbit for optimal behavior.
You could explain to it its intended role in evolution,
and ask it to choose appropriate behaviors in all life
situations.  That may be pretty hard for a rabbit to do
consciously, as it doesn't have enough general intelligence;
hardwiring a complex analytical system into the rabbit's
brain is too difficult for the blind evolutionary mechanism.
The solution here would be to program "one-step smarts" into
the rabbit.  If you see a wolf, run; if you see a fox, run;
if you see a hawk, hide; if you see a falling stone, jump.
The rules would be more compact and general if they are
grouped.
 (wolf,fox,hawk,stone) -> [State "danger", bad]
 [Everything OK]       -> [State "happiness", good]
Now, you program into the rabbit a desire to avoid bad states
and achieve good ones, and appropriate reactions for each state,
and the job is done.  The perception of each of these states by
the rabbit is an emotion.  The perceptions of its causes, and
resulting behaviors are connected to emotions, but are already
a different matter.
  It is really easy to program such one-state rules into a computer.
You can write a chess program that would "feel good" every time it
takes an opponent's piece, "scared" every time its piece may be taken,
"angry" when it happens, and "peaceful" in all other cases.  You can
even evolve a population of such programs with a mix of predators,
cowards, and peaceful/aimless piece movers.
One thing you can't do with such "single-step intelligence", is to
develop a good chess program, as chess requires looking more then
one step ahead.  And so do all other problems.  So the best solution
would be to come up with a brain that can do better-than-one-step
situation analysis, equip it with understanding of the rules and
goals, and do away with this primitive emotion stuff.
This is how we program the computers.  They are already beyond emotions.
With ourselves, it is different though; as a legacy system, the human
consciousness is a funny mix of an "inner rabbit" and new rational
thinking mechanisms.   This defines our identity and allows us to have
a lot of fun (usually by misusing the mechanisms wired into us by
nature to optimize our behavior in the woods and monkey tribes), but
may not be the best way to program computers, or engineer the next
generation of intelligence.
  If I ever get a chance to reprogram myself, I would put emotions
under complete control, so that, when I want, I could turn off the bad
ones, and feel the selected good ones.  So that the emotions would
be used only for fun, and will not stand in the way of decision-making
processes, where they tend to mess things up, even when the goal of
decision-making is to optimize future emotions.  I guess this is
something most people are trying to do with their emotions already.

03/28/97. _Life Itself_ ch.5 is called "Entailment Without States:
Relational Biology", and in 5A and 5B Rosen recognizes the pioneering
work of Nicholas Rashevsky who, in the 1930s (predating even Hebb's
cell-assembly work in the '40s), "conceived the pregnant idea of
stringing excitable elements into networks"; but, by the 1950s had
realized that "no collection of separate /descriptions/ (i.e., =
/models/)
of organisms, however, comprehensive, could be pasted together to
capture the organism itself.... Rashevsky is saying that we must look
for a principle that governs the way in which phenomena are =
/organized/,
a principle that governs the /organization/ of the phenomena, rather
than the phenomena themselves."=20

Mathematically, Rosen says, "the trick is to consider what happens on
certain /sets/ of phases of that underlying particulate system, rather
than on individual phases, and to express this in a /probabilistic/
language.... The Second Law thus asserts that /a closed system cannot
autonomously tend to an organized state/. Or, contrapositively, /a
system autonomously tending to an organized state cannot be closed/."

In 5D, "The Concept of Function", Rosen warns that this "has overtones
of end, purpose, finality, [though] nowadays it is considered again
acceptable to talk of function, because natural selection and the
adaptive evolutionary processes it generates can, it is supposed, be
invoked to exorcise any finalistic demons." Rosen talks about how
through "willful, active intervention" and observation, "the =
discrepancy
between the two /systems/ [before and after] defines the concept of
/component/; the discrepancy between the /behaviors/ defines the
/function/ of the component."

In 5E, "On the Strategy of Relational Modeling", Rosen continues to
emphasize the distinction between relational and traditional
reductionist approaches by saying: "I can epitomize a reductionist
approach ... as follows: throw away the organization  and keep the
underlying matter." But he emphasizes, "there is nothing in the
relational strategy that is unphysical ... The organization of a =
natural
system ... is at least as much a part of its material reality as the
specific particles that constitute it at a given time, perhaps indeed
more so."

5F, "The Component", talks about how "the component may be thought of =
as
the /particle of function/"; and 5G discusses "Systems from Components"
via mappings, circuits, compositions and the "abstract block diagrams"
Rosen uses to describe these. In 5H, "Entailment in Relational =
Systems",
Rosen claims to "have made a gentle and natural progression from
/organization/ to /function/ to /component/, and thence back to
organization."=20

He describes how "inner entailments are of a restricted kind; only
/elements of sets/ can be entailed thereby." Whereas, "outer =
entailments
allow us to entail (in fact, to /construct/) mappings from mappings in
the category, and sets from sets." Here, he says, "we must invoke a
category axiom, the one that allows composition of mappings [and] gives
us an inferential rule F of precisely the form F(f,g) =3D gf [such =
that]
gf can be regarded as an /effect/, the pair (f,g) is its material =
cause,
and the inferential rule F is its efficient cause.... But it is crucial
to keep in mind that this inferential rule F, which governs the
entailment of mappings from mappings, is not /in/ the category; /it =
does
not encode a component/".

02/09/97. _Life Itself_ 5I introduces final causation & functional
entailment: "by invoking the concept of design ... we are talking about
finality. This is alright when we talk about machines as human
fabrications, but it is manifestly not alright to consider organisms in
such terms.... The traditional argument is that the produce of an
evolutionary process give the /appearance/ of design but without any of
the finalistic implications of design". Final causation is inconsistent
in the Newtonian picture, but not in the relational picture where "a
component is entailed by its function"; but, Rosen hastens to add, this
"does not connote anything vitalistic or transphysical in material
nature".

In 5J, on "Augmented Block Diagrams", Rosen claims that it is possible
to entail mappings because the mappings from one set to another are
themselves a set AND also a mapping. He is building a case for =
recursive
relations between system components as the basis of biology, vs. the
recursive chronicling of separate components that is the basis of
mechanics.

03/15/97. In 5K of _Life Itself_, on finality & entailment in 'abstract
block diagrams', Rosen argues that "finality is allied to the notion of
possibility, while the other causal categories involve necessity". He
shows how, with relational models, "there can be many distinct,
different ways of entailing the effect f(a) (i.e., of executing the
function), between which final causation cannot distinguish".

Finally, in 5L (p143), Rosen describes the Theory of Categories that he
has been leading up to: "The Theory of Categories arose out of topology
[and] the Cauchy concept of convergence ... a mapping is continuous if
it commutes with the operation of taking limits of sequences; if the
image of a limit is the limit of the images.... convergence and
continuity are local concepts ... the traditional figures of the
geometer are not local objects.... The obvious way to connect the two
... is to tie the notion of congruence (a global notion) to that of
continuity (a local one) ... we need continuous mappings (to preserve
the local structure) that are also invertible (so as to form a group)."

"In a word, we are led to the homeomorphisms, which turn a topological
space into a geometry in the sense of Klein.... If we wish to retain =
the
original geometric flavor of the Klein Program and treat individual
topological spaces as 'figures', we can see ourselves being led toward =
a
category of all topological spaces.... There is thus the problem of
trying to decide whether two particular topological spaces are
homeomorphic or not. This is the Classification Problem ... One way to
approach it is ... in terms of invariants, with numbers or other =
objects
that are constant on the equivalence classes.... The trouble is that
nonhomeomorphic spaces may also get the same number ... Most of what is
presently available in these directions goes back to Poincare ... it
embodies a very syntactical approach to topology."

Rosen then describes the progression from points, zero-simplexes, to
line segments, one-simplexes, to chains, two simplexes, to arrays of
such simplexes, complexes, and continues: "the boundary operation,
appropriately generalized, is a homomorphism between groups of chains =
of
successive dimensions ... if S1, S2 are two complexes, and f: S1 -> S =
is
a continuous mapping between them, there is a corresponding group
homomorphism Hn(f): Hn(S1):-> Hn(S2) for each n [nth homology group]; =
if
f is a homeomorphism, then Hn(f) is an isomorphism.... These Hn are
examples of functors. They basically associate groups Hn(S) with
complexes S ... It is most important to observe that such factors do
not, in general, associate or encode elements (points) of S with
elements of Hn(S).... In fact, all we retain about S is that some of =
its
points lie on boundaries that separate others; i.e., a relational
property. Indeed, the relation between S and the Hn(s) is what we
earlier termed a metaphorical one.... And it is important to note that
the metaphor from the Hn(S) to S ... runs in the opposite direction as
the functor itself (i.e., from spaces to groups). That is, we decode =
the
range of the functor to its domain."=20

"Category Theory itself embodies this picture but divorces it =
completely
from any specific referents. Thus, in place of the topological spaces
and groups of algebraic topology, we have unspecified objects; in place
of continuous mappings and group homomorphisms, we have correspondingly
unspecified morphisms. In fact, we can even dispense with the objects
and proceed entirely on the basis of morphisms alone. We only require
that morphisms can be composed, just as mappings can, and that this
composition is associative.... We can take functors as objects of a new
category, with natural transformations providing the morphisms between
them. And we can keep doing this, iterating this procedure, so that the
functors and natural transformations arising at any given level become
the objects and morphisms for the next. In a certain sense, then,
Category Theory can talk about itself, or describe itself, in ways more
nearly akin to natural languages than to the formal systems that
normally constitute mathematics.... It can be used as a kind of
transducer, to move ideas and methods from one part of mathematics to
another."

I have recently discovered that these _Life Itself_ theories of
biophysicist Robert Rosen on the distinctions between organisms and
mechanisms have invoked substantial discussion on the Principia
Cybernetica mailing list and can be browsed through the PRNCYB-L Web
archive at
http://www.fmb.mmu.ac.uk/~bruce/PRNCYB-L

A good alternative summary of these theories can be found in Donald C.
Mikulecky's Web essay: LIFE, COMPLEXITY AND THE EDGE OF CHAOS: COGNITIVE
ASPECTS OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN CELLS AND OTHER COMPONENTS OF LIVING
SYSTEMS at 
http://views.vcu.edu/complex/mikulecky/rev.htm
Mikulecky's essay is a good summary of Rosen's theories from someone who
(unlike myself) has read all of Rosen's works and extensively applied
these theories in scientific investigations, and also includes some of
the *diagrams* that are very helpful for understanding the modeling
relations described.

BTW, the issues involved here are at the core of several recent
Extropians threads ("Protean Self-Transformation" and "The Emotional
Computer") and a few Transhumans threads as well.  I wish I had the time
and fluency to show how they apply, but I don't.

Some additional items on the Web that might help anyone interested in
relating the above mentioned threads to these relational biology and
category theory concepts are:

* Jeff Prideaux's  "Observables and Fractions" essay at
http://www.acsa2000.net/bcngroup/analytic.html

* Bruce Edmond's post titled "A-Life as Self-referential TMs" at
http://www.fmb.mmu.ac.uk/~bruce/PRNCYB-L/0858.html

* Finally, on the question of whether cognitive / emotive beings can
really be simulated on mechanistic systems, I'd recommend Catharina
Kennedy's Oct 1995 PRNCYB-L post at
http://www.fmb.mmu.ac.uk/~bruce/PRNCYB-L/0836.html

03/28/97. Ch.6 of Robert Rosen's _Life Itself_ discusses 'Analytic and
Synthetic Models': "Modeling ... is the art of bringing entailment
structures into congruence.... the essence of art is that, at root, it
rests on the unentailed, on the intuitive leap. I have stressed
repeatedly that the encodings and decodings on which modeling relations
depend are themselves unentailed. Thus, theoretical scientists must be
more artists than craftsmen; Natural Law assures them only that their
art is not in vain, but it in itself provides not the slightest clue =
how
to go about it".

6A. 'Modeling Relations': "An examination of modeling within =
mathematics
reveals two quite different approaches to modeling. One of them, which =
I
shall call /analytic/, is intimately tied to the idea of direct
(Cartesian) product ... the notion of efficient cause. The other, which
I shall call /synthetic/, is tied rather to the idea of /direct sum/ =
and
to the notion of material cause.... Only in very special situations do
they happen to be equivalent in any sense, and these special situations
all inherently involve some kind of linearity.... In fact, the
difference between direct sum and direct product, between synthetic and
analytic models, is also closely allied to the difference between
/syntactic/ and /semantic/.... from this viewpoint, Godel's
Incompleteness Theorem is an assertion that direct product [does not
equal] direct sum (more specifically, direct product is 'bigger' ... we
shall see further that an assumption of coincidence between analysis =
and
synthesis leads directly to the concept of /mechanism/ ... In a sense,
it is the thrust of this entire work that this hypothesis of analysis =
=3D
synthesis must be dropped.... By dropping it, we enter a new realm of
system, which I call /complex/ ... The distinction between relational
and Newtonian models of natural systems will become crucial here,
because as we shall see, the former extend to the realm of complex
systems, while the latter cannot."

6B. 'Some Preliminaries: Equivalence Relations': "At one level,
equivalence relations can be looked upon as a vehicle for constructing
new sets (quotient sets) from given ones.... the relation R ... allows
us to ... first, find in S/R the equivalence class to which s belongs,
and then, locate s within this class. A property of s that depends only
on its class ... will be called a /general property/ of s, relative to
R. On the other hand, a property of s that depends on where it is =
within
its class ... will be called a special property.... We can think of the
set S/R of equivalence classes as a /base space/. Over each point in
this space, there is an equivalence class, the /fiber/ consisting of =
all
elements of S that project onto this point.... the base space here is
the habitat of the general properties under R; the fibers embody the
special properties.... I will henceforth call the mapping f: S -> X an
/observable/ of S; the totality of values f(S) of f will be called its
/spectrum/.... When we write the expression 'f(s)', we get the
impression that f, the mapping, is fixed, and s, its argument, is
variable in S. But the role of argument and mapping are formally
interchangeable.... given S, the set R(S) of all equivalence relations

  We (Firefly, Inc.) are working now on a book recommendation
system for Barnes and Noble, and are trying to come up with
lists of important books in each of the fiction categories that
would allow us to better survey tastes of different groups of
readers. If you can recommend such lists, or can suggest some
particular titles that you think would be good for a survey,
please let me know.
 The books should not necessarily be "the best" in a category
from any point of view, and may not be current bestsellers.
The purpose is that after we ask the users to rate these titles,
we can have some [preliminary but] decent understanding of their
tastes.

  The book categories we are interested at this point are:

 1.  Action/Adventure/family saga/war
 2.  Erotica
 3.  Espionage / Intrigue
 4.  Folklore
 5.  Gay/Lesbian fiction
 6.  Horror/suspense/thriller/ghost
 7.  Humorous fiction
 8.  Literary/classic
 9.  Mystery and detective
10.  Mythology
11.  Religious fiction
12.  Romance
13.  Science Fiction
14.  Fantasy
15.  Westerns

  I would greatly appreciate it if you could nominate some titles
and authors; if you have the ISBNs, it would be better still.

  Please send any suggestions you have to <alexc@firefly.net>

I in no way mean to suggest (and did not think I was suggesting) that
one shouldn't subscribe to things like "extropians" or enjoy the
fellowship of others.

I was far more suggesting that many people spend their time far more
in the "wouldn't it be neat if" rather than in the "how to" mode of
thought, and dream of the future rather than following through and
attempting to achieve the realization of their dreams.

Not everyone, of course, need share the same values or desires. (The
world economy works precisely because people have a diversity of
desires and skills.) I would not suggest that every extropian become a
computer programmer tomorrow or some such. 

I would, however, suggest this: achieving dreams is usually more
satisfying that merely having them. Most Extropians dream of a life
without end and without unreasonable constraints. A surprisingly large
fraction, however, do very little in the way of attempting to actually
achieve that sort of life for themselves. I don't believe in the
concepts of universal good and evil, so I will not judge people for
not attempting to achieve their dreams. I will, however, suggest that
most people are happier if they actually are moving forward toward
them rather than simply thinking about them.

I will also point out that I did not start this thread. "Anonymous",
whomever s/he is, did. I merely reacted to the way that, almost like a
bunch of antibodies lining up against a foreign invader, or group of
fundamentalist christians ganging up on someone discussing atheism,
the list membership "rejected" the posting by "Anonymous" without
giving it serious consideration. As I noted, some of the comments
(like "selfishness isn't measured in dollars") seemed fairly inane --
after all, the point was not "you should be more selfish" but instead
"you may find yourself much happier if you have the financial means to
achieve your personal goals".

Since part of being an Extropian is (I would presume for most people)
to achieve the sort of personal apotheosis dreamed of in "BEST DO IT
SO", I would assume that criticism -- even self criticism -- would be
an important part of Self Transformation. After all, to Self Transform
implies 1) that you are not happy with your current world line, and
that 2) you want to shift it in response to a critical analysis of
what is wrong with your current condition.

"Ego" in the colloquial sense doesn't usually drive people
forward. Generally, I think it holds them back.

People have an unhealthy tendency to become dogmatically attached to
their ideas and their lifestyle. This tends to make people reject
important information -- especially when the are incorrect. People
frequently have trouble admitting *even to themselves* that their
position is incorrect or that their actions are counterproductive. I
attribute this to "ego" in the sense that often the problem is
emotional attachment to one's world and world-view (often conflating
one's self worth with the "truth" of one's ideas), and not an
inability to think things through clearly *if one is willing to*.

In my opinion, the beginning of wisdom is the ability to say "I was
wrong about that -- I had better revise my closely held view based on
the facts".

I'm possibly rather different from most people. I say "possibly"
because I frankly don't know what other people's inner lives are like
in this regard.

For those that remember me, you may recall that I came to my current
views (i.e. anarchocapitalism and the notion that the free market isn't
just to be tolerated but that in fact "to be rich is glorious", to
quote the new Chinese Communist Party mantra) as an adult, having
spent many years as a self-acknowledged socialist. Over a period of
time, however, I realized "I was wrong", and changed my viewpoint 180
degrees. Such adult changes in world view happen, but they are hardly
universal. I know many others who have not done the same even
confronted with strong reason to do so.

On many occasions I've had a sudden internal "snap" as I've realized
"you know, that viewpoint that I've held is not just incorrect but
actively damaging to my self interest -- I had better revise my
thinking".

I'm not certain that I'm particularly unusual in this respect, but
I've noticed than many other people around me of all stripes *seem* to
have a much higher tendency to bring ego into their decision making
processes. They wrap their feeling of self worth in with their belief
in the "correctness" of their world view or thinking, so it hurts to
think "I was wrong" -- thus making them avoid that path of reasoning
once they've made up their minds. This makes a "pan-critically
rational" world view hard, because to be a pan-critical rationalist
means that you have to be willing to accept the notion that tomorrow
morning any of your closely cherished beliefs might suddenly be
falsified.

In my opinion (and this is just my opinion), to live well especially
in a fast paced, ever changing world, you can't be overly attached to
one's ideas or one's activities. You can work for six months or a year
very hard on a project and have the conditions that made the project
worthwhile disappear. You could be horribly devastated by this, but it
won't make your life any better to do so. Similarly for ideas, people
(nothing wrong with mourning but you can take the deaths of friends
too far and torture yourself about their loss) or anything else. Every
once in a while, one finds ones self confronting the approaching need
to detach ones' self from something. Resisting changing one's opinion,
habits, etc. for reasons of "ego" only causes more pain. You should,
in my opinion, keep your goals in mind, rationally consider whether
you should continue with your job, your course of study (or lack
thereof), your world view, etc., and, if rational examination makes it
look like it is getting in the way of where you want to be, let go.

I would suggest that this might hamper decision making as well, for it would
disable the program that can tell the difference between a pleasurable
outcome and an unpleasant one. For example you could switch off the bad
feelings just before you went into battle, or executed a risky plan that had
50- 50 chance - And in case it came out wrong, and you would still "feel"
good about your decision, even if things went terribly awry. 
If everything turns to shit, you're in jail or broke, or whatever, just
amplify the good feelings and what's the difference?

        [Bring out my age-old generic response here.] You forget that this
is merely a list that deals with the arguments and information provided by
like-minded people...a list exclusively made for such discourse.  Most (if
not all) on this list do more for extropy than check their mail every hour
and subscribe to a few magazines.  Extropy's something that I cannot even
comprehend being idle and wishy-washy about.  I would wager that most people
on this list were extropians before they even heard the term spoken.
However, your argument appears similar to arguing whether a whisper is more
effective than a shout...they both have their place.  What *is*
disappointing is the SIGNAL:NOISE ratio.  Currently we have a lot of NOISE
going on this list (my post included) as opposed to the desired SIGNAL.  It
isn't hard to get SIGNAL happening, but first you must relinquish the NOISE.
Nothing's stopping any of us from generating SIGNAL and complaining about it
isn't doing anything.  So who is going to aim their stone?

Hmm, it has just occurred to me that there might be a Hayekian
argument here?  Maybe the killjoys have a point in that our present
emotional/cognitive setup is functional in ways we don't yet understand,
and perhaps there is some sort of balance there that, if disturbed,
would render it dysfunctional in some way we can't foresee?

I haven't read _State of the Art_ yet, but Banks has talked about this
somewhat elsewhere.  About how Contact's secular missionary work, it's
"good works", provides the justfication for the Culture's easy
existence.  Some people may feel this way; I think many would find
purpose on their own.  If it's really a problem, cultural or even
genetic evolution will happen: those who find reasons to live will live.

Digression:
There's a cliche that if we make contact with an advanced civilization
our research will drop, because "everything's been done, why bother?"  I
find little support for this in general.  In real life many aborigines
have adapted well to Wester culture, I hear.  I don't know how well
their culture survives, but the people adapt and go on.  In SF... Julian
May had the most likely scenario, I think, where in a generation or two
humans have learned Galactic physics and are holding their own.  Brin
has some die-off of research, but not completely, and there he has the
justification that not only has it all been done, but so much has been
done that even the Galactics don't know what's there.  Clarke had
die-off in Childhood's End, but the Overlords refused to tell us
anything.

End digression; the Culture, I think, has the single best reason
anywhere for the humans to give up research: the Minds.  Even if you
learn what's happened up till now, theù can vastly outthink you.

Except that they run out of physics to do, and biology and history allow
contributions by humans.  Small ones, but useful ones.  Mathematics
would be the area where nothing ever slows the Minds down, and humans
have no advantage.  Oddly enough, in _Excession_ we learn that esoteric
mathematics is the grand addiction of the Minds.

But in an earlier book, there was a human mathematician anyway.  People
do things.

} At any rate, I stand by saying that the Culture, while a possible peak
} in cultural design space, isn't a peak we could get to by a socialist
} (planned/skyhooks) path, but only by a capitalist (Darwinian/cranes)

One point I forgot last time: the Culture isn't a monolithic socialism.
It's an anarchy of socialisms: each ship or habitat is socialistic (or
dictatorial) but relations between them is anarchic.  He argues that
this is inherent to the nature of the medium.  It's hard to levy
property taxes on property which can run away, and conversely the amount
of uncontrollable interactions on a ship (breathing) may screw over a
local market mechanism.  Okay, his anticapitalism is stronger than that,
but he himself recognizes that the Culture may not be creatable by its
own lifestyle; he worries more about a need for agression to evolve
intelligence and technology.

But hey, we aren't living the way we once did either.  The key is
whether a society is sustainable.  I don't like May's Milieu because it
seems too pacifistic to survive against more "primitive" societies
without locking them up.  But the Culture is wealthy enough to do what
it wants and healthy enough to _want_ to research and explore and
computer model generations of warship-designs without the competition of
survival pressure.  "People hate to feel useless."  And there's probably
status to be gained.  "I found a trillion year old star!"  "I proved the
433rd _Serious Callers Only_ Conjecture!"  And whatever Banks thinks, I
doubt that some monetary mechanism to determine who gets the steaks or
the shrimp will damage his Utopia.

If we were to seriously consider the economics of such an advanced
society (it's a game, Perry) I'd worry more about allocation of raw
resources and control of spreading.

        I am very interested in what everyone has to say on the topic, if
anyone has been storing pithy one-liners for a theological vs. technological

For starters, consider taking this approach--that the implied premise in the
argument, which is "we either allow nature to take its course or we are
playing God," is a fallacy.  You needn't permit the argument to enter your
paper, no less any dialogue on the ethics of the employment of
transhumanistic technology.

Ethics /is/ a technology, just like language, society, education, and
the paper on which you write about them.  And the very language of the
question is absurd: one can no more "defy evolution" than one can defy
gravity.  Evolution isn't a purpose, it's an effect. 

Evolution (or for that matter whatever other process you postulate
led to the development of species) led to a vast array of creatures
with different abilities and mechanisms for survival.  Our species
has been equipped with a capable mind, and a natural desire to use
it.  Beavers make dams; humans make fire, the wheel, hunting weapons,
clothing, agriculture, government, family structure.

These things are just as much a part of nature as birds' nests and
anthills.  As we evolve further, each generation learns from the
last about its struggles, its mistakes, its crimes, and creates ways
to overcome them.  The next generation learns from /those/ mistakes
and creates new marvels--and new mistakes.  That continuous struggle
is what we are--what nature itself is.  To choose some single point
in our history and say that the Earth as it existed then is "natural"
and everything since is "artificial" is arbitrary and meaningless.
Was Neanderthal man "natural", with his particular set of tools and
tribal structure?  Were the American Indians "natural" with their
larger nations and religious rituals?  Are the Amish "natural" with
their barn raisings and head cheese?

The obvious conclusion is that all of them were, as are we, and as
our cybernetic grandkids will be next century.  We're not "playing
God", we're playing human, just as we always have.

  It appears that at this point nobody has a decent representation
of the taste space.  Purchase data and bestseller lists are generic
and do not tell you what books are bought by different kinds of
people; also, they reflect current trends, but not the books that
people could have read 10 or 20 years ago. Reading lists are usually
specialized.  Also, tastes and purchases are quite different things.

(Besides, nobody has a database representing extropian tastes -
which is one of the reasons I asked for advice on this list).

It would be very interesting to do some real-time analysis of
taste trends - this would allow, among all other things, to predict
sales data for various products, and the market value of the
companies that produce them...

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

EXpedition 97 is just three months away.  This is probably a good time to
remind folks that a group of us will be taking a backpacking trip in northern
New Mexico from July 3 to 7, 1997.  Rendezvous is at the Albuquerque airport
as early as possible on July 3 and we will be getting out of the back country
in time for departing flights from Albuquerque during the afternoon of July
7.  We will probably make the trip in a way that people could depart earlier
than that, if necessary.

Right now, the plan is to try to gather the party by no later than noon or 1
pm on July 3 for departure by car from the Albuquerque airport.  We'll be
picking up consumables that can't travel by air in Albuquerque (fuel and
last-minute "I forgots") and then heading to our trailhead campsite in the
Pecos Wilderness Area outside Santa Fe.  We'll hike into a base camp along
the Pecos River on July 4.  Activity on the 5th and 6th will depend on
whether group members need to leave earlier than the 7th, but will most
probably either consist of day hikes up the Pecos and to other destinations
or a very mild overnight peak-bagging expedition.  We'll break our base camp
early on the 7th and make it out to the cars and back to Albuquerque that
day.

I'm an experienced backpacking guide and there will be others on the trip
with backcountry experience.  This will be a very mild trip, so novices are
welcome.  I've created a web page for the trip, with itinerary details, a
list of folks who have expressed an interest in going, and tips for novices:

       http://users.aol.com/gburch2/exp97.html

Everyone is invited to stop by the web page and everyone is invited to come
along on what promises to be a great trip!  If you're interested, please drop
me a line privately.  Please put the term "EXpedition 97" at the beginning of
the subject line so I'll be sure to spot your message.

I'm sending a separate e-mail to everyone I can identify who has already
expressed an interest.  As some of you know, I've had some hardware problems
in recent weeks that caused me to lose some e-mail archives so, if you get
this message from the List and don't get a private e-mail, PLEASE send me a
note to confirm your continuing interest.

I look forward to seeing you on EXpedition 97!

If you accept that God created us (in his own image, no less), and you 
accept that God is omniscient, then you must accept that God knew full 
well what he was doing when he created us with consciousness, curiosity, 
and the ability to develop technology to assist us in our growth.  
Therefore, the philosophy of transhuman development not only _doesn't_ 
defy evolution, but is, rather, part of our evolution, and is also part 
of God's plan for us.

Put that in your Bible and smoke it!

I don't know how literally you mean "bordering on creationism" but if it's
literally true you're probably wasting your time.  Anybody believing in
creationism is following emotional or social needs while ignoring
overwhelming evidence in matters biological.  If so, even the most pithy or
telling arguments will be ignored.  

Anyway, on defying evolution: We already do.  I'd have died of pneumonia at
age 3 if we didn't defy evolution with antibiotics.

On playing God: What, is all this hypothetical God able to do is push around
a few DCA molecules?  Pretty wimpy God, I'd say.  I thought God was supposed
to have made the universe, which would be a much more impressive feat.  I
don't see how even completely remaking our entire *galaxy* could even
remotely be considered "playing God".

Sounds like a hard problem, but most probably worthwhile. 

When people accuse me of wanting to play God I usually point out that it 
is by playing one truly learns. 

Here are some one-liners and other quotes:

"...the only meaning of life worth caring about is one that can withstand
our best efforts to examine it." - Daniel C. Dennett

It's time to stop worshipping gods and aim at becoming gods. -- Markoff
Chaney

We are alreadly like gods, now we better get good at it too. -- 
Misquoted from somewhere (Whole Earth Review?)

"I see no difference between physical and spiritual.
How about this:
a physical mind,
a physical body,
a physical soul,
a physical heaven,
and a physical God.

I notice that the definitions of those concepts are very mystical.
I believe mysticism is tactic used to keep people stupid.
Stupid people are too busy arguing about things 
to notice they are being killed.
It is memetic warfare."
Mike Cowar

Two little longer but relevant quotes: 

Like the Romantics before them, genre SF writers have generally been on
the side of Faust, convinced that the quest for knowledge was a sacred
one, no matter how fondly a jealous God might prefer blind faith.
Stableford, Brian and Peter Nichols. 1993. "Technology." Pp. 1202-1204 in
The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, eds. John Clute and Peter Nichols.
NY: St. Martins Press. 

The second face had the classical beauty that could belong to a man as
well as a woman. There was no particular expression of virility nor of
femininity. Still it wasn't a blank face; it expressed youth -- eternal
triumphant youth -- transcending everything else. The expression
proclaimed pure simple existence, superior to any mystery, torment or
nostalgias. It was a plenitude, not self-contained, but expressing
limitlessness. In other words, it was a face of a god and very human at
the same time. This head proclaimed, "God is human and human is God." 
William Markiewicz (from some issue of the Vagabond)


And finally a fun exchange from the omega-point theory list: 

Cosma: Man trully *is* God
Jim Davila: Heaven help us!

    "Thou art God," Mike repeated serenely. "That which groks. Anne is
    God. I am God. The happy grass are God. Jill groks in beauty
    always. Jill is God. All shaping and making and creating together --"
    He croaked something in Martian and smiled.

		--Robert A. Heinlein, "Stranger in a Strange Land"

"Evolution" is a cold physical process. You can't "defy" it any more
than you can "defy" the wind, or the rain. It doesn't care whether you
are "ignoring" it or not.

Furthermore, there is no god, or gods. We are sentient creatures in a
universe that "just is". There is no creator out there wearing a long
beard to care about our acts. The only creatures that care about our
actions are ourselves. The only morality or ethics that exists is the
one we impose upon ourselves. The universe doesn't care about our
acts.

No great golden tablets exist saying "thou shalt not do X". You are
free to murder, to steal, to love, to grow pretty flowers in your back
yard. Other humans may disapprove of your actions enough to
try to stop you from pursuing them, or approve of them sufficiently to
laud you for them. You may find that setting off dynamite in close
proximity to your body causes you to cease to function as an intact
human organism. However, the disapproval or approval of humans, or the
tendency of the universe to mechanistically kill organisms that
perform certain acts, does not imply an absolute morality of any
sort. It is not "good" or "bad" to set of dynamite near you, or to
grow flowers.

All we can objectively say about an action is that it furthers one's
personal goals or hinders them. In this sense, to a suicidal
psychopathic axe-murderer, it is reasonably in furtherance of one's
goals to go about striking people in the head with axes in the hope
that one day someone will kill you. In this same sense, to a
self-preserving person, locking the suicidal axe murderer in a cage is
an act that reasonably furthers one's personal goal of survival.

Goals are arational -- they are beyond the realm of rationality or
irrationality. It is no more rational to favor survival than not to do
so, any more than it is more "rational" to prefer vanilla ice cream
over chocolate ice cream. Chacun a son gout.

It is true that evolution tends to lead to a preponderance of those
who value survival as a goal, of course. I, for one, favor my personal
survival, and most people I know do, too. Given that most people who
you will meet are in favor of their own personal survival, if one of
your goals is also survival we may prescribe a set of behavioral rules
of thumb, which we will term "ethics" or "morals", that will improve
your chances of meeting your goals in this environment.

Do not, however, mistake this for a claim to an absolute definition of
"right" and "wrong". Such beasts don't exist. One can only say
something is "right" or "wrong" *to* some sentient creature.

Therefore, to answer the question "is it 'right' to play 'god'", we must
ask "what are our goals?"

A number of years ago, I was trying to explain to someone what the
Extropian world/goal was. I finally came up with a reasonably succinct
two word summary. "Personal apotheosis".

Extropians are those who possess personal goals that include life
without bounds or limits to the greatest extent possible. No longer
living in foolish fear of the gods who do not exist, the Extropian
wishes to possess powers previously ascribed to the gods of the
superstitious. We desire unlimited lifespan and the capacity to do
whatever it is that we desire that does not conflict with the laws of
physics. In short, we ask for "freedom, immortality, and the stars",
i.e. "personal apotheosis", to oneself become a "god".

In this context, the question of "tampering with nature" becomes an
obvious benefit, and thus not merely "moral" within the context of
one's personal moral code (the only kind there is!) but actually
laudable. If the tampering furthers our goals, to the extent that we
may manage to do so without being prevented by others, we should do so.

Now, we may answer your original question.

So, to answer your implicit question of "what do I say in this paper",
we must first establish your goals. Is your goal to enjoy free speech,
or is it to get a good grade?

If your goal is to get a good grade, the obvious optimal strategy is
not to challenge the beliefs of the highly prejudiced and entropic
person grading the paper, since you are unlikely to convince a
superstitious fool of the correctness of your world view given that
they live in an entirely alien mind set that, among other things,
believes in "gods". In that case, you are better off trying to be as
non-committal as possible, or perhaps (on the outside) to show that
"tampering with nature" is somehow "permitted" [gag!] by the
superstitious fool's world view.

On the other hand, if you don't care about the grade, and your goal is
to have fun by shocking them, by all means have fun. Mess with their
mind. Shock 'em.

Its all just a question of selecting the strategy that furthers your
goals the best.

I saw something on the front page of the paper (on Wednesday) about the
creation of an artificial chromosome, but couldn't read the story, except
the comments from some excited scientists.

Does anyone have more information about this?

OK.

My friends and I were wondering about the possibilities of combining
cryo freezing and encasement in Jello.

Any ideas, on this?

1) not "freezing", vitrification. Blood washout, gradient perfusion, 
   temperature descent. (Decapitation optional).
2) if encasement, then amber. Preserves _and_ ornaments. (Also consider 
   clear glass Dewars, for the living room. Expensive, but stylish).
3) if Jello, then green Vodka jello. Otoh, consider vinegar.

You may be right; this does sound rather similar to my experience. Few of
my previous colleagues have felt like joining me in dancing all night at a
rave or climbing a mountain to watch the sun rise. There have certainly
been exceptions, but I think it's true in general.

I believe that the first artifical chromosome has already been invented
for yeast.

Human Chromosome Created Artificially
 Science: Technology is called a major advance in study of genes. It may
offer a way to cure inherited diseases.
By ROBERT LEE HOTZ, Times Science Writer




PREV STORY
NEXT STORY

n a major milestone in the study of human heredity,
researchers announced Monday that they have created the
first artificial human chromosome, which experts said represents a
quantum leap in the ability to probe the complex molecules that
make up humankind.
     The new technology offers scientists a powerful new research
tool for investigating fundamental questions about the chemistry
responsible for human heredity, experts said.
     Its inventors at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland
and Athersys Inc. hope the techniques may also offer a way to cure
inherited diseases by altering a cell's genetic structure, bypassing
biochemical stumbling blocks that have so far stymied efforts to
accomplish that task.
     As a medical tool, a custom-tailored chromosome could
potentially be used as a package for introducing a therapeutic gene
into a cell. The new gene could either replace a defective gene or
generate a medicinal protein.
     In research published today in Nature Genetics, the researchers
said they were able to use the human cell itself to perform the
trickiest portion of creating a synthetic chromosome. The scientists
basically gave the cell a molecular construction kit developed after a
decade of experiments and let the cell do the actual work of
assembling it.
     On at least two occasions, the result was a new artificial human
chromosome, the researchers reported.
     A normal cell has 22 pairs of natural chromosomes--threadlike
structures inherited from an individual's parents that contain the
genes that guide the body's growth and development. An additional
pair determine gender. Natural chromosomes are built in pieces,
made up of hundreds or even thousands of genes, bracketed by
special protein structures that enhance the structure's stability and
guide its functions--turning genes on and off, for example. Taken
altogether, the natural chromosomes contain roughly 100,000
separate genes--the molecular blueprint for human development.
     The artificial chromosome appears to co-exist with the natural
ones. It appears to divide and multiply normally, surviving as a kind
of accessory chromosome for at least six months, the researchers
said.
     French Anderson, a molecular biologist at USC who helped
pioneer the concept of human gene therapy, called the new research
"a very important advance." The invention of synthetic human
chromosomes is, he said, "the next big step."
     Melissa A. Rosenfeld, a senior researcher at the National
Genome Research Institute, called it "an important landmark."
     Officials at Athersys said they hope eventually to use artificial
chromosomes as a way to package treatments for diseases affecting
the human immune system, like AIDS, as well as blood disorders
like sickle cell anemia and beta-thalassemia.
     If the technology proves itself clinically, it could be applied to an
even wider range of inherited or infectious diseases, they said.
     Anderson, who is working with the pharmaceutical firm Novartis
on a competing gene therapy technique, cautioned, however, that
the danger of chromosomal abnormalities may be too high to make
artificial chromosomes work as a medical product. In addition, the
manufacturing problems in producing complex chromosomes in
industrial quantities may be too formidable, he said.
     Even so, he said, artificial human chromosomes would be a
powerful tool to help fathom the mysteries of human genetics.
     The discovery comes at a time when researchers engaged in the
federal Human Genome Project are rapidly charting the unexplored
regions of the human genetic structure, determining where each
human gene is located.
     But mapping a gene is only the first step in determining what it
does in the larger universe of the human body, researchers said.
Despite their high-speed gene machines and DNA microprocessor
chips, scientists know more about where genes are located--having
mapped more than 16,000 human genes so far--than they do about
how they function.
     Even with their rudimentary knowledge of individual genes,
researchers have been able to create a bestiary of novel life forms,
from genetically engineered crops to bacteria that produce drugs for
humans. But until now, scientists had no way to assemble human
genes together with all the chemical elements necessary to their
proper function, the way nature does in the large daisy-chains of
protein and DNA that make up a human chromosome.
     "This opens the door to be able to study human genes in their
normal context--as part of a chromosome," said Huntington F.
Willard, chairman of the Case Western Reserve genetics
department and leader of the research team.
     The Case Western Reserve team and Athersys, the team's
privately held business partner, have patented the new technology
and are seeking patents on the artificial chromosomes.
     For more than a decade, gene experts have been able to
assemble the chromosomes that guide the simplest living
organisms--yeast, for example.
     Last year, researchers at Chromos Molecular Systems created
the first mammalian chromosomes, stitching together the gene
packages that shape a mouse. By February, the company had
completed a manufacturing plant capable of churning out 3 million to
5 million of them a day.
     But the chemical essence of a human chromosome had eluded
researchers until now.
     To make a human chromosome, the Case Western Reserve
researchers added to a normal human cell separate portions of
ordinary DNA, protein structures called telomeres, which help
protect the chromosome from damage, and other structures called
centromeres, which help control the way a chromosome divides and
reproduces.
     The cell did the rest.
     "We were letting nature takes its course," Willard said. "For all
intents and purposes, they are 'real' chromosomes . . . to our
delight."
     
* * *
     Hacking the Human Chromosome
     Researchers created the first working artificial human
chromosome by inserting the raw material into a normal human
cell--ordinary DNA, telomeres and centromeres--which then
assembled a working package of genes.

You could have a quick browse through the >H/Extropian booklist on my site,
which would give you some titles suggested by people on these lists.

And, to anybody else out there, I'm still happy to receive new entries via

I got dropped from my <snarl> internet system for a few days, 
hopefully error messages were not appearing on these lists.  I am, 
however, missing mail.

If you have tried to reach me or post to the list on any of the 
following, I have not received the messages:

1.	my terminology suggestion (transcendence)
2.	the upcoming Max Perutz lecture
3.	Extropy web magazine issue

Thx,

<blush>  Actually, I was picking their brains to resolve a 
planet mass/gravity ratio dilemma.  Some very creative responses from 
Mark, John Blanco-Losada, and Doug Houts.

Sunday was an informal lunch with me, Doug, Sasha Chislenko and his 
friend Andrew, with chocolate bunnies provided by moi!  We spent 
several hours discussing a wide range of topics and learning more 
about each other.  A beautiful spring day to be out on the roof and 
viewing the cherry trees, probably too relaxing to get into any deep 
debates, but a very enjoyable visit.

The computer without instruction and the human without emotion produce the
same output, nothing.

	Have you known of any humans without emotions?

 How these emotions come to us, unbidden, is still not fully explained by
cognitive science- 

	Wasn't there a recent study which showed the steps of emotions?   Did it
not show that first there is an incident, cognition of the incident,
physical response to the incident, release of various chemicals based on
the physical response and finally the "feeling" of the corresponding
emotion?  Do not many actors experience this by copying the physical
response for a particular emotion?

Has it been established that we "need" emotions?

	When you boil all the bullshit out of it, is not ego simply the notion of
being an individual?

	Is it possible for an individual to see their life the same way any other
individual sees their own life?

	What prevents you from "reprograming" yourself now?
	Would you consider having a self-activated joy-button connected to your
"feels good" section of the brain?

	Have you ever experienced 100% Bliss?  Can people experience this state at

Yes, that's precisely my point.  "Natural" is an irrational concept
that people use with various arbitrary meanings, such as "whatever
the state of the world would be if humans continued to live as they
did at some earlier time", or "whatever the world would be like if
humans didn't exist at all".

Since these are all counterfactual concepts, there is no rational
meaning to the word used that way.

Subject: Coordinating Sex Roles
Sender: postmaster@extropy.org

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

I just finished reading Farrell's thought-provoking "The Myth of Male
Power".  It made me realize that the genders have an awful lot of
unfinished business.

Once upon a time, people had relatively constant and predictable sex
roles, allowing matching expectations.  More recently, these roles
have been in flux, especially regarding women.  Many of us are
confused because we are not sure where these changes are going, or
where we want them to go.

Now its all well and good to say that each person should choose the
sex role they like best from all imaginable sex roles, but there is a
big coordination issue here.  People are choosing many actions based
on their expectations regarding the distribution of choices other
people will make, now and in the future.  

For example, we choose how to raise and educate our children, and
people choose for themselves what sort of skills to invest in
learning, in part based on expectations about who in the future will
tend to raise future children, who will tend to defend us in war and
on the street, who will work in contexts where teamwork and
competition are at a premium, and who will do the unpleasant boring
jobs.

We also make various choices based on what we expect the opposite sex
to be looking for in partners and relationships, and on who will be
expected to initiate and take risks regarding the growth of such
relationships.  And employers make choices about who to hire based on
who is likely to have invested in what skills, and who is likely to
stick with a job for how long.

For example, employers who want long-term employees may be less
interested in hiring women if women will tend more to leave jobs for
child rearing.  Parents may be well-advised to have their sons suffer
more from hazing, risk-taking and encourage them to do more team
sports if they are more likely to be sent to war or to be employed in
competitve team-oriented jobs.   And boys should learn more to suffer
rejection if they are still going to be expected to initiate
relationships. 

Now if we all knew that we were moving to a future with no substantial
correlation between sex and roles in society, it would be wrong and
unfair to train people for old sex roles.  But this may not be our
future.  Maybe our genetic heritage implies that the sexes differ in
what they *want*, such as perhaps women enjoying child rearing more.
So the big questions are:  what do we want, and what can we expect?

No, I have not.  But I suspect that somebody, somewhere has met a coma

certainly some of them are.

Name the rational basis for your goals.  Better yet don't.  You can't do
it.  You can establish a basic axiom like "I want to be happy," and work
rationally from there but there is no rational reason, unless it derives
from your basic axiom, your personal "meaning of life," to value happiness
over pain, or existence over non-existence.  Of course, I am willing to
engage in a bit of irrationality.  The only other option is death.

Yes. And I would say it often holds us back: we believe we are in a 
certain way, and hence don't do things that contradict this illusory 
identity even when they would be beneficial for us.

Something which might emerge before uploading becomes fully feasible
would be some form of World Wide Neural Net. When we can directly
interface wetware and hardware we should soon after be able to create
implants to connect us to the Web via something like cellular phone
service.  

Is anyone aware of any sci-fi which explores and elaborates on this
idea?

One of the aspects of this which interests me most is its ramifications
for the technomad and specifically for the technomad seeking an
accreditated education. As universities begin to offer accreditated
degrees via the Web, students are no longer limited in where they exist.
The individual can participate from nearly any place in the world. With
direct neural access this is taken a step further. Nearly every
neurological stimulus could then be sent and retrieved, thus enabling a
full spectrum of communication within the collective cybernetic
consciousness.

Bridging ethical boundaries for a moment. This technology might even
enable an instructor to directly access a student's memory to ascertain
just what exactly the student has retained. Of course this is only a
small part of education, and only one of many ways in which direct
neural interfacing could conceivably be used in education.

THE CRIME: 

Mir Aimal Kansi is being sought in connection with the shooting of five

Shit... whacking two guys in front of Spook Central with an AK-47 and he

My big beef with current equalization of sex roles is that while women are
encouraged to take on traditionally male roles of laborer and competitor, men
are not encouraged to take on traditionally female roles of homemaker and
conciliator.  While I'm pretty neutral on who does what, I worry about a
society short of homemakers and conciliators.

I have a pretty laissez-faire attitude towards societally-chosen sex roles.
 Like it or not, questions of what we want and expect in this category are
very complex, and with the 30-40 year lag time it takes a lot of time to
resolve.  This is one of those cases where if the information isn't in yet,
you can't make a good decision.  If sex roles are to change significantly,
for whatever reason, it's going to take a century or so of "settling out" to
adjust to the new situation.

Here is some background on the killings.  
The CIA agent who was killed in this shooting was a field agent who had been
operating in the town from which Mir came.  No connection had been
established, last I had heard, between these two persons.  However, the
assumption was that it was a "hit" that had been carefully planned for some
time.  Mir, by the way, had traveled from the Middle East to the US for no
apparent reason other than this killing.
Also, if memory serves me correctly, Mir had purchased an AR-15 and had
intended to use that instead.  After a couple of days, he attempted to return
the rifle to the gunstore, but was not permitted to get a refund.  Instead,
he exchanged for the AK-47, a firearm with which he was more familiar, at a
loss of several hundred dollars.
If the CIA knows why its man was "hit", no one has reported--at least not in
a declassified text.  That leaves the background of the entire affair to
speculation.

Hyperion by Dan Simmons, takes place in a society in which implants

Here's a little excerpt from HotWired's ClubWired schedule for the week
showing how the internet is already having God-like memetic influence on
politics:


 Wednesday, 9 April
 6 p.m. PDT
 David S. Bennahum, in Wired Talk

On the night of 17 November 1996, hours after Yugoslavian President
Slobodan Milosevic annulled democratic elections in Belgrade, messages
began to appear in a relatively tiny electronic bulletin board service
in Serbia. They called for mass demonstrations. Two days later, people
marched to uphold the elections. Journalist David S. Bennahumn was an
eyewitness to the Net's influence there and reports in "Wired" 5.04:
"For the first time, I saw how the Internet can lower a tipping-point
and accelerate a process of infection. In this case the idea being
spread was that of a viable democracy." But is communication enough
against clubs, guns, and tanks? Join us with David and host Bob Parks
for a discussion on the Serbian "Internet Revolution."

He probably had a family member who got whacked by the CIA agent. He's
from Pakistan, and I imagine that the only two things the Christians In
Action are interested there is local politics and nuclear arms/ missile
proliferation.

Possibilities: 

1) the agent either helped or was percieved to help a local politician
win an election. What is Aimal's political affiliation?

2) the agent suborned or handled a Pak national in obtaining nuclear or
missile intelligence. Aimal was either hired or in some way honor bound
to relatiate.

FBI HARASSMENT, DEATH THREATS, AND ELECTRONIC WARFARE

Yesterday the FBI hit Richard Russell again. Richard is 
the former American Airlines pilot who acquired the FAA 
TWA 800 radar tape that the FBI seized a few weeks ago.
This time they hit him with a subpoena to appear before 
the federal grand jury in charge of intimidating the 
real TWA 800 investigators. They will force him to 
reveal who gave him the radar tape that allowed
the American people to have a glimpse of the 
forbidden truth, before the FBI rehid it.

ELECTRONIC WARFARE

The last time the FBI hit Rich they shutdown both his Net accounts:
http://home.dc.lsoft.com/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind9703&L=flight-800&O=A&P=9098
Today several private messages sent to me are arriving to me not 
from their actual sender, but from Kai Liu <kailiu@wam.umd.edu> 
with a CC: list a mile long.  In short: private emails sent to me 
from friends are being intercepted before they get to me and are 
being sent to the public and me. An act of electronic aggression.

Since my post about the death threats against me from military 
intelligence (http://www.thnet.com/~deckard/dthreat1.htm), I've 
been getting bombed heavily with huge junk mail posts with mile 
long CC: lists, in fact, it seems they are the same CC: lists 
as the my intercepted private emails are bring sent to. 
Gee, what a coincidence. 

I got a dialog box message when I went to download my mail 
that said messages were being removed from my inbox.  Never 
seen anything like that before. I've contacted my server and 
they are investigating this apparent breach of security.
I only hope this message gets out. 

If slander, vicious ad hominem, and death threats don't
work to protect the cover-up of the TWA 800 crash, it 
seems the Information Warfare game will move to a new 
level: Electronic Warfare. I don't know what to expect 
next, a bullet in the head or some kind of electronic 
terrorism, or both. At the same time other members of 
our research team have been threaten with or are now 
being hauled before a federal grand jury that has done 
NOTHING but TERRORIZE private TWA 800 researchers. A 
full-court, Establishment-wide campaign of slander, 
intimidation, and terror. Is this still America??

Here is one of the headers underwhich one of my rerouted 
private email came to me... my comments follow it. I've 
cut away 90% of the CC: list:

This is a fraction of the length of the cc: list. Below the long cc: 
list was a private message sent to me that never arrived to me from 
the sender, but rather from the header above. The first time Richard
Russell was hit by the FBI, they shut him off the Internet, from both
of his two server accounts. This would be the second time electronic
jamming-type activity has coincided directly with FBI aggression
on our small group of private TWA 800 researchers. But surely
it would be "paranoid" to see any connections. 

Vicious slander... death threats... electronic terrorism...

Yes.  Presumably the "price" of such activities will rise, inducing
more "supply".  But which sex will supply first?  My guess is that men
are more likely to realize how much they value these traits in women,
inducing more women to supply these traits, than women are likely to
value these traits in men, inducing men to supply them more.  I wish I
were wrong though.

Yes its complex, but the time to bring expectations and actions into
equilibrium depends on the mechanisms of information transmission.  If
each person just makes a private guess, and then waits a generation to
see the results, it could take a while.  It should help to have more
of a conversation about what we want and expect.  So I am dissapointed
that there seems to be little conversation on these topics.

My observations:
1) They don't look unusually ugly to me.  With a smile, some of them might
even be above average (I don't think Thang Thanh Nguyen is bad, for
example).  What incentive would the FBI have to show a smiling, happy,
attractive photo?

2) Except for the airplane bombing, and maybe the Alvarez multiple-murder
suspect, it looks like a pretty anemic set of crimes to me.  If these are
the most dangerous people in the country, the place must be pretty safe.
What, not the most dangerous, but the most wanted?  (sarcastically) Now
_why_ would there be a difference?

Frankly, I find the nature of the questions as posed disturbingly
collectivist.  How "we" should teach "children" about "roles in
society" is an irrational concept from the start.  What I will
teach my son or daughter is how to best exploit his or her own
natural talents and predispositions, whatever they might be, and
how to deal with others openly, honestly, and fairly to achieve
whatever his ends might be.

Certainly many assumptions will be made in relationships.  Any
contract, such as marriage, rarely spells out every detail of who
performs every action; typically each will settle into assumed roles,
or make choices based on ability or predisposition, as you say.  But
to correct the problems that come from bad assumptons doesn't require
changing to new--and potentially just as bad--assumptions; it
requires learning how to communicate openly and deal fairly in light
of /whatever/ issues come up that weren't covered in the original
contract, and the commitment that /all/ human relationships are
founded on mutual consent, not shared assumptions.

I am certainly not among the PC-brainwashed masses who are afraid
to state the obvious that men and women are different, and I will
even go so far as to say that those who postulate equal abilities
and drives for the sexes have no rational basis to do so in light
of the evidence of evolution.  But that doesn't mean I really want
to know every detail of the differences, nor do I think it is
necessary to know them to deal fairly.  I deal fairly with women
because I deal fairly with people, not because I understand them
or empathize with them or other such psychobabble.

Of course we respect individuals choice in the roles they chose. And the way
they bring up their children. This thread is not about enforcing gender
roles, it is about rationally analyzing them. Choosing values instead of
accepting ( perhaps not so useful?) traditional ones without thinking.

' We' is a word which can be inclusive of one or more persons. How we should
do things is a very rational topic , from businesses - to families, to
societies, to individuals, and it is not 'collectivist'. That would entail
enforcing our ways upon you. Coercion has not been suggested.
 I would see extropians as one rational  "we" (group), and also my wife and
I, or my society and I, and "we' are always discussing how things should be
done. Even Objectivists and Libertarians talk about how "we" do things.
Can we talk about what "we" should do about space exploration? Freedom of
speech? Technological advances?

Changing how we do things, especially as "A SOCIETY", is helpul, for
dysfuntional societies form a large part of the darwinistic pool against (or
with ) which our individual concepts must swim.
To censor a forum about such an important issue, especially one that involves
our future- as children do- is IMHO, more collectivist than allowing free
speech.

Only if you know all the inputs and the precise timings of any
'interrupts'. A single bit or clock cycle difference may produce very
different results. As a simple example I have fond memories of a bug which
made our software work correctly in the afternoon but sometimes produce
invalid results in the morning... Of course you have no proof that humans
are any different; most people I know have 'buttons' you can press (by
doing or saying something) which will make them react in a predictable and
seemingly deterministic fashion.

I'm not sure of the 'official' definition of the word, and few of the
people I've asked seem to have any idea either. To me ego is the
difference between a person's perception of themselves and their real
state. This is why it holds people back; you can't act sensibly if you
don't know who you are. As we were discussing in another recent thread,
many people seem happy to just talk about doing things rather than 
actually do them (which is hard work and involves a risk of failure).

Yes. It just takes effort to eliminate the ego nonsense and see yourself 
as you truly are.

I think the biggest problem with reprogramming is that people first have
to accept that they are programmed entities. Our mythology tells us that
we aren't, and you have to break through that programming before you can
start on anything else. I've tried explaining this to some of my friends
and even the neurophysiological evidence doesn't convince them. They
usually try to change the subject to avoid having to even consider that
they might be 'just' computers.

Everyone has a self-activated joy-button connected to the "feels good" 
section of the brain. Most people just haven't worked out how to activate
it yet except through interactions with other people ('love', etc). Again
it's just a matter of programming.

Close to 100%, maybe and yes. Utter bliss is fun, but it gets dull after a 
while, at least for me.

Net censorship, access cost increase, and Intellectual Property alert!

Every netizen or organization that wants low cost net access, net 
free speech, and uncensored e-mail has a high stake in a court 
case soon to be decided in the litigation war involving Scientology,
the Internet, and a nonprofit electronic library and historic archive 
called FactNet.

An emergency Internet and legal issues briefing has been prepared for 
you and/or your organization at (www.factnet.org).  Factnet’s Board of 
Directors urgently asks your help to  promote both media coverage and 
a vigorous dialogue among netizens on the immediate and substantial 
threat this briefing discloses to the future of the Internet. 

To help understand the importance of this briefing to Internet costs, 
Internet slowdowns, Internet intellectual property and Internet free 
speech please find the following media quotes.

"If the church's (Scientology’s) lawsuits prevail...future providers 
of bulletin boards and newsgroups on the World Wide Web, as well as 
the companies running such subscriber services as Prodigy, Compuserve, 
and America Online might be forced to monitor or restrict information
simply because they fear being sued...If system operators are liable for
the content of the postings, it will lead to censorship...It would change
the whole idea of how the Internet develops -- it's that important." 
--Shari Steele, attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, as
quoted in "The Net: Copyright or 'Free Press'?" Newsday, 10/10/95

"Besides the technological curtailment of free speech, a skirmish like
this one has the potential to completely disrupt the online operation not
only of individual users, but also of entire networks overloaded by
traffic their circuits were never designed to handle."  
--Colman Jones, "Freedom Flames Out on the 'Net: Who Launched the 
largest-ever Sabotage of the Internet?" 
www.now.com/issues/15/44/News/feature.html 

"Other [Internet] users have reported mysterious incidents: investigators
 visiting their neighbors, strangers attempting to get into their telephone
records, e-mail sent to their sysadmins asking that their accounts be
closed down. How did we get to this, in a free country?...

"It turns out that a belief in free speech and an interest in 
Scientology may involve you in the bitterest battle fought across 
the Internet to date. A fight that has burst the banks of the Net 
and into the real world of police,lawyers, and armed search and 
seizure. Ultimately, however, the drama doesn't matter: the real 
issues here are the boundaries of free speech and the future of 
copyright and intellectual property in the face of a
technology that can scatter copies across the world in seconds...
"Whatever the motives, when computers are seized because they
contain allegedly purloined intellectual property, messages are
intercepted as they traverse the network, or the security of anonymous
remailers is pierced by police, the days of the Internet as a cozy,
private, intellectual cocktail party are over. .." 
--Wendy M. Grossman, "alt.scientology.war," Wired, 8/95

Lest anyone doubt Scientology's intentions, an article in the most 
recent issue of an internal Scientology magazine called "High Winds" 
proudly trumpets "groundbreaking lawsuits against both copyright 
infringers and the computer service companies that served as 
electronic conduits" for them. It goes on to predict "landmark 
decisions" in which, "for the first time, Internet access providers 
will be held responsible for any copyright infringements posted 
through their facilities."  

"The Internet is an information age tool that empowers individuals and
reduces the need for a large, authoritarian government. It empowers the
poor with an unregulated world of entrepreneurial opportunity... 
Information and the new frontier could create a more fair, peaceful 
society The free flow of information is central to America's foundation, 
and '90s technology only enhances it. Unfortunately, it's all big threat
to those in power who rely on the control of information to secure 
their lofty positions. No matter what they call it, free speech is the 
issue." --Wayne Langsen, "Raiding Free Speech," Boulder Weekly editorial. 
                8/24/95 

PLEASE help protect our mutual Internet freedoms by appropriately 
forwarding this briefing to your personal or organizational network 
of individuals, newsgroups, listservs, net media, and net watch 
organizations where it hasn’t appeared yet.

Your timely attention to this critical briefing is appreciated,

The Directors of Factnet
Boulder Colorado USA

P.S. Factnet has been reconstructing its electronic files since they 
were sabotaged and returned to us by court order after the Scientology 
raid. Our original mailing lists consisted of individuals and organizations 
who had viewed materials or had an interest in Scientology’s Internet 
abuses and other human rights abuses. Because of the raid we are not 
fully certain that our reconstructed mailing lists contain what they 
originally contained or have been reassembled back into the proper lists. 
These reconstructed mailing lists are far to important to the battle for 
Internet free speech not to begin using again just because they were in 
Scientology's possession.

If you have received this alert and you have not previously reviewed or 
been interested in any information on these issues let us know and we 
will immediately correct the situation. We ask your understanding if 
there has been an error or duplicate mailing. Try to imagine someone 
illegally seizing all of your computers and computer files then searching 
and altering and destroying parts of them. Finally you get it all back 
to you in boxes and pieces. That's what happened to Factnet. Over the 
last 12 months with minimal resources it has had to reconstruct 6 
gigabits of its deliberately disordered returned libraries and files.

Real communities of people who regularly contract with each other have
lots more mechanisms for coordinating expectations regarding
unspecified contract details than just "learning to communicate openly
and deal fairly".  Most such communities spend lots of effort to
socialize new people into the shared community expectations, and often
have lengthy discussions regarding proposed changes in common norms.

It might help you to think in terms of multiple equilibria in a game
in game theory.  In a game it is important to coordinate each player's
expectations regarding what others will do with actual action choices.

This is a good point. I also think that the difficulty is more complicated
than 'erasing old tapes' - although that's a great psychological advantage. 
The real dilemma is we do not fully understand the programming instructions
already there, (although encouraging leaps have been made recently, in neuro
bio. & cog. sci. ) so we do not fully understand how to program new ones.
This is one reason why AI is so facinating.

Regarding ego ( Ego) and bliss... the so called 'spiritual ( which I beleive
is just another part of our brain's inner working) bliss'  of letting go of
the ego ( awareness of the separation between self and reality) is well
known. An interesting topic. It seems to be hardwired into many humans. Some
religions claim that this is letting in "god".
I think it is important in an evolutionary sense, regarding consciousness. 

In the Emotional Computer thread, the type of emotions ( instructions of a
level of say, a lower animal's emotions)  "easily programmed" into computers
were not compex enough to be useful to cognition at any level i could
understand, unless just as a starting point.
 This "Ego" would be a good emotion to program into an A I.

The opportunities for women in society have opened up a lot in the last
few decades.  Today we teach our kids that there are no differences in
what boys and girls can expect as far as career opportunities open to
them.  (Even if this is not completely true, it is what they are taught.)
We try to encourage girls in particular to look past traditional roles
and to seriously pursue professions and work roles that were closed to
them in the past.  I believe it is a better society which allows women
this kind of freedom.

Suppose I knew that society was going to change, and that women were going
to go back to being stuck in the home, called upon to greet their husbands'
return from work with a fresly-cleaned house, a pair of slippers, and a
delicious home-cooked meal.  I wouldn't change what I teach my daughter.
I find those old limitations abhorrent.

Maybe this makes me a bad parent.  I wouldn't be preparing my child for
what society is going to expect of her.  She could face a hard time in a
world where she wants to be an aerospace engineer but everyone else expects
her to be Suzy Homemaker.

My justification would be that, with enough determination, she could
probably get past the kinds of sex role limitations which we have seen
within the last hundred years or so.  So unless the social changes are
extremely drastic and sudden, she can probably still expect considerable
freedom in choosing her life's work.  Furthermore, her efforts to take on
non-traditional roles will play some incremental part to retard whatever
social changes are occuring, changes which I would oppose.

Likewise the idea of encouraging my son to play team sports so that he'll
be all set when he gets drafted into the army or when Party membership is
a prerequisite for success is an equally unpleasant prospect.  I simply
don't think in these terms.  I have an individualist philosophy, and I
am raising my kids to pursue what interests them personally, without much
regard to what society wants.

While discussions of future sex roles may be interesting in their own
right, they wouldn't have much effect on my child-rearing practices.

Couldn't we talk more  about *habits* -  bad habits, good habits,
micro-habits, macro-habits?  It seems to me that re-programming oneself
is simply (!) a matter of changing one's habits, that's the way of
talking and thinking that gives one 'access' to that level of programming.
In my experience, a new habit, good or bad, can be learnt more easily
than an old habit can be got rid of: a figure I have heard is that it
takes on average 3 months to make a proper dent in destroying an old
habit.  *Very* difficult, but not impossible.

I agree.  This is a subject that has fascinated me enormously since I
had 'mystical experiences' as a child.  Several times I remember thinking
"Who am I?" so intensely and concentratedly, that my sense of 'self'
suddenly disappeared, and in its place was ... (what?  I could say
something like 'God' consciousness, because that's what it felt like in
a sense, but really I suppose it was just 'pure' consciousness without a
reflexive component).  You could say that 'I' didn't experience it at
all, or you could say 'I' wasn't even there; yet the experience was
perfectly lucid and normal, nothing *looked* any different, but the *
meaning* of it all had undergone a revolution.

Looking back at that paragraph, I should note that my sense of self
didn't disappear exactly, but was, so to speak, *seen through*.  I still
knew who was who, and what was what in relative terms, but I wasn't*identified
* with anything less than existence, the universe itself.

I've never had it since then (last time about 12 years old, I think),
although I've tried, and through study I know it's exactly what
Buddhists have spoken of as 'emptiness' of self. I think the reason why
it's been so hard to get as an adult is because when you are a child it's
relatively easy to see the transparency of the 'self'- after all, there
hasn't been that much of it! As you get older, the sense of self has more
history, becomes tougher, more encrusted and more complex, and it becomes
extremely difficult to hold it all together in one thought that could be
'seen through'.

I reckon there's a lot of room for a modern, scientific, rational form of
mysticism that gets the experiences without the hypno-hype and extra
cosmological baggage.

Dennett's work makes a great foundation for this, IMHO.  Seeing the
self as a 'virtual captain of the crew' is almost half way there!

(Why bother?  Believe me, there is *nothing* like that experience; even
psychedelics give merely a weedy little echo of the 'cosmicness' of it.
And I think that sentient beings who *lived* from that perspective could
be immensely powerful and joyful creatures.  Easily able to re-program
themselves, to morph, etc. - in fact, Transhuman!)

What is it you want to know?  Hitachi makes beautiful monitors if
you can afford them.  Some people don't like the barely visible mask
seam line in the Trinitron, but it's otherwise a good deal.  All of
those monitors will handle the refresh rates shown.  All the cards
you mention are decent cards, but a year or two out of date.

Also, depending on your application, you may not want such high
resolutions, even at that size.  I run my 20" NEC at 1152x864 with
no problem, but higher than that would be hard to read for me.  Also
note that 1280x1024 is the wrong aspect ratio (has non-square pixels)
which might be a problem for art design.  1600x1200 is correct, as
is 1280x960, which some of those cards will do.

I agree that they do, but that's no indication that it's right.  Such
social norms are probably a valuable shortcut to working out what's
honest and fair, but it is the concepts of honesty and fairness that
exist in reality; social norms are merely a matter of consensus, not
reason.  If these shortcuts are valuable to everyday life, it might
make some sense to find those that more closely accord with reason,
and I have no reason to oppose such discussion, I just don't find it
particularly interesting or as valuable as laying the foundations for
solid reasoning on which to base it.

This is to sneak in the assumption that the rules of the game include
the social norms.  In that case, certainly knowing your opponents
available choices and likely coices and payoffs is necessary to win
the game.  But the "rules" of the game of life are not constrained by
society, only by the nature of reality.  To play a fair game unbound
by the shackles of convention requires learning the rules of reality,
not the rules of society.

My Hitachi has been giving me problems.  I finally figured out that it was
an inappropriate video card, rather than a wiggly monitor. In dealing with
the problem, I'm considering other options, one of which is a different
monitor -- the Trinitron along with the Matrox Millennium (if it upgrades to
8mg).  The other option is to stick with the Hitachi and purchase either the
4mg VRAM card of the #9.

>Hitachi makes beautiful monitors if

My question then would be are you familiar with the 800, 801 and 802 series
of Hitachi 21"?  (I haven't been successful at researching this on the Web.)

Any suggestions for newer cards?

I'm accustomed to using 1280x1024, and haven't had problems with service
bureaus for print outs.  1600x1200 might be too small for me in that I have
a stigmatism and get headaches easily.

I appreciate your suggestions and comments, Lee.  Thanks.

Speeking of these 'buttons', I have a question regarding them.  In the book
'Dianetics', by L. Ron Hubbord (super mystic of the millenium), he talks of
these 'buttons' as being something called 'engrams'.  I'm sure many of you
are familiar with it.  I have always wondered to what extent the 'engram'
theory may be true.  I don't believe in anything mystical, but I still wonder
if there are any valid points in the book.  Perhaps one of you out there has
a theory about 'engrams', and how we could use this knowledge in a
non-mystical way.  Please let me know.

Kathryn (and anyone else with ideas), I am organizing the event with the
help of a team of extropians. If you tell me about the idea I'll pass it on
to the others.

BTW, I'll be making an announcement of EXTRO 3 developments very soon.

Strange, I find it easily available. Modern capitalism in forms such as the
Great Earth vitamin store supply me with DMAE (GE have their own brand). Do
you not have any health foods stores nearby?

Here's something fresh out of my recent revisions...



Carpet King


A naked battle field defies a man what he deserves,
And an open sky of =91heaven=92 betrays a man of whom he serves;
When the war is over, he=92ll know the type of song to sing:
An elegy or an anthem --the wisdom of the Carpet King.

What kind of tree could symbolize he: a beech, oak, larch or birch?
What bell will toll for when he aspires to end man=92s greatest search?
Will fear not be an asset as it has been long before?
Or will life not be the =91same again=92 as he opens the fifth door?

The spinning worlds of yesterday slow as Gideon Queen resides,
And a rouge red rug riles rioting rogues as Carpet King presides;
The earth will stay flat if the gods are assigned to do his own bid,

I haven't read the book, but I have heard that there are some valid 
self-transformation techniques in it. That is the secret of Scientology: 
it actually works when people try it, so they want to learn more and get 
better, all the way to the Thetans and Xenu...

The engram is a term used in psychology to refer to the "memory record" 
of a person. Quite a bit of research has been done attempting to find it 
(Lasley's famous ablation failures are most important), and today it is 
generally believed to be encoded in the network connections of the brain 
in a rather non-localized manner.

What Hubbard refers to are suppressed painful memories possibly from past
lives. I don't buy the past life part, but all people seem to react
strongly to signals that threaten their identity or peace of mind, even if
they don't consciously think they are threatening (why do my blood
pressure rise steeply when I read *stupid* attacks on transhumanism, but
not when I read logical and well reasoned attacks? Maybe it is the
stupidity that affects me more than the attack).

Dunno what the rules are about blowing one's own paraliterary trumpet
(although I've done it before), but I'd like to hear what Extropians make
of the Gestell - which pretty much fits the above bill - in my March '97
science fiction novel from Avon, THE WHITE ABACUS.

(BTW, I don't write `sci-fi', and neither do Swanwick or Simmons.  We write
sf.)

You might like to see my post regarding Linda Nagata's Atriums at
http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.96/0246.html
<Linda Nagata's 1995 novel "The Bohr Maker" describes an artificial
organ called an 'attrium' grown by nanotech 'makers' in human brains to
provide direct immersion in virtual realities, communications on the Net
and remote sensing by linking to similarly augmented people, animals and
mechanical sensors at distant locations.>
and also Anders Sandberg's response at

You guys keep writing the sf and we'll keep reading the sci-fi (-: )

I was recently browsing the online catalog of Tools For Exploration at
http://www.tools4explore.com/default.htm
wading through the New Age fluff trying to find something that might
actually be useful for 'mental discipline' (better, non-mystical term?)
exercises.

Does anyone have any experience with the sound and light machines that
are purportedly useful for brainwave control; or, any recommendations
regarding the Anna Wise "High-Performance Mind" approach; or, tapes like
those from Acoustic Brain Research?

Well, discussion would help, but discussion is generally with highly selected
groups.  You'd want people to know what other people, in the aggregate, are
deciding, and surveys are far better for that.

Another big problem with forecasting or discussion is that people often
change their minds about what they want.  It's difficult for a 20-year-old in
college who's never worked anything more than part-time casual work and who's
never had a significant relationship or children (an awful lot of
20-year-olds these days) to really have any good idea what they will want at
40.  For example, a lot of career women change their minds and want kids when
their biological clocks start going off in their 30's.  For another example,
"Mid-life crisis" is a cliche.

So my point is that we aren't going to have a good idea what people's
long-term life choices are going to be if they don't follow traditional
paths.  Surveying, planning, and discussion are all good things, but even
ideal application of the above (unlikely) will leave us with a lot of
uncertainty.

You're setting a false dichotomy here.  Society is quite "real" and unless
you think you can single-handedly change the rules of society, they are part
of reality.

I just ordered a Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) meter from Tools For
Exploration. By the way. There has been a recent thread on this listserv
about Dianetics and Scientology. The main tool used by Scientologists is
a GSR. It is what they use to measure their engrams. Jung and his
colleagues were the first to use the GSR for this purpose, though
Hubbard didn't give Jung (or anyone else for that matter) credit for the
discovery. Many psychotherapists (non-scientologists and non-jungians)
employ the GSR in their clinical practice today. It is effective in
measuring stress levels via the amount of moisture present in the skin.
The GSR is actually measuring your bodies electrical resistance. Its
really pretty amazing if you ever get the opportunity to use one.

Jung and Hubbard would run through a list of words with a patient and
when the GSR meter reading increased they knew they were on to
something. They would then use word associations and other technigues to
further localize and reveal the source of a person's psychological
problems. Once the source of the problem was fully remembered, the
memory could be "discharged" so as not to have further neurotic
effect/affect on the individual. A clear would be a person without any
of these "negatively charged" repressed memories.

I used to own one, and found it somewhat helpful in attaining theta
states. The discipline was in reaching and sustaining the state without
losing consciousness. You have to keep your mind entertained while
reducing the metabolism of your thoughts. The entrainment devices are
definitely relaxing, but there's really not a lot to them yet. The thing
about them is they do not require much from you. They entrain you.
Personally, I'm more interested in bio-feedback.

Technically it poses little (well, uh... no unsurmountable ones) problems
emplanting an bioinert electrode microgrid, juice either coming from a
semiconductor laser, or a EM induction coil, hooking the output to an
embedded, which in turn tunes into the datasphere via a cellular modem. 
While generating activity vectors at will should pose little problems (stuff
is noisy, though), interpreting input will be darn hard, probably beyond
the capacities of an average adult (albeit not of a small child). Imagine
a headup video, accompanied with Earth magnetic field-, inertial
navigation-/Earth gravitation-, and GPS input tracking, and a 3rd cursor 
you move around by simply willing it to move. Look, I just tweaked your nose

Augmented reality is fun. Can't wait till it hits the market.

In principle one could imagine an agglutinating, ideogram-based wireless
cellular language, which directly invokes concepts/imagery (by poking the
right representation systems, the Cyberlaputan). But even English is
adequate for that. Otoh, i theory, one could activate representational
systems upon reception of a token automagically, bypassing all protective
filters. Say "bliss" and feel it (please don't try "agony". And never,
never, never say "death", for it instantly triggers the cranial implant's
lead azide charge (ack!!!)).

You would still have to learn that language. CoCo, common code ("mo, didya

Darwinian evolution has made us adept of tracking gaze direction, and
interpreting subliminal body language and face mimics. Basic survial

gather it does not exist.

It won't work anyway, relax. Microchanges in local synapse LTP are unique,
and reading them remotely (ignoring the utterly trivial problem of their
interpretation), is physically impossible (at least with that crude type
of implant we are talking about).

Sorry, this is just not true.  Games really can have multiple
equilibria, even with no explicit modeling of "social norms".  
Consider the standard 2x2 "battle of the sexes" game.

Flashback? Darwin, and wireheads? Your singularity portal broke down with

Simmon's other career (as a horror writer) seems to intrude. Otoh
"Hyperion" (less so "The Fall of Hyperion", and how is the third book?) is

Yes you want wide participation in the discussion, but surveys are not
necessily better.  Consider the wide use of "focus groups" in marketing.

Most people care more than you about what other people will respect in
them and desire from them, but perhaps your children will be like you
here.  Even so, you surely want your children to have realistic
expectations about what sort of things are possible for them.  You
don't want them to think they can fly by jumping off the roof and
flapping their arms.  And if, for example, they announce their
interest in being a movie star, princess, professional basketball
player, or astronaut, you probably want to make it clear these are
long shots.

Similarly, you might want to give similar info to a son who would like
to be a fulltime house-husband, or who is hoping he'll never have to
deal with violence from bullies at school, or who is hoping to deal
with his shyness by waiting for girls to ask him out socially.  While
these may be realistic prospects for most girls, they are simply not
for most boys.

I understand the math perfectly; I am questioning your particular
application of it to the real world.  You claim, correctly, that
different sets of rules will lead to different equilibira--I agree.
But you seem to imply that we should then teach our children the
set of rules that leads to solutions we think beneficial.  I claim
that we should teach them the /method/ and let them find the rules
themselves, because they will know more than we possibly can about
their world, and they will be its masters, not us.

Of course, I hope to still be around in their world, in some form
or another.

If you can sense the data traffic you can pick up patterns, a bit like 
listening to the hard drive of a workstation. That could give you an 
impression of what others are thinking/doing ("She is deep into the Net, 
with all that traffic. I wonder if her reality is even here... but he is 
just bursting a bit, only his agents are online.")

It might feel that, since our ability to interpret the state of other
people is largely subconscious - just think of those pheromones. We have
elaborate limbic systems to deal with this; hur the temporal lobe and you
might loose the ability to recognize faces or (if the amygdala is hurt)
send/receive the wrong dominance-submission signals. And emotional content
of speech seems to be interpeted in the non-dominant temporal lobe. Some
people are bad at communicating socially, and they are seen as
unsympathic, rude, aloof or unempathic despite having normal brains
otherwise. 

It would be interesting to develop limbic enhancements; we tend to think 
far too much about improving our cognition without thinking of the need 
to improve our social abilities. Enhanced Empathy, anyone?

IRS raids a cypherpunk
by Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)


Jim Bell's first mistake was publishing an
essay describing how disgruntled citizens could
kill off Federal government agents by using
anonymous betting pools and digital cash. His
second mistake was informing the IRS that the
agency had no legal authority to tax him.

About twenty armed IRS agents and other
Federal police swarmed into Bell's home in
Washington state on Tuesday morning, hunting for
evidence that Bell's "Assassination Politics"
essay had come to fruition. They expropriated
Bell's three computer systems, two guns and even
a solitary mouse cable. The Feds were taking no
chances: Since Bell's voluminous Net postings
mentioned tax collectors, agents from the BATF,
FBI, DEA, and local police forces joined the
raid.

[...]

The raid stemmed from a six-month tussle
between Bell and the IRS, which began in November
1996 when the 38-year old computer engineer
demanded a hefty tax refund and threatened to
convene his own "common-law court" if it was
refused. That grabbed the Feds' attention. (So
did the actions of the "Multnomah County Common
Law Court," which apparently met in January to
convict IRS agents and Attorney General Janet
Reno of "theft by deception.") In February, IRS
agents seized Bell's 1986 Honda as payment for
back taxes -- and found inside it a printout of
his "Assassination Politics" essay. "

[...]

And it was, ultimately, a Federal magistrate
who signed the search warrant on 9:02 am on March
28 at the request of the IRS. Jeffrey Gordon, an
inspector in the IRS' Internal Security Division,
details in an 10-page affidavit how he traced
Bell's use of allegedly fraudulent Social
Security Numbers, how he learned that Bell had
been arrested in 1989 for "manufacturing a
controlled substance," how he found out that Bell
possessed the home addresses of a handful of IRS
agents. Gordon's conclusion: Bell planned "to
overthrow the government." The IRS investigator
says in his affidavit that Bell's "essay details
an illegal scheme by Bell which involves plans to
assassinate IRS and other government officals...
I believe that Bell has begun taking steps to
carry out his Assassination Politics plan."

The original question posed was along the lines of "What social norms
should we teach our children to prepare them for the coming transhuman
world?", and my answer is "None; teach them how to create their own
norms by giving them the principles from which they derive, and letting
them reason for themselves."

I recognize that these norms and assumptions are real--all too real,
having just written a check to the IRS.  But that doesn't mean I'm
going to teach my son "pay your taxes", I'm going to teach him "I pay
taxes because the government has a gun to my head, but they are evil,
and I hope you will be able to abolish them in the future and deal
with other people by voluntary exchange instead."  The reason I teach
him this is that I believe it represents reality, even though it may
not be what most people believe.  He will learn the principle, and
then work toward creating norms that reflect it, and maybe work
around the existing ones as I do in the meantime.

I'm sure there were parents during the time when such social norms
as slavery and enforced gender roles were common who taught their
children that slavery was wrong, and that women had rights.  I admire
them, but I admire even more those who explained /why/ they were wrong,
and gave their children the tools to not only abandon the morally
repulsive norms of their parents, but their own as well.

I will teach my child that yes, you /can/ single-handedly change the
rules of society, because you have that most marvelous of all tools,
the human mind.  Every advance in society was first imagined by some
individual, communicated to others, validated, championed, and put in
place by the work of individuals.  Your mind has the same abilities
as Francis Bacon's or Thomas Paine's, and you have more information
and experience to draw from, so your decisions can be better than
theirs--and better than mine.  I won't just teach you my ideas, I
will teach you how to find even better ones.

Both of these seem like reasonable statements, but neither of them are
what I claimed!

Again: A single game can have multiple equilibria, even if the "rules"
of the game are held constant.  The action you want to take given your
options and preferences typically depends on what actions you think
other people will take.  There can be more than one set of
self-consistent and mutually-reinforcing expectations.  So I advocate
that we discuss our expectations and desires regarding sex role
actions, so that we can reach *some* equilibria between them.

I wrote a trivial program that blinks the screen on and off at frequencies
from 3 to 20 hz.  Staring at the screen for a few minutes at 20 hz or more
made me tense.  Eight or 10 hz produced a dreamy sort-of-stoned feeling.

All that this accomplished was to show that blinking light could influence
my brain; but I never was able to find any real constructive use for it.

Thanks, Mark.  But, they are expensive!

Radio Shack carries one ( Micronta, part # 63-664 ).  Cost me 13.95
a couple of years ago.

I'm trying to build a brain wave monitor (eeg) on my PC.  I've got
most of the circuitry and the software worked out, but I could use
advice on electrodes. 
Most medical supply houses simply cannot cope with a designer who
doesn't know all the jargon and part numbers - they seem incapable
of telling me what their products /do/.  Any advice?  Does anyone
on this list work in a hospital?

And when I get one built, does anyone on this list want one?  I will
happily sell them at cost - I'm not trying to make a profit - of about
$75 to $125.  ( Current machines like this sell for $1000+ )  System
requrements would probably be a 486-100 or pentium.

Also, is anyone on this list real good at digital electronics in 
case I do have complicated questions?

OK, let me see if I can understand your point in my terms.  (1) A simple
game can have multiple equilibria, at equal or different payoff levels.
Agreed, from basic game theory. (2) We would prefer to find such a local
maximum which is also one of the global maxima.  (3) There are legitimate
reasons to suspect that the /actual/ behaviors and expectations of others,
as distinguished from game theory's usual assumption of perfection, may
have a great effect on one's ability to reach the desired equilibrium, and
it is therefore advisable to learn about them.  (4) Especially where there
are multiple global maxima, your perfectly rational choice to pursue a
particular one may be a sub-optimal strategy if you have good reason to
believe the majority of your opponents pursue a different one. (5) A
society stuck at one of the sub-optimal local maxima may be highly
resistant to the changes necessary to bring it to a better state, so it
is a good idea to learn to recognize that situation.

Is that better?  Even given that my children will be better able to
reason their way to good solutions than I can, it might be worth the
effort to study what we expect the actual behaviors of the society
they grow up in might look like.  I don't think I could argue with that,
but I still don't personally find it as interesting or fruitful as
philosophy itself, so I don't understand your surprize at getting less
response than you expected.  Each of us has different interests and
different evaluations of worthy goals.

I was complaining about our society in general, not about this forum
in particular.  And to our general society, "philosophy itself" seems
much less interesting and fruitful than lowering the apparently
subsantial costs due to misunderstandings and uncertainties regarding
desired and expected sex roles.

I don't believe in anything mystical,

	Do mystics "believe" in anything mystical?

Perhaps one of you out there has a theory about 'engrams', and how we could
use this knowledge in a non-mystical way.  

	"knowledge".....Of what?....Didn't Hubble simply over-use a word meaning a

ego: 		1. the "I" or self of any person; a person as thinking, feeling, and
willing, and distinguishing itself from the selves of others and from
objects of its thought.
		2. (often cap.) Philos. a. the enduring and conscious element that knows
experience.  b. Scholasticism...the  complete man comprising both body and
soul.
		3. Psychoanal.  the part of the psychic apparatus that experiences and
reacts to the outside world and thus mediates between the primitive drives
of the id and the demands of the social and physical environment.
		4. egoitsm, or self-importance.
		5. self-esteem or self-image; feelings.
This was taken out of a direction-ary....you know, the book which gives
directions on the use of words?

I tend to agree that playing by the "rules" of society is a major part of
evolving capably - and also that creating a dichotomy - or setting yourself
apart in 
obstinance- is nonproductive.
However - I think his point is quite valid. Although we do not swim alone in
the tides of life, most of current "societies" today believe all kinds of
baloney, so one must have the GOAL of rational and reality based values
rather than the goal of socially correct ones.
Where the twain meets is another story.

Philosophy may well seem [to you, and perhaps to many] less fruitful to
society.  Good thing I don't give a damn about society then.  I care
only about how I might act and deal with other individuals to achieve
my individual ends, and how I can eliminate things like "society" that 
might get in my way.

But let's for the moment assume that knowledge of what the expected
gender roles in society will be is worth my effort to speculate on
and criticize.  Let us then identify what factors might lead to change.

- The initial cause of gender role divergence, i.e., the tremendous
  differential in investment of calories, risk, and time in the
  production of children between genders, is lessening.  Calories are
  cheaper, risks are lower, time is more productive, and children
  themselves are produced less.  So it is likely that assumptions of
  egalitarianism will be more useful as time goes on, though they
  will never achieve parity until men actually carry children or
  women no longer do.  Public institutions should reflect more equal
  treatment under law except where absolutely tied to the basics of
  reproduction, and society will likely favor such law changes.  All
  "roles" not related directly to investment in children should be
  eliminated in favor of assumed equality.

- Since reproduction-based institutions like marriage will have an
  increasingly smaller role in society, we might expect laws that
  temper or eliminate them will become more politically advisable.
  Gay marriage, adoption, polyamoury, and other alternative family
  arrangements will probably become more accepted, and laws giving
  special privilege to them less accepted.

- Since the investment of genetic parenthood is decreasing, laws
  that favor genetic parents rights over acting parents should be
  reduced or eliminated.  Contract law in reproduction in general
  should be more strongly enforce and less regulated.  These laws
  will be more difficult to change for psycological reasons.

- Since cultural evolution is much faster than genetic evolution, it
  is likely that our psychological predispositions will not change
  to match the more egalitarian culture.  It might be good, then, to
  realize those predispositions now and accept them so their future
  divergence from egalitarian ethics won't catch us by surprize.  In
  particular, it is probably a good idea to continue gender-specific
  fashions and marketing without apology, and to eliminate private
  anti-discrimination laws that prohibit free association based on
  gender (in private schools and businesses, for example).  It is
  likely that such moves may encounter resistance from dogmatic
  egalitarianists, so some such changes might be difficult.  I don't
  have a solution to this problem in mind.

Those are my initial guesses.  I'm sure others will have more.

I'll copy here to the list what I sent privately, in case others felt the
same baffled exasperation:

Calm down.  The distinction is not as foppish or gratuitous as you seem to
think.  Here's a rather over-excited statement of why, nabbed without
permission (but I hope he won't mind) from Harlan Ellison's Web fan page.
Harlan was asked to write a piece for *Newsweek* on the Heaven's Gate
suicides. `for the week ending April 5th, 1997.  The piece was requested by
Newsweek to examine the link between the Heaven's Gate cult's mass suicide
and science fiction'.  It eventually appeared in massively revised form.
The original version had this to say, inter alia:

`Try this for an answer: *nothing*.

`They had *everything* to do with that hideous verbal 
crotchet "sci-fi," however.  And they are light-years apart, so 
don't confuse them.  At peril of your life.'

Harlan added further on:

`The concepts that abound in fantastical literature have the
magical capacity to inspire dreams that become enriching reality.
Science fiction, like The Whole Earth Catalog, is only
an implement, a tool of the mind's imagination.  It employs the
technique called extrapolation, allowing us to play the game of
*what-if?*.  A game of intellect and daring, of special
dreaming and determination not to buy into all those boneheaded
beliefs that always tell use we're too stupid and too inadequate
to prevail.  That we need some kind of mythical alien or
supernatural babysitter to get us over the rough spots.  Science
fiction says otherwise... 

`"Sci-fi," that hunchbacked, gimlet-eyed, slobbering village
idiot of a bastardized genre, says only that logic is beyond us,
understanding must be crushed underfoot, that the woods are full
of monsters and aliens and conspiracies and dread and childish fear
of the dark...

`And *that* is the dichotomy of science fiction, as opposed 
to the tabloid mentality of UFO abductions, triangular-headed ETs,
reinterpreted biblical apocrypha, and just plain bone stick stone
gullibility.  It is obscurantism and illiteracy, raised to the level
of dogma.  It requires that you be as ignorant today as you were
yesterday, that you be no brighter than the sap who keeps playing
three-card monte on a street corner with a hustler who will
*never* cut you a break.

`"Sci-fi" is what the Rancho Santa Fe sleepers bought, in that
flashy but adolescent shell-game called *Waitin' for the UFO*.

Given that this is the accepted and long-standing usage among practitioners
of sf, can you see why we resent having the alternative thrust upon us?  If
you doubt the significance of such verbal dichotomies, try the
time-honoured method of approaching a large [----] and calling him a
[`-----'].  (Enter target and epithet of choice)

I should add, perhaps, that the unnamed list member who exploded in
exasperation at my nit-picking between sf and sci-fi was *not* Gregory
Houston, who had introduced the unspeakable `sc-' word into an earlier
discussion.

As much as I might have shown some pride in calling myself a hacker in
1980 when the term was coined to mean an honorable explorer of the limits
of computer capability, the fact is that to the real world hacker=criminal,
and as much as I lament the word's original meaning having been lost,
there ain't a snowball's chance in hell it's coming back.  In the real
world, sci-fi means science fiction--nothing more, nothing less--and
always will.   If there's a distinction to be made, we need to give up on
this one, get over it, and move on.

Unless of course, like those who still use "hacker" in the old sense,
one is doing so precisely to avoid open communication but as an ego-
stroking device for an exclusive community.

In the short time since browsing through the extropian threads I have
been pleasantly surprised to see the evolution of the human condition is
likely to be freed of the
regulators short sighted heavy hand by at least a few of us. 

About 25 years ago I added DMAE to my life-extension program.  At the
time much less
was known and it appeared to be just another powder puff item.  I
checked into Max 
More's reference to centrophenoxine with the Entrez browser at NLM/NIH
and my good
old faithful Merck manual.  I was astonished at the similarity between
the combination
of DMAE plus the common herbicide 2,4-D and centrophenoxine.  The only
difference is the
2, chloro of the 2,4-D.  Would people exposed to minimal amounts of
2,4-d while also
consuming DMAE have similar effects to those of centrophenoxine?

Well, I'm also trying to build an eeg system (the Brainmaster), and I'm 
currently taking a course in medical technology dealing with biosignals. 
I'm hardly an expert, but I'm at least studying the area (although from a 
rather theoretical standpoint; I get nervous when people start talking 
about impendances).

Thank you Damien. I just ordered your book through Amazazon.com, who by
the way safely classify THE WHITE ABACUS as "Science fiction".

Just as much that the term "Gun owner" is equated with criminal,
terrorist, murderer, fascist, etc. It shouldn't surprise you that the
liberal media/government successfully tars both groups with the same
brush since they both tend to be made up of white males. In todays
reactionary politics, the socialist/mercantilists play upon the fears of
the "oppressed" majority, using stereotypical prejudiced opinions of
people who tend to take responsibility for themselves by those who care
not to do so, and are thus oppressed by the socialist/mercantilists,
using the lone white male as a scapegoat, much like Hitler scapegoated
jews.

I have been an active science fiction fan since the 1960s, and in that
community -- at least in the San Francisco Bay area -- the most common
term is still "SF" (meaning "science fiction"), sometimes with an additional
"F" -- "SF&F" (meaning "science fiction and fantasy").  When one hears 
"sci-fi" it is usually when either (1) the speaker is a clueless newbie,
or (2) the speaker is expressing contempt for a specific work.

But I agree with Kathryn, just as long as people read it, shucks, they
can even call it literature...

Kathryn I think you have a point. I think content is much more important than
genre labeling. I read things that *interest* me ( BTW Heaven's Gate does
not).
I read the other post with massive confusion. SF was a city in northern
California for me until now.... and Harlan Elison, I thought, was  TV
writer.... hmmm.... I don't read much sf, or scifi, which ever one is the PC
name - not since highschool anyway, and come to think of it, it seemed like
lots of fun! Now I read mostly technical nonfiction - and always thought sci

Oops! sorry to give you the wrong impression.The exact opposite of what I
meant, mysticism.
I was talking about a form of thinking that explans "spiritualism" in human's
mind. A sustained low focus type, often mistaken for mysticism, exploited by
religions of the world, but nothing mysterious, just under-researched. 
I suggested it was a part of our natural cognitive state.

Drug experiences may have some effect on this process by shutting down high
focus thought ( sometimes permanently ; - ), but your so called 'mystics'
have found meditation does it also. Also exercise seems to help and mindless
simple things like shaving... driving....
This process helps with creativity also.

I've been playing acoustic guitar for about a year and a half, and recently
made the big jump to an electric.  As I joyfully working my fingers to the
bone on this curvaceous wonder, it occurs to me that the electric guitar
provides a nice metaphor for budding transhumans.  Its acoustic predecessors,
though finely crafted, sorely lacked the power and flexibility of the
electric.  By layering recent technologies on a well-established foundation,
the electric guitar upgraded musical expression to a far higher and broader
level.  The whammy bar alone adds a whole new vocabulary of nuance!  Throw in
variations on pickups, amps, and MIDI processing . . . and--mother of
Hayek!--it makes my head spin!

I don't recomend that level of involvement for everyone :-) but cryonics

This reminds me that I've been wondering about the importance of
self-transformation to reach goals vs. transformation of one's
environment.  I answered some poll on this or the transhuman list once
by saying "transhumanism means being like Della Lu"[1], and Guru George
and I spent some messages discussing the Culture's feasibility with an 
agreement that it was a desirable transhuman society in of itself.

But while both Della Lu-type high-techs and Culture hominids have access
to and use various self-transformations -- mind-computer links, genetic
engineering -- the intensity of use is fairly light.  High-intensity
examples might be Freeman Dyson's comet colonizing ideas, somewhat
realized in Brin/Benford's _Heart of the Comet_ or the symbionts in
Varley's books.  People have modified themselves or been modified to fit
into the cold, vacuumy environment.  Ditto for ideas about modifying
humans to live on Mars.  The more typical alternatives, of course, are
terraforming Mars and turning comets into O'Neill cans.

So do people see transhumanism/extropy as about self-transformation per
se or about being adaptive?  Means or goals, perhaps?  The examples
above seem more like shifting weaknesses to me -- transhumanism going
sideways, perhaps, rather than upward.  Plain techno-humanism is more
upward in a way, as it remakes the universe ("paves") into forms we can
fit into.  A bit shorter on diversity, though.

The final "answer" of course, is the subjectivist usual: whatever you
feel like.  But personally I agree with Anders' endgoal.  If I'm going
to muck around with myself, I'd rather add capability rather than change
it.  Not too become a Martian, but either to pave Mars or to become some
super-flexible form that can live anywhere.  (Deep Space 9 changelings
are pretty neat, not counting their violations of the First Law of
Thermo.  They play god, too.)  Or some safe and slightly limited form
that can get experiences from anywhere -- a la Culture Minds, which live
in starships, but could send avatars anywhere they want and reabsorb the
experiences.

So if Tom saw electric guitars as being a species-change from acoustics,
eww.  But if they can perfectly emulate acoustics as well as lots of
other things, cool.

Real extropians play really good synthesizers. :)

I checked out the attributes of centrophenoxine at

from a simple keyword search and spread out to "similar articles" .

I am going to check if it is a commercial product in north america or

In case you're unable to do a Web search here are some summaries:

>From http://www.naturallife.com/DMAE.html

<DMAE  The memory stimulant ... Choline is the usual precursor of 
acetylcholine, but it does not cross the blood-brain barrier very 
well. The body makes acetylcholine from choline as it is needed. DMAE 
is basically a choline molecule with one methyl group missing from the 
nitrogen. DMAE is more able to cross the blood-brain barrier than 
choline. Once inside the brain, an enzyme performs a methylation that 
converts DMAE into choline. So, taking DMAE increases the brain's 
potential to make neurotransmitters.  Dean and Morgenthaler's book 
reports the following effects for DMAE: mood elevation, improvement of 
memory and learning, intelligence increases, and increases in the life 
span of laboratory animals.>

>From http://www.damicon.fi/sd/centrophenoxine.html

<Lipofuscin is the material centrophenoxine is said to remove or scour 
from the glial cells or neurons. It is the waste or residue of 
digestion by lysosomes of effete organelles and bacteria.... The data 
demonstrate that centrophenoxine-induced inhibition of lipofuscin 
accumulation has a positive influence on the cell metabolism and the 
mitotic division capacity and causes a delay of the cellular aging of 
the human glia cells in vitro. (Rodemann and Bayreuther, 1979) 
Concomitant with the reduction of the accumulated lipofuscin, 
centrophenoxine- treated glia cells show enhanced rates of RNA 
synthesis, protein synthesis and glucose uptake. Most likely the 
utilization of glucose is shifted from glycolysis to the pentose 
phosphate pathway. Data suggest reduction of lipofuscin by 
centrophenoxine has a positive effect on cell metabolic functions and 
causes a delay of the cellular aging of the human glia cells in vitro. 
(1983)>

As for what Morris Johnson was referring to (BTW, I didn't see any 
reference by Max More to centrophenoxine) when saying
<I was astonished at the similarity between the combination of DMAE 
plus the common herbicide 2,4-D and centrophenoxine.  The only 
difference is the 2, chloro of the 2,4-D.  Would people exposed to 
minimal amounts of 2,4-d while also consuming DMAE have similar 
effects to those of centrophenoxine?>
I haven't a clue - interaction of neurochemicals in the brain is an 
EXTREMELY complex subject.

interesting to develop limbic enhancements; we tend to think  far too 
much about improving our cognition without thinking of the need  to 
improve our social abilities. Enhanced Empathy, anyone?>

Perhaps Sylvia was tip-toeing around the subject of 'auras'.  The TFE 
catalog I mentioned yesterday sells 'aura goggles'
http://tools4explore.com/TFE85.HTM#LO450
and a whole bunch of stuff under the category of 'subtle energy 
products'
http://tools4explore.com/TFE86.HTM

I suspect the skeptics have serious arguments regarding this 'subtle 
energy' stuff, and I think Anders is probably on the right track in 
pointing out that we have a lot of subconscious routines that assemble 
all sorts of subtle signals from various senses to produce what we 
call our intuitions.

So, when Eugene says "NOTHING BUT body chemistry, and interpreting 
subtle body language" (my emphasis), I would say, this is probably the 
MOST complex system there is, and harder to study than our 
'higher-level' cognitive functions.

Aside from the psychological processing involved, there could be a 
whole lot more to the basic processes of 'chemical communication' than 
we realize.  Linda Nagata builds most of her recent novel, _Deception 
Well_, around this subject.  Here are a few tantalizing snips from 
that story:

<The Communion made here was flawed and corrupt. It had no center, no 
focus, and so it could not grow by conquest but only by slow 
accretion,, a confused, disjointed intellect operating forever out of 
sync ... A  biochemical dialogue in the Chenzeme way. The suspended 
data patterns seek consensus ... Death masquerading as salvation ... 
The Cult Virus. A gift from the void, a parasite that had lain in 
wait, patiently seeking a new host ... manufactured nirvana, 
short-term plan ... a feedback reaction, notably devoid of choice ... 
Information streamed in chemical currents through the dust, flashing 
occasionally into the electromagnetic spectrum astride erratic signals 
barely distinguishable from the static. Halfway down the sheltered 
Well, human lives burned in the warm infrared, oblivious of the 
whispered exchange. Dust sifted past them, falling into the 
atmosphere, into oceans, taken into the colloidal flow, perhaps rising 
again with storms, escaping the atmosphere aboard some unknown ferry. 
Information was traded and adjustments were made in feedback reactions 
working on alien protocols encoded in the dust, long ago, while the 
Communion waited: alert, patient. The dust was alive. Lot wondered why 
he hadn't understood that before ... Dreaming dust. A system replete 
with information, but operating without foresight, without 
consciousness, Selective processes rewarding survival ... tiny judges, 
forever untouched by mercy or forgiveness ... Maybe success could 
never be measured except in the transcendent power of a moment, the 
grace of an hour, or a day, short spans of hallowed time, like brief 
poems, sparkling gems set in the flowing matter of space-time. There 
is no finish line. Only a collection of small victories, and the 
choice to go on. Choice was a privilege not shared by the Well or the 
Chenzeme marauders.>

I skimmed thru it recently and my initial impression was that Hubbard

No. Never done any real research. But I've noticed such experiences with

I don't know; I've never met one but I can imagine that they exist

Yes, so two of the definitions here basically match mine. The point I was
trying to make was not that the dictionary gave some particular definition
but that often in the past I'd spoken to people who would talk and talk
about 'ego', but when I asked them what they meant by the word they umm-ed
and ahh-ed and failed to define it. They talk about this thing, they claim
to have one, but don't actually know what it is.

Uh yes, I know what a dictionary is.

The fact that we all like to regard ourselves as somehow better than we
really are. Even the most deranged killers think that they have a good
reason for what they do.

Because their internal model of themselves would match their actions. If,
say, I was to go around telling everyone that I was going to be a famous
writer yet I never wrote anything, then I would clearly have an ego
problem and would never attain my goal until I solved it.

Uh, can you start that question again? 

> 	How were they programmed?

Input data => neural net => output data. Reinforcement of input leads to
reinforcement of pathways leads to reinforcement of output. Go and read
about Skinner Boxes sometime. Or take a martial arts or dance class; both
program your body and brain by repeating the movements until they stick,
and both are useful and fun.

Maybe, maybe not. Perhaps deliberately, or perhaps not. 

> 	Do you think you are 'just' a computer?

There's no neurophysiological evidence to think otherwise, unless the
quantum mechanical effects in the brain are truly significant. You cannot
conclusively prove that we don't have 'souls', but there seems little
point when the vast majority of human behaviour can be explained without
them. 

> 	Is this just another way of simplifying humans?

I don't really understand the question, but if anything I'd say it's
another way of complexifying humans. Claiming that we're 'souls' in
physical bodies is a much greater simplification. If we accept that we are
computers then exploring the precise details of our operation will be
extremely complex. Frankly I find the idea of humans as computers far more
bizzare and puzzling than the idea of humans as immortal souls incarnated
in flesh.

Yes.

Nope. It's not something you can tell to anyone; they have to go out and
find it for themselves, though you could point them in the right direction
as the Buddhists try to do. You'll just have to trust that the switch
exists and go hunting for yours by yourself. Anyone who claims that they
can tell you how to do it is trying to sell a religion.

I prefer interactions with other people, I just know that it's a natural
brain-state which I turn on by my own actions so I don't make such a fuss
about it as they do. I don't meet someone and think that I could never be
happy without them because I know that I can switch on that circuitry
pretty much at will.

Uh-huh.

Roughly.

Because 100% bliss would require that I shut down all processing in my
brain except for the bliss-circuits. I've never been there, but I've been
close.

Yes, but I much prefer 100%.

Been there, done that. I sort of agree if you use 'letting in god' in the
sense of Crowley's 'true will'. A lot of mystics have talked about moving
out of the way and letting 'god' work thru them. This seems to be what
they're talking about; the idea that 'god' created us with our 'true
wills/true natures' and that the way to follow the 'will of god' is to
find your 'true will' and follow that. 

> 	How is it important in an evolutionary sense, regarding consciousness?

Because erecting a barrier between yourself and reality and calling it
'ego' is a sure way to get into lots and lots of trouble. Of course,
eliminating it and sitting in cave going 'Aum' and blissing out is just as
bad.

I believe the distinction between science fiction and science fantasy 
may have begun with George Lucas.  Early on, he wanted to distinguish 
the Star Wars stories from the genre of science fiction, because they 
were not highly technical and they contained elements from his 
favorite genre, fantasy.  I don't know what the abbreviations have to do 
with it, tho.  People are always coming up with little points to 
argue over.

Seems about right to me, but this depends mostly on motivation. Many
people set out to change habits but don't have the motivation to do so
properly or are so stuck in their social role that the people they
interact with won't let them. It's just a matter of repeating the new
behaviour until the new pathways through the brain's neural network take
over and the old ones rot away through disuse.

Crowley's Thelema is the closest that I know of, though the Chaos
Magickians might qualify. Of course Crowley never did get the hang of
ego-loss himself, much to his chagrin. 

> 	Do you know of any mystical scientists, living or dead?

Didn't Crowley study Chemistry at Cambridge? I think someone already
mentioned Newton, and various 20th century scientists have had some kind
of mystic beliefs. Do Leary and Lilly count?

Uh no. Ellison has written at least as much paper fiction as TV, and won
numerous awards. Possibly his most famous story was 'A boy and his dog',
which later became a tolerable movie. I think he also wrote the story
which inspired the 'Car Wars' board-game.

  I suspect it is more of an historical coincidence that for a long
time, most fantasy was either set in low-tech worlds, or in settings
in which technology played little overt part in development of the
story, while most science fiction had no fantasy element.  One major
detail seems to be that many of the major early shapers of the field
were science and technology enthusiasts (Verne, Wells, Gernsback).
Once that restriction is lifted, many alternatives become possible:
Lucas-style science fantasy is one of them, but there are a number of
stories which more nearly resemble traditional magical fantasy which
have substantial hard-science underpinnings.  I remember a
conversation with Katherine Kurtz, for example, in which she described
what the genes were that controlled the ability to acquire magical
power in her "Deryni" series, and how they were inherited, and how
that affected the plot development of her first several books.

I fancy that the popularity of _The_Rules_ stems from the uncertainties many
women feel about their sex roles.  I believe that this best-selling book's
chief purpose is telling women how to find husbands.  I skimmed a little of it
months ago; my impression was that the book prescribes dating in which the
woman's company is a prize the man wins by proving his worth to her in
specified ways.  Its "one size fits all" method and insistence on
old-fashioned sex roles makes it easy for self-consciously up-to-date folks to
dismiss the book, but its sales suggest that it fills a need.

The writers might make their title a brand name:  THE RULES (TM).  I imagine a
series of _Rules_ for different market segments--e.g., black yuppies,
lower-middle-class fundamentalists, etc.--whose needs would be better served
by more specialized mate search algorithms.  Male and female versions might be
made for each heterosexual market segment.  People could tell each other which
version of _The_Rules_ they'd chosen to follow so that potential dates would
know what to expect.  (Such allegiances are a very weak version of the phyles
in Neal Stephenson's _The_Diamond_Age_.)

In the modern American social flux, many people don't "know their places" and
have inherited inadequate mores.  Inventing customs from scratch exposes one
to the perils of innovation.  _The_Rules_ and, in other areas of life,
etiquette books allow the safety of emulation.

No, sorry, how... PC... of me.

And thank *you* for illustrating an interesting linguistic 
phenomenon, the amelioration of female terms into the perjorative, as 
stated by Jane Mills:  ...'the term for the female is likely to acquire 
negative...connotations and, once it is attached to the female, is 
unlikely to be transferred to a male unless to express contempt.  Some 
linguists have concluded that this constitutes a definitive semantic 
rule.'  

IOW, try and find a male perjorative term that would fit into the above 
list, I doubt you will succeed.  

Sin,

Kathryn Aegis

Oh, go and lay an egg.

I saw right through your feminist BS in a microsecond.
"I'm a model, you know what I mean...."
Ha Ha Ha!!!

There is a limit to the amount of pretention I can take.

Your PATRON(h)ising attitude does not further the cause of extropy.

The feminist movement was justified and correct, but IMO it has gone far
enough. There is a prevailing attitude today that straight white men are
GUILTY of something. Well, listen up, baby, we are NO MORE GUILTY OF
ANYTHING THAN YOU ARE. Shall we blame all the Germans alive today for WW2?

Sorry, Tony, but facts are facts regardless of the personalities
or motives of the one who brings them up.  I'm as tired of PC
whining as anyone.  I'll be the first one to stand up and shout
that Hugh Hefner has done more for women's rights than Dworkin,
McKinnon, and the rest of those idiots put together.  But the
English language /is/ outrageously biased, and that /does/ have
an effect on the way my children will grow up thinking, and I do
want to do something about that.  To deny that out of emotional
backlash is just as petty and irrational as Dworkin's all-sex-is-
rape hogwash.

When a movement like feminism loses sight of the moral foundations
that created it to become an irrational us-vs-them war as it is now,
the way to get it back on track is not to accept the war and fight
back, but to jump out of the combative mindset and get back to the
philosophies that moved its creation.

Lee, you are obviously a highly rational person with a strong grasp of
objective reality. What you say is correct, it is emotional backlash, so I
am not going to waste our time arguing about my motives.

I respect the fact that, though you present highly rational ideas in
this forum, you are not in here to inflate your own ego, which is more
than can be said for several others on this list. Extropy is not about
being admired by others - this is the fuel that creates cults - it is
about the advancement of humanity.

Crowly had some good ideas:

We place no reliance
on virgin nor pidegon:
our method is science,
our aim is religion.

(almost *our* goal) but in the end Thelema (and much of chaos magick)
unfortunately turned into occultism instead of science. There are still a
lot of interesting stuff to work on where they left off (if I ever get the
time, I plan to study more psychology and write a thesis on my model of
how ceremonial magick works psychologically).

	That explains a lot to us.  Do you think a rheostat would be helpful or

	Both of these men were mystics.  Bacon was the Imperator of a mystical
order 	and Paine, along with Jefferson, Newton and Franklin were members of
the 	same order. Do all minds have the "same ability" to access the
mystical 	experience?  Is the "information" gained in the mystical
exerience valid?

As the universe begins to collapse back on itself towards the Big Crunch,
intelligent life can manipulate the collapse in order to extract shear
energy, which can be used for information processing. If this is done in
the right way the amount of processing (and hence "subjective time") can
diverge as the universe collapses, and in the limit the amount of
information stored and processed becomes infinite, the Omega Point. The
Omega Point Theory is a falsifiable form of this scenario, which says that
the Omega Point is not just possible but also *necessary*, a boundary
condition of the universe. 

[That was exactly 100 words. A suggestion: maybe we should try to define
all the "big" terms we use in 100 words or less and try to create a
transhuman dictionary?]

To learn more about the OPT, take a look at my page at
http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Global/Omega which contains a more detailled
treatment and critique of the OPT.  Generally speaking, I like the
scenario but I think the OPT per se is flawed.

A favourite term of (light-hearted-through-furious) abuse in Australia is
`dick-head'.  `Fuckwit' has its fanciers, and is at least gender-free.
Calling someone a `prick' is colder and less forgiven, oddly enough, than
any of the pudenda epithets - well, of course, there's so much more
phallocratic mana attached - and `bastard' tends mysteriously to be the
male equivalent of `bitch' (while I suspect `son-of-a-bitch', little used
here until recent media saturation, equals `bastard' in the States?).

DMAE can be ordered in liquid or powder form from the Life Extension

http://www.lef.org/scripts/html_web_store.pl?page=articles/dmae.htm&cart_id=
3361206

I mail-order most supplements from the Life Extension Foundation, and have been
happy so far with price & quality.

Today, you can use web search engines, such as Metacrawler or Alta Vista,
to find just about any kind of information you want, or any product you
wish to buy. (Mod. cap. at its best!) Try them to comparison shop:

http://www.metacrawler.com/
http://altavista.digital.com/

Use "DMAE price" as a search term and you'll get about 19 hits.

I dare to think that Extropians have gone beyond this kind of limit teaching.
This very meme is what I encounter expicitly when i speak of Extropy. 

I was really surprised to see it on this list. Dynamic Optimism does indeed
 mean getting a REALISTIC view, so astronaut or athlete or artist  would not
be an easy task, I need to tell a child it entail lots of work; a true
talent; perserverence of great magnitude... but to call it a 'long shot' is
to *discourage* them from ever trying! ...dynamic pessimism?? Its a kindly
meme parents often use to protect their kids from failing -and terrifying to
me, yikes!

He was making observations about the style of debate, and was not pointing
out amelioration ( if he knows what it means, I had to look it up ; - ), but
you made a good point. It is cultural, Kathryn - and mysogenistic. It is a
social hierarchy thing. For a man to act like a woman means, in most
situations ( ie sports, etc)  less efficacy. This is an unfortunate and
hopefully reversable translation of gender roles.

Astronomer Alan Hale laments:
<Like I'm sure is true for many of you, I was inspired by the 
scientific discoveries and events taking place during my childhood to 
pursue a career in science only to find, after completing the rigors 
of undergraduate and graduate school, that the opportunities for us to 
have a career in science are limited at best and are which I usually 
describe as "abysmal." Based upon my own experiences, and those of you 
with whom I have discussed this issue, my personal feeling is that, 
unless there are some pretty drastic changes in the way that our 
society approaches science and treats those of us who have devoted our 
lives to making some of our own contributions, there is no way that I 
can, with a clear conscience, encourage present-day students to pursue 
a career in science.>

While an anecdotal survey of 'science career horror stories' would 
certainly be interesting, and might even be useful, I sense that Alan 
Hale is hoping that this could somehow be used to lobby for more 
government funding of the sciences.

I can imagine a situation where, with the right type of marketing, a 
bumper-crop of astronomer and physicist wanna-be's could be produced 
for which there is simply not enough societal need or demand.  Is Hale 
trying to say that everyone who wants to star-gaze for a living should 
have the opportunity to do so?!

After spending several years through my early twenties studying things 
on my own, wandering the country and learning several trades, I 
realized I should go to school and begin a professional career.  Given 
my aptitudes and dispositions, I thought there was nothing I'd rather 
be than a hydrographer.  Well, a little market research soon told me 
that there wasn't that great a demand for hydrographers; so, I 
switched to 'computers' - actually systems science, as I was always 
more interested in software than hardware. Anyway, I don't regret not 
becoming a hydrographer...

On further thought a note:
Both groups of insults usually are used on men, the female ones being a lower
insult, while male ones usually are reserved for males.
Male epithets of genital origin seem to be used to mean: dumb,  insensitive,
 arrogant, blind, mean, slow, uncaring, thoughtless and cruel.
The ones for female: weak, faltering, inadequate, uncertain,  emotionally
mercurical, grouchy, manipulative, and touchy feely.

This reflects  on.....????

In case you're unable to do a Web search here are some summaries:

>From http://www.naturallife.com/DMAE.html

<DMAE  The memory stimulant ... Choline is the usual precursor of 
acetylcholine, but it does not cross the blood-brain barrier very 
well. The body makes acetylcholine from choline as it is needed. DMAE 
is basically a choline molecule with one methyl group missing from the 
nitrogen. DMAE is more able to cross the blood-brain barrier than 
choline. Once inside the brain, an enzyme performs a methylation that 
converts DMAE into choline. So, taking DMAE increases the brain's 
potential to make neurotransmitters.  Dean and Morgenthaler's book 
reports the following effects for DMAE: mood elevation, improvement of 
memory and learning, intelligence increases, and increases in the life 
span of laboratory animals.>

>From http://www.damicon.fi/sd/centrophenoxine.html

<Lipofuscin is the material centrophenoxine is said to remove or scour 
from the glial cells or neurons. It is the waste or residue of 
digestion by lysosomes of effete organelles and bacteria.... The data 
demonstrate that centrophenoxine-induced inhibition of lipofuscin 
accumulation has a positive influence on the cell metabolism and the 
mitotic division capacity and causes a delay of the cellular aging of 
the human glia cells in vitro. (Rodemann and Bayreuther, 1979) 
Concomitant with the reduction of the accumulated lipofuscin, 
centrophenoxine- treated glia cells show enhanced rates of RNA 
synthesis, protein synthesis and glucose uptake. Most likely the 
utilization of glucose is shifted from glycolysis to the pentose 
phosphate pathway. Data suggest reduction of lipofuscin by 
centrophenoxine has a positive effect on cell metabolic functions and 
causes a delay of the cellular aging of the human glia cells in vitro. 
(1983)>

As for what Morris Johnson was referring to (BTW, I didn't see any 
reference by Max More to centrophenoxine) when saying
<I was astonished at the similarity between the combination of DMAE 
plus the common herbicide 2,4-D and centrophenoxine.  The only 
difference is the 2, chloro of the 2,4-D.  Would people exposed to 
minimal amounts of 2,4-d while also consuming DMAE have similar 
effects to those of centrophenoxine?>
I haven't a clue - interaction of neurochemicals in the brain is an 
EXTREMELY complex subject.

Every old grunt knows what it means to come back from a hard day at the

I'm not certain that Kathryn actually *did* mean what she wrote.  To

Oliver Richner asked
<DMAE have any known negative side effects?>

I have seen no references to any negative side effects for DMAE. 
 Remember, the result of taking DMAE is to increase the amount of 
choline available to the brain AND choline is a natural substance 
produced in the brain, so it's not like it's really a drug, it's more 
like a 'vitamin supplement' for the brain.

Most of the questions related to DMAE that I've seen deal with the 
question of the proper dose to achieve some noticeable effect.  The 
conservative recommendation is 100 mg per day, which is usually the 
amount in one capsule.  DMAE is often combined with B vitamins in 
prepared capsules.  For stronger effects, I think the recommendation 
300 mg per day in three doses.  At this level you might get a 
noticeable 'buzz'.

Discussion and focus groups are often necessary if the topic is something
people don't normally think about.  But aren't focus groups often selected by
the researcher, either to reflect a sub-population, or to gather a more
represtentative sample, rather than self-selected?

True.  I was thinking more along the lines of how anybody could know what
modern 20-year-olds (either individually or in the aggregate) will be like at
40.  The 20-year-old won't know; they haven't been there, and as I outlined
above, their predictions are suspect.  The 40-year-old won't know; they and
their peers were different at 20 (insofar as they're the same, we have
neither a change nor a problem).

Rather the converse, when a male term is used to describe a woman, it
typically is a sign of respect of one sort or another, with the possible
conditional exception of "butch".  If a woman is described as having
balls, cojones, she is  considered to be "macho" or worthy of being a
leader.

Yes, you'd rather have a sub-population who wasn't self-selected to
discuss the topic in question.  This is why this forum may be a better
place for a discussion like this than say the newsgroup soc.men.

Yes, I think that in the absence of a broader discussion of these

Which seems quite a shame.

Are you claiming that these are not in fact long shots, or that one

have no problem with people taking long shots, if they know that's
what they are doing.

A male perjorative that I have heard in several contexts is "cowboy",
usually used to describe someone who is being ham-fisted and mindless
when finesse and thought are required.  I first hit this one in the
general aviation industry, as a term for incompetent pilots.  (I
recall there were convincing statistics that up through about 300
hours of flight time, women were far better pilots than men; after
that, men's abilities rose to equal those of women.)  I have also
heard it used by automobile racing drivers, with similar meaning.
I'm not sure it would be as popular in cattle country...

One also hears the slang "testosterone poisoning" used in perjoratives
for men who, e.g., have too much ego and too little sense.

My favorite example of a pair of words whose denotative meanings are
(approximately) mere gender-specific terms for the same thing (like
"he" and "she"), but whose connotative meanings are very different, is
"master" and "mistress".

Turning pain off might be too extreme.
How about,
"Wait a nanosecond... 
this bodily conflagration is burning my flesh.
Hey, I don't like that feeling."
This brings to mind how much pain is needed to be pain, 
may be only recognition of a thing is to be reacted to as if it were pain;
or is Reaction to pain what you are seeking to avoid?

As for general changes being hard to deal with
simply program automatic settings 
for predetermined situations/environments
(or split second reminders to occurr at those times, as you suggest).
Perhaps I am over simplifying 
or talking about an other thing?

Practicality:
If you can't see it you don't know it exists,
so don't worry.

Optimism:
If it can't be fixed you're wrong.

I do not think there is much difference.
I believe thinking is a register/reaction 
and feeling is simply a reaction of higher intensity 
(even becoming a prolonged willfull action 
{note: will is not always conscious}).
I would rather limit my reactions 
from what I would consider motivational distractions 
(I need no motivation when I have programming that can not be ignored).
Think about how many distracting reactions are related to addiction/habit
(fill in the blank_____________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________________)
and how many are related to withdrawl/restlessness, 
such as tapping fingers, bouncing knees, biting lips, scratching iches, etc.

I do not need to care.

	I'm not certain that this is entirely true.  It does operate in
the cholinergic system, but I don't believe that it is ever synthesized
into choline, I believe it is synthesized directly to acetylcholine.  That
is why DMAE is better than choline, they have the same function, but DMAE
more effectively crosses the blood-brain barrier.

	Many vitamin supplements can cause harm.  Look to ascorbic acid as
one examample of a highly used yet still potentially dangerous supplement.
To much ascorbic acid can cause kidney stones in the long run, and ulcers
as well.
	Just because it is "natural" doesn't make it safe...
	I do agree in regards to the safety of DMAE however, I have not
seen any reports of negative side affects.

	I believe that is correct.

I will interpret that as well as I can.

If you are asking if clones are not identical( same)  
I say yes they are not completly exact and totally true copies 
nor should they be considered 
a one soley singular person or conglomerate entity.
Though they have similarities and common traits 
(chimps share a majority of genetic traits w/ humans)
it only takes one difference to seperate their identities.
Twins are two people even if they share a waist( Siamese twins).


If you are asking if they are a waste of time, 
I say, in a major sense, yes.
Cracking the genetic code for improvement is important to me. 
Reproducing the code we have now is not.
98% of parents are unfit communicators, educators, and providers.
Think of ALL the children who have EVER been desperate, homeless, sick,
hungry, ignored, maladjusted, abused, enslaved, tortured, murdered( need I
go on?).
Remember 70 year olds are children too, every one has a parent/creator.

We need to care for the children we have before we make more.
The global community with easier access to communications 
will bring humanity together from the youth up.
Teens are the ones on the net who grow up talking to people world-wide.
They are the ones who will help each other when adults have failed.
Point being we have enough unloved people.

One good some what related aspect could come about 
if people become sterile and procreated solely via genetic engineering.
That would decrease accidental, unwanted, unprepared for progeny.
It would also pass on genes of choice.

While I am intrigued by the possibilities of many new drugs for
enhancement of the human experience, I still take none, because I
am distressed by the complete lack of real information about them
available to me, and I wonder what might be done to fix that.

I have spent hours scouring web pages, magazines, in search of
some morsel of fact; but I find only speculation and anecdotes.
I really /want/ there to be something real in them, but I cannot
bet my life and my health on anything I've seen so far.  Is it
so hard to do a few simple controlled experiments?  Is there some
law that "information" can't have actual numbers in it, but has to
be written like ad copy?  Don't these writers know that by writing
anecdote after anecdote, implication after implication, that they
are undermining their own credibility?  A single table full of
real numbers is worth more than 1000 pages of glowing endorsements
and bullshit hype like "natural", "safe", "well-known", "increased
vitality", "antitoxins", "dramatic effects".

I'm not even looking for fancy university-funded doctor-performed
research, just some basic honesty.  Informal experiments among
friends--but with placebo controls, measured effects, and complete,
honest disclosure of results and methods sufficient to allow any
reader to compute statistical significance and judge its value.

Let's take some simple "smart drug", for example.  How hard would
it be to find a dozen people, give them some simple cognitive skill
tests, then give half the drug and half a placebo, give the tests
again, and print all the numbers?  We could do it in a few hours
at a party, and repeat the ones that showed promise to get better
sample size.   The fact that numbers like these are never printed
makes me suspicious of the whole supplement industry.

[P.S. In an earlier thread here, I accused alternative medical
practitioners and supplement sellers of being generally charlatans,
which I still do.  In particular, though, I was asked to go look at
the actual labels of supplement bottles to verify that they had no
specific health claims.  I did, and they don't.  They do, however,
still contain reams of meaningless ad copy, and the magazines and
books on the next shelf over have actual health claims, and have
lots of supplement ads, so I am no less of the opinion that these
people are generally charlatans.  I would honestly like to think
otherwise, but I have no evidence to base that belief on.]

        This list has been a great help in finding and hopefully tomorrow
being able to acquire my first helpings of so called "smart drugs".  Also i
think that the reliabilty of these drugs really isnt in question. 
        For DMAE the one I choose to start on there was a simple biological
explaniaton for its effects and simple biological reasons for its
side-effects.  Along the line these supplements and nootropics have to be
passed by the FDA for approval as OTC, supplemental, and prescription
availability and they must establish necessary guidelines for dosing and
prescribing and probably even establish its LD50 dosage.  so these
supplements and drugs aren't totally unresearched. 
        as for their claimed effects to the mental process, it doesnt really
matter to me. If my body can be fooled into a higher ability to concentrate,
better mood and extends my life span then i dont really care if more
acetlycholine has penetrated the blood-brain barrier, its not really the
issue, the results are.

Well spotted Anders!  I think there are indeed many points of contact
between Thelema and Extropianism.

BTW, there are many  people who claim to represent Thelema nowadays. For
anybody who is interested, IMO the authentic lineage which sticks to the
authentic 'method of science, aim of religion', is:-

Crowley

- Karl Germer

- Marcelo Motta

- William R Barden

This lineage has a website for anybody who would like to make contact
with Thelema.

I agree with Lee about the lack of good information about supplements.
Unfortunately there is a huge gulf between the people doing actual
research (which is often quite misinterpeted; just reading a medline
abstract supporting it doesn't prove substance X makes you smarter) and
the people selling and using "smart drugs" and supplements. I'm reading
Gilovich's _How We Know What Isn't So_ right now, a book about how we are
often misled by our flawed reason, and almost every pitfall I read about
are represented among the enthusiasts. Tragic.

I agree that this should be done. It will not likely be strongly
significant (you need plenty of subjects for that), but at least it is
better than the usual "I've tried it and I feel great!". Of course, doing
a good mini-study isn't entirely trivial since there are plenty of
pitfalls, but it can be done. Maybe we should try writing a
"laytranshumanists's guide to testing" explaining how to do a double-blind
placebo study and analyze the data?

This is a good example why it is easy to get fooled by small studies. In
the above case, you implictly assume that the drug will have effect quite
immediately (most medical models suggest it takes weeks), and if you are
not doing it double-blind you are quite likely to influence the subjects.
But the general idea is sound. We at Aleph have been thinking of doing
"consumer testing" of smart drinks like Magic or Red Bull, comparing test
results before and after, and adding comments about taste, price and
nutrients. Maybe we transhumanists could work together on something like
this?

There are several problems with this:

First, most supplements (according to the claims) take time to produce 
an effect.  It's not like you can take a capsule and immediately see a 
result.

I have found that most 'nootropics' appear to act more as 'mood 
enhancers' or stimulants rather than improving some simple and 
measurable cognitive skill. But, then, that's something that's 
subjectively observable and I'm some objective measurement like how 
fast I can read or how well I might score on some coordination test.

How do you measure a 'rapture effect' without doing something 
impractical like measuring the level of endorphins in the brain? 
 There's also an issue of tolerances.  Some of these substances have a 
very apparent effect the first few times they are used, but then as 
the body (or mind) becomes used to them the effect is either 
attenuated or taken for granted and not as consciously noticeable.

There are some ways to experiment on your own, maintaining a healthy 
level of skepticism until you see some noticeable effect that is new 
in your experience and 'appears' to be causally associated with the 
substance being used.

For example, I tried ginkgo billoba (reputed to be a powerful 
antioxidant herb) never expecting to notice any effect from it - I 
just assumed that if it worked it might improve 'brain circulation', 
whatever that meant.  Usually I just took a capsule in the morning 
along with my other vitamins.  On occasion though, I would take one 
before bed time.  I was surprised to notice that my dreams, on these 
occasions, would be alot more 'narrative', that is, rather than a 
'typical' impressionist dream of people and places and feelings, it 
seemed like someone was reading a story to me.  Even when I noticed 
this and 'said to myself' (still asleep), that this story was 
ridiculous, the narrattion continued as if it were a TV program that I 
could not turn off.  This was something that I had rarely noticed 
before even though I make an attempt to remember my dreams every 
night.  As a 'control' I would then try to observe this effect on 
other nights with and without the ginkgo.  Also as a control, this was 
before I had read any details or annecdotes about ginkgo billoba other 
that it was supposed to be an antioxidant.

Also, it's hard to distinguish the primary mental changes of a 
biochemical effect from the secondary changes produced by increased 
mental exercise or concentration.  For example, an athlete might take 
some sort of stimulant that inspires them to do more exercise but it 
is most likely the exercise itself that results in measurable 
increases in muscle mass or coordination.

How would you measure the improvements in your life from zen 
meditations?

You missed my point. Are we talking statistics or are we discussing how I am
to raise my child? 

Perhaps pursuit of a glorious career is a  long shot for someone , who has
not the talent or perserverence. 
You seem to claim it is a long shot for ANYONE to become a movie star. 
I must point out, that for those who are already there, this a natural state.
I know a two "movie stars". ( No astronauts sorry). They are simply people
who put one foot in front of the other every day, like you and I, but aimed
in a certain direction

With respect to personal achievement, Robin, you should know that the
chances one has of making it to the goal are mostly affected by
preparation and perseverance. While going for it may be a long shot for
those who only try, those who follow Yoda and live by "There is no try,
do or do not." have good chances. 90% of the weeding process in life is
a matter of the individual quitting at one point or another, even if
only mentally at one crucial juncture. WHile it is true that some start
off with worse odds than others, those who never try because of the
supposed "odds" never even show up for the race.

Or course it's in question, or I wouldn't have asked.  I find not
merely insufficient evidence, but /no/ evidence, and not even the
attempt at evidence that they do a damned thing.

Huh?  That's precisely what I'm talking about--there are reams of
paragraphs like that one.  Lots of buzzwords, zero information content.

Precisely!  I agree.  I don't care /why/ they work either, I just
want to know /if/ they work, and all I can find is explanations and
testimonials.  I don't give a damn what gets transmitted where, or
why we think it might work, or how the people using them feel or what
they believe.  None of that matters.  Do they work or not?  A simple
question, easy to answer, with methods known for centuries.  The fact
that no one even tries to answer it is very suspicious.  I'm happy
that you feel better or think you concentrate more with them, but if
I see no reason to believe that those aren't just placebo effects,
then I'm not going to blindly pop pills on some random testimonial.

Yes, I left out some details, but in principle it shouldn't be too hard.
I did a similar thing once: I was having some insomnia, and my mother
(whom I love and admire, but who will fall for anything) suggested I try
melatonin.  I gave her some specific instructions: tell her assistant at
work (whom I was not likely to meet in the month ahead) to go to the
local drug pusher (GNC) and get a bottle of melatonin and a bottle of
something similar-looking but inert, transfer the pills to envelopes
marked A and B, then give them to me, where I'll try one for a couple
of weeks and then the other, and record things like what time I got to
work, how much time I spend online (a rough measure of how much time I
spend awake!), my subjective impression of how I feel at night, etc.
Not quite double-blind because she sees her assistant every day, and a
sample size of 1 isn't very impressive, but it's still better than the
kilopages of magazine articles on the stuff.

The result was that I found my insomnia did in fact go away, but under
both the drug and the placebo, so it was probably just due to the
ritual of taking something and going to bed at a regular time nightly,
not due to anything the drug did.  Of course, a larger study over a
longer period of time might well show some real effect, but I was at
least satisfied that I wouldn't benefit much from continuous outlay
of money on melatonin.

Simple: ask.  Give a dozen people a euphoric, and another dozen a
vitamin or something, then have them all answer multiple-choice
questions about how they feel.  If the answers to some question
correlate strongly enough with those who took the real drug, you've
shown a measured effect (certainly not a conclusive one, but at
least better than nothing).

This is generally a waste of time, even for someone who is skeptical
and knowledgeable about research, because placebo effects work even
on those who think they don't.

I've never tried to, but I suppose I could if I really wanted to.
Hmm.  How do you give a placebo for sitting?

Yes, of course one should condition estimates of career chances on
estimates of talent and willingness to persist relative to others.
But even conditioning on these, there are many people for whom many
careers are "long shots".  I know very persistent people who tried and
failed to become movie stars.

Moving back to the topic of sex roles, I would claim that current sex
roles make many goals "long shots" for most males.  To my previous list:

>he'll never have to deal with violence from bullies at school, or who
>is hoping to deal with his shyness by waiting for girls to ask him out

I would add fathers who hope to gain custody of their children in a
divorce.  The responses above sound like the standard response to male
complaints: "If you were a real man, you'd try harder and succeed."

An interesting point, thank you for bringing that up.  It doesn't 
contradict my original point, however, which is that the vast 
majority of insults thrown at men referent the female.  The two 
points complement each other.  Both are symptoms of our highly 
divisive gender power structure that pits males and females against 
each other rather than bringing them together for mutual growth.

Also enjoyed reading Geoff Cobb's comments, and the additional word 
suggestions (have we violated any community standards yet?).  As for 
Tony's rants, they evidence that he has not read most of what I post 
here, so I'll just wait for such time as he catches up to my 
post-feminist ouvre to converse with him.

Yes, it is suspicious, but I there is a lot of taboo around the idea of
promoting a drug as a nootropic, or anti-aging drug, even if it does work.
Most companies are very comfortable with the idea of producing drugs for
"the sick". That is why most of the currently available "nootrpics" were
developed to treat diseases of cognitive impairment, such as Alzheimer's
disease. If there are any side effects, those side effects are not so
acceptable when they occur in someone who doesn't *need* the drug.
Maybe the information you are looking for is contained in the data for the
control populations that are usually tested along with the "diseased"
populations in most sudies. In order to get this data you would have to
look at the original research articles, which shouldn't be too diffcult.

I should admit that a lot of papers will not include this data, so it might
take quite a search.

There has been a lot of talk about proper testing of smart drugs on
this list recently.
Is it just talk or are we serious here?


I propose an experiment with ourselves as the subjects:

1) We collectively choose a smart drug to try.

2) Someone slightly skeptical establishes a testing protocol.
      ( Lee, want to volunteer? )

3) Someone distributes a test ( could be a standard IQ test, or an 
     attached program that will test hand-eye coordination, or
     whatever is appropriate to the drug of choice ) This establishes
     a baseline.

4) Have a trusted person blindly distribute it and placebos by snail mail.
      ( Max, want to volunteer? )

5) Similar tests are re-distributed periodically.

6) At the end of the testing period, test results are correlated
      and we can then have real data to argue about.


I hereby volunteer to be one of the guinea pigs, and to possibly
do part 3+5 depending on the drug.


Any takers?

BTW, this could have some publicity value if handled properly...

Your subtly conceived arrogance is what made me angry in the first place,
so you can count on a very long wait.

I have read everything that you have posted here since I joined this list.
Also I have not pretended that I have not read your material, like a lot of
childish people do.

1) To avoid bruised or bloated egos, the test should probably be
  a coordination or memory test, not IQ.

2) I'll pay for the drugs.

Not just talk, surely.  

(I've been told by my housekeeper that my home is now easier to clean.
Apparently, he noticed that how I toss my laundry and dirty dishes appears
to be substantially more methodical than in the past years, and contends
that it just might have something to do with a higher rate of mental agility
and  focus and as well as enhanced memory capability.)

Ok, Robert, I'm actually seriously interested in smart drugs and
experimentation with same.  I'm not sure what research has been done in the
past, but I would gladly review any notes on such results.

An alternative would be to report only the differences in the test
results instead of the actual numbers.  This would protect
individual privicy but still provide useful information.  Results
could be provided either as absolute change or as percentage change 
(but not both since that would give away the test scores).

Of course, using more than one kind of test is a good idea anyway.

Actually, that should be done by a trusted anonymous person
as well, so that neither the experimenters nor the subjects
have any expectation of what it's supposed to do.  The subjects
should ideally be those with no previous experience.

I don't qualify as only "slightly" skeptical, but I'll certainly
lay out some rules.  RULE #1: anyone who regularly takes them
now is out.

A Java applet, of course.  It should have multiple tests, including
linguistic ones, visual ones, etc., and the subjects should not know
what they are expected to be good or bad at.  A web form can be used
for reporting as well, but the test has to be an applet for timing.

I'll kick in some bucks for postage; no need to burden ExI.

To understand life we must understand death.
Alive is not dead.
Dead is not alive.

When is dead dead?
No brain activity means death.
Before that no heart activity meant death.
Before that no lung activity meant death.
Perhaps there was a time when no structural muscle activity meant death.

Does death exist?
No one has proven to me that death can exist from the subject's view point.
It is seems impossible that though one may experience the process of dying 
one can experience death.
It is accepted that if I am dead I can not experience.
Therefore I can not experience death,
I can only experience dying.

How far from dying is living?
If I am dying I am alive.
If I am alive I am living.
I am living; 
I am dying;
is there any real difference?
I say there is only action/change/motion/movement 
and I challenge everyone to verify or falsify that.

Peter Voss has designed an intelligence test (Peter@optimal.com).  Perhaps
it could be helpful in determining aspects intellectual enhancements. 

Standard IQ tests are limiting.  Hand-eye coordination realizes specific
systematization - good evaluation technique. Memory processing is central to
learning and thinking  - recollection, recall, recognition and relearning -
good evaluation technique.

Any of these test would identify any smart drug effects, however it seems to
me that the measure we would be looking for can be established by comparing
markers for intelligence before supplementation - to after supplementation.
Otherwise, how do we know if Jack is "naturally" a coordinated person while
Jill has always been a bit bovine.  Or that, Jill is endowed with innate
capabilities in memory, or photographic memory, while Jack's recollection
techniques are stimulated more by audio?

First age is not our enemy, disfunction is.
I would rather be a millenia of age with full capability
than a challenged person with 18 years of age.
Second I would rather be doing things other than being really still,

Let us stop calling it immortality.
They are jealous of us using the meme.
Call it indefinite longevity,
or better yet help me think of an extremely technical term 
in an obscure language.
If they do not know what we are talking about 
they may not argue as much about it.
Either that 
or we should learn to express our concerns with their words 
so they see we want the same thing they do,
though we do not want to make God provide it for us.
I think Gods job is hard enough.
Why make him do the work?

I would rather not need learn or concern my self with death.
Religion is metaphysics and law.

Wave a flag remotely as a distraction

The fact that science is taking the word "immortality" and giving it stature
is shaking up religious and spiritual communities.  It's also causing these
same communities to rethink their faiths. As these communities dodge reason
and cover their eyes and ears to technological progress, they too shall
slowly, awkwardly, stubbornly move into the future.  And, I wouldn't be
surprised if there aren't a whole slew of closet supporters of science in
hopes of it benefiting their own immortal cause.

Indefinite lifespan, or indefinite longevity are more apt phrases -- a bit
more transhumans, while immortality has a strong reference to humans.

Depends on the goal.  Some require special talent, some the right body, and
some really good luck.  Most people have essentially no chance of ever being
a chess grandmaster, a basketball star, or a actor/actress, regardless of the
preparation or perseverence.  One of my cousins has acted in numerous plays
and gone to many acting schools for a decade now and has gotten nowhere.  A
friend of mine tried for years to get into scriptwriting - and I, a natural
critic, liked many of his works - but he never got anywhere past "let's do
lunch" and one flaky director.

Preparation and perseverence are necessary, but not sufficient, to have good
chances.  One must also try to do something for which one is well-suited.
 Things which many, many people want to do but at which only a few succeed
are often things one's chances are poor no matter your determination.

Lee: I'm surprised. I agree that there isn't a whole lot of really good
experimental evidence for smart drugs working on young, healthy people.
However, there is plenty of good evidence that they work on people with
cognitive deficits, and there appears to be *some* good experimental
evidence for affects on young healthy people for at some of the substances.
By good experimental evidence, I mean double-blind, controlled, cross-over
experiments. One of the newest discoveries--ampakines--having been found to
improve memory in older people, are being tested on young folks by
researchers like Gary Lynch at UC Irvine. 

Do you discount *all* the studies cited in books like Smart Drugs and
Nutrients by Dean and Morgenthaler. Certainly, the evidence is often in
terms of theoretical arguments that these substances ought to work and come
along with pretty useless personal stories. However, there *are* some
studies that apparently used good methodology. I'm wondering whether you
just haven't come across these, or whether you have reasons to dispute all
such cases.

Yes, I suppose I am exaggerating.  I suppose I'm just disappointed
by what I've been able to find for the layman.  I'm sure there are
some good therapeutic studies that might generalize well, and there
might be (as Tony suggested) some value in looking at data from the
control groups of those studies as well.

My ire should be directed at the mass marketers of these things who
look only for vaguely-applicable studies that justify their sales
rather than looking for honest facts about their everyday benefits
to ordinary people.

I'm sure the misguided ethical barriers to cosmetic pharmacology
cause grant-seeking researchers to look elsewhere, but real capitalist
researchers should be looking for the cosmetic uses to /really/
boost sales among skeptics like me.  The gullible will buy anyway,
so they have real incentive to do those tests to prove the value of
the products to joe consumer while the "ethical" doctors can keep
sucking the public teat for their studies.

The test methods available will depend on the sample space.  Predispostions
can be factored out mathematically after the data are gathered--no need to
do before and afters--in fact that will bias the results of those who
might find or invent some reason to believe which group they are in.  

And here's an important point: if we do generate enough interest to do
something, and get a good sample base, we should STOP TALKING about the
possible protocols of the experiment in public.  Those who will be out
of the sample set--the experimenters, helpers, data collectors, and
advisors--should discuss the protocol among themselves privately where
the subjects can't hear, so they won't have any expectations.

You are suggesting individual duplicates get shorter sentences 
for having someone quite similar to them.
That is not reason.
If a duplicate kills seconds after it is made, 
shall the one it is made from be punished 
when it's finger did not pull a trigger, no.
Shall a duplicate whose fingers did not even exist in the mind 
of the one who would soon dream of creating them,
suffer wrath for an event occurring before it was yet formed, no.
What you suggest is a child should pay for a parent's sin.
If you believe this 
the child may suffer for parents of it's parents and other ancestors 
who have not paid enough to satisfy your greed.
This brings absurdity to my mind.

My God people...

Two things are not the same thing, they are different;
that is why they are two things!
Is that so hard to know?
Two dollars are not the same dollar.
You may say they the have the same value to you 
but that is because you fail to see the differences.
If you talk to a collector they will tell you 
there are many things which determine value

Use some common sense, you're dissapointing me.

There's nothing in Ben's statement which implies any lack of dynamic
optimism. It's perfectly possible to be dynamically optimistic about death.

This IMHO far too aristotelian; there is no clear division between the 
two. Perhaps it would be better to say "alive is less dead" and "dead is 
less alive".

Remember that the old Greeks said that Hypnos, the god of sleep, was the 
brother of Thanatos, the god of death. 

Death seems to be a function of medical advances. The interesting question
is whether there exists an asymptote as medicine goest to infinity.

Discussion:

 Hi Loren,
 I most certainly agree with this post.
You understand the situation I see very well.
People are often too closed minded to learn enough 
to know words they hate represent the same things as words they like.
If hatred is caused by misunderstanding I think I love you.

 I wonder if I have read any other posts by you.
This is the only post of yours I recall reaching my consciousness.
Do you write often?

___

Problem:

How can transhumans express to religions
the possibility of indefinite longevity without required death?

Solution:

Suggestions for speech( meme ops):

If we die and there is afterlife we are not dead;
if we are not dead we did not die, 
why want to die if we won't?

Don't die and go to heaven; 
live and make heaven come to you.

Unfortunately the evidence is rather sparse and spotty, so it is hard to
evaluate. I would say there are intriguing results out there that
definitely merits further research, but hardly any proof.

Yes, this seems quite promising. I'm going to do some actual research now
on a memory model, and the professor of my research group (Martin Ingvar
of the Karolinska Institute) has been involved in testing the ampakines.
I'll see if I can get some useful data from him.  (My memory model
actually suggests one possibility for how cholinergic nootropics work, but
it is just a hunch right now).

I haven't read SDaN yet, but my impression is that it may be convincing 
but not necessarily correct. Making sure a study has a good methodology 
is HARD, especially in a fuzzy area such as cognitive medicine, and it is 
easy to be fooled by one's convictions. A lot of arguments are built on 
animal experiments (one of my recurring nightmares: the rat hippcampus 
does something completely different from the human hippocampus) and 
individual studies, which is weak. The nootropics movement really needs

And one person's hippocampus may do 'something' different from

one day compared to another.  These kinds of tests and 'animal

you mentioned) the won't tell us much of anything *interesting at a 
higher level*.

Yes, 'gullible' people who rely on their own experiences can be 
'fooled' by 'placebo effects'.  Just what this placebo effect really 
is is an even more interesting question.  The objectivist skeptic is 
just as easily fooled by convictions.  BTW, how do we measure 
conviction?

P.S. In a field closer to my own occupation - I produce 'objective' 
economic statistics - I noticed a story in yesterday's Wall Street 
Journal about how business analysts 'in the trenches' find it 
absolutely essential to supplement such statistics with annecdotal 
evidence in order to make useful decisions on a real-time basis.

Lee described an experiment with insomnia and melatonin:
<The result was that I found my insomnia did in fact go away, but 
under both the drug and the placebo, so it was probably just due to 
the ritual of taking something and going to bed at a regular time 
nightly, not due to anything the drug did.  Of course, a larger study 
over a longer period of time might well show some real effect, but I 
was at least satisfied that I wouldn't benefit much from continuous 
outlay of money on melatonin.>

Of course, and the brain also produces its own melatonin, which 
complicates the results...

You might do the same experiment with headaches and aspirin and get 
the same inconclusive results. For example, I don't have headaches 
every day, nor do I have trouble sleeping every day; and, I can put up 
with a headache and it will probably be gone in the morning, but that 
doesn't mean the aspirin wouldn't help with a headache at the right 
time. Nor would I necessarily use the aspirin every day. (And in the 
case of aspirin, it reputedly also has long-term affects on the 
'health of the heart', further complicating the analysis.)

Your assumption that "it was probably just due to the ritual" is just 
as biased and simplistic (simplistic because it tries to fit a 
non-linear, multi-variate situation to a linear, single-variable 
equation) as the pill-popper's assumption that it is the pill that is 
doing all the work.

I asked
> How do you measure a 'rapture effect' without doing something
> impractical like measuring the level of endorphins in the brain?

Lee answered:
<Simple: ask.  Give a dozen people a euphoric, and another dozen a 
vitamin or something, then have them all answer multiple-choice 
questions about how they feel.  If the answers to some question 
correlate strongly enough with those who took the real drug, you've 
shown a measured effect (certainly not a conclusive one, but at least 
better than nothing).>

I said 'rapture effect' in quotes precisely because I don't have good 
descriptions for many of these mental states, even though I have spent 
many hours trying to describe them for my own edification. A selection 
of multiple-choice descriptions is too simplistic - there are times 
when I could have answered "all of the above" to any list you might 
provide even though some of the selections might seem contradictory.

When dealing with human health, moods and cognitive capacities, we are 
dealing with a VERY complex system that does not submit to simple 
mechanical measurements.

Scientists Confident of Life on Jupiter Moon

PASADENA, Calif. (Reuter) - Space scientists said Wednesday they were 
confident life existed in the muddy waters of
one of Jupiter's moons. 

"I am sure there's life there," John Delaney of the University of 
Washington said in a reference to the Jovian moon
Europa. Delaney and the other experts spoke at a news briefing detailing 
results of pictures from the Galileo probe. 

Pictures of Europa sent back by Galileo after its closest flyby of the 
moon in February and released by the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration Wednesday showed a red-colored sea 
with a crust of ice about three feet thick in
which huge icebergs several miles across were floating, the scientists 
said. 

The images were taken as Galileo was 363 miles from Europa. 

Talking to reporters at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the scientists 
said they believed all the ingredients for creating
and sustaining life forms existed in Europa's waters. 

Delaney, a professor of oceanology, said he and other scientists believed 
the waters under the ice crust were being
warmed by volcanic activity and undersea research on Earth had shown that 
"volcanic activity supports life without
sunlight." 

Richard Terrile of the JPL, a planetary scientist, said he believed there 
was organic matter in sediment at the bottom of
Europa's ocean and pointed out: "On Earth, these same ingredients in a 
million years gave presence to life." 

Terrile said he would like to see a "machine exploration" of Europa 
during a future unmanned probe to the moon in the
hope of confirming his beliefs. 

Delaney said he was "very excited" by Galileo's pictures. "The bottom 
line is, it's about life. The discovery of life on
another planet will surpass anything that has ever taken place in human 
history," he said. 

He added that volcanic activity not only sustained life but encouraged 
it, saying when a volcano erupted under the ocean
on Earth it caused bacteria to "bloom at a massive level." 

In an effort to bolster their life-in-outer-space theory, scientists and 
engineers from around the world were meeting in
Pasadena on Wednesday and Thursday to discuss an exploration of Lake 
Vostok, a subglacial lake under the ice in
Antarctica which they believe has conditions similar to Europa's sea. 

Michael Carr of the United States Geological Survey said there was 
evidence of movement and rotation by the icebergs
which could not be explained by wind as Europa is in a vacuum. "The 
plausible cause for this motion is traction below
which implies liquid below. 

Dr Paul Geissler of the University of Arizona said the pictures showed 
the sea as a red-brown area on the surface of
Europa. He speculated that the red-brown material in the waters indicated 
it was a "muddy sea," while Max Coon, a
scientist with NorthWest Research Associates, Inc., concluded after 
studying the pictures that, "The ice features here (on
Earth) look very, very like the ones on Europa." 

Oceanographer Clark Chapman of the Southwest Research Institute said he 
believed Europa was still developing and
the ice crust was about one million years old, "a mere day in geological 
terms." 

The scientists, who make up the Galileo imaging team and whose task it is 
to interpret the pictures and data sent back
from the spacecraft, also said it appeared that the ice crust was slowly 
melting because of the warmer waters below
which were being heated by volcanic activity. 

Galileo was launched by the shuttle Atlantis in October, 1989 and arrived 
at Jupiter to begin its exploration of the planet
and its moons in December of 1995.

I agree with Natasha Vita More.
The term "immortal" carries some heavy connotations, the most noticeable
being  *removing the CHOICE of whether or not to live*. You *cannot* die. I
find that undesirable. Simple. I would like an INDEFINITE lifespan, one
within my own control.  Immortal implies I cannot choose to pull my own plug.

>Not very ardent, how about some dynamic optimism?

Dynamic optimism leading to just wishful thinking is useless (or worse).
 Dynamic optimism is useful only insofar as believing it gets you to do
things that help you acheive your goals.  I should point out that Mr. Best is
one of the most assiduous (but sensible) practitioners on the calorie
restriction list, so his actions reflect a dynamic optimism and a real value
on extended life.

>> It is sometimes 
>>hard to remember that FOREVER includes 10exp10exp1000 years from now. 
>>Do I want to be alive in 10exp10exp1000 years? 

>I do.

Nobody *knows* what they will want in even 200 years, never mind
10exp10exp1000 years.  Nobody's ever lived that long.  People change over
time, and we are, after all, only designed to go about 100 years max.  Over
periods longer than the existence of the human race, who knows what you'll
become?  At some point, you may want to check out.

I'm quite confident I want a very extended lifespan, but not so arrogant as
to assume I want to live forever.  I describe my current goal as "500 years
with an option to extend".

I'll also point out that normal human existance is about 80 years with
significant deterioration towards the end.  There is, as yet, no *proof* that
we can do better than that.  Plausible ideas, yes.  Wild speculation, yes.
 But even saying that you will make it to 120 in full possession of your
faculties is optimistic.

Who does not defend his or her rights has defined him or her self as a
slave. (Similar meaning to Ayn Rand's "I swear by my life and my love of
it that I will not live for the sake of another, or ask another to live
for mine" perhaps?)

However, free human beings do not want slaves; slaves are an encumbrance.
(In an image: each slave has only one chain, the slave-'master'  has
many.)

On the other hand, free human beings might want *servants*, whom they
would pay a proper wage.

I think you're onto something here Tony, it's the same with everything
Extropian, everything to do with consciously improving oneself: it sends
shivers down peoples' spines, it is 'taboo'.  What a sick society! (I
exaggerate of course, and the bottle is, on the whole, half full.)

That's why the full might of the scientific community hasn't been
focussed on 'smart drugs', or even the 'placebo' effect, come to think
of it (e.g. how could we learn to control these obvious psychosomatic
powers better?)

No, that doesn't complicate them at all.  It may /affect/ them,
but the results are the results; we're not looking for reasons or
explanations.

I doubt it very seriously.  The effects of aspirin are well-tested,
outperform placebos by miles, and are easy to describe.  I have done
similar tests, for example, to determine which of the various common
anagesics works best for me, and the results were quite dramatic:
acetominophen had no effect I could measure (on me; I have no reason
to doubt its clinical worth in general), ibuprofen worked, but aspirin
beat 'em both hands down.  The hardest part of doing those experiments
was controlling for caffeine :-)

I agree--it was a wild guess.  But the experiment was just barely
sufficient to give me some confidence that spending money on the
melatonin wouldn't give any dramatic immediate effects.  That's all
I really cared to know, so I didn't investigate further.  I leave
it to the manufacturers to do more complete tests.

So complexity tells you that you should just give up?  Nonsense.  I do
not concede for one moment that there exists anything I am not capable
of measuring, testing, and understanding /eventually/.  It may be very
difficult; we may not even know how to begin going about it yet.  But
anything we experience is measurable, without exception, if we take
sufficient care in the experiment.  Even if our experiments are sloppy
and our conclusions vague, we're still better off than someone who
doesn't even try.

Unlikely.  After all, you are writing on this list.  

A computer (of today's complexity, not a theoretical mega processor) exists
to get things done.  It has masters that tell it what to do.  Many acetics
have forsaken pleasure to fulfill the "instructions" of what they perceive
as their "maters."  What is your master?  If the only person, or thing, or
entity, you answer to is yourself, must you not live for yourself?  I find
it hard to believe you are the one true altruist.

Reminds me of one of my favorite poems:

By Racter, an obviously deterministic computer program.  But its point is

I just got a couple Fall 1969 copies of the Whole Earth Catalog.  I think
the following statement by Stuart Brand was in there from the first edition:

   PURPOSE

   We *are* as gods and might as well get good at it.  So far, remotely done
   power and glory--as via government, big business, formal education,
   church--has succeeded to the point where gross defects obscure actual
   gains.  In response to this dilemma and to these gains a realm of intimate,
   personal power is developing--power of the individual to conduct his own
   education, find his own inspiration, shape his own environment, and
   share his adventure with whoever is interested.  Tools that aid this
   process are sought and promoted by the WHOLE EARTH CATALOG.

The back cover has the word "FURTHER" in giant letters, streaking up and
away from the little photo of the Earth, and underneath the Earth in tiny
letters: "closer."

Funny, I just read these, but I had written the following for my diary
today:

steve-

your ego is your idea of yourself.
and while you want to leave your idea of yourself
subject to doubt and revision,
you still need to be as true to yourself--your actual self--
as you know how to be.
and your ego is your own judgement--so far--about that.

so the idea is not to fight or oppose or ignore or belittle the ego,
but to realize that it is an idea, a judgement, and that it's necessary.

you don't want to be ego-centric--enslaved to one of your own ideas,
but you do want to be self-centered--speaking and acting from your
own center as best you know how--and that know-how is your ego.

it is possible to be more true to yourself than you *know* how to
be, just because it's possible to have resources or luck that you
didn't know you had.  in fact it's possible to know *that*, to count
on it, make provision for it, choose it as a way of life--that is, to
incorporate knowlege of your ego's incompleteness into your ego.

but maybe what some people mean by ego is your self-image's tendency
to distort to serve *itself*.

 -steve

I follow Fritz Perls' line in most things, and he noted that your "self" is
just yourself.  You are your body, there is no "self" inside you.  But the
ego, in Perls' terms, is the aspect of you that is trying to determine
what's you and what's not-you.  Perls thought that most neuroses were
problems of incorrect identification, treating self as nonself or vice-
versa.  And he seemed both fascinated by "satori" (awakening) experiences,
and scornful of the idea of "oneness with everything."  I still worship the
guy but I think he was difficult sometimes.  I mean difficult to worship.
Maybe he was saying what I was saying (or vice-versa): that are you and
have to be you.

I hope I made clear the three levels I was talking about above:
actual self, idea/image of self, and the tendency of the idea to distort
so as to become entrenched.  Only the last one of the three is something to
work against.

Goeff notes:
>>Some religions claim that this [letting go of ego] is letting in "god".

Another way to look at it is to define "God" as all the stuff one's
ideas and habits of perception don't account for.  So to let go [of
preconceptions] is to "let [in] God."  I think a lot of what religions say
is useful--even vital--when you interpret it in that way.  Ideas and
habits have a tendency to close in on themselves tighter and tighter, and
it's important to have a compass that keeps pointing you in the opposite
direction.

Oh no, not this claim again.  What wages do dogs get paid?  Cows?

I sent this message to Alan Hale:

Subj:	Horror stories
Date:	97-04-10 23:31:38 EDT
From:	MESmith
To:	ahale@nmsu.edu

Dear Alan:

Although I meet your criteria for someone who you wanted to hear from, I’m
not sure that everything I’m going to say will conform to your expectations.

I definitely sympathize with much of what you are doing, particularly your
efforts to raise awareness of the harsh realities of the science job market.
Had the real situation been more widely known when I was younger, the process
I followed in seeking a career would have probably been much more efficient,
and I almost certainly would have ended my years studying physics after
getting my M.S.

As it was, I had been encouraged for all of my life to follow my love for
science to a career in it, and it was always implied that there were plenty
of jobs waiting for me if I did. So, I went on towards a Ph.D., a decision I
now feel wasted quite a few years of my life. The closer I got to a Ph.D.,
the more evidence I saw that the what I had been told concerning the
plenitude of science jobs was a myth, and that the reality was that there
were not nearly enough jobs to go around. Finally, in 1994, I decided to jump
ship, and gradually managed to parlay my computer skills into what has become
a fairly satisfying career in information technology.

I personally know people who haven’t been as lucky, and again, I sympathize.
However, I’m not sure precisely what sort of "drastic changes in the way
society approaches science" you could be proposing, or what exactly you
expect to result from meetings with government leaders.

The problem, in a nutshell, is that the supply of scientists (especially
physicists, astronomers, and chemists; certain fields have faired better) has
been growing much faster than the economy and the population. It is a matter
of supply-and-demand, exasperated by the sudden end of the Cold War and the
subsequent reduction in defense expenditures. It’s very sad, but I find it
hard to imagine our cash-strapped government doing much about it, or society
reacting positively to any assertion that people who want to be scientists
should be protected from the realities of life.

What could you say to a person who responded "I wanted to be a (fill in the
blank; actor, professional football player…) but eventually I realized that
it wasn’t likely to happen, and I moved on. That’s life."

Yes, I personally value scientific research more highly than theater or pro
football, but I also think that it is pointless to expect the government to
repeal the laws of the marketplace and somehow effectively employ all of our
would-be scientists. Rather, I think that the answer lies in people using
their scientific talents to help grow our economy and make our society more
efficient, so that ultimately we will live in a society that can afford to
fund more scientific research. After all, scientists have faired much worse
in the societies of the former Communist world, where the laws of the
marketplace were more blatantly ignored.

Sincerely,

Michael E. Smith

	Didn't Arthur C. Clark have "Enhanced Empathy" occur to the human race in
his "Childhoods End"?

	Since most religions are founded on the teachings of mystics, the
"exploitation" is understandable, especially when the original teacher
moves on and the control-oriented people take over.
	If the mystical experience is "part of our natural cognitive state", then
it would serve us to explore the experience more fully, would it not;
especially considering the obvious "reprogramming" that seems to occur with
most of those who report having the experience, including NDE?

	"Believe me, there is nothing like that experience;..."  ...Of course; but
that can be said of many expeiences, can it not?
	"...immensely powerful..."...When the need for power disappears, then all
power is realized, right?   Isn't the striving for power an indication of
fear and the need to control?
 

 but your so called 'mystics' have found meditation does it also. Also
exercise seems to help and mindless simple things like shaving...
driving....
This process helps with creativity also. 

	It appears that creativity can be accessed when one gets out of the
critical, judgemental state of mind.  This is referred to as "being in the
space".  This can be accomplished by remaining focused on "the point of
concentration".  The mindless activities, you mention, are ways of dropping
the critical, judgemental state of mind.and leaving oneself open to the
creative process.

	Since all humans have different values, world-views, etc. they would each

share the same world-view, would it?

	Have you studied anatomy and physiology yet?   The point being, that when
humans began making and using machines extensively, they had a mechanistic
view of the Universe, including bodies.  Now they appear to be doing the
same with the body, which has to be a gross over-simplification of this
very complex item.

concerning music's role in meme propagation,
it's effect on the evolution of societal values,
and it's possible transhuman uses.
Does any one have any suggestions I could use to get this interview?

I would probably ask first for his views concerning the coastal war that
is taking place in the hip-hop segment of the music industry, and then
this cultural message of Gangster Rap, has it raised the bar for white
middle class rebellion, so that unless you have an earring embedded in
you tongue you are not cool, and then get into transhumanism

I like this little probe.
Also find it interesting, for it suggests another way in which Cartesian
dualism has crept into our concepts of cognition. There seems to be a huge
misconception (especially in the AI community but everywhere ) that human
emotions are *separate* from cognition.


It should seem very obvious that human emotion is part and parcel of our
thinking processes. 
Focus changes the way in which we utilize this (sorry Lee, I tend to disagree
with Ayn Rand that high focus thinking is the only useful sort).  Using logic
and reason is only one element of our capacity to think, and it is for the
most part void of emotion.
It's values and virtues are magnificent, but limited and numb in their own
way.
There are lots of ways in which the mind uses higher emotions ( and perhaps
lower as well ) to display some of it's awesome powers - most noticeably in
the arts. 
Emotion, by providing great insight and intuitive flashes, and OF COURSE,
inspiration to continue,  makes for great thinkers in all aspects of
creativity.
And of course emotion is the thought process behind communication, empathy,
achievement, love, and other affect linked activities which make us human.
It is striking and revealing that Turing  made it quite clear that a machine
must not be "as smart as a human" in order to be considered intelligent, but
somehow must fool us into thinking it *IS* a human....
Whether or not I agree with this test as the final word in AI  is not
relevant, what remains is the paradigm that in order to simulate human
cognition, we think in terms of the whole spectrum of thought, not just
logic.

You have made good observation about the creative process. Nevertheless, 
I see no evidence  that these activities are specifically good for letting go
of critical thinking, which is another part of the creative process, and an
important one.
But they do occupy a portion of the mind's focus, and perhaps conversely
allow the mind to "unfocus" a little. This could cause the mind to relax,
slip into reverie and intuition ( a state where the mind can unconsciously
choose from stacks of memories which are relevant to the problem, and bring
up the most appealing solution excatly *without* apparent thought on "the
point of concentration" or focus).

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

I just learned that the strong anti-quantitative stance in history
departments in the last two decades is largely a reaction to Fogel's
'74 book "Time on the cross; the economics of American Negro Slavery".
In this book, Fogel argued that his quantitative analysis suggested
that while slavery was bad for the slaves, it was not economically
"inefficient" (in the sense that there was another arrangment that
would have made everyone better off).  In general owners took care of
their property as one would a valuable machine, thought slaves were
worked harder than free men willingly would.  

This position outraged historians, who called Fogel an ultra
conservative and racist.  This though Fogel was an active member of
the communist party and was named one of the ten most dangerous
intellectuals during the 50s red scare.  Quantitiative analysis has
ever since been a no-no in history departments, who say the
"contingent" nature of history makes numerical comparisons
meaningless.

Fogel is on the U of Chicago econ faculty, and won the economics Nobel
prize on '93.

At the exi-bay meeting last night, it occurred to me that Robin
Hansen's idea for fixed-time debates could be adapted to a mailing
list like this to control list traffic and optimize quality of
postings.  It might require the involvement of some cypherpunks
to write parts of the software (depending on how strictly we want
to enforce the rules), so I would appreciate it if someone here
who is also involved with that community could forward this.

Robin's original idea was this: at the start of a multi-person
debate, issue each participant a fixed number of tokens.  A device
that beeps a certain number of times per minute (but not at fixed
intervals so it's unpredictable) is placed on the table.  Whoever
is talking when a beep is heard discards one of his tokens.  No
tokens, no talk.  But here's the catch: the tokens are fungible,
so that if you find someone interesting, or making your point
bettter than you would, you can toss him some of your tokens.  If
you want to talk more, you can beg tokens from others.  The total
time of the debate is fixed, but who talks most depends on who
the participants want to hear from most.

To adapt this to a mailing list, the moderator of the list maintains
a Chaumian digicash mint (here's where we need cypherpunks), in which
the digicoins are /posting rights/, and are similarly exchangeable.
If you're rich and don't have anything to say, email your coins to
someone you find interesting.  If you're poor and want to post, beg
for coins from others.  Or another possibility is to archive every
message sent, paid for or not, but only distribute the paid ones;
then anyone with more time who wanted to could browse the unpaid
archive and send mail to some poster saying "I liked this, and I'll
pay for you to post it to the main list."  That way we eliminate
begging by email, which might make some uncomfortable.  Posting to
the unpaid list is something like lobbying for a grant.

The details that need to be worked out are the specific method used
for distributing and cashing in the coins.  We might not even need
something as complex as digicash: just issue coins as serial numbers,
and tell people to put the number in brackets on line 1 of the post
to spend it.  The moderator might maintain a 'bot that issues the
coins randomly to list members at a given rate, and he can control
the rate to "inflate" the list if there's a good discussion going on,
or slow its growth during quiet periods to avoid accumulation.

The minimal setup is this: two distribution lists (paid and unpaid),
a robot at the list address that splits the messages and cashes the
the coins, a robot that issues the coins, two Web archives.  Perhaps
better is to have a robot actually keep track of all the coins and
who owns them, so that users won't lose them--that would require
them to go to a web page form to give a coin to another list member.
Perhaps some user software to simplify the process would be nice.

One problem I forsee: since the above assumes 1 coin=1 post, there
will be incentive to make long rambling single posts on multiple
topics, so we may have to either set a fixed limit, or pay per page,
or some other standard (but then quoting or attributing others costs
you, so would discourage that).

Any ideas how to fix those incentives, or other ideas?

Subject: A-10 Shot down by Air Force
Date: 10 Apr 1997 03:51:57 GMT
Organization: Arizona Desert

An A-10 pilot decides to fly to Colorado. With 4 500 lb bombs. Why?

The pilot was going to "take out" The Denver Federal Courthouse, and
Timothy McVeigh. However, the Air Force, to prevent such a renegade act,
shot him down.

The pilot, Button, was single. He was normally stationed in Texas, which is
very close to Oklahoma City, OK. Perhaps Lt. Button had a relation in the
Alfred Murro Federal Building (which was blown up by McVeigh last year) and
he is just now enacting his revenge. The Fed. Courthouse in Colorado has
been "hardened" from attack on or underground. But from the air? 

The A-10 flew almost a dirct route towards Vail. I doubt the pilot had the
necessary sectional charts with him for that portion of Denver, since his
OPS were supposed to be at the Goldwater Bombing Range near Gila Bend. In a
moment of silence, he aimed his plane in an approximate NNE direction and
set autopilot for the long haul.

Now consider that the airplane, flying at a decent altitude, was painting
radar screens all over the southwest! Especially since it did not have its
transponder or IFF equipment activated. Don't you think the ATCs at Sky
Harbor and Albuquerque were pulling their hair out with this craft?!?!
Especially since it was going way too fast for a civilian joy-pilot.
However, the Air Force has been rather silent about THEIR capability to
track! Luke AFB, Yuma MCAS, Davis-Montham AFB would have been tracking him
with their own powerful radars (plus any associated with bases in NewMexico
like Holloman or White Sands; Colorado; and Wyoming).

After about half an hour of flight, (which puts the A-10 in NE Arizona) the
Air Force finally figures out they have a renegade. Sure, they probably
tried to talk him down, but he is commited! They finally scramble either
F-15s, F-16s, or FB-111s from either Luke, or bases in Wyoming or Nebraska
to intercept. 

Now we know the pilot had to have been flying due to circling manuevers
outside of Vail. He was either getting his bearings for an attack run on
Denver (remember..it's after lunch recess at the Jury selection) or he is
aware of the interceptors, and is now defending himself through stealth
means (since he has no air-air capability).

All aircraft are outfitted with ELTs (Emergency Locator Transmitters) that
are quite capable of withstanding crashes, and activate during one emitting
a radio beacon that can be picked up by searchers or a satellite. If the
A-10 merely crashed, where is the ELT? The fighters shot down the A-10,
utilizing missiles to create a secondary explosion onboard the craft with
the 500 lb bombs. Even though the bombs may not have been "armed", they are
still packed with explosives!

This enormous explosion probably went unnoticed due to the unusual
snowstorm and terrain of the Rocky Mountains. If the wreckage is exentually
found, but scattered, then it was shot down. Localized wreckage will
indicate a mere collision mid-air with a mountain.

Why would the Air Force do such a thing? Consider the embarrassment! The
nation would be outraged, and the Air Force en masse would be grounded
pending hearings and investigations. Also the potential "cover-up" would
only involve a small group of pilots, controllers, and officers.

I'm under the impression that this has worn off somewhat, and now it's very
trendy to do stats work in history. It has a buzzword that I've forgotten.
Not uncontroversial yet, but trendy.

I like this idea.  It is worth trying; the main problem is getting
someone to implement it.  So one should strive for a plausible
*simple* design.

I don't think the quoting issue is a big problem; authors who don't
quote enough won't be understood, and authors don't like that.
Similarly while a per page or line charge might be best, a per post
charge seems workable and much simpler; overly long posts will not get
read.

A non crypto first implementation also seems fine.  Just go down the
subscriber list at some rate sending out random ASCII strings of
length 30, which people can forward to whomever they like.  The big
problem is not people stealing tokens from peeking at messages; it is
people creating new addresses to get more tokens.  So I suggest tokens
only go to subscribers who have posted to the list within the last
month (or three months?), with the first post per such period being
free.

Having tokens expire after some period might be more robust to dealing
with unknown accumlations of tokens.  Then it would be fine to have a
target number of posts per week, and use a one or two week moving
average of the recent posting rate to adjust the rate of token
distribution.

The token for a new post should probably go in a special header line.

Not much to us, but a lot to the cow.  It might object to being treated
as a *simple* machine, and prefer to be treated like a more complex
machine, like we human sentient beings treat each other.  If it doesn't
stand up for itself, and let us know this, and let us know that it isn't
going to put up with being mistreated, then it is, ipso facto, in the
position of a sentient being allowing itself to be enslaved.

It can be said of *every* experience, depending on the 'grain' of one's
experience.  But there are experiences and experiences, there are stars
and then there are STARS.

The dog barks, the flower grows.  Power is a natural expression - every
entity that exists is trying to "remake reality closer to the heart's
desire".  It simply canot be avoided.  From one point of view life is
just a game, with winners and losers.  If there is no game, then
everything is the same.  That is the desired goal for the suffering one,
but the sorted one realises that the intrinsic sameness of things is
boring, and magically creates goals, possibilities that call to be
realised, and that, when realised, will temporarily upset the 'balance',
whatever it was.  The Dance.

Agreed, but that has nothing to do with ego loss per se.  The Buddhists
distinguish between Shamatha, tranquility, lucidity, 'emptiness' in the
sense of silence, not much going on, on the one hand, and Vipashyana,
insight, 'getting it'.  The thing about the mystical is that it isn't
just a state of relative calm and peacefulness or just plain absence of
being bothered by thoughts or the ego, it is literally *seeing through*
the ego, seeing it for what it is, actually grasping as a fact that it
is empty of intrinsic identity, identifiability or reality.

Trouble is, then someone wrote 'Eliza' and we realised that many humans
weren't too smart to begin with.

IMHO near-death experiences are identical to Lilly/Leary/Wilson's
metaprogramming experiences; you just get there a different way. In either
case your brain is so far from its normal state that you have the
opportunity to program in significant changes on the way back to
'reality'.

Piffle...

When I was in the Army, a guy went nuts and took off with an armed 
M-1 Abrams tank.  He headed straight for the East German border.  A 
platoon of M-1s were scrambled to intercept him, with orders to shoot 
if he got within 50 meters of the border.  The MP's arrested him when he 
stopped at a gas station for cigarettes.

Not for a moment did anyone give a second thought to lighting him 
up, nor was there even the slightest hint that a cover up would be needed.  
Shooting to prevent the commision of a major felony was well within 
our rules of engagement.  The only difference is that an A-10 could 
do a *lot* more damage.

AFAIR around 1% of those who apply for astronaut posts are selected. A
large fraction of those who are bounced are bounced on medical grounds, so
if you can pass the medical your odds are probably closer to one in
thirty, and even better if you've also followed the advice in the Usenet
'how to become an astronaut' FAQ (e.g. get a pilot's license, practice
public speaking, work for NASA or a contractor, have a squeaky clean
lifestyle). You can also reapply every couple of years; most of the
astronauts I've met were selected on their second or third try. 

Actually the FAQ brings up an interesting point; the best way to get one
of these glamorous and unusual jobs would seem to involve finding out what
your potential employers are looking for and ensuring that you meet their
requirements. I think a lot of people who wouldn't, say, expect to be
hired as a programmer without no demonstrable programming ability think
that they can be hired as an astronaut without demonstrable astronaut
ability (not in the sense of having flown in space but, say, being able to
give pep talks to halls full of science students).

Uh, I don't think that means what you think it means... or at least that's

But if it's not just a machine, then what is it? I've met many people who
tell me 'But the brain isn't a computer', or 'But the body isn't a
machine', but none of them have ever been able to tell me what they are.
I'll accept that we might have 'souls' who sneak into our bodies through
quantum mechanical effects, but that seems to be the only other option.

Or Bach's comments on 'selfishness' in 'Illusions', or Leary's, or a lot

Which rather fits into the other threads about ambitions and gender roles.
Most of my friends from school seem to have wandered into random roles
outside of their choosing, because they simply didn't have a clue as to
what they really wanted from life. This seems to be a much greater danger
than setting out to do great things against all the odds.

Hmm... I'm not sure of what you're saying. Crowley knew an awful lot and
did an awful lot. His problem was expecting that people would admire him
for it. Well, that and wanting to be the Anti-Christ when he wasn't. Now
that's one ambition which probably should be stopped early on ;-).

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

Today I spent most of my time reading front to back Damien Broderick's
new novel _The_White_Abacus_. For those of you on the list who have not
read it, I recommend that you do so as one of your leisure priorities.
Here are my impressions.

I stopped into the Dartmouth Bookstore in Hanover today, and was
browsing the SF shelves when I spotted _The_White_Abacus_, a title I had
just read about from Damien's past posts to the list. Hey! A book by
someone I "know". For $12.95, it was pricey for a paperback, but hell,
what are freinds for. ;)

After purchasing the book along with this quarter's issue of 2600
magazine, _Time_Station_Paris_ by David Evans, and
_Partisan:_Hostile_Takeover_#2_ by S. Andrew Swann, I strolled up the
street to The Dirt Cowboy for a double latte, and sat down to read TWA. 

The first several pages went a bit slow as I shifted my perspective to
grow comfortable with the lingusitic conventions and slang of the
milieu. I didn't catch on to the parallels to Hamlet until the death of
the protagonists father, following which, the various character's
allegorical names helped me sort out the story based on the Shakespeare.
The one part I found I most enjoyed was that while Hamlet was a true
anti-hero, snatching defeat out of the jaws of victory, Damiens
protagonist, Telmah, is Hamlet's mirror more than in name.

At the same time, Damien weaves a future universe of very extropic
transhuman means, equal to that of Dan Simmon's Hyperion novels, though
in a thousand pages less. The pace more closely resembles that of
_Fall_of Hyperion_ in its suspense, rather than the plodding sloth of
_Hyperion_ that parallels _The_Canterbury_Tales. Brodericks
understanding of both physics and philosophy, their DMZ, and the facets
of the archetypal oedipal conflict make for  a seamless dialogue with
the reader.

One plot hole which was evident in my mind seems to be a false construct
to justify the existence of the authoritarian belter culture. The
belters still hang onto belief in the immortal soul (and base some
technology on the same) and refuse to use the hex teleportation gates
due to a beleif that their souls become separated from their bodies
through use of such technology. THus they are stuck using plain old
reaction propulsion technology, which limits them to the solar system,
while the hex civilization has spread across the galaxy. WHile this is a
necessary construct, it seems to me that the very physics that enable
hex technology also enable development of Alcubierre Warp technology, a
means of traveling at hyper-relativistic rates relative to non-local
space while remaining within the bounds of relativity. As such a
technology would not require a dissociation of body from "soul", as the
body remains corporate within the local frame of reference, the belter
society would thus not become insular and stunted as it is in TWA.

Beyond this, which I imagine would not be evident to any but a few
readers, I found the book so gripping and fun that I only stopped once,
in the middle, to travel back to Lebanon, where I finished the book over
lunch.

My only question left answered/unanswered is: Where are the
extraterrestrials in this galaxy?

You're probably right that a simpler non-crypto honor-system first
implementation would help prove the idea and find new bugs.  Here's
a specific proposal that I could implement in a few weeks, given
the cooperation of the server owners:

The existing lists stay as they are.  A new list, say "exi-paid" or
something like that, is created.  Everything posted to the new list,
paid or otherwise, is copied to the old list so the existing archive
becomes the complete open archive.  Some people may still want to
subscribe to that, or else just occasionally read it on the Web to
find things to spend their tokens on.

Tokens are simply 5- or 6-digit numbers (depending on traffic).  To
pay for a posting, the number is placed in the text of the message
in square brackets: [73567] anywhere in the post.  Shouldn't be a
problem for anyone with any mailer to do that.

The robot that recieves postings to exi-paid looks for the token,
matches it against its list of outstanding tokens, replaces the text
with [PAID] or something, removes that token from the outstanding
list, and forwards it to the archive and to the paid list.

A robot running daily or as a cron job on lucifer walks through the
subscriber list, and at each name tosses the dice to decide whether
to send that person a token (the probability is adjusted at will to
control traffic).  If it decides to send one, it generates a random
token different from any outstanding one, and then sends mail to the
person selected that looks something like:

    You have been issued the token [54637] for the discussion list
    exi-paid@extropians.org.  If you wish to post to that list,
    just include this number (along with the brackets) in some line
    of your post.  It can only be sent once, and will be retired
    when it is used.  If you want to give this token to someone
    else, just forward them this message or tell them the number.
    If you want this token to be reissued randomly, reply to this
    message and change the subject line to the word "REISSUE".
    See (some URL) for further details.

Note that even non-members can post if they get a token from
someone.  Those who are broke can post to the unpaid list a message
with a title beginning with "BEG: <subject>", trying to convince
others to fund them.

The token mint logs every issuance and every redemption, and maybe
produces statistics we can use to tune the process.  We may want to
expire very old ones, and perhaps notify people who were issued them
before we do.

Dear all,

A year or so ago, I maintained "A Fringe-Watchers Guide to High
Weirdness," a web site that was an annotated encyclopedia of links to
"fringe" sites and information. Categories included aliens, hidden
history, giant conspiracies, unorthodox science, contactees, and so on.
The site was immensely popular and generated a great deal of positive
attention. 

Then the server it was maintained on went away and the site disappeared.
Until now. 

At the urging of emailers and other interested bystanders, I have
uploaded the site at a new home:

http://www.sff.net/people/MBourne/Weirdness.htp

I will be working on it in the coming weeks, and at this time I can't
guarantee which of the hundreds of links are still active. But I will
edit as I go along and add new sites to replace those that have gone
away.

I'm open-minded about these topics, yet I know the site won't be for
everyone (a sense of humor is encouraged). Feel free to drop in and
browse. Keep checking back as the site develops and grows. It's meant to
be enjoyed.

Thanks,

Mark

It may not have been on this list, but I recall having a discussion 
on empathy.  At that time, I mentioned that in the relatively new 
areas of study involving emotional skills, psychological experiments 
have been conducted on children to determine how they develop empathy 
and how that development can become stunted.  Empathy is considered 
by psychologists and conflict resolution practitioneers to be a 
learned skill and as such, one's abilities can be enhanced in that 
area.  Conflict resolution trainings teach people methods of 
increasing the use of empathic skills in problematic situations, and 
this is done from the standpoint that much of what we consider 
'subconcious' is actually 'unconcious'.  I agree that there is a 
point at which our limbic systems take control, but an increased 
self-awareness can bring some of the process into our control.

As an example, I could use the people that make themselves known as 
'psychics'.  In actuality, according to the histories of the slavic 
peoples, gypsy fortunetellers could be considered the first 
therapists, because they had developed empathic skills to a degree that 
they could cloak them in mystic rigaromole and render sage advice to 
others.  Modern 'psychics' often play the same role, focusing their 
attention and acumen on perceiving what sort of state a person is in 
and then using that as a basis for making 'predictions' that are 
usually just commonsense advice.  In societies where psychiatry has 
not been widely accepted, astrologers and fortunetellers fulfill the 
roles of therapist and advisor.

I don't know if you got to read the last newsletter, but there will 
be some changes coming to this list soon that are the result of much 
discussion and thought about some recurrent problems.

While I agree with Robin on the base point that time has an economic 
value and that it represents a resource that must be carefully managed 
within a group, I fail to understand how rendering that into coinage of 
any sort will solve the problems that plague group discussions, 
because those problems usually stem from factors other than the amount 
of time someone speaks.  

>The total
>time of the debate is fixed, but who talks most depends on who
>the participants want to hear from most.

>From a design standpoint, for any facilitation process to be fully 
effective, it must make accomodations for what is known as 'minority' 
viewpoints, the word 'minority' referring both to the social standing 
of the speaker and the popularity of a viewpoint.  I could predict 
a situation in which a few people are highly 'paid' to silence someone 
else, akin to holding a filibuster.  Or a situation in which the 
economic incentive to garner more 'coins' leads to the development of 
opposing factions that stall collaborative discussion.  

Sin,

Kathryn Aegis








To adapt this to a mailing list, the moderator of the list maintains
a Chaumian digicash mint (here's where we need cypherpunks), in which
the digicoins are /posting rights/, and are similarly exchangeable.
If you're rich and don't have anything to say, email your coins to
someone you find interesting.  If you're poor and want to post, beg
for coins from others.  Or another possibility is to archive every
message sent, paid for or not, but only distribute the paid ones;
then anyone with more time who wanted to could browse the unpaid
archive and send mail to some poster saying "I liked this, and I'll
pay for you to post it to the main list."  That way we eliminate
begging by email, which might make some uncomfortable.  Posting to
the unpaid list is something like lobbying for a grant.

The details that need to be worked out are the specific method used
for distributing and cashing in the coins.  We might not even need
something as complex as digicash: just issue coins as serial numbers,
and tell people to put the number in brackets on line 1 of the post
to spend it.  The moderator might maintain a 'bot that issues the
coins randomly to list members at a given rate, and he can control
the rate to "inflate" the list if there's a good discussion going on,
or slow its growth during quiet periods to avoid accumulation.

The minimal setup is this: two distribution lists (paid and unpaid),
a robot at the list address that splits the messages and cashes the
the coins, a robot that issues the coins, two Web archives.  Perhaps
better is to have a robot actually keep track of all the coins and
who owns them, so that users won't lose them--that would require
them to go to a web page form to give a coin to another list member.
Perhaps some user software to simplify the process would be nice.

One problem I forsee: since the above assumes 1 coin=1 post, there
will be incentive to make long rambling single posts on multiple
topics, so we may have to either set a fixed limit, or pay per page,
or some other standard (but then quoting or attributing others costs
you, so would discourage that).

Any ideas how to fix those incentives, or other ideas?

The "Node Net" which is being designed by ExI will be a new venue for
posting and will, by its very nature, deal with problems of traffic.  It
will not replace the Extropians list, but when it is implemented, will
affect it.

If there's a specific claim in there, please name it.  I don't know
what problems you have in mind, so I can't solve them.  The fact
that reader attention is valuable and posting is free leads to an
obovious tragedy of the commons that the proposal helps solve.  If
you have other problems, be specific.

Read the specific proposal again: coins are issued to /all/ participants
regularly, and once spent, coins get reissued randomly.  The only way
someone can be "silenced" is by his own choice, and even then, his
comments appear on the unpaid list.  In fact, it is likely that some
people will refrain from making minor comments on the paid list so that
they can save up for those times when they really want to let fly.  But
that's exactly what we want--the paid list having the discussions the
authors found most important, and the unpaid list having everything else.

Any details/ETA?  My idea has some interesting features that I'd like
to try, but if ExI is doing something else, then I'll try them elsewhere.

Given my simplified version, there are some interesting side-effects:
first of all, one can take over an existing list without their consent,
lobbying for people to join your list simply as a filtering service
for the unpaid list.  Second, you can filter at multiple levels: posts
that pay 2 tokens get distributed to all, 1-token messages go to a
subset, and unpaid ones to the general list.  That way, each person
can decide what level he wants to read, and how important each post he
makes is.  Also, lists affiliated with a sponsoring organization (like
ExI) can have a backdoor for the organization's posts to always succeed.

Yes.  New ideas have a lousy track record, so only volunteers should
be subjected to them.  If however that many members of that list are
already experimenting with one or more other auxilliary lists, members
may not feel much like trying yet another concurrent experiment.  This
is a good reason for trying to coordinate with ExI plans regarding
other trial extropians lists, or for trying on another list.

The random element probably isn't needed, and would complicate
auditing.  Probably better to just randomly sort the list once and
then go down it in order each time.

Sounds like featuritis; keep it simple.

Certainly it is obvious that the subject is agreement 
but by the title I think it means 
the body of your message explains the concept of agreeing.
I would have no idea what you would be talking about 
if I did not read the body.
It was far too general.
It should have at least said "I agree with Mike's statement".
Then you would not have even had to say "I agree." in the body.

Rejecting immortality accepts death.
I want immortality with indefinite longevity.

but I will NOT let it kill.

 1) Formal complaints and administrative requests should be sent to:

	postmaster@extropy.org

 2a) Mail to the list should be sent to:

	extropians@extropy.org

 2b) The software that processes traffic on the list alters the mail headers
 so that all correctly working mail readers will automatically address
 replies BACK to the LIST. [reply-to: extropians@extropy.org]

 2c) If you want to reply to an individual poster you should manually address
 a reply. If the post does not have a signature line, viewing the message
 in a text editor should help you determine the sender's address.

 2d) It is strongly recommend but not required that all list members use a
 signature file containing their e-mail address.

 3) Due to the volume of list traffic please restrain yourself from over-
 quoting  previous posts -- just a couple of lines to re-cap for those  who 
 weren't paying attention is usually sufficient.

 4) The list is conceived as a forum for the exchange of new information
 and techniques, and not as a forum for debating the  basics. We do have
 our disagreements -- often quite lively ones -- but rarely about really
 basic issues. Arguments in favor of socialized medicine or dying a 
 natural death at age sixty are, judging by past experience, likely to be
 refuted, and finally ignored.

 5) Traffic on this mailing list can run quite high. We like to keep the 
 signal- to-noise ratio as high as we can, so please restrain the impulse
 to post "me-too" messages or ad hominem flames to the list at large.
 If you cannot resist engaging in such discourse, please do so
 in private e-mail.

 5b) Posts about the list, or its rules, should have the pre-fix "META:"
  We encourage the use of other prefixes indicating the content of a post.
 Examples include, PHIL:, MATH:, SCI:, CHAT:, etc.

 5c) Polls being submitted to list members will have the "POLL:"
 prefix.

 5d) Rules about fighting and insulting; fighting and insulting 
 are not allowed!

 5e) If someone starts a fight with you what should you do?; we have a
 private legal code set-up to handle such disputes which includes a
 judge (the List Administrator) and an adjudicator to handle appeals.

 If someone really annoys you, you can do any of the following:
 1) Nothing - give no response
 2) Respond OFF the list
 5) Make a formal complaint to me asking for a judgment against Person X

 5f) What if you just have to respond to "up hold your honor" or to set 
 the "facts/record straight," or to tell the entire list why you
 will not be speaking or reading posts or messages from the person who
 offended you?

 D O N ' T!

 we consider such responses flames in their own right and you would
 be taking the law into your own hands; you might also be censured or
 removed from the list.

Remember:
 Don't contribute to or continue a fight once one has started.
 doing so places you in violation of the list rules. That includes 
 meta communication, which includes posts with an angry tone, or voice.

 Help us help each other.
Transhumans, extropians, metamorphosists, and cryonicists unite!
I place my faith in life.
Any who place faith in same belief and practice as I 
support my cause and I should treat with respect and friendship.
I do not want to be unknown person posting messages!
Let us know who we are!
We probably do not know each other; that does not help us.
Tell me who you are; I want to know you.

 Let us know what you think should be done, what need be done.
What are your problems?.
Tell me what you want;
if I were your slave for life what would I do?
Help me help you.
Let us get organized to do more than talk, to control our lives.
Let us work together and cooperate.

 What are we doing?
I learn and teach; I want to learn what you want me to teach you.
What can we do?
I can be filled with doubt and not be able to answer this question, 
though there is no thing I can not do if I try hard enough.
What can we not do?
I can not be immortal yet and it makes me sad, afraid, and angry.
Let us learn how we could do it, then do it.

We need a plan;
if you listen to me I will give you one.
Follow me, 
you will be led;
Sit on your ass,
you will be dead.
You choose and you choose now!
If I get one person motivated and bring their brain to life 
we will be one step closer to our goals.

 WAKE up!
We are DYING!
Our DNA is being TORN APART by free radicals!
Bacteria, virus, and fungus are DEVOURING our cells!
We are eating TOXINS!
People are STARVING!
People are KILLING each other and themselves!
Natural DISASTER is known world-wide!

How much time is wasted? 
...too much; 
stop playing games and get serious;
this is our life we are talking about!
Am I ALONE trying to stop this?

What about other kinds of experiences that "wonderfully concentrate the
mind" - danger experiences, penniless experiences, etc., etc.?  I reckon
all such experiences are opportunities to some degree: one has a choice
at these junctures.  Either one tries one's strategy from the past (and
that* might* work just fine), or one could try a *new* strategy, jump
out of the system, so to speak.

c't, _the_ Kraut computer mag has initiated a PGP key certification
campaign, attempting to link the isolated web'o'trust chain mail
patches. Certification requires a face2face interaction. So far,
several 100 persons submitted their certification entries.

Certification Agencies (CAs) have begun operation as well.

It may be obvious to you, but it is not obvious to me.  Many of us on 
the Internet subscribe to ten or more lists and have learned to 
manage the postings quite effectively with our email software.  I 
don't believe in restricting bandwidth to any participant in any 
manner, because there is plenty of room for everyone and we all 
possess filters and delete keys.  I can zap fifteen posts or more at 
one keystroke if I want to, I don't grudge the ten seconds that takes 
to anyone.

>From my perspective, having to make an accounting of my resources 
every single time I post to a list renders that process more complex 
and timeconsuming.  It is clear to me that your goal is to limit the 
voices on this list, and I refuse to buy into that concept.  
To me, it is vitally important that persons be encouraged to post 
more than they do, because so many wonderful ideas and thoughts are 
not getting heard here.  

Sin,

Kathryn Aegis

Lilly suggests that the brain gets white noise and picks its own reality
out of the noise. But how do NDEs and OOBEs produce this noise?

Let's hope. These floppy slots are currently just ornamental, after all. 
Next to nothing fits on 'em anymore. Zipdrive would be floppy++, if only
media prices wouldn't be held up artificially.

Uh, caveat lector. (I fact I was :P~~~~~ , as well, I fervently wish this
stuff was already there. Chucks, even a vanila NIR LED as 4 MHz bandwidth,
plastic optofiber costs next to nothing, and even semiconductor lasers lie
in low $10 range. It's all a standard by fiat thing. Why can't we send old

    COLLEGEVILLE, Pa., April 9 /PRNewswire/ -- NanoSystems LLC today
announced
a three-year feasibility collaboration and license agreement with Warner-
Lambert Company (NYSE: WLA), to develop new pharmaceuticals through the
Parke-
Davis Research division of Warner-Lambert Company.  Under the terms of the
agreement, NanoSystems will apply its patented NanoCrystal(TM) drug
formulation technology to develop nanoparticle formulations of proprietary
Parke-Davis compounds for evaluation in preclinical and human clinical
studies.  In return, NanoSystems will receive R&D support, milestone
payments,
and royalties on sales of products incorporating NanoCrystal technology.
          "NanoSystems' NanoCrystal formulations provide a means for
improving
delivery efficiency and clinical performance of drugs with low solubility,"
said Larry A. Sternson, Ph.D., President and CEO of NanoSystems.  "The
partnership with Warner-Lambert Company will result in the application of
this
technology in support of discovery and development of new drugs that because
of the limited water solubility could not otherwise be developed."
          Fred Hershenson, Ph.D., Sr. Vice President of Technical Development
for
Parke-Davis Research says he expects the collaboration with NanoSystems "will
allow us to optimize formulations of poorly water soluble drugs to accelerate
their development and commercialization.  By utilizing this technology at
early stages of the R&D process, we anticipate that the efficiency and speed
of drug discovery will be significantly enhanced thereby reducing drug
development cycle times."
          Parke-Davis, a division of Warner-Lambert Company, is devoted to
discovering, developing, manufacturing and marketing quality pharmaceutical
products.  Its central research focus is on heart disease, diabetes,
infectious diseases, disorders of the central nervous system and women's
healthcare.  Warner-Lambert Company is a worldwide company employing
approximately 38,000 people, and along with Parke-Davis is headquartered in
Morris Plains, New Jersey.
          NanoSystems is applying its expertise in particulate/colloidal
systems to
improve drug delivery via a broad range of dosage forms and across all common
routes of administration.  NanoSystems is collaborating with a number of
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to develop improved formulations
of
both marketed products and new chemical entities.  To date, eight drugs
incorporating the Company's  technology have been tested in human clinical
trials.  The Company has over two dozen feasibility studies ongoing with
various clients.  In addition to Warner-Lambert, the Company has license
agreements with a number of pharmaceutical companies, including Merck & Co.,
Astra Draco AB, Mimetix Inc., and Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V., a subsidiary of
Johnson & Johnson.

what happens.  I agree with her that user-side filtering doesn't seem to
be used as much as it could be.

My own filtering is currently serving all of 6 people, but I realized
later that the service would probably be most useful to people who've
already unsubscribed from the list, a population I can't reach easily,
although I do have a few.  So tell your missing friends.

4-5 of the people receiving my list are ones who would be auto-selected
by my filter.  I'm not sure what that says.

I should have been more specific in my prior post.  What sent my 
attenae up was not the suggestion of adding another list, it is the 
generalized assumptions stated regarding access and participation.  
The post I read cast the issues into terms like 'control' and 
'limiting access' as if everyone agreed that these were paramount 
concerns.  Prior discussion that led to the development of the 'node' 
concept indicate that many list participants are interested in better 
management and encouragement of intellectual discussion.

"Nature uses only the longest threads to weave her patterns, so
each small piece of her fabric reveals the organization of the
entire tapestry."  Richard P. Feynman
\\//
Consider coming up to your car, and inserting your personal
key into the door lock. The induction loop around the keyhole
provides juice for the teensy transponder chip embedded within
the key. Talk to me. Interrogated by the lock, it quotes
chapter, and verse, and sets your seat's digital motorics
into motion, buzzing your seat to envelop your buttocks
optimally, targeting user-associated configuration space point
last remembered (and mind that the seat stops moving by time
your ass has made a 3pt touchdown, as everything else might
-- uh oh -- upset the customer). Thai-Ming.

Analogous thing happens when you start the engine. The key has
a Philips transponder, offering 128 Bytes of rw memory. After key
ID is written, this segment's write protection bit is turned on.
Irreversibly. Codes issued, icbms in transit, all fucked.

The key contains a key, a random token. Using a hardware random
(a free-running counter with a couple of extra mangling) a
new token in generated, and written into the transponder. Each
time you use your key, lest flash/E^2 oxide layer abandon ye.
If you want to start your car, and the token within the EWS and
the key won't match, the engine won't start. Awwww. The unit
knows a subspace of 10 keys, having inherited it from a central
dbase (so don't lose your keys too often, it might require a
visit at Joe's). And of course one can't read systems's memory
by diagnosis packets over the bus. Orelse this would be too simple.

This is not sf, btw. Just a high-end limousine extra.
Coming soon\\
to your Datsun. (Attention: here comes the sf part).

Consider implanting a bionert trasponder implant into your wrist. Not his
master's voice, his master's touch. TACK. Next, please. (Though you might
consider this to be large horned male bovine excrement, many members of
the abovementioned tribe already wear transponder emplants (and it even
were't the Greys)). 

Each device you own now knows you. Intimately. Either rendering
unauthorized use impossible (why not by void SYS_detonate()? (of
_course_ void. Which return value if there is nothing to return
to?)), or instantly coming up with your customized environment,
for multi-user devices. Useful, eh?

Then comes the guy with katana and a plastic sack, and you've
lost your keys. _And_ your arms. (Both, for the guy does not
know what your dominant arm is). Shit. Shit. Shit. And no clone
transplant insurance.

Hmm... How about a piezo crystal in the transponder? You tap the
code (which even generates piezojuice), and lock/unlock the
particular key(s) from a ring. (If you walk around with all your
keys armed, you certainly deserve what happens to you). Or consider
making a biosig fingerprint part of key. Retina, finger, voice,
mugshot.  "Kindly place your palm on the rectangular window,
gazetrack the 3cursor, and repeat after me: Betty Botter...
No, sorry, I _cannot_ let you drive your car. Your sonogram
says you are hoarse, and mass-spectro of your breath indicates
presence of ethanol breakdown metabolites. Residual alcohol
level estimate gained from your body mass (you gained weight
since yesterday, _again_) says your reaction latency to be
sufficiently inhibited to render you incapable for car driving.
Have a nice day."

(Of course there is torture. But there is no perfect security,
and one can always consider zeroing the flash by means an
biofeedback-learned EEG signal. Ok, this means one must render
your unconscious (by whatever means) asap, but there _is_ no
perfect security. Did I already say that?).

Oh, I don't know about "secret."  That's kind of a stretch.  Projects that

No one's said much about what the stuff might be, or when, besides
"soon", it might come out; and people are more likely to have other
ideas if they've been thinking about the problem of list quality, which
they would do less if some better solution to the perceived problem had
been implemented.  There was a substantial delay between Robin's urging
me to make my 'select' filter a public service and my doing so, partly
because I was anticipating action from other channels.  Eventually I
went ahead and did it.

I'm not trying to cut anyone in all this, but it's been a while.

What was the name you threw out, "NodeNet"?  I hope this isn't a
Web-based thing, at least not for interaction.  I've worked with a
complete Web-forum at Caltech, as well as things like Wired's Brain
Tennis, and consider Web posting and retrieval to be completely
inappropriate; it takes far too long and is too inconvenient when
compared with e-mail, particularly for high volumes.

Ah well, I can't really criticize something I don't know anything about,
can I?

I would like some ideas,discussion, and advice from fellow Extropians.  

I'm unemployed (whee!) and casually looking around for the next job.  I'd
like to get back into information retrieval, which was my guiding passion a
couple years ago, and I'd like to do something that has the biggest
possible impact.  What I don't know is what would be the coolest and most
extropy-enhancing form of information access to get involved with.

Let me give a few examples that I've thought of:
	* Help people finding the right product or service to buy.
	* Improve access to scientific information/studies
	* Combine information access with decision support tools
	* Improve tools for argumentation
	* Idea markets
	* Improve interfaces for today's consumer search services (conveniently,
I'm interviewing for a position at one of them)
	* Improve interfaces for high-end search engines (like Verity or Inktomi)

What else is out there that I haven't heard about?  Which of them is the
most leveraged way to increase the effectiveness of information?  What
problem is out there that just needs a bit of a push for a huge benefit?

Now, my skills are information and user interface design, design
management, and Web technologies.  I'm not much of a programmer, so going
for pure algorithm or engine design probably won't work for me.  But if you
tell me about any cool ideas or technologies, I'll try to figure out a way
to get involved.

Thanks!
Drea

On Thursday, April 10, 1997, I suggested:
When dealing with human health, moods and cognitive capacities, we are 
dealing with a VERY complex system that does not submit to simple 
mechanical measurements.

Lee Daniel Crocker responded:
<So complexity tells you that you should just give up?  Nonsense.  I 
do not concede for one moment that there exists anything I am not 
capable of measuring, testing, and understanding /eventually/.  It may 
be very difficult; we may not even know how to begin going about it 
yet.  But anything we experience is measurable, without exception, if 
we take sufficient care in the experiment.  Even if our experiments 
are sloppy and our conclusions vague, we're still better off than 
someone who doesn't even try.>

I said nothing about giving up.  I said /simple mechanical 
measurements/ were not very useful.  Lee described experiments he 
performed to test the efficacy of melatonin and aspirin.  The aspirin 
vs. acetaminophen experiment, in particular, seems similar to what I 
would do when trying to evaluate some new supplement or nootropic 
substance.

I think the following is relevant to the types of measurement problems 
I had in mind:
<It is important to emphasize this epistemic necessity of the 
complementarity of laws and measurements since it is often ignored. 
Reductionists try to avoid the epistemic cut and take an entirely 
objective, unified, or reified view of information as if it exists in 
the structures of the physical world independent of an organism or 
observer. Such a view is possible only because formal or structural 
information measures can, in fact, be applied to any physical 
structure without regard to its epistemic function in construction, 
measurement, prediction, or control. That is, structural information 
measures need have no relation to fitness, function, or meaning. This 
gratuitous use of structural information measures, while it may be 
made formally consistent with physical theory, simply has no 
significance for the naturally selected semantic information in 
biological systems and for predictive information used in control 
systems. >

The above is from a paper by Professor Howard Pattee called "The 
Physics of Symbols and the Evolution of Semiotic Controls" that was 
presented to a Workshop on Control Mechanisms for Complex Systems at 
the Santa Fe Institute last December.  It can be accessed at
http://ssie.binghamton.edu/people/pattee_docs/semiotic.html

The abstract of Pattee's paper is also worth quoting:
<Physical laws and semiotic controls require disjoint, complementary 
modes of conceptualization and description. Laws are global and 
inexorable. Controls are local and conditional. Life originated with 
semiotic controls. Semiotic controls require measurement, memory, and 
selection, none of which are functionally describable by physical laws 
that, unlike semiotic systems, are based on energy, time, and rates of 
change. However, they are structurally describable in the language of 
physics in terms of nonintegrable constraints, energy degenerate 
states, temporal incoherence, and irreversible dissipative events. A 
fundamental issue in physics, biology, and cognitive science is where 
to draw the necessary epistemic cut between the coherent physical 
dynamics and its rate-independent semiotic description.>

sure this is true of all transhumanists), the different lists are
appropriate because of differences in emphasis and personal priorities.
Often, those dedicated to one list (and consequent activities) will be
quite determined that those dedicated to the other list (and its
activities) are sadly misguided, at best, in their piorities. Usually,
those active on the lists are very inactive about actually *doing*
something which will increase the chance of the list's ostensible
purpose being fulfilled. ie. the *real and effective* purpose of the
list is to *talk* about (and therefore *appear* active) and to *evade*
the fact that one is not actually *doing* anything *effective* about
that which one is professing to devoutly desire.

>I place my faith in life.

I place any faith that I allow myself, in *myself and others* who are
*doing* all that we reasonably can to give everyone a reasonable chance
to stay alive.

>Any who place faith in same belief and practice as
>I support my cause and I should treat with respect and friendship.

Not if their similarities in personal philosophy are restricted to just
wanting to continue to stay alive indefinitely. Respect for that desire,
yes, but unfortunately, some with that desire may be so antithetical to
ones other major philsophical viewpoints that one cannot possibly call
them friends.
 
>I do not want to be unknown person posting messages!
>Let us know who we are!
>We probably do not know each other; that does not help us.
>Tell me who you are; I want to know you.

First, it is doubtful that one person can ever truly *know* another. We
have enough trouble knowing *ourselves*.

Second, message correspondence *is* a reasonably effective first step in
getting to know someone. Live and dynamic phone conversations would be
next. In person discussions and *doing* things together are best of all.

Finally, getting to know someone better can actually have a negative
effect. I may be much more able to be respectful and cooperative with
someone, it I *don't* know that their personal philosophy is in such
conflict with mine.

> Let us know what you think should be done, what need be done.
>What are your problems?.

I think that most people *are* doing this in the messages that they
post. For me, it means giving all your time and money that is not
absolutely necessary for your current life extension program towards
research to perfect suspended animation. This is my first priority
simply because I believe that it has a better time-to-achievement vs
cost relationship than any other potentially life-span extending
research (including, anti-aging/rejuvenation, nanotechnology, uploading,
etc). It should be the fail-safe/backup (to avoid *death* - the end of
any possible life) to these other methods which will be needed to allow
*continued* life. *After* the fail-safe/backup is *effectively*
in-place, it will be time to put all ones efforts toward solving the
fundamental problems of continued life.

>Tell me what you want;
>if I were your slave for life what would I do?

I have no need or desire for slaves. As a slave, you would not be fully
*alive*. I desire *life* in myself and others. Therefore, I would rebuke
your efforts and ask you to set yourself *free*.

>Help me help you.

You can help me best, by becoming convinced of my priorities and doing,
in your own best way, whatever you can to further them as a free person
and an associate.

>Let us get organized to do more than talk, to control our lives.
>Let us work together and cooperate.

In the ways described above, I totally agree.

>What are we doing?
>I learn and teach; I want to learn what you want me to teach you.

Sorry, but most of the knowledge I desire cannot be *taught*. It can
only be *learned*. It will not help *me* much if *you* learn it.

>What can we do?
>I can be filled with doubt and not be able to answer this question, 

It is sincere and inspiring that you admit it. Many do not.

>though there is no thing I can not do if I try hard enough.

I used to think the same thing. Unfortunately, will-power and
determination are not enough. If a large number of us couple "try hard
enough" with all our other positive attributes, we may yet succeed in
vastly extending our lives. Anything less is likely to fail.

>What can we not do?
>I can not be immortal yet and it makes me sad, afraid, and angry.

Well spoken! Just don't get so "sad, afraid, and angry" that these
negative emotions cause you to be impotent about finding a solution as
is the case for so many.

>Let us learn how we could do it, then do it.

By all means, yes!

>We need a plan;
>if you listen to me I will give you one.
>Follow me, 
>you will be led;
>Sit on your ass,
>you will be dead.
>You choose and you choose now!

This sounds too much like the "come-on" of a guru/cult-leader for my
taste.

>If I get one person motivated and bring their brain to life 
>we will be one step closer to our goals.

True if their brain is not already alive. However, this might be taken
as an insult to many of us whose brains *are* alive and who have been
"trying hard" for many more years than you have.

>WAKE up!
>We are DYING!
>Our DNA is being TORN APART by free radicals!
>Bacteria, virus, and fungus are DEVOURING our cells!
>We are eating TOXINS!
>People are STARVING!
>People are KILLING each other and themselves!

All very true and very sad. And something that every one on these lists
knows.

>How much time is wasted? 
>...too much; 
>stop playing games and get serious;
>this is our life we are talking about!
>Am I ALONE trying to stop this?
>HELP ME HELP YOU!

No, you are not alone. I and a few others are "trying our hardest" and
being as effective as we can. In my view, your exhortation is
appropriate and reasonable, although, when I did less than this at the
beginning of the Prometheus Project, I was roundly criticised for
insulting people and questioning their motives and priorities.

I was in dictionary mode - nothing so vulgar as *data* or *facts*.

I would guess that the impact of poststructuralism does still shape
humanities' depts.  One of the routine put-downs I repeatedly heard around
the literature end of the academy, blood-curdling and chilling, was:`mere
empiricism'.  Yeah, right, I'd say, I'm troubling your doctrine with facts
(yetch)... so sorry.  But `facts' are just culturally-bound
interpretations, I'd be told.  In such a climate, I don't imagine
cliometrics would do very well.  On the other hand, poststruck doctrine
seems to be increasingly on the nose, so the tide might be about to turn.
(And the new models emerging from complexity theory are likely to attract
interest back to *measurement*, aren't they?  Or will that be just a new
scholasticism as well?)

Your right, no one did, and this is a good point.  It should be started by
the end of the summer, before or directly after EXTRO-3.  Node Net is an
idea created by Greg Burch, the full name is "Scientific Technical and
Professional Special Interest Groups", or "STP-SIGS."  It was explained in
the most recent newsletter.

If everyone ate controlled calorie restricted diets

free radicals, toxins, and starvation,
as well as living longer.

1. In this modern era of neural networks and genetic algorithms, it is
quite possible for a computer program to develop abilities the
programmer never thought of.

Searlesiously, now, folks, is there a Zombie in your computer's Chinese
Room??

Emotions are signals which have evolved prior to the development of
language. Biology works by modifying and adding capabilities, so we have
both language and emotion. If the computer mentioned above had a
convincingly detailed avatar, I would experience it as an entity
expressing emotion if I were visiting it via a suitable VR. I don't know
if you have or experience qualia, but my experience is that you say
so....

I used to wonder why many nerds seemed to be so socially and emotionally
inept. IMHO, for the usual factors, some of us are better at and more
rewarded for social skills and others of us are better at technical
skills. In many ways the technical skills are simpler in that it is
easier to get replicable results with things than with people. I began
as a very emotionally inept nerdic type, and over the years acquired
some social skills, and a very much better appreciation and knowledge of
emotion and the types of signals emotions indicate. I do often wonder
if, say, a good mentor had appeared in my undergraduate days, I would be
a physics nerd today.....

And, just as a >H thought, perhaps there are other signaling complexes
yet to evolve as we become more able to manipulate our structures for
experience...

Yes, of course there are games without winners or losers, but there are
games with winners and losers too, and those are quite legitimate as
games too.  My point is that there is nothing intrinsically spiritually dodgy
about winning/losing scenarios.

I have the impression that many NDEs are rather extreme brain-states, the 
brain is very active and far from the normal attractors. When the neurons 
start getting into trouble due to ischemia, hypoxia or poisons they don't 
go quietly, they start firing and releasing neurotransmittors like mad; I 
have seen some microdialysis curves from dying brains, and they are a 
chemical circus (interesting enough they suggests that glutamate may not 
be the main culprit of brain death, or that it is just a local factor). 
So there is definitely enough noise in such states to trigger interesting 
experiences (especially if the temporal lobe is involved).

OOBE's are different, at least in the beginning "looking down on my body" 
stage (after that they can move towards the NDE stage). My personal theory
is that they are a form of dissociative reaction that we subconsciously
create to avoid pain or confusion, a kind of temporary MPD where the ego
is cut loose from the rest of the mind which is very busy.  They can be
triggered through training and suggestion, although I suspect that there
is no firm border between them and hypnosis, visualisation and (lucid)
dreaming. A wild guess would be that they involve the parietal lobe.

I recently pulled out some of my personal notebooks from years gone by.
I am surprised to find my 'religious' views have changed little over the
years.  The only caveat to this is that I am now (almost) certain God
doesn't exist as I was brainwashed to believe 'He' did.

I suddenly realise that throughout my life I have never equated religion
with a concept of god(s).  Religion is a system of beliefs.  The concept
of god is a power ploy for control over the believers.  I do not suppose
we will ever know for sure but the 'god' concept is probably the origin
of government.

This idea brings up whether the concept of 'democracy' or 'communism' is
a religion.  It seems ALL religions involving 'supreme beings' attempt
to convert by intimidation (Believe THIS or you are WRONG!).  These
practices always seem to slowly develop more and more control over the
organization.  I'll pick on the christian religion for starters:

Originally started as a splinter group breaking away from the prevailing
power elite.
Simple 'rules' (the Ten Commandments)
Open to everyone
Just 'believe' and you're in

Then

You can't do that and be a true believer!
Ceremonies and rituals developed (to distinguish the true followers?)
Power struggles, rewriting of it's history and bylaws.
The church at Rome became the universal (catholic) voice of truth for
ALL.
Persecution of non-believers.

Then it got worse.

You HAD to be 'blessed' by the leaders to even be involved in
non-religious activities (such as running your own slice of the world)
You couldn't explore new areas of endeavor (spiritual or otherwise)
unless in doing so you advanced the religion.
You got killed for not believing, whether you were guilty or not
(Inquisition)
Turn emotions against logic, if you make it illegal to question, all the
masses have left is emotion.

Then...

A splinter group broke away from the power elite, refuting many of the
demands of the established organization.  Unfortunately, the above
scenario happened all over again.

Government has many parallels.

Break away from the existing power with fewer laws and more freedom.
Everyone has a voice.
Powerstruggle ensues.
Vote for an accepted 'believer' who will then 'have your voice'.
You can't do THAT and be a good citizen!
Persecution of those who speak out against the state.
Appealing to emotion.
Ad infinitum.

"A rose by any name would smell as sweet."
"Religion is the opiate of the masses."
"When the state does something 'for your own good', be frightened."

My questions are:  Will we ever be rid of 'religion'?  Should even try?
Is the cycle unbreakable?

Yes, but they're not at the same level. You certainly can reprogram
yourself by choosing different paths in these cases, but a true
metaprogramming experience seems to leave everything open to change. It's
like installing a new operating system rather than just changing a few
lines of code.

I'm not sure what you mean by white noise. Do you mean that there's
nothing external at all, just noise? I think that the 'clear light' which
both groups (and the Buddhists) talk about is (in some sense) the universe
seen by the brain without its filters. In both cases the filters have
broken down and to get back you must choose a set of filters to use. You
can either keep the old ones or pick a new set.

Serves ESCOM right. When I bought my laptop from them I had to wait six
weeks for them to get one which worked, then take it back for a
replacement because they left off the CPU heatsink and it continually
overheated, and they told me they'd have some more RAM for me a couple of
weeks after I bought it. Nine months later I finally found a RAM card for
it in Taipei...

Why not? Sounds like a good price to me; just delete NT and install Linux

Bad, bad, bad. I don't want my browser downloading pages which I didn't
choose to look at, because I don't want to end up in access logs unless I
have to. I get more than enough junk mail as it is. And just think of the
problems if someone links from a popular page to a legal Dutch porn site
with images which would count as 'child porn' in America, or to an
American crypto ftp site. People looking at those pages would be breaking
the law purely by accident as their browsers go off and download the 
illegal data for them.

install on trains. Presumably if you could afford to use 40 GSM channels

Do color films use silver? Anyway, we have a long way to go before film
becomes obsolete; my $700 35mm camera gives about five times the linear
resolution (twenty-five times as many 'pixels') of any similar priced
digital camera. So digital is great for snapshots and advertising photos
with a short turnaround time (e.g. real estate agents, used car ads), but
at the moment it's lousy for real photography.

Coordinating between NodeNet and pay-for-merit may be difficult as there is
a difference in philosophy. NodeNet involves central planning whereas the
other is market-based.

One common point to both of these schemes is that they rely on some measure
of majority opinion of worth. Ideally we would each filter on our own
measures of worth, as with Sasha's document rating proposal (not
coincidentally related to his work at Firefly on rating movies, web sites,
and now books). Combining document rating with a payment scheme (as I
suggested some time ago) might be the best solution, as you get both
measures of both similarity and worth.

In brief, an author says what a message costs (or a subscription to her
messages): one-liners may be free, substantive postings 5 coins, essays 10
coins, whatever. The author is charged a fee by length of post. Readers rate
the message on what they think it is worth. As with Firefly your ratings are
compared to others, and the system recommends messages to you. You can then
pay the author the fee to read the message, and subsequently rate it (if it
wasn't worth the entrance fee, too bad).

Well, the goal is cramming movies (while still recognizable as such) in
smallest store possible. (Hint: compression ratio rules). Quality? What
for? Besides, IFS/ANN compression should beat MPEG (or wavelets, or...) by
orders over orders. Asymmetrical, of course. Crunching offline, 
expanding online.

Personally, I think the "Amiga(tm)" is cursed. So don't buy it, ever.
(Particularly, if approached in the street. Hey mo, Amiga Inc., just $50. 
Deal?).

Linux/AXP sucks still (as does any nonIneptlian Linux, according to last 
tests). And gcc takes eternities to run on the Alpha, and produces pure-d 
bagbiter code. You care for Alpha assembler? (It's sure smooth and mellow, 
but it's assembler still).

Junk mail poses a sufficient problem on its own, it will be dealt with 
by a mechanism, shortly. Authentication by crypto protocol, I guess. Nothing 
less will serve. No more regurgitated spam, no, thanks. (Boy, I am 
looking forward to these times).

Well, I tend to just ignore insane legislation. What, a law preventing me
from clicking on that link? Bull. I can click whatever thing I like. And
the day they outlaw PGP will be the day I'll have my key certified. I
won't even bother with steganography. Waaay too sublime.

Fuck the law, then. Let that be problem of the Chinese (those behind the

I was thinking of something way beyond GSM. Smaller cells, shorter
wavelengths, higher bandwidth. Let's say, 10 MBit/s celllink. SF?

Ludicrous. Just 40 channels, eh?

Yes. I guess Ag (current price trend extrapolated) might find a niche in
AC motor windings, though. Kinda better than copper (slightly). Ah, and 
silverware cutlery. It's traditional.

Just now, yes. But a) not everybody is a pro b) CCD resolution will go up 
in near future c) image processing and archival is a lot easier if no 
scan necessary

Personally, I don't care for high quality. I'd like the stuff I pictured
to be recognizable, and dbaseable. Being able to send the pic over
celllink is quite valuable for certain clientele. Silver hog photography
will still have its niche in the high-end, for a long time, sure.

I think the question is whether digital photography is suitable for the mass 
market. What's "real"? Picturing babies, animals, landscapes, and cars. I 
guess it qualifies, already. (Lookit! That's Marge on ole TV!).

	Good, because in this game you have just lost!

	Why bring up the legitimatcy of finite games?

	Who cares about spiritual dodginess?   

	How did you react after reading the first sentence?

	What does that reaction tell you about yourself?

The big use coming up for silver is in any superconductor wire
application. They are using silver as a sheathing substance for brittle
superconductor in making flexible, rugged superC wires.

Greg is still functioning under the delusion that he was born with an

This URL-minder service I mentioned a few weeks ago provides a form of
"push" technology which notifies you of changes in web pages you have
selected.  I see on looking at Robin's page that he is going to be at
Berkeley starting this summer as a "Scholar in Health Policy".  (Apologies
if this is old news, or if I am announcing it prematurely.)

This program is a multi-disciplinary effort to analyze health policy
using economics, political science, and sociology.  From their web page:

> Economists may help by examining the merits of market-based competition
> versus regulatory approaches, by analyzing the effects of organizational
> changes on the cost of care and on the willingness of competing
> organizations to serve diverse population groups, and by assessing the
> effects of continued growth in health spending on federal and state
> budgets as well as on other sectors of the nation's economy.

This sounds like exactly the kind of study which can benefit from the
kind of hard-nosed, critical analysis that Robin is known for, as well
as his creative, decentralized solutions to difficult problems.  I hope
they know what they are getting into bringing him on board...

Only 12 people are selected each year for this program, and although I
am not familiar with the post-doc job market, the stipend looks generous,
and the freedom from teaching and administrative responsibilities sounds
like an ideal research environment.

Clearly health care policy is going to be of increasing importance in
the next few years, with the ongoing advances in research results that
we all expect.  Congratulations to Robin on being selected for this
position!

Hal

Such softies mock empirical methods cause they are too lazy to do the

Ich bedaure aber ich kann kaum darüber lachen, denn so es ein Übel
scheint, so sei es notwendig - bis jetzt bin ich mir nur als
Freeware-Tester vorgekommen - gearbeitet habe ich jedoch bisland nur mit
gut erprobten, stabilen und in jeder Hinsicht anständigen Progranmmen -
worunter ich Linux und Freeware - Konsorten auf jeden Fall nicht rechnen
würde - da arbeitet man zwei Tage an der Installation der neuesten
Release und dann: Man wählt ein entspannendes Spiel - Sokoban - und
kommt sich vor wie vor der Jahrhundertwende, ein lächerliches Spiel im
Design der erten Pc - Generation in einer für Pentium-Maschinen
optimierten Linux-Release - absolut lächerlich, wie der ganze
LINUX-SCHROTT - ein alternder Dandy in einer eisernen und verrosteten
Rüstung - soweit meine Meinung über diverse Alternativen, bis mich
jemand überzeugend und vorallendingen praktisch vom Gegenteil überzeugt.

I subscribe to 30, and get about 2MB of mail a day.  I've learned
to use my software, and to judge in a second or two whether a post
might be worth reading.  But I still value my time, and I believe
that a two-tiered system like that I have proposed, with an open
list and a self-limited paid list, would increase my ability to
find interesting things, because I would be less inclined to skip
postings on the paid list.  If I knew somebody thought it was
important enough to pay for, I'd be inclined to spend more than
a second or two to find out why, whereas on an open list I have
less patience for anything I don't see an immediate benefit to.

I am glad you are generous with your time, and will give anyone
those ten seconds of attention.  But /my/ time is not yours to
spend, and it is clear to me from talking with others that they
value their time as well, and want to make it more productive.

You seem to be under the impression that bandwidth-limiting by
self-restraint is a kind of control.  Nonsense.  The proposal I
have made is entirely voluntary and unmoderated.  It is a way
for list participants to voluntarily select those things that
might be more valuable for them to spend their time on.  If you
want to listen to the unpaid list, no one will stop you.

That is a slanderous and baseless accusation.  You don't have a clue
who I am; that I don't have any personal killfiles, that I have
lobbied against the moderation of Usenet groups; that I have fought
against all legislation of email.  Yet you accuse me of wanting to
limit the voices on the list when I propose a system that anyone
with two working brain cells can see isn't capable of that.  Thank
you, at least, for giving me information with which I can evaluate
the likely intellectual merit and honesty of your future posts.

In my two-tiered proposal (did you even read it or are you just
reacting to your personal guess about my motives?) I suspect that
newcomers will be /more/ likely to post to the general list than
they are now, if they know that it is encouraged, and that there
is not even the existing social pressure against it.  I know I
have restrained myself from sending some messages for fear of
generating too much traffic that I would gladly post to the unpaid
list if I were assured that I would not burden those uninterested.

We both respect the ideas of others, and we both want them posted
and discussed.  I also respect their /time/, and do not wish to
impose a single Procrustean bed of rules on participants, but offer
them a choice.

Mike, 

Thank you for your motivating message.  

I would like help in promoting legislative support for anti-aging 
research. We are learning grass roots techniques in influencing 
legislation. We need realistic goals that would be accepted by decision 
makers.  Letters and phone calls to legislators get results if we know 
what issues to promote and have credible information to educate them.

Don

Yes, I see what you mean.  But is such deep OS level stuff really what
we mean by 'self', in preference to the day to day stuff?  Or isn't it
both, the self being more a process of identification than a product:-
sometimes I might identify myself with the 'unconscious', sometimes with
some utterly trivial daily decision.

What if what Buddhists call 'clear light' is what Lilly and other
scientists would call 'noise': i.e. the thing or experience is the same,
but looked at from different perspectives?

Is the clear light experience perhaps just experiencing noise *as* noise,
rather than giving in to the habit of trying to find a signal?

Excuse me, before we go any further, can I just make a reality check: do
you have a point or are you just rambling?  (I've been under the
impression that you were making a point; it's ok if you're rambling, but
that would require a different kind of response.  Also, do you think
it's possible that you might be being a wee bit pretentious?)

Other people gave some excellent responses.

Mike Rose writes again:

WoW! You guys really know your brain stuff. I seem way out of my depth at
the moment but I am really keen on learning more. Can any1 suggest any
preliminary texts on brain function and basic neurology? Where should I
start? I am currently reading Lilly's 'Centre of the Cyclone' and I guess
I will read 'Programming and Meta-Programming....' next - any other
suggestions?

Please bear in mind that I am only a journalism student with training in
humanities and not science.

Lilly talks a lot about NDEs and replicating various states with LSD and
hypnosis, isolation etc. etc.

The question is what has happened since the 70s, is anyone else doing any
similar meta-programming research?

        The following poem just got rave reviews by my friend Wade
Cherrington today.  I'd like to hear what others think...



Delusions Of Grandeur


Welcome to the afterlife: a place of false surreality,
Where window-paine Charlemagnes bask in superficiality.
Meet the men who would live your life, the men who want to sell your soul,
The men of mercy, the men of faith, the men who just want control.
Welcome to your private Hell, reminding you of the thoughts unmade,
The heart of virtue, the core of fear where you take a promenade.
The idleness of vanity will lead to cold insanity,
A picture of confidence for the goodness of humanity.
Meet the men who would steal your faith and make you a catastrophe,
The men who'd love to suck you dry and watch the coming atrophy.
Welcome to the place where you give up and give in to disrespect,
A world where you must earn your pain and circumstantial retrospect.
Meet the men who would take your heart and drain it of the blood it wields,
The men who abhor reason and the concept the ideal yields.
Meet the one who would flush his world because he could not dare be true,
Welcome to the afterlife: the previous life is overdue.

know who they are, what is happing to them.
Let conversation be fun, and to the point.
Do NOT send a novel unless they ask,
offer to explain more.
Decorate letters for attention; 
be noticed.
Relate suggestions to their past ideas.
Let them know you share views.
Be their new best friend; 
do NOT seem obsessive.

I don't know, is a game or filter the same thing as a lie?
Aren't they really just choices, like choosing which city to live in?
I mean, do you believe there is a more real reality behind these things
that they're covering up?  Or is this choice of games just the way it is?

I had two separate depressed years where it seemed existence was
baseless and there was no reason to go on.  Also a pretty long period
where I felt I just didn't *want* anything.  The thing that helped me
was realizing that I sure didn't *want* to feel depressed, I didn't
*want* life to be empty, etc.

For instance, you talk about lack of progress as a problem.  maybe you want
"progress."  Or, maybe not, when you look at it.  But if that sounds
bad, it means that there is some "good" way you wish things were.  Also
you talk about tolerance as a good thing.  Or maybe you're overdoing
tolerance!

Anyway it worked for me.  At least started me moving.

Solipsism may be uncomfortable to accept, but it seems to me that 
it's the closest thing I've seen to an absolute truth.  That isn't as 
self contradictory as it may sound.  Solipsism doesn't preclude the 
existence of absolute truth, but only absolute knowlege of the truth.

Living with that philosophy is not what a "believer" might expect.
Severing all dependence on outside definitions of "meaning" allows
life to have whatever meaning we choose to give it.  Which, if we
choose, can go far beyond any "canned" sense of meaning that might
come from one of the ready-made paths to enlightenment that religion
may offer.  Beauty can exist wherever we choose to see it.  Hardly
the bland, nihilistic world that some might mislead you to expect.

As for how one progresses without a foundation of faith, it isn't so
difficult really.  We decide what seems most likely to be true, and

B" can improve the odds, but the B plan can be as disfunctional as
the A plan.  We place our bets, and we take our chances.  Those with
a "solid" foundation of belief may perceive life as something other
than this, but they're rolling their dice just like the rest of us.

I think anyone who puts any thought at all into the nature of reality and
epistemology will go through some dark nihilistic stage... angst, I
guess.  I know I did.  Realizing the fact that this is an angst suffered
by basically anyone who has thought about life is not so commonplace.  I
would have appreciated a teacher telling me that philisophical angst was
normal back in high school.  I don't think getting over this angst
necessarily means forming some new philosophy that claims to find the
"truth", it simply requires that you except that no knowledge is sacred or
a foundation except for the existence of self.  It can be a comforting
thought when you think of how much bullshit there is in the memes sent to
you every day by the media.  It's nice to know that everyone could be
"wrong," that it all could be a big dream... I find that more comforting
than the "truth" some religions will sell me. 

Re: progress....  

	I think you are measuring progress using the religious sense of
the word, that we are finding more and more "truth" and this will somehow
allow us to understand the universe in some divine way.  I see progress as
the increase of *useable* information, and I don't see why there needs to
be truth except for those who don't have the strength to exist with
criticizable, temporary beliefs.  In science, there are models to explain
phenomena, but no one claims that those models are a direct
representation of reality, they are simply a tool that we find useful in
analyzing and using the workings of the universe.  They are an
approximation, and sometimes a very bad one.  I see no problem with this,
science is not a religion, it is not about beliefs, science is simply a
tool.

Well, there are plenty of books about the brain and neurology, but it is
hard to tell which would fit you the best. The "bible", at least here at
Sans and the Karolinska Institute, is Kandel, Schwartz et al. _Principles
of Neuroscience_. It contains almost everything (the drawback is of course
that it contains almost everything, and hence weighs around four
kilograms). There are many simpler and less heavy books, of course.

Yes, it might be something similar, although I have the impression the
clear light (the azoth of the alchemists) is an indivisible experience ("I
am that I am"), not the complex hallucinations (or whatever) of NDE and
OOBE. I would like to point out the similarities with this and temporal 
lobe epilepsy (Dostoyevskian epilepsy), and Persinger's experiments:

"There is little doubt that the class of experiences that comprise
mystical experiences in general, and NDE's in particular, is strongly
correlated with temporal lobe activity....Kate Makarec and I have found
that all of the major components of the NDE [near death experience],
including out-of-body experiences, floating, being pulled towards a light,
hearing strange music, and profound meaningful experiences can occur in
experimental settings during minimal electrical current induction to the
temporal region due to exogenous spike-and-wave magnetic field sources." 
       - Michael Persinger in Report on Communion by Ed Conroy 

My personal guess is that the 'clear light' is some kind of limbic state, 
started by influencing the temporal lobe. Might be interesting to try. 

> Is the clear light experience perhaps just experiencing noise *as* noise,

I have the impression it is more like seeing "everything as one". One 
should distinguish between experiencing noise and having noise in the 
brain.

Why not?
It is perfectly logical that all I can know is what I feel.
Have you ever felt not you?
If you did it was not you and therefore you did not feel it.

Relying on the opinion of others can *be* part of one's measure of
worth.  Firefly ratings are *also* measures of the opinions of others;
they measure the opinions of those Firefly crudely predicts will share
your opinions.  Defining the group right, they are even measures of
majority opinion within a certain group.  Joining a mailing list with
some sort of joint filtering rule is just another way for you to
choose people to rely on.

I know that not everyone here shares the radical libertarian views
that I find consistent with Extropian ideals, but you should consider
that enough of us do to make us a bad resource for information on how
to make legislators do anything but go away.  If research on life
extension is your goal--and it is a noble one--then just do it.  Find
the people who can do the research and try to get the funding by free
market voluntary means; if you can't raise the money volutarily, then
the project isn't worth funding by force.

Please justify this statement.  The proposal I made is exactly the
opposite of that: each individual decides for himself how to spend
his own tokens, majority be damned.

Because it seems to be the only plausible option other than mechanism. 
Many people believe we have 'souls'. The only way they could interact with
our bodies would be through quantum mechanical effects. I don't think 
this can ever be proved or disproved.

I was thinking along the same lines recently when in my religion (morality,
Christian justice, brainwashing, time to practice riding on the edge of
acceptable behavior so the teacher does not notice but the students do,
etc...) class we discussed the spiral of violence.  

Basically, it starts with basic injustice, then violent reaction occurs to
the injustice, then there is increased repression that leads to more
violence etc.  We were suppossed to think of ways to break the spiral.  To
do that one first has to identify the basic injustice.  I concluded that
this is a very subjective thing.  As long as the majority has the ability
to impose its wishes on the minority there will be injustice.  Eventually
the majority gets smaller and smaller as more people feel they are the
victims of injustice.  Massive spending ensues in the form of revolution or
getting votes.  Until that point is reached, people feel powerless and feel
the use of semi-random violence is nescesary.

Of course, this allows a relatively simple solution.  Destroy the power of
the majority to impose their will on the minority by destroying government.
 Unfortunately, that will not happen until some libertarians, hopefully of
the anarcho-capatalist breed, gain control of the schools through massive
amounts of money.  I suspect that, given that society continues on its
present course this could take quite a long time (my children would be
dead).

I spent a great deal of time trying find a method of expressing my 
reaction to this, either on or off the list, that would fall within 
the list ethics and intellectual standards that this list attempts to 
maintain.  In the face of accusations of this sort, I don't know what 
to say, or whether I should even attempt a reply.  I could use some 
guidance here from someone more experienced on this list.

Some seem to believe that I have a great deal of time to waste and 
possess the desire to take potshots at people's ideas for the fun of 
it.  I don't.  But I cannot remain silent about issues regarding 
access, voice, and participation.  In the prior discussions that led 
to the Node concept, these issues were discussed in a manner that 
these concerns were listened to and considered.  It saddens me that 
this discussion led to statements such as the above, because I was 
willing to listen carefully to what Lee had to say about his own 
concerns and intentions.  But then, my time is my own to spend on 
such frivolous activities as that, I suppose.

Fuel cells are cold, non-Carnot devices, they thus have exceedingly high 
efficiencies. They differ from other electrochemical batteries by using 
atmospheric air for one electrode, vastly reducing weight. Though one of 
the first electrochemical effects observed, fuel cells have been 
languishing in obscurity (why?) until quite recently on-board fuel 
reforming and PEM electrolyte invigorated the concept. Though platinum 
metal content has been reduced drastically, fuel cell, if mainstream, are 
thought to increase platiunum metal prices do to enourmous demand. 
Direct methanol-metabolizing fuel cells might make NiMH and 
lithium-ion/polymer obsolete for powering portable devices. Recharging 
could be done in seconds, by refilling the liquid fuel.

************************************************
     Ballard And Daimler-Benz To Invest Over $450 Million In Fuel Cell
     Ventures To Develop The Next Generation Of Engines For The World's
     Automobiles

     VANCOUVER/STUTTGART, April 14 /CNW-PRN/ - Ballard Power Systems Inc. of
Canada and Daimler-Benz AG of Germany announced today that they are combining
forces and jointly investing over $450 million in fuel cell ventures to
develop the next generation of efficient and clean engines for the world's
automobiles using Ballard Fuel Cells. The two companies signed a detailed
memorandum of understanding which will result in the alliance of Ballard, the
world leader in proton exchange membrane fuel cells, with Daimler-Benz, the
quality and innovation leader in the automotive industry.
     Ballard Fuel Cells are electrochemical devices which convert a fuel, such
as methanol, natural gas or hydrogen into usable electricity, directly without
combustion. Surrounding a fuel cell is a system which consists of a fuel
processor, air supply subsystem, cooling subsystem and controls. Combining
these subsystems with the fuel cell creates a fuel cell engine which can power
a car, truck, bus or other vehicle.
     In the proposed transaction, Daimler-Benz will invest a total of $198
million in Ballard by contributing all of its fuel cell stack technology,
related fixed assets and $142 million in cash to Ballard in return for
5,653,664 new treasury shares of Ballard at a price of $35 per share which
will constitute 25% of Ballard's outstanding shares after the investment. In
addition, Daimler-Benz will invest a total of $207 million made up of all of
its fuel cell system technology, related fixed assets and $57 million in cash
into a new fuel cell engine company which will develop and commercialize fuel
cell systems to be supplied to the world's automotive industry as the engines
for tomorrow's automobiles in return for two-thirds of this engine company.
Ballard Power Systems will invest a total of $103 million made up of all of
its vehicular fuel cell system technology, related fixed assets and cash of
$53 million to the new fuel cell engine company for one-third ownership of the
engine company. Ballard Power Systems will supply the fuel cell engine company
with the fuel cells which will be integrated into fuel cell engines for sale.
     In addition, Ballard Power Systems and the new engine company will
jointly form a new company which will market all fuel cells for vehicular
applications made by Ballard Power Systems and all fuel cell engines for
vehicular applications made by the fuel cell engine company to all of the
world's automobile, truck and bus manufacturers.
     Ballard Power Systems and the new fuel cell engine company will together
spend over $200 million over the next three years to develop and commercialize
fuel cells and fuel cell engines for market introduction after the year 2000.
     The transaction is subject to the approval of Ballard Power Systems'
shareholders, which will be sought at the Company's annual general meeting on
May 29, 1997, satisfactory completion of all formal agreements between the
companies and the approval of regulatory authorities. Final completion of the
transaction is expected to occur during the third quarter of 1997. Financial
advisors to the Company on this transaction were Morgan Stanley & Co.
Incorporated of New York and Goepel Shields & Partners Inc. of Vancouver.
     "This relationship with Daimler-Benz is the most significant event to
occur to date in Ballard's history. It will be a catalyst for the development
of the next generation of clean and efficient automobiles, and will enable
Ballard to become a major supplier of a key automotive component," said Firoz
Rasul, Ballard's President and Chief Executive Officer. "We have successfully
collaborated with Daimler-Benz over the past four years and, by joining
forces, we can together build on our technological and market lead to provide
the world automotive industry with cost effective fuel cells and fuel cell
engines for use in their vehicles."
     Daimler-Benz presented the first traffic-ready passenger car vehicle
using fuel cell engine technology in 1994. At that time, the fuel cell system
took up almost the entire cargo space of the van. Only two years later, the
company launched a fuel cell car that had room for six people. The next goal
is to integrate fuel cells into the recently introduced subcompact
Mercedes-Benz A-Class in the near future.
     Daimler-Benz chairman Juergen E. Schrempp sees this partnership as
further proof of the company's continuous strive for progress through
innovation. Observes Schrempp: "A provider of premium automobiles can
distinguish itself from the competition only through outstanding technological
achievements. The fuel cell is the only so-called "alternative engine" with
the potential to harmonize mobility and environmental concerns. Through the
intensified collaboration with Ballard, Daimler-Benz will further expand its
technological lead."
     Dr. Ferdinand Panik, Daimler-Benz Senior Vice President and head of the
fuel cell project sees the fuel cell engine as "the alternative engine with
the greatest chance of seriously competing with the combustion engine." He
emphasizes: "Daimler-Benz wants to be the first to bring a production
automobile with fuel-cell engine technology to the market and to develop a
major business with Ballard to supply fuel cell engines to the world."
     Daimler-Benz is the world's most comprehensive provider of
technologically advanced transportation products, traffic systems and services
and has 290,000 employees and revenues of approximately $70 billion.
Daimler-Benz is focused on the development and manufacture of Mercedes-Benz
cars and commercial vehicles, Freightliner trucks, rail systems, diesel
engines and microelectronics. Daimler-Benz Aerospace builds aircraft and space
systems and Daimler-Benz InterServices provides leasing and sales financing,
mobile communications and information technologies. North America, where
Daimler-Benz employs more than 18,000 people, is the largest regional market
outside of Europe and accounts for approximately 20 percent of worldwide
revenues. In 1993, Daimler-Benz became the first German company to list its
stock on the New York Stock Exchange (symbol: DAI).
     Ballard Power Systems is the world leader in the development of proton
exchange membrane fuel cells. At the heart of its products is the Ballard Fuel
Cell, a proprietary zero-emission engine that converts natural gas, methanol,
or hydrogen fuel into electricity without combustion. Ballard Fuel Cells are
currently being used by leading international companies to develop
zero-emission vehicles and clean stationary electric power generators.
     Ballard's Common shares are listed on The Toronto Stock Exchange under
the trading symbol "BLD" and on the Nasdaq National Market System under the
symbol "BLDPF".

	We have never been accused of being a "wee bit pretentious".   Usually it
(the pretentiousness) is preceded by "a lot" or "grossly".
	The point, being....that games, whether finite or infinite have nothing to
do with legitimatcy or "spiritual dodgyness".  The win-lose games are ego
food, at least for the winners.  The win-win games are cooperative
ventures.
	Talking about rambling...what was the plea to lead all about?

I would be thankful if anyone could answer some questions about SQUID,
or would give me some bibliography or URL.

1. How many chanels can ensure magnetoencephalograma from the scalp ? The
best EEG resulution can be about  1 cm. What is SQUID resolution ? (I read
about SQUID system with 256 chanels. Is the more chanels is possible ?
How many ? Also I read, that digital SQUID system can ensure 100 Msamples
per second speed. But the other limit is resolution, I think).

2. How about MEG from the implanted electrodes ? Is the any real system
implemented ?

3. How about SQUID in the liquid nitrogen temperature ?

4. Do you know any commercial (not experimental) SQUID system for brain
maping ?

Regards,
Algimantas

Hey Lee, did you  read R.A.W.'s Shroedinger's cat? Remember how the e;ected
president of the Immortalist Libertarian Party put a huge reward on anyone
who found ways to extend life, and it happened almost immediately?
Legislation does not need to mean force, it could provide incentive.

Lee's tone was unnecessarily rude.  But I also think you were too
quick to conclude you disagreed over goals, rather than over methods,
and I think Lee perceived this as an insult.  Holding goals constant,
there are reasonable cases to be made for all the various alternatives
discussed.

Btw, do you see the irony in your advocating the choice of your
official ExI committee on the grounds of it better promoting
participation, when general list members were not offered a chance to
participate in or even observe this committe discussion, and still
have been told very little about the actual choice?

Dunno how many X-fans there are on the list, but this past Sunday's
episode featured cryonics AND time travel. A guy who is a cryonics
developer comes back from the future with a chemical that induces an
exothermic reaction in the body to freeze it without crystalization. He
uses it to quick freeze his research partners in the present, as well as
his present self in the end (an interesting paradox). The downside is
that if the frozen people aren't revived properly, they warm up
endothermically to the point of brusting into flames spontaneously.

If people like us dominated a rich and powerful future civilization,
what a glorious place it might be.  They would value the things we
value, and so we stand a good chance of approving of their choices
regarding space exploration, scientific advance, body modifications,
individual freedoms, ecological preservation, spiritual insight, and
industrial advance.

But will our future descendants want what we want?  Or will
evolutionary pressures change the distribution of values in our
descendants?

The following two papers offer useful insights into the evolution of
values.  

  Ingemar Hansson, Charles Stuart, "Malthusian Selection of Preferences",
  American Economic Review, June 1990, V.80 No. 3. pp.529-544.

  Lawrence Blume, David Easley, "Evolution and Market Behavior",
  Journal of Economic Theory, 1992, V.58, pp.9-40.

The Blume & Easley paper analyzes the investment values selected for
by asexual reproduction.  It finds that such evolution selects for
investors with logarithmic (and hence risk-averse) utility of wealth,
minimal time-discount (i.e. maximal patience), and Bayesian beliefs
with the smallest relative entropy to the truth.

The Hansson & Stuart paper tries to infer the gender and age specific
time discount values that were an equilibrium in our tribal past.
They note that on average sexual reproduction in a stable population
should prefer a discount rate of a factor of 2 per generation (which
fits with historic interest rates), but find that for tribal humans it
varies with age and gender.  Young males, for example, discount the
future heavily, in contrast to children and men over 35.

I don't have a cite, but I think there are also good reasons to think
that young males should be risk-takers rather than risk-averse.  On
average though one would expect only slight risk-aversion from sexual
reproduction, except for small genetic populations.

I also have a theory that young males should be more optimistic than
Bayesians; the better they think of their prospects the more likely
they are to fool young women into thinking highly of their prospects.

As we become better at exchanging information in ways other than via
sexual reproduction, it seems the longer time-horizon of asexual
reproduction should win out.  This suggests a future of very patient
risk-averse asexual Bayesians, in contrast to the impatient optimistic
risk-taking young males who dominate science fiction.

While I would say that family concerns make males much more risk averse
than without such responsibility. It is an evolutionary goal of males to
pile up as big a pile of stuff, as pretty a nest as possible, in order
to attract the closest to optimal mate. This factor does vary in
relation to the males short term libidinous drives, as well as to what a
particular male considers his "optimal" mate and what his preexisting
assets physically and charismatically are (shades of your BS ability
theory below)

So you are saying that the future portends being boringly stable, with
high social pressures for conformity (if you reproduce asexually, you
are producing identical clones) with low growth, low interest, long term
investments being the norm. I predict that such a society will not
survive long in the face of possible world ecological disasters, threats
from within or without. Its stability and conformity will not make it
suitable to adapt to radical changes. The machine will stop. Get me off
this rock ASAP.

        I also saw the x-files sunday and was a little disappointed when
they began to introduce the cryonics theme.  
        They dodn't know the difference between a cryonisist and a
cryobiologist which is irksome at the very least and gee wouldn't it be nice
if there was intense multinational cooperation in the field of cryonics, or
if at least the meaty government grants that the doctoral candidates were
competing for even existed.

I said nothing of the sort.  Future asexual entities change themselves
during their lives, so grandchildren can be very different.  I said
nothing about stability or social pressure.  Interest rates should
track growth rates, which should be as high as possible.

To be more precise: We should expect very little risk-aversion in a
large genetic population regarding idiosyncratic risk, but strong (log
utility) risk aversion regarding risks correlated across the
population.  This may explain a lack of concern regarding car
accidents and heart attacks, relative to ecological collapse, war, or
a plague like AIDS.  For more info see:

Utility", Journal of Economic Theory, 1996 V68, pp.397-424.

I see no reason for the production of clones to translate into social
pressure to conform.  One could easily argue just the opposite, that
large populations of clones would desperately search out ways to
individualize themselves.

Growth rates should be largely controlled by room to grow in.  Such
beings might be unwilling to grow rapidly if this involved much personal
risk, but there are ways around that, especially in an SF future.  And I
don't see the problem with long term investments being normal.  In fact,
such a mentality would indicate that they would spend a lot of time
trying to foresee, forestall, and hedge against ecological disasters
and threats of many kinds.  Redundancy and flexibility.

Hmm.  Are these asexuals in general, or immortal asexuals?  And does
asexual meaning cloning oneself or designing your offspring?

I find these papers very gratifying, since this result well matches my
most common view of the future.  SF representation... at least partial
matches are Culture Minds, the ship in Cherryh's _Voyager in Night_,
Niven's Outsiders, the aliens of 2001, Babylon-5's First Ones, possibly
DS9's changelings.  Patience and risk-aversion seem to be expected as
consequences of immortality; asexuality comes because the writers shy
away from attributing sexuality to such beings, and no one ever writes
in terms of Bayesianism but low-emotion rationality seems to be the
usual guess.  Curious survivalists.

Hmm.  I wonder if I've gotten to the point where I think less of any
extended-term SF which doesn't have such beings.

I haven't been sure of the implications of "risk-averse": trying to wipe
out all possible threats (Pak protector), hiding (Spathi), or preferring
safe social conglomerations?

I doubt humans will go extinct though.  Non-dominant yes.  Not extinct,
not in a large and diverse universe.

Interesting to note how they say that their deeds are legally valid
because they "filed a declaration of ownership with the US Government".
That could mean anything, down to sending a declaration to the local
social security office, where it got filed in the wastebasket.

That's a rather interesting idea, but it should be able to work in the free
market as well.  Get a lot of people to pledge a certain amount of money
for significant life extension.  For twenty years I'd be willing to put up
$10,000.  Now, just get 100,000 people to do this as well and you would
have a prize worth one billion.  How many immortalists are there?

Though this is X-Files, which exists in an even stranger universe than we

This is the dilemma .  When does 'protection of the minority' infringe
upon the 'rights of the majority'?  In the US the minority often imposes
laws over the majority.  When does ANY belief system ('religion' or
government) start taking on aspects of dictatorship?  How do we prevent
it?

My opinion is that it happens when laws are passed based on emotion
rather than NOT being passed because logicially it doesn't make sense.
When emotion becomes the main issue then common sense has been
abandoned.  This is because one side cannot convince enough of the
population in a logical manner that the one side is right, so emotion is
appealed to.  Many completely idiotic things can be made law based on
emotion.  Logically they make no sense.  

When ANY group appeals to emotion enough to start making the majority
start agreeing with it based on emotion then emotion becomes the driving
force.  'Don't THINK, FEEL!'.  You can get widely seperate groups
agreeing based on a narrow emotion where if individually you thought out
the consequences of such action you'd totally reject it.

There are several laws in the US that remind me of this:

(The dumbest I can think of is the current possibility of it becoming
illegal to burn the US flag.  A totally emotional thing.  I care about
how the banks are screwing me, I don't give a rat's ass about Joe Blow
burning the US flag.  Does congress really think flag burning is a wide
spread activity?  How many people will it involve?  Certainly nowhere
near the folk being screwed by their 'friendly local bank'!)

Abortion is kinda legal.  However, if the mother wants an abortion the
fetus is considered tissue and can be aborted.  If the mother does NOT
want an abortion the fetus is considered a human.Law:  In the US if
you're involved in an accident that causes the spontaneous abortion and
death of an unborn infant you can be sent to jail for involuntary
manslaughter, even though BY LAW, the unborn infant can be considered
'tissue'.  Emotions are involved.  (Amazingly, this 'manslaughter' law
was NOT passed until abortion became legal!)

'Drunk driving is illegal'.  This is based purely on blood alcohol
content (BAC).
In the US 50% of all traffic deaths involves at least one driver having
an 'illegal' BAC.  This is appealed to in the courts and legislatures.
This TOTALLY assumes you can't add and deduce you're as likely to be
killed by a sober driver as one who has been drinking!  (I'm sure there
IS a percentage of traffic deaths due solely to drinking, but it is
nowhere near 50%.)   In other words, according to the statistics it's
'How you drive more than what you imbibe' because if you drive like an
idiot sober you'll drive like an idiot after drinking.  However,
EVERYONE who drinks and drives is considered a criminal, even though YOU
might be safer on the road with a BAC of .1 over some fool who
disreguards all common sense and drives aggressively (and WILL
eventually kill someone) and has a BAC of .00.  Some fanatics will argue
'but the none drunks had mechanical failures or driving conditions were
bad or ...... The idiocy about this is that when ANY driver that has
been drinking (BAC over .00) is involved in an accident the mechanical
or driving conditions are disreguarded.   In fact, even if the drinking
driver IS NOT AT FAULT he/she IS CONSIDERED AT FAULT just because he/she
has been drinking!  How logical is that?  It's the emotion of the 'evil
drunk driver' that encourages such law.  Remember, logic has no bearing.
 We have been appealed to emotionally that drinking causes death when
the statistics themselves prove it's driving habits (US anyway).  I
guess US citizens will only understand this when it's illegal (AGAIN) to
consume alcohol and 100% of all traffic deaths are due to sober drivers
who drive like idiots, or we realise the reduction of traffic deaths is
due more to the fact that automobiles themselves are safer and are the
major cause of reduced deaths rather than a criminalization of drinking.

US:
The Constitution guarantees 'freedom of speech'...included to allow any
citizen to speak out against the government.
In the 19-teens or 1920's the 'Un-American Law' was passed (by those in
power which BTW had also passed laws requiring a certain percentage of
the population wanting you to before you could even be considered
elligible for election...in other words, 'everyone was elligible' was
taken away, you had to belong to an accepted 'political party' (group of
"TRUE BELIEVERS") instead of what you believed in) of which allowed the
state to arrest anyone speaking out against the government.  Many of the
Americans who loved democracy AND America were arrested in the 1960's
using this law (and by the way, still are).

What scares me most is most people have given into the emotional thing
(when the HELL were we brainwashed?) and allow such things.

Oh, don't forget, there are VERY FEW (if any) democracies in the world,
most (including the US) are republics (YOUR vote means squat, the person
you voted for vote means EVERYTHING and he/she generally cares about
him/her-self in his/her political power game).

I won't even go into the educational system.

This is exactly the psychology presented in Bruce Sterling's excellent new
novel HOLY FIRE.  But he's setting it up as a transitional stage between
careful longevity and genuine, hormone-charged rejuvenation.  Thereafter,
selection pressures would presumably encourage tweaking of the reinstated
hormone rushes...

Well, I would think of myself as patient, risk-averse, and Bayesian, or at
least more so than the general population.  I sure like good sci-fi, but only
rarely take the protagonists as role models.  So I see this as claiming that
people will be more like me in the future.  

(I would miss sex, though :-)

Do these papers take into account evolution of memetic parasites?  Fashion,
fantasy, and religious-type beliefs interfere with patience, risk-aversion,
and inductive reasoning, and they haven't been doing poorly of late.

Lookahead and awareness are not neeed; they just need to make choices
that end up valuing future payoffs.  Children spend almost all their
time investing in their human capital, investments which pay off later.

What these SF creatures lack is the very rapid growth rate predicted
by these models: as fast as possible.  More like grey goo, Von Neuman
machines, etc.

Curt Adams writes:
>Do these papers take into account evolution of memetic parasites?  

They are abstract models of simple evolution, rather than coupled
evolutionary systems.  But if one posited memes as the primary
evolution system, one might try to fit memes into these sort of
models.  Then the question is: for a meme considering sacrificing
consumption by today's host to benefit a potential future host, what
is the chance that future host will actually host this meme?  If the
chance is low, say 10%, that makes memes even more impatient than
genes, who have a 50/50 chance of living on in each child.

Sorry, I didn't explain because I thought it was obvious and I had to catch
a flight.

If the majority of people (or more accurately, the majority of coins
donated, but given a normal variation on the size of the donation it serves)
are not interested in some rarely discussed topic of interest to me (e.g.,
nanotechnology), then the pay-for-merit scheme does me no good. I don't know
who will post on that topic in advance of the post, and a standing offer to
donate for such a post doesn't look like a good idea.

I want the filter to highlight what *I* like. BTW, here's a repost of
Sasha's message on this.

If you were to search the archives, you would find a general

all list members had an opportunity to discuss their ideas and concerns.

Saberhagen's Berserkers? :)  But you're right, I know of no SF of
that sort, presumably because the evidence obviously conflicts with it.
One would have to have such a universe result from human development,
and most people assume that means extinction of humans, which makes
storywriting hard.

Hmm.  Given that this _is_ similar to the universe I've been working on,
perhaps I should try writing some SF, at least if Benford's 6 book
series (can't remember the title) isn't too similar to what I have in
mind.  Even if I can't make up a story I should get points for new
combination of ideas.

Authors may also shy away from imagining a universe where nearly all
matter is biomass, fuel, or substrate.  I'm not sure I've seen any
entirely alive universes, Bayesian immortals or not.  Although I read
_Star Maker_ a long time ago.

I'm not sure what you mean by fantasy; reading fiction or believing the
tabloids?  At any rate, since both mortality and sexuality have yet to
do poorly I wouldn't expect the analysis to apply, from what Robin's

evolution does take time; scientific reasoning is mostly new to the past

That's true, but unless half the drivers on the road at any given 
time are legally drunk, the 50% statistic still shows that a drunk 
driver is much more dangerous than a sober one.  That is with all 
else being equal, of course, but I'm not arguing that intoxication is 
the ONLY thing that can cause hazardous driving.  Granted, I don't 
have a statistic for how many drivers are legally drunk at any given 
moment.  But 50%?  I doubt that 50% of the population gets drunk 
even once a week, let alone having 50% drunk at all times.

Huh?  Are you actually proposing that intoxication doesn't impair 
mental function?  Why the heck do people get drunk in the first 
place?

IMHO, everyone who drinks and drives IS a criminal, whether they
actually cause an accident or not.  The crime is in seriously and
unnecessarily endangering the lives of others.  The only thing that
seperates the drunk driver who kills someone from the one who
doesn't is pure dumb luck.

I do agree that driving while intoxicated isn't any more criminal 
than driving while stupid, but that comparison doesn't make drunk 
driving any less of a problem.  I suppose that ethically, driving 
while stupid should be just as illegal and punishable as driving 
drunk.  But unfortunately, it comes down to the purely practical 
problem that stupidity is a much more difficult thing to measure 
objectively.  Although it could be argued that blood alcohol level 
while behind the wheel is in itself one fairly good objective 
indicator of stupidity.

Of course the problem is driving habits, but are driving habits not 
affected by drunkennes?

Consider this:

1. Driving while intoxicated is significantly more dangerous than 
not, and therefore can be considered negligent.

2. Drunk drivers endanger more lives than just their own.  Therefore, 
laws against drunk driving can't be written off as just protecting 
people from themselves.

3. The purpose of law is not just to get revenge on those who do
harm.  It is also to serve as a deterrent to prevent people from
doing harm in the first place.  To that end, penalizing people for
negligent behaviour is quite reasonable, even if no harm has yet
occurred.  Of course, this kind of  deterrent will only work for
reasonably sensible people.  Unreasonable senseless people will
commit the crime anyway, and will end up being penalized.  Seems
like a pretty good arrangement to me.

The point of all that being that drunk driving laws are easily 
defensible with no appeal to emotion.  It seems to me that your 
objection to those laws is itself an appeal to emotion rather than 
reason.  Painting a picture of the big bad government vs. the 
innocent free citizen.  Hardly a convincing picture when that citizen 
is drunkenly cruising the streets putting everyone at risk.

One of the few truly rational arguments against drunk driving laws
is that just letting 'em drive drunk will allow natural selection to
do its work and prevent a few morons from breeding.  I don't think
DWI laws really defeat that though.  They just make it a bit more
selective in that it requires that one not only be stupid enough to
drink & drive, but that one also be stupid enough to do it even
though he/she can face legal penalties even if he/she is fortunate
enough to not be a member of that "someone else" group of people
that bad things always happen to.

Hmm.  The old "Where does it end?" or "If it goes this far why not
further?" deception.  Given a bit of thought, the answer is pretty
clear.

Where does it end?  It ends with tasks in which inebriation 
causes a clear danger to others.

Why will it not go further?  Because drunk driving laws aren't about 
the "sinfulness" of alcoholic beverages.  It's about negligent 
behavior that threatens lives.

Connecting drunk driving laws with prohibition just doesn't work.

I have been informed that my presuppositions might have been

different from what has been discussed heretofore.


I'm picturing a system where every message has an opportunity cost that
is partly dependent on size and partially independent (is there a label
for such? I'm unaware of a specific name for f(x)+c as distinct from
f(x)... At any rate, such a scheme would reflect roughly my notion of
limited attention, if the tokens had a useful lifetime (say a week).


Then it would be possible to predict the maximum bandwidth per week.

This is tantamount to what happens in the periodical publishing world:

"All the news that fits."

Hmm, this might be relevant to my thoughts about the growth and 
differentiation of technospheres. Once a species starts spreading across 
space, it would tend to differentiate as different evolutionary 
pressures have different strengths in different parts of the growing 
technosphere. Near the edges, rapid growth and colonization would be 
preferable, perhaps creating a grey goo-ish form of the species bent on 
expanding quickly (why? because their ancestors were the most expansive). 

At the core matter is under control, resources limited but the amount of 
information (and presumably processing) maximal. This might be the land 
of the careful Bayesians. They grow mainly memetically rather than 
physically (although I would suspect they were very interested in 
technological growth to keep an edge against the "smart barbarians" 
at the fringes), and in the face of resource limitations are likely to 
favor megaengineering to ensure their long term future (Dyson spheres, 
stellar lifting and whatnot).

I think you are interpreting Robin's idea in a slightly extreme way. 
Social conformity isn't likely to be enforced if you assume clone/xox 
reproduction, it would just be a natural consequence of the form of 
reproduction (although there would be a drift). Remember that there is 
likely also competition, and these rational beings would act to ensure 
their long-term results which means that they would be much more likely 
to do something about future ecological disasters or other dangers than 
less risk-aversive beings (like the sf males? "Yeah, I know the black 
hole in the reactor is unshielded, but I trust my ship, and besides, 
real men don't get radiation sickness..."). 

But I agree, we need to get off this rock.

Indeed.  I was asking whether the papers took into account the co-evolution
of these agents, which could potentially interfere with the development of
the wise agents these analyses predict.  Robin's answer was basically no,
they didn't take this into account.  

I would tend to suspect the existence of such parasitic memes would
accelerate this evolution of these characteristics.  However, the same memes
might organize society against such agents, too.  Educated, thrifty, and
practical minorities, such as Jews, overseas Chinese, or Parsees, are often
persecuted by society at large.  Of course things are complicated in that two
of the above minorities are carrying significant religious baggage of their
own.

Liars and Bayesians (or more generally, sensible inductive agents) are not
mutually exclusive categories.  Bayesianism requires that you not lie *to
yourself* but otherwise you can lie like a rug.

The diff is sexuality, which makes each child only half you, so you
have only half the interest in promoting its welfare over your own.
Evolution has no problems with your dying in order to make room for
another entity with your essential (i.e., selected-for)
characteristics.

The optimal risk aversion implies a certain risk premium.  If the
market risk premium is less than this, you buy risky stuff.  Otherwise
you don't.  What you should buy depends on the price, and your
estimate of the actual risk.

If these regions could effectively contract with each other, then both
should grow at the same rate in terms of wealth.  Central memetic
investments would compete with edge physical investments, and if there
were more good ones of the later type, then edges would be funded by
central investors, with payoffs flowing from the outside in.

If these regions were cut off from one another, then the evolutionary
arguments would apply to each one seperately.  The arguments I cited
did not depend on the actual local growth rate available, so they
imply that both places would have careful Bayesians.  And evolution
should also select for agents which choose to be on the inside or
outside based on expected growth rates in each place.  In a population
dominated by such creatures, it wouldn't be obvious whether to head on
out against great odds and competition, or to be one of the few who
stay home.

Well, maybe they've had their money in gov't bonds all their lives, but
at this stage I would think such bonds _are_ good investments.  Having
their money is more important than having it grow fast.

Yes, exactly, so you'll just have to spend your own tokens on your
own ideas, and no one will stop you.  If people reply, they reply.
If they don't, they don't.  Are you suggesting that minority topics
ought to get /more/ time than their accurate share of interest? 
Minority interests are always protected better by a free market
than by any consensus-based system.

The formula is correct, but your conclusion is not.  While n is an
integer, f is not.  That means that a "beam" of light consists of
a discrete number of quanta (as opposed to a continual wave), but
the individual energies of those quanta can have any value from
a continuous spectrum.  In a special case of coherent light, we
engineer the source in such a way that all the quanta have the same
energy, for example by making sure all of them are emitted from a
certain transition in a certain kind of atom.  However, if you move
the coherent source relative to the observer, you can change the
observed frequency (energy) of the quanta by a non-discrete amount.
This is called the Doppler effect.  It's even simpler to make the
frequencies of quanta in the same beam different: just heat up the
source!

Another wrong conclusion.  One: N is not an integer.  A photon that
has one "crest" over one meter has one point three crests over one
point three meters.  Two: the number of crests depends on the frame
of reference.  If you measure five crests over one meter, and I am
moving relative to your rest frame, I may measure five times square
root of two crests over one meter.  But now I see how you got to
that conclusion:

You're now drifting toward the question of interpretation that has
been a hobby of every self-respecting quantum mechanic since the
thirties.  You're trying to dump more information into the problem
in order to try to make it look more "intuitive".  Counting crests
of photons is a mental crutch.  In reality, what you can do is
measure the energy of your pet photon.  Unfortunately, in the
process you're destroying the photon itself, so the accuracy of
your measurement is not constrained by the Heisenberg inequality,
but rather by the construction of your apparatus.  You can even
measure with some accuracy where in space did the photon convert,
but that doesn't tell you whether the photon was a little ahead or
a little behind that point in space at the moment of destruction.

And you are right in that randomness is not a continuous quantity.
In fact, it's not a quantity at all, it's a concept people have
trouble imagining because it's not "intuitive".  However, an 
incredible mountain of evidence suggests that quantum mechanics is
how universe works, so the right attitude imho is to convince
oneself that there simply are questions that have no meaning within
the confines of the working theory, and that their meaning emerges
at some other level.  Isn't complexity fun?  :)

No, it just says that our historical choice of units for "energy"
and "momentum" was arbitrary, so we invented a "constant" to make
it sound less embarrasing.  That's not a very useful observation
if you build bridges for a living, but in the Universe and in my
current profession c == h == 1.

  Would it not be more accurate to say that one can select units
in which c == h == 1, and that the particular values they have in
(say) the MKS system of units are historical accidents based on 
the way that system was set up.

  It would, of course, be possible to set up units in which c and
h had other values -- say, pi -- in which case the case for what
some posters have referred to as a "digital universe" would be
even more far-fetched.

Kathryn's right here: we had considerable opportunity for discussion,
and no one objected to letting ExI do its own thing; nor do I.  My
suggestion came when it did simply because that's when I thought of it,
and did not in any way reflect upon the value of any other suggestions
or decisions of the past.  Ideas just come when they come; I am sorry
if the timing of my inspiration was inconvenient, or if that caused
some to speculate about my motives or my feelings about ExI's ideas.

I invite, welcome, and value criticism of my ideas, and I do not hold
back from giving my own evaluations of others.

While I appreciate Lee's fuller explaination his point, this statement 
has not been definitively proven and remains a point of questioning 
and debate among libertarians and groups that use consensus 
processes.  The point has been raised in detail on many political 
discussions on this list, so I will not attempt to elaborate further.

Regarding consensus, most of my facilitation training has focused on 
this type of process, as I worked with nonprofit groups.  Consensus 
processes were developed for the very purpose of accomodating highly 
heterogeneous group meetings, which experience severe slowdowns due 
to the wide variety of viewpoints represented.  These processes have the 
advantage of allowing heterogenous groups to make decisions quickly on 
areas of general agreement and concentrate their time on the issues that 
need more debate.  Concensus also provides an excellent system for 
registering lone objections, which can prevent defections or one of 
those blowups that can shut down a meeting.

Sin,

Kathryn Aegis

I was just looking at life insurance and a thought came to me.  Would it be
in the best interests of life insurance companies to pledge support of life
extension?  There are numerous variables to take into account like how many
people die in accidents and such things that are not related to aging.  As
I am not an actuary I would not want to attempt taking all of these factors
into account.  If anyone has any less data intensive ideas that might shed
some light on this possibility I would love to hear them.

I asked a galfriend who's forever finishing off a PhD in history (and whose
father is a notable Australian historian, so she's drenched in the subject
matter), and to my surprise her response was this, confirming Robin's
declaration:

`I for my part have never heard of cliometrics and know of no cliometrician
anywhere. Statisitics in history was kind of trendy in the late 70s when
the 'new social history' was in vogue. This involved looking at birth, deaths
and marriage certificates, tax records and any obscure reference to ordinary
Jo and Jill Blows that were in existence and flogging them for all they
were worth to find any interesting historical social trends which might
tell us something about the 'ordinary' people as opposed to kings and
emperors.
As all that could be found was often just vital statistics these became the
centre and focus of historical studies and used as the basis for all sorts
of imaginative speculation. That is the last time I remember stats being
used to any significant degree by historians

`I have certainly never read or seen anything with even the most passing stats
in historical works recently. Although my thesis contains a few which
might make it even more untrendy.'

Sulloway's _Born to Rebel_ has tons of number crunching behind it, and
is about applying Darwinian family mechanics to personality development.
It doesn't do much for predicting history per se, but claims to tell you
something about the people in it.  Sulloway also applied for a grant to
do some statistical study, I forget about what, and the NSF historians
basically laughed him out because of his idea of applying numbers to
history.  At least that's how he tells it.

Diamond's _Guns, Germs, and Steel_ isn't so obviously numerical, but
it's certainly an attempt at figuring out broad laws from empirical
data.

It's possible to overdose on anything.  It's easy to overdose on GHB
when you combine it with alcohol or other depressants, or when you don't
bother to look up the active and lethal doses.  No offense to your friend,
but I've never heard of, nor seen *any* documented cases of, people OD'ing
on GHB who weren't taking massive doses or mixing it with alcohol.

Mixing depressants is a sure way to win the Darwin award.

EJCBS CALL FOR PAPERS

     We are announcing the EJCBS (The Electronic Journal
of Cognitive and Brain Sciences) as an experimental journal
which is published in an electronic form on the
World Wide Web (WWW). Submission, acceptance and publication
are automated. The journal is moderated by the whole scientific
community. It requires no editorial supervision.  EJCBS is
dedicated to publishing experimental, theoretical reports,
review papers, joint commentaries, degree Ph.D. theses and
preliminary works before they are submitted to other journals.
Beyond the characteristics of the traditional printed journals,
and in contrast with the characteristics of other electronic
journals, EJCBS has certain new features which may attract
scientist and thinkers to challenge their works.

Some of these features are:

-Self-editing
-Supports graphical representation (insertion of figures,
 images, charts, mathematical formulas)
-Two stages of acceptance
-Final acceptance based on an on-line poll of the readers
-Open for reviews and commentaries, with on line links to
 encourage discussion, and communication of ideas.

This type of publishing has never before been tested.  Since
the system is open for public review and examination it
facilitates discussion among professionals.  The quality of
the journal is guaranteed by setting a high threshold for
acceptance. Acceptance of submitted material is judged by our
on-line poll.  The readers evaluation, or on-line poll has
been designed to focus on the standards of the hypothesis
testing, theoretical relevance and methodological adequacy.

Submission is easy!  An interactive protocol for submission
instantly links the submitted article into the first stage
of review.  The journal should be aesthetically pleasing.
Formatting styles and figure placement can be manipulated
until a final form is accepted by the author.  Once a document
has been submitted and accepted, it becomes permanently
available in the archive.  The authors are eligible to
republish their papers in other journals. Thus, EJCBS may
provide a useful domain to crystallize the content of any
scientific paper before it is submitted to other journals.

Free Access!  Access to EJCBS is free.  Materials may be
examined and downloaded for personal or public use.  However,
the submitted papers are still protected by copyright law
and referencing to materials obtained from the EJCBS
requires correct citation of the author and journal.

You could start by:
   1.  provide a list of funding sources for research for stopping the 
aging process in human beings.  That would include 
	A. Government funding
	B. Corporate funding
	C. Foundation funding
    The sources would be people who have already committed funds or 
public support for such objectives (stopping aging).  Their expertise 
would be combined for a massive collective grass roots effort.

   2. find authority sources in the biotechnological fields who could
write and outline a specific research plan that would be acceptable to the
funding sources without seeming like an unrealistic dream (like UFO's and
time travel).  The proposals would need to be credible enough to be
accepted by the general population. 

  3. recruit marketing and promotional personnel to get these 
objectives moving.

  4. coordinate a massive world-wide volunteer effort to support these 
activities

This would depend on the speed of spread and the distances. Setting up 
contracts can be hard over lightyear distances, especially since the 
growers would have spread a few lightyears while the messages were sent 
back and forth. This suggests to me that unless the core beings were 
quite patient and accepted that their trading partners would be nearly 
core too once the contract was finished, the different regions are 
effectively cut off from one another.

Note that I never said the growers would not be careful; wild and daring 
explorers seldom become old explorers. The difference would likely be 
between the growers, who colonize new space to create hardware, and the 
stay homes, who might move in into the new hardware, paying with memes 
and knowledge.

THere is a book just out, I believe called _Longitude_ about the
Englishman who solved the problem of longitudinal navigation.
Apparently, the Parliament put up a big prize to the person who could
solve the problem. He solved it by developing highly accurate clocks and
a system of astronomical and velocity based tables. THis is probably the
most famous and commercially beneficial application of the invention
bounty, though there are currently prizes up for many different
engineering acheivements, and if you remember, Paul MacCready developed
his human powered airplanes in the 80's to win such prizes put up by
private organizations, doing a mile loop, then spanning the English
Channel, and then the course from Crete to Greece that was mythically
taken by Deadalus.

If you note the progression MacCready took, winning each prize along the
way, this might be a good blueprint to go by, having cash prizes to
individuals or teams that extend human life past 120, 150, 200, and 500
years. Given that the sums will be waiting for that amount of time to
mature, they will be earning a goodly amount of interest while they wait
for those spans to complete.

As for cryonics, which realistically is by definition NOT life
extension, but suspension, as a corpsicle is not aware, cognizant etc
while under suspension, I would suggest prizes for successfull revival
of various higher mammals as intermediary steps, with human revival as
only the final one. Of course, there will also need to be prizes for
anciallary technologies like nano that will be required for reparation
of corpsicles to full capability.

I have a paper "Patterns of Patronage: Why Grants Won Over Prizes in
Science" (http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/whygrants.ps), with an
empirical study that suggests that the reason the once common prize
was replaced by grants was that governments became the dominant
research patron.  So the current infrequency of prizes relative to
grants should not overly discourage private patrons from using prizes.
Prizes can be an excellent mechanism.

I see no reason why it cannot work. I just find it sad that the only

pure thrill of success, or the feeling of achievement gained when you see
a private fantasy tuen into a reality.

But these other incentives are quite strong and growing.  The trouble
is that it is hard to affect other's perceptions of the pride, fame,
thrill, etc. they will feel with different outcomes.  It is much
easier to affect their perception of the amount of money to be won.
That is the whole point of money, after all, to make it easier to give
other people what they want so they will do things you want.

The idea is much older than that: prizes for invention predate
the relatively recent idea of patents by centuries, and have
much to recommend them over the present approach.

All of those things--pride, achievement, thrill--are income, and no
different than any other form of income.  What each person desires,
and what efforts he is willing to put in to obtain them, is a
personal matter, different for each person on the planet.  "Money"
is a wonderful invention that allows different people to compare
their desires more accurately and facilitate exchange.  It is only
a mechanism, not the end goal.  But since everyone wants different
things, if I want to give someone a prize for a certain task, money
makes it possible for me to offer something of value to more people.
If I offerred my labor, some may not want it.  If I offered fame,
some won't care.  But if I offer money--interchangeable for all of
those things--then everyone can participate, and use the money to
buy what /he/ wants instead of what I might want to give him.

Someone might very well prefer the feeling of accomplishment at a
job well done, but that's his business, not mine; and there's no
reason he can't have that /and/ the money.

> Nobody believes in their dreams any more, only if they get rewarded

> It is a sad state of affairs.

A meaningless tirade that people use to excuse the fact that they
don't feel like doing what's necessary to achieve their goals, or
by those whose goals aren't imaginitive enough.  It would indeed be
irrational to seek green squares of paper for their own sake; but
any person with goals, who wants to interact with others freely to
achieve those goals, would find those pieces of paper to be his
handiest tool.  Seeking money is a sign that you have goals, and
are willing to work for them.  Nothing could be more anti-life,
anti-progress, anti-human than to not value money.

I think that more people than you realize are motivated by their own 
dreams.  Look at all of the individuals working very long hours in the 
jobs that offer rewards other than high salaries -- police, 
firefighters, aid workers, rescue workers, counselors, researchers, 
teachers, activists, astronomers, inventors, experimental scientists, 
nurses, philosophers, ministers, human rights workers, coaches, poets.  
Not to mention the thousands of volunteers that give generously of their 
precious free time and energy to provide cheap labor for various causes.  
Parents, who make huge sacrifices to raise their kids in the best way 
possible.  And, most importantly for this forum, systems 
administrators, like Julf, who have put their personal safety and 
careers on the line to maintain a free and open Internet.

Sin,

Kathryn Aegis

It's not directly relevant, but the most interesting brain book I've read
in the last year was Dennett's "Consciousness Explained". I disagree with
a number of things that he says (mostly in the first couple of chapters),
but his model of brain function explains a lot of my weird experiences.

'Prometheus Rising', of course. Possibly 'Cosmic Trigger'. Both are by
Robert Anton Wilson, who has a somewhat sensationalist style but does 
write from experience.

Yep, but not on any official basis AFAIK. There were a couple of mailing
lists on the subject but I don't know if they're still going. There's 
little on the Web other than Lilly, Leary and Wilson texts.

Uh, so that you can see something on that movie you recorded? Yes, being
able to squash my movies down to one byte per frame would be nice, but I'd
rather have high quality pictures. In the last few weeks I've been copying
a lot of the Hi8 footage I recorded while travelling and watching some of
the VHS footage I recorded when I was a VIP at a couple of space shuttle
launches years ago and wishing that we'd had a higher quality camera back
then. The difference in detail is amazing (about twice the horizontal
resolution and better color seperation).

But as someone who's currently writing his own spambot to keep the crap

wasn't signed by keys that I recognize, but then noone could mail me
unless I already knew them.

Sure, but when the Feds find you downloaded PGP from an American site, or
the local cops come around and find 'child porn' or Neo-Nazi Holocaust
Revisionist propaganda in your Netscape cache you'll be on your way to
jail.

Am I wrong in thinking that Germany bans Holocaust Revisionist writings?

Yes, but image size also goes up with CCD resolution. I guess that a CD
with full-size, high-quality JPEGs will be smaller than an equivalent
number of 35mm films.

I actually find it sad when 'money' is looked down upon.  It is the 
singular driving force througout history.  I suspect anyone who doesn't 
want 'more money'.  It is the means of obtaining that which you desire.  It 
is the means of doing that which you wish to do.  It is a far better way of 
doing so than to cut down acres of forest to plant a crop that you barter 
for the same end.

Profit brings advance.

When mining asteroids becomes profitable you'll see amazing advances in 
space travel.  Why?  Because you won't go broke developing a better way.

I'm tired of bashing the rich.  Heck, I wish I were one.  Only when you 
make so much money that it doesn't matter will you not mind losing money on 
an idea that doesn't prove correct.  IBM made billions on the ideas of it's 
pure research that only came to fruit years later (mostly by tapping some 
poor bloke on the shoulder who tried to patent something and say 'Ahem, 
sorry, WE did that years ago.  There's a market now and WE will exploit 
it.'  How?  It could afford pure research.  Combine ambition with desire 
with talent with money.  An unbeatable combination.  SOMEBODY HAS to have 
the wear-withall to finance the others.

When there is a market for an idea, the idea makes money.  You can't 
develop a cold-fusion reactor unless you can afford to develop and build 
one, and no one is going to become homeless hoping to do so.

Perhaps in a 'Star Trek' future when some folk are happy to take your 
filthy stinky trash to the disposal for nothing because they can live in a 
mansion as big as the person happy to run an interplanetary conglomerate 
because anyone can get it for free because there is no money   (but there 
is in the rest of the galaxy so I'm REALLY stumped),  but not in today's 
reality.

Anyway, who says you have to be poor to be famous, feel thrill in your 
achievement, or proud of your accomplishment?

If some physical property comes in units, 1c, 2c, 3c, 4c, ... then that  
property (in this case momentum) is digital, the constant c can be pi, e, or 
any real number except zero, it does not matter. The absolute value of one 
unit is not important, the point is that the difference between one unit and 
the next comes in steps, integers. Digital.

1.3 crests? Is that anything like 1.3 pregnancies? As I said, as you get to 
the end of distance X there will always be uncertainty over whether something 
is a crest or not, but the uncertainty can be made arbitrary small simply
by making X larger because that increases the number of crests you are 
certain about and leaves the number you are uncertain of unchanged. Now you 
have better knowledge about what the momentum is, but because X is now larger
you have less knowledge about where the photon is.


        >Two: the number of crests depends on the frame of reference.  


Everything depends of the frame of reference, except the speed of light. 
All photons will be red shifted or blue shifted, the amount of the shift will 
depends on how fast you're moving relative to the source, and at any instant 
the shift will be a constant for all atoms of any element in the source. 
                         

        >Counting crests of photons is a mental crutch.  


Why? Seems like a perfectly respectable activity to me, absolutely nothing to 
be ashamed of, it's entirely natural, just part of life. Physicists do it, 
engineers do it, even educated technicians do it. Let's do it, let's count 
wave crests.

You can measure the energy of a photon as accurately as you want but
regardless of how good your apparatus is, the more you find out about the 
position of a photon, or anything else for that matter, the less will be
your knowledge of its momentum.

When we say we understand some physical phenomena we mean we have found the

don't understand it, it's only because there is nothing to understand.
        

        >However, an incredible mountain of evidence suggests that quantum 
        >mechanics is how universe works
        

True, but it's not randomness that makes Quantum Mechanics so weird, it's
spooky action at a distance, retroactive causes, and the question of
exactly what an observer is and is not that makes it all so bazaar. The crazy 
experiments that proved Bell's inequality is violated should not have turned 
out the way they did, but they did.

What on earth are you talking about? Plank's constant h comes in units 
momentum times length, wavelength comes in units of length, divide the Plank
constant by wavelength and you get the momentum of the photon, it's true
here, there, and everywhere. Use the Metric system, or the English system, 
or the measuring system favored by the 3 headed 5 armed 7 eyed creatures of 
the Virgo cluster, it doesn't matter in the slightest, c  will still come in 
units of length divided by time, and if you want to find the energy of a 
photon multiply the momentum by the speed of light, and the speed of light is 
a constant, always, everywhere. 


        >in the Universe and in my  current profession c == h == 1.


One what? c and h do not come in the same units, but the units are related, 
sure you could change the size of the units of c and make c whatever you want, 
but then h would have to be fixed.

	We have some questions which we would love to get some feedback on if
there is anyone on the list who is familiar with the problem.
	The overall question is how a protein with a certain sequence of amino
acids takes the form of a unique three dimensional structure in water/body.
 The next level of question to this, what are(is) the most dominating
forces in the formation of the unique structure.  In the 60's an oil drop
in water was suggested and said as the oil in water collapses to a globule
so does a stretched sequence of protein collapses into a globular-like
structure.  This force was/is called hydrophobicity.  Later on it was found
that water around oil/apolar groups in proteins forms very organized
structures known as clathartes/ice-like structures etc.  These "ice-like"
structures have small entropy (high structure)  Until recently the
understanding was up to this point: formation of highly organized
structures around apolar groups.  Recently it has been found that the low
entropy phenomena is not restricted to apolar groups but is found for water
around polar groups as well.  So what do we do?  What is so unique about
water around polar groups (oily matter)?  It has been found it the past few
years that the heat capacity (tendency to absorb heat) around apolar groups
increases while the heat capacity of water around polar groups decreases. 
Can this last observation be reproduced by computer simulations?  Can this
be explained by a reasonable theory?
	If it is understood how water behaves around apolar groups and polar
groups in proteins, it will be easy to understand and predict the formation
of a unique 3-dimensional structure from a sequence of protein.  Hence the
design of a drug from a computer for a diseased protein.
	We would appreciate any discussion of this problem.

Who's this royal we?

Very simple.  The atoms in the protein and the water attract and repel each
other based on well-known calculations based on their distances, charges, and
orbital arrangements from quantum mechanics.  Their movements are constrained
by their covalent bonds, which are also well-understood.  The protein
rearranges itself so the energy stored in all the various bonds and
interactions is minimized.

No, it won't.  The devil is in the details.  To simulate a protein in water,
you need to simulate thousands of atoms in the protein and thousands more in
the water.  The difficulty of the simulation goes up exponentially with the
number of atoms.  The simulations could be programmed today, but the
execution is still in our dreams.

Subject: If God Were a Programmer

 SOME IMPORTANT THEOLOGICAL QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERED IF WE THINK OF GOD AS A
COMPUTER PROGRAMMER.

Q: Does God control everything that happens in my life?
A: He could, if he used the debugger, but it's tedious to step through all
those variables.

Q: Why does God allow evil to happen?
A: God thought he eliminated evil in one of the earlier revs.

Q: Does God know everything?
A: He likes to think so, but he is often amazed to find out what goes on in
the overnight job.

Q: What causes God to intervene in earthly affairs?
A: If a critical error occurs, the system pages him automatically and he
logs on from home to try to bring it up. Otherwise things can wait until
tomorrow.

Q: Did God really create the world in seven days?
A: He did it in six days and nights while living on cola and candy bars.
On the seventh day he went home and found out his girlfriend had left him.

Q: How come the Age of Miracles Ended?
A: That was the development phase of the project, now we are in the
maintenance phase.

Q: Will there be another Universe after the Big Bang?
A: A lot of people are drawing things on the white board, but
doubt that it will ever be implemented.

Q: Who is Satan?
A: Satan is an MIS director who takes credit for more powers than he
actually possesses, so people who aren't programmers are scared of him. God
thinks
of him as irritating but irrelevant.

Q: What is the role of sinners?
A: Sinners are the people who find new and imaginative ways to mess up the
system when God has made it idiot-proof.

Q: Where will I go after I die?
A: Onto a backup tape.

Q: Will I be reincarnated?
A: Not unless there is a special need to recreate you. And searching
backup files is a major hassle, so if there is a request for you, God will
just
say that the tape has been lost.

Q: Am I unique and special in the universe?
A: There are over 10,000 major university and corporate sites running
exact duplicates of you in the present release version.

Q: What is the purpose of the universe?
A: God created it because he values elegance and simplicity, but then the
users and managers demanded he tack senseless features onto it and now
everything is more complicated and expensive than ever.

Q: If I pray to God, will he listen?
A: You can waste his time telling him what to do, or you can just get off
his back and let him program.

Q: What is the one true religion?
A: All systems have their advantages and disadvantages, so just pick the
one that best suits your needs and don't let anyone put you down.

Q: How can I protect myself from evil?
A: Change your password every month and don't make it a name, a common
word, or a date like your birthday.

Q: Some people claim they hear the voice of God. Is this true?
A: They are much more likely to receive e-mail.

Q: Some people say God is Love.
A: That is not a question. Please restate your query in the form of a
question. Abort, Retry, Fail?

<h2>ALL SPACE IS <em>NOT</em> EQUAL: PHYSICISTS FIND AXIS THAT GIVES THE UNIVERSE ORIENTATION</h2><p>
<p><p>
<p><p>
<h4>April 17, 1997</h4><p><p>

     Physicists at the University of Rochester and the University of Kansas have found evidence that flies in the face
of the long-held belief that space is the same in all directions (isotropic). In fact, measurements indicate something
seldom considered by physicists: that the universe has an
orientation. The unexpected finding, determined by measuring the polarization of light as it travels to Earth from the
far reaches of the universe, is the subject of a paper in the
April 21 issue of <i>Physical Review Letters</i>.<p>

     The work, which may be one of the most fundamental findings about the universe in recent years, could affect
physicists' views about the birth of the universe and suggests that scientists will need to explore how Einstein's
theory of relativity and the theory of electromagnetism might explain the finding. That's quite an impact from an effect
so tiny that it's betrayed only by light traveling across most of the observable universe, from 15 billion years ago.
Physicists have dubbed the effect the "corkscrew effect" for the way it twists light crossing the heavens.<p>

     "The big news is that perhaps not all space is equal, for as far back as we can peer in time," says Borge Nodland
of the University of Rochester.<p>

     Adds co-investigator John Ralston of the University of Kansas: "The shocking thing about our result is that there
seems to be an absolute axis, a kind of cosmological north star that orients the universe. We don't really know yet what
this axis represents."<p>

     This axis of orientation is not a physical entity but rather defines a direction of space that somehow determines
how light travels through the universe. In effect, Ralston and Nodland have discovered a direction in space that is out
of the ordinary or different from all other directions. The idea that any direction of space is in any way "special" has
long been taboo among astrophysicists.<p>

     "This work defies the notion that there is no 'up' or 'down' in space," says Nodland, research fellow at
Rochester's Theory Center for Optical Science and Engineering.<p>

     From Earth, the axis of this orientation runs toward the constellation Sextans, roughly in the direction of Leo and
Gemini and high in the southern evening sky this time of year. The other end of the axis points toward the
constellations Aquila and Equuleus. (Stargazers, of course, will see nothing special when they look in that direction.)
Nodland and Ralston, a professor of physics and astronomy at Kansas, say the axis might have several interpretations: It
could be an intrinsic property of the universe, or it might indicate that an undiscovered particle, such as the long-
theorized axion, is at work.<p>

     The team made the finding by studying the polarization (orientation of electric fields) of radio waves from 160
distant galaxies as measured in previous experiments by
astronomers around the world. Nodland and Ralston found that the plane of polarization of the light rotates like a
corkscrew as the light travels through space, and that the orientation
of the universal axis that they've discovered is key to the amount of rotation. The rotation of polarization depends on
the angle at which the light moves relative to the axis and on the distance the light travels before being measured. The
effect is crudely analogous to that of a crystal that twists light depending on the direction light is traveling through
the crystal.<p>

     Astronomers have long known about a somewhat similar effect called the Faraday effect, which is caused by magnetic
fields between galaxies and causes the plane of polarization of light to rotate as the light travels through space. The
newly discovered effect is in addition to the Faraday effect.<p>

     Though the cause of the corkscrew effect remains unknown, in their paper the team constructs a mathematical theory
that explains the observations. The data indicate that light actually travels through space at two slightly different
speeds. Such a mismatch in speeds would cause the polarization plane to rotate in a well known manner, in a way that
physics students see when they pass light through corn syrup and look at the light with polarizing filters. This
corkscrew effect is far more subtle, though: Light traveling across the heavens undergoes one full rotation of its plane
of polarization about once in a billion years.<p>

     Whatever the cause, the work could have widespread
implications. Scientists have long theorized that the Big Bang was completely symmetric. Says Nodland: "Perhaps it was
not a perfect Big Bang, but a Big Bang with a twist to space and
time." Such a twist would be seen today as a ripple of
non-uniformity, perhaps as the axis (an "axis of anisotropy") represents.<p>

     Much more speculatively, the work may provide some of the first experimental evidence for physicists who have
theorized the existence of other universes. If our universe was asymmetric at creation, and symmetry in the cosmos is
maintained as many physicists believe, it raises the possibility of the simultaneous creation of another universe with
an opposite twist.<p>

     The work also seems to run counter to the notions that all space is uniform and that the speed of light in a vacuum
is always precisely the same, key assumptions of the theory of special relativity.<p>

     Though the researchers say there's only a few chances in a thousand that the result comes from statistical
fluctuations, they stress the need for other scientists to
confirm their results.<p>

     Questions about the universe and our role in it have
fascinated Nodland ever since he can remember, filling his
mind as he took long hikes while growing up in his native
Norway.<p>

     "I've always had a passionate interest in the universe and its origins," he says. "We're on a little planet going
around some burning mass that we call a sun, in a certain region of space. What is this space, and why are we here? The
universe is amazing, and I want to know the most I can about it."<p>

     The team's work is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation, the New York State
Energy Research and Development Authority, and the Kansas Science and Technology Advanced Research (KSTAR) program.<p>

Actually I think the inverse problem is much more interesting. (I 
also think it also to be much harder).

The most dominating? Volume exclusion. At biological energy levels no two 
atoms may occupy the same place. Second by stringence: no covalent bond 
may break (ignoring autocatalytical scissile bond activity, which is Rare).

Uh, it is more than crude. It is an important contribution, but without 
other's contribution impact your Hamiltonian is entirely bogus.

Clathrate domains are long and well known structures. In fact water has 
nanoscopic, fluctuating ice domains. Methane/water clathrate is very well 
known due to its propensity to clog up siberian gas pipelines. Modeling 
methane aggregation in a water box is very well known PFP toy model.

PFP people are a heterogenous field, there is very little dogma there.

Why is heat capacity of such an interest to you? _Which_ heat capacity? 
Besides, I doubt heat capacity has much relevance in nanocluster domain.
Modeling? Sure you can model that.

Oh no. You forgot the oompteen other contributions. Trivial example: two 
helices interact strongly, being macroscopical dipoles. And water is not 
the only context, what about phospholipid bilayers? Assymetric bilayers? 
How about influence of protein history upon tertiary structure? 
Disulfides require certain redox potential, and chaperonines have some 
crucial aspects to the fate of misfolded proteins. Being under kinetical 
control, ribosome outlet channel/transmembrane transport protein pore 
geometry has a distinct impact on tert structure.

Context is crucial: in vivo may fold different from in vitro.

Easy it is not. PFP, and particularly IPFP require dedicated hardware and 
novel algorithms to be usable. Coming soon to a site near you.

Let's discuss antihelmintica instead. Tapeworms are fascinating creatures.

Eugene Leitl forwarded this page:
http://www.rochester.edu/pr/releases/phys/borge.htm
which I also learned of via physics news:
http://www.aip.org/physnews/graphics/astro/1997/aniso/

It's based on Borge Nodland's thesis work, which he completed in
1995, but its just now being publicized because it appears in the
21Apr97 Phys Rev Letters.

Nodland describes the effect as the sort of thing produced by magnetic
fields, but dismisses mag field correlations on billion light year
scales as improbable, and so opts for saying the speed of light is
anisotropic.  Having just heard a talk here at Caltech on the
mysteriously large strength of most large scale (including galactic)
magnetic fields, I'm inclined to guess that there really are billion ly
scale correlations of magnetic fields.

I think that the next 15-20 years will be a golden era for empirical
and hopefully also theoretical cosmology.  There are so many projects
that promise to bring lots more data in soon on 10 billion light year
scales, which should finally give theorists some real concrete clues.
The next 20 years will be the time we finally learn the overall
structure of the universe that we hope to spend the next 10+ billion
years colonizing (assuming no FTL).

Indroduction to the ICMSB'97
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The first International Conference on Molecular Structural Biology (ICMSB=
)
took place in Vienna in September 1995, and was very well received by all=
 who
took part, including over 200 participants from more than 20 countries
wordwide.
The organisers are pleased to announce the Second ICMSB, which will take =
place
from the 10th to 14th September 1997, and will feature internationally re=
nowned
speakers. The conference, which will focus on topics covering a number of=
 the
most exciting areas in the field, will be opened by one of the
pioneers of molecular structural bioloby, Dr.Max Perutz. The following fo=
ur
days of the conference will include sessions on Structure and Prediction,=

Macromolecular Interactions, Catalysis and Design, and Folding.

Vienna - A Unique Conference Location
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The conference will again be located at the Bundeswirtschaftskammer in Vi=
enna.
The city is a particularly attractive location for a conference, with its=

combination of historical buildings, green parks, and modern architecture=
=2E
Some of the most famous city sights include Sch=F6nbrunn Palace and the H=
ofburg,
former homes of the Habsburgs, St. Stephans Cathedral, and the colourful

Several years ago I read (and reported here on) a book called "The Big
Bang Never Happened".  The author challenged conventional theories about
the formation and evolution of the universe.  He proposed that large
scale dynamics were dominated by electromagnetic interactions rather
than gravitational ones.  He had some pictures of plasmas which resembled
the shapes of galaxies, with spirals, etc.

Most theories that totally contradict the conventional wisdom turn out to
be wrong, so this one probably is, too.  But Robin's comment about the
possibility of very large scale, strong magnetic fields reminded me of
this earlier theory.  There are a lot of things which cosmologistsy can't
explain, so the door is not yet closed on alternatives.

Transhumans,

My article/interview on the Singularity has FINALLY been published in latest
issue (#23) of 21C--Scanning the Future, under the title Mind Children,
 starting on page 46.  If I may say so, it looks terrific.  Featured are the
comments of transhumans you all know and love, John K. Clark, Daniel C
Clemmenson, Eric Watt Forste, Eugene Leitl, Sara Kathryn Marr, and Anders
Sandberg, as well as comments by science fiction author Vernor Vinge.  In the
same issue, Mark Dery (author of Escape Velocity) does an in depth interview
with Vinge.

Thank you all.

As a journalist, semantics interests me greatly. Especially the
use of E-Prime.

Are there any other E-Prime users out there? Can any1 suggest some good
books, I have read RAWilson's Quantum Psychology and would like expand
my search further.

The talk I heard said that magnetic field energy densities are
comparable to gravitational potential densities for many large scale
structures such as large molecular clouds.

Not having been part of the Old List, last summer I too posted a 
review of Eric Lerner's book which Hal mentions.  Unlike Hal's post, 
mine is in the archives at
http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.96/0195.html
if anyone is interested. (Most of my post was a summary of Lerner's 
comments on the philosophy of science, though, rather than the details 
of plasma cosmology.)

Yes, I find these Anisotropic Universe comments interesting in light 
of the recent thread where it was suggested that the only ones still 
questioning the Big Bang theory were creationists.

[BEGIN FOWARDED MESSAGE]

Hey, maybe those black-helicopter paranoiacs aren't so crazy after all...


- -----[no forwards to snip, just pure copyright violation]-----


Army's anti-terrorist drills frighten, anger city dwellers

BY DANA PRIEST
Washington Post

WASHINGTON -- A dozen U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopters, their lights
out, descended from the night sky March 4 on a corner of Charlotte, N.C.
They swooped among the high-rise apartment buildings, then dropped
dozens of special operations troops, some with their weapons blasting,
into an abandoned warehouse to capture a group of ``terrorists.''

Some terrified residents grabbed their guns. Others ducked into
doorways. The 911 line went crazy, as did Mayor Pat McCrory's telephone
line.

``I could barely hear the callers because of the helicopter noise and
the gunfire in the background,'' McCrory recalled.

Neither McCrory nor his police chief was sure what was going on. But
they had a clue: Three months earlier, two men in jeans and T-shirts
from the secretive U.S. Army Special Operations Command had visited
McCrory's office to ask permission to conduct urban counterterrorism
exercises they said would go unnoticed. McCrory signed a confidentiality
statement agreeing not to disclose the event beforehand for national
security's sake.

``We were misled,'' said McCrory, who was forced by the public outcry to
kick the Army out of Charlotte after the first of what was to have been
three days of urban anti-terrorism training.

``How they thought you could come in and out without any disturbance is
beyond me. It was almost like a blitzkrieg operation. People went and
got their guns. I feel fortunate no one was hurt.''

Over the last three years, the U.S. Army Special Operations Command has
conducted at least 21 such exercises in 21 U.S. cities, including
Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, New Orleans,
Miami, Pittsburgh and Seattle.

In city after city, the exercises have drawn fire from frightened
residents who are not told beforehand that the several roaring
helicopters flying in circles several hundred feet overhead late at
night -- blacked out except for a tiny red taillight for safety -- are
trying to get as close as possible to the buildings they appear about to
crash into.

The confusion and fear caused by their invasion is compounded when
residents see dark-suited figures slide down ropes dangling from the
choppers and then begin firing loud blanks from their assault weapons.



Real explosives

The simulated sound of grenades and incoming artillery often follows, as
does, in some cases, the sound of real, small breaching explosives used
to blast open doors.

To top it off, local police are on hand to keep traffic away from the
exercise site -- typically an abandoned warehouse, jail or apartment
building -- but often refuse to tell motorists what the commotion is all
about.

News media offices and 911 operators, who are not alerted to the
exercises beforehand, also cannot provide information. Several callers
to state law enforcement agencies have been told to call the Defense
Department in Washington.

Last June, troops were forced to leave Pittsburgh early because of the
uproar. In Houston, a night's exercise was cut short when a helicopter
landed hard, rolled over and its two occupants were hospitalized.
Thousands of callers to local media there demanded that the troops leave
town. ``Who invited them?'' demanded one caller.

Lt. Col. Pete Pierce of Special Operations Command said the Army
retreated early from Charlotte because the operations were more
disruptive than anticipated. He said people on the streets closest to
the exercises were notified just before the maneuvers but, he added,
``in the process of notification, people are going to get missed.''

Army officials argue that only cities give troops the chance to work on
real-life challenges, such as using night-vision equipment in partially
lit areas, avoiding power lines and dropping troops quickly enough to go
virtually unnoticed by the citizenry.



Safety in secrecy

It is safer for the troops to descend in secret than to alert residents
and risk the sightseeing crowds that would gather, said one Army
official, who added: ``And they don't want their equipment photographed.
They don't want their tactics, operations and procedures known.''

As the threat of urban terrorism abroad has increased, Army officials
say it has become all the more important that their troops be skilled at
flying into an urban obstacle course of skyscrapers and towers and
inserting teams of special operations troops: Green Berets, Rangers, the
160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment and the super-secret Delta
Force. Such troops would likely be deployed abroad to rescue hostages,
capture enemies and kill terrorists.

``I can't imagine there isn't an American around who wouldn't want these
guys to be as good as they can be,'' said Army Lt. Col. Ray Whitehead.
``This is real serious stuff.''

The exercises also draw criticism from citizens worried that the Army
may be secretly training local police and SWAT teams, which is forbidden
by U.S. law under most circumstances.

The possible participation of U.S. troops in the 1993 Branch Davidian
debacle near Waco, Texas, in which more than 80 people died, is still
hotly debated within some circles.



Alliances restricted

U.S. law greatly restricts the type of training the military may conduct
with domestic law enforcement agencies. Pierce said local law
enforcement agencies only provide support by blocking off roads, for
example. Never, he said, did they train with special operations troops.

But some local police believe that joint training is part of the
exercise.

Such was the case in Pittsburgh, where the Army brought in 14
helicopters and 200 special forces troops last June.

Craig Edwards, assistant superintendent of the Allegheny County Police
Department, said the Army exercise was ``a big joint effort'' that
trained city and county SWAT police. ``We thought it went extremely
well. Naturally, being police officers, we thought it was extremely
necessary.''

But asked for a further description of the training, Lt. Bert Cifrulak,
Pittsburgh's SWAT team leader, said Edwards was mistaken. ``We conducted
no training with them and we provided no training,'' he said. ``We sort
of acted like tour guides'' by identifying sites, he said.

Do a web search on "general semantics", or follow the links from Anders'
pages.  There's plenty of stuff on the net.  Also check out my personal
favorite language, Lojban, at <http://xiron.pc.helsinki.fi/lojban/>.

Could someone provide some pointers to this discussion?  A url in the
archives would be wonderful, Words to search on would be fine.

Ob discussion comment:
This points out one of the flaws in mailing lists as a medium for design
decisions.  There's no support for a sense of history, so it has to be
created socially.  Now, when is that Foresight Institute test of HyperG
starting?

Don't you think the discussion of Cartesian doubt, combinatorial
explosion, hallucinations, dreams and stuff in the intro rings*extremely
* true? About how the brain seems to throw out possible meanings, and
will try and interpret even a bit of noise to carry *some* sort of signal,
and how that's the likely explanation of dreams and hallucinations?

It particularly rings true for me if I ever get any hallucinations
nowadays:- I feel I can catch the mechanicalness of it in action now,
it's just me throwing out possible identifications of things, visual,
linguistic, aural, mental, associational meanings, significances:-   

"I thought I saw a banker's clerk descending from a bus, I looked again 
and saw it was a hippopotamus." (a Crowley skit) 

or

"Did he just say what I thought he said? " (at a party, say)

for example.

And *none* of it is *necessarily* to be taken seriously just because it 
*feels* seriously like it's the real meaning of the situation at the
time, and your critical faculty happens to be relaxed.

On the other hand, none of it is necessarily *not* to be taken seriously,
and must be judged also when sober (as apparently the Vikings would do -
judge everything twice, once drunk, once sober); and may indeed be judged
true, and may in fact be true.

It's good to know that we can actually order Esfandiary's books from 
somewhere, as they are out of print.  And, yes, they are worth 
reading, especially to find out the origins of the concept of 
transhumanity.

I use E-Prime.  It helps me to break out of those easy patterns of 
thought that can create traps for writers, by forcing me to consider 
the actual relations and consequences between objects and actors.  
Unfortunately, when used online, E-Prime can create the impression 
that the user has a cold personality (as has been mentioned to me by 
various readers of my posts who have met me in person).  I've 
concluded that in general list postings, mixing in a few 'is' 
constructions makes a post read more like a conversation.

An E-prime web site with an excellent bibliography can be located 
through any web search engine by entering the key words 'general 
semantics'.

I'd forgotten about Mark's review of Lerner's book.  I have problems
with the idea of a universe infinite in time, though.  Intuition says
there should be a beginning somewhere.  Intuition may be wrong, but not
in any way I can grasp.  And it seems to make the Fermi paradox much
worse.

I like Bank's twist on 'continuous creation'.  Stuff is constantly being
generated, but not within our universe.  Whole universes are expanding
from the singularity, like a cosmic onion.  Nice compromise.

	A couple of weeks ago, we had the opportunity to thumb through a weekly
American magazine called TIME, perhaps you have heard of it.  It is filled
with short, shallow articles on a variety of topics.  One article was about
encryption for computers which would make it too expensive for the State to
break.  This was tied in with E-Money being the new world currency. 
Scenario:  With encryption on our PC we have secrecy concerning our
financial affairs if we use E-Money.  The spread of E-Money will break the
STATE/BANKS and their monopoly on the money supply.  It will also cause the
collapse of governments because of the vastly increased underground economy
which cannot be taxed.  
	The  author seemed to be unaware that the STATE could very easily tax
something that cannot be hidden, such as real estate, which they do
already.  So the STATE might be thwarted in attacking production and merely
take its share of the "action" via the spot where our home or business is
located.  The BANKS would lose their nice marriage to the STATE and would
have to compete on the open market.  With property tax, people get one tax
bill, no forms to fill out, just a bill marked "Pay this amount....." 
Renters pay with greatly increased rent.  Businesses use property
efficiently.  Land speculation goes bust.  Property values drop.  The only
way out of paying taxes is to have your home or business off of STATE
controlled real estate.  (although the effect of taxes, reflected in the
higher cost of goods and services, would still be experienced).
	That, my friends, suggests Cities, Floating on the Sea and in the Air. 
Private Cities, which provide (no roads of course...who would need them?)
the structure for living, playing, working.  Cities, which compete by
giving better service for less.  Cities, which provide the space for
automated hydroponic farms.  Cities, freed from the STATE.  Cities,
providing all the variety or sameness one wishes.  (Although EXTROS,
midgets, and animal trainers would probably not find a City just for
them.....perhaps a neighborhood..........a BIG neighborhood, mind you...)  
:-)
	Well, we can just let our imagination run rampant with orgasmic joy at the
changes to be wrought by the creation of a tool for war.  (The Internet, of
course.)  It looks like it is going to eat its MAKER.  My, my...the times
they are a changin...

I'm in the process of putting together a web-site which is an hybrid
between online debate, ezine, gallery, literary magazine, scientific
journal...

I shan't waste list space by going through the details here, except to say
that the venture is very future-orientated, and subscribes to many of the
principles of tranhumanism and Extropianism, but also seeks to
contextualize the present through an understanding of histories.

Right now, the project is in its formative stages, but in order for it to
grow I need contributors and collaborators. If you are interested, or
simply wish to see how things are going, please drop by the site, where
full details are available. The crf web site is accessed via:

http://dialspace.dial.pipex.com/sarah.marr/index.html

Please consider it in terms of potential, as well as current content. If
you would like to contribute, collaborate, take part on future debates, be
kept informed of developments, etc. then please contact me via the 'join
crf' page. Other comments can be sent via the 'guest book'.

Thanks for your time and bandwidth.

Sarah

An intriguing and incredibly detailed account of these issues, in the form
of a running recursive debate, is THEISM, ATHEISM AND BIG BANG COSMOLOGY,
by William Lane Craig and Quentin Smith (Clarendeon Press, Oxford, 1993),
in which Craig (the god-botherer of the two) argues impressively for `the
impossibility of the existence of an actual infinite' - that is, an
ontologically instantiated one (sorry for the mouthful).  They are both
horrid to Stephen Hawking for impeccable reasons, BTW.

Lerner's revised edition of THE BIG BANG NEVER HAPPENED has a post-COBE
intro, which makes what looks to me like a good case for the standard
Smootoid interpretation being blatant codswallop.  I don't have the book
handy, but there's some key point about scaling parameters that shocked me
greatly.  I've never seen his criticism answered by any of the Bang
hotshots.  (George Smoot's WRINKLES IN TIME lists Lerner's book, but calls
him `Learner', which might suggest that he did not actually, you know,
like, *read* the bugger...)

IMHO, if I wait for the human results for life extension double blind
studies to come in, I'll already be dead. By the time the studies come
in for intelligence enhancers, I expect I will already be senile.

It's your life, do as you like, and be aware that avoidance of risk can
itself be risky.

There's an ancient way of handling discussion which might apply here. It
is called the "talking stick". The Email version would work like this:

1. The discussion thread is stated on the Exi List. All interested
persons email the announcing person and indicate if they are participant
or lurker.

2. The announcing person creates a CC list from the incoming emails and
sends to the CC list two lists: The CC list and the list of
participants.

3. A "talking stick" is created, which defines who has the "floor". This
is initially the first person on the participant list. 

4. The participant makes a posting and indicates who is to post next
(gets the "talking stick"). This is always the next member of the
participant list. If the participant does not want to post, h/she posts
a brief message passing on the "talking stick". The last participant on
the list passes the "talking stick" to the first person on the list.

5. The discussion is ended when two passes through the participant list
result in no more postings, or by all participants agreeing to a motion
ending the discussion.

Simple, effective, no fancy tech needed.

BTW, more than one "talking stick" can be in circulation, for example a
list of 20 participants may have two sticks at 10 person intervals. It
might be useful to limit responses by a participant to the previous 10
postings in this case....

I too can catch the mechanism. I was at the ballet recently and I was
extremely tired. I kept falling half-asleep, and I closed my eyes as
I prefer the music to the dancing (Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty).

Everytime I came back to "normal" awareness I kept perceiving the stage as
a movie screen and the dancers as merely 2 dimensional figures on that
screen. I could almost feel my brain doing this and I could also gain some
control over how I perceived it.

I have only been to the ballet three times in my life, but I go to the
cinema at least 4 times a month. It seems that in a confused hypnogogic
(?) state my brain chose the most obvious (familiar) framework for the
sensory stimulation it was receiving. If I were a ballet freak and only
went to the cinema on a few occasions no doubt I would have seen Ralph
Fiennes and Kirsten Scott Thomas doing a pas de deux, or maybe Woody Allen
doing a few high kicks.


I think these 'slips of the mind' are interesting because they can show us
how our mind really works. Robert Anton Wilson was once walking in a well
known gay district of SF. This fact was on his mind and he saw a sign for
"All-Gay-Cleaners", the slip of the mind gave him an insight into what was
on his mind at the time.

Similarly, my ageing Grandmother only hears what she wants to hear and
manages to ignore anything which might annoy of offend her.

On a personal note my mind-slips have been very enlightening, I always try
to find a cause for them and usually it is some deep-prejudice or anxiety.
Perhaps 'mind-slip', like the Freudian-slip, is a good name after all.

Being a resident of a State (New Hampshire) which derives roughly 2/3 of
its tax revenues from property taxes, I think I can comment on this with
some authority (we also have no income or sales tax, though there is a
rooms and meals tax, a professional services tax, cigarette taxes, as
well as state lottery and state control of liquor sales). If I
illustrate my own situation at the moment I think you can uderstand the
economic impacts.

I accept temporary design, CAD, webauthoring, and desktop publishing
jobs, and average between $10-15 per hour, though 1/3 of my time is free
between jobs. I'm paying about 10% of my income to uncle sam in income
taxes, plus about 15% in everything else (SS, WC, etc..) Business is
starting to pick up as this area begins to become more computerized.

I live in Lebanon, NH, a city of 12,000 on the Conneticutt river, with
immediately to the north, Hanover, NH, home of Dartmouth College. The
area has a total of 45,000 people in mostly rural surroundings. We are
one hour from Concord NH, and two from the Massachusetts border. We
currently have very low unemployment, estimated at around 2.5% or less.
There are three pages plus of help wanted ads in the paper.

Rent on a one room apartment varies through the area, but here in
Lebanon, rent typically is between $400-600 per month. Electricity costs
are $0.10 per kWh with comparably high heating oil and propane costs
(natural gas is not available). Property taxes are around $4,000 on a
$110,000 house annually. This $110,000 house I am using is in an upper
middle class neighborhood, has 2,200 square feet and is on a 3/4 acre
lot on top of a hill with a great view. The house has a septic system
rather than sewage, has a paved driveway with a 2 car garage, 2
bathrooms and four bedrooms.

THere are towns with much lower property tax rates, but about the only
thing to do in those areas is spiking deer out of season and incest with
your sisters.

Culturally, there is little to do, except for what is available at
Dartmouth, though the local opera house has regular musical
performances, and the small six plex theatre at the local mall. Being on
the NH/VT border, Lebanon has a huge amount of shopping centers (VT has
an 8% sales tax) and retail space ranges from $10-20 per square foot.
The intersection of Interstates 89 and 91 right across the river help
funnel Vermont and Quebecois shoppers to our area.

As for government, NH has the largest legislative body in the world, so
with a state population of just over 1,000,000 representatives still
have a close relationship with their constituents, (I know at least one
of mine personally) and they only get paid $400 per year plus gas money
to do their jobs, and are only in session for I beleive two months of
the year. The state tax burden, when measured as a percentage of income,
is second lowest only to Alaska, I beleive, and we used to be first in
the country. Its around 2.5-3.0% of income.

We also have the lowest expenditures per student on education in the
country, yet consistently score in the top 5% of states on SAT tests (we
were once first for several years running, when our expenditures were at
their lowest rate).

As for the cost of living, I would say that a single person needs to
make at least $8.50 an hour just to tread water around here. My little
brother makes $15 an hour on average delivering pizza and is supporting
his family of three and slowly getting ahead.

Yes, when political power resides mainly in local bodies, the locality
will be a direct reflection on those who weild power locally. Hanover, a
white collar/intelligentsia/alumni town is quite progressive, while its
bedroom hamlets of Etna and Lyme are extreme NIMBY practitioners of the
rich and hermit celebrity sort.
Lebanon is more average, with a normal level of buddy buddy corruption
in city gov't, with a cultural impasse between natives and Taxachusetts
carpetbaggers.

Excellent idea Sarah.  As discussed, I will gladly contribute and

You should visit the First Millennial Foundation's Web site at  
http://www.millennial.org/  to see a great idea for building ocean communities.  
More than an idea these people are already making real-world head-way into 
making it a reality.  They are already experimenting with a working OTEC in 
Hawaii and an extensive integrated polyculture.

Alas, too late!  Scientific American says recent studies show telomere
lengths vary greatly down and up during regular cell processes!  So their
key-to-aging status has become dubious.

!! Which is pretty bad!

However, there is a difference: school is at least ostensibly for the
benefit of the student.  "Service" is for the benefit of others.  So
its message is that one has a duty to serve others as *they* see fit,
and that's even worse than the message of compulsory schooling (that
one should let others decide what one should learn).

>I believe the Extropians, on the whole, seriously lack an appreciation

Those libertarians among us (probably the ones you're thinking of)
have a *very* serious idea of an individual's obligation to the community,
and where that obligation ends.  I'm obliged to peacefully coexist with
others, and that is it, period.  I think you who fail to appreciate
everyone's obligation *not* to impose (whether individually or as groups)
on others.  By approving compusory service, you are being a bad citizen.
You are failing to treat your community with the respect you owe it.

Each person deserves respect as an individual, and has the right
to *choose* his or her connections--or disconnections-- with others.

>No man is an island.

That's a reminder, a piece of advice, to each person.
It's *not* a compusion to follow someone else's idea of service.
I wonder whether the author [Bartlett's fails me] would approve
your use of that line.

>Anyone who calls community service "servitude" doesn't know what the
>word means.

And vice versa.  Let's not confuse slavery with true service.
The main question is whether one's service is voluntary or not.  An
additional question is, who is being served?  The actual community or
an organization that happens to claim to represent the community?
Who is deciding what form "service" should take?

I believe compulsory associations make people into enemies and
destroy true community.  I can't thank you for promoting that.

Hmm, how about an 'insurance' company set up that takes in payments on a 
timed basis (say, quarterly).  This money is used for research with enough 
investment to provide payments.  The members designees are given a payment 
if a life extension mechanism is not developed prior to the members death 
AND the member does not die of a cause (such as traumatic accident) that 
the life extension mechanism could help. I imagine the legal woes are 
awesome as the current insurance companies would surely do this if it was 
feasible (they want you to pay in as long as possible).  I also suppose 
there would have to be some age limit put in.

I wonder what would be the minimum to allow such a thing.  $25/quarter 
would allow $100 million/year if a million folk bought into it ($10 
million/year if only 100,000 members).  For a 35/15/50 split of 
investment/administration/research would this make a fair start?  Is 
$100/year too much to ask?  What would be a reasonable sum?  What would be 
a valid payment upon natural death?  When the life extension became a 
reality what would the contributors get ... equal shares/amount invested in 
all profits ... or only contributors get the benefits?  Also, who/how would 
the research be corrobarated, as well as the investments?

10 years with 1 million inital and faithful members would be $500 million 
purely for research.  What is the minimum amount needed for research?

I was just looking at life insurance and a thought came to me.  Would it 
be
in the best interests of life insurance companies to pledge support of 
life
extension?  There are numerous variables to take into account like how 
many
people die in accidents and such things that are not related to aging.  As
I am not an actuary I would not want to attempt taking all of these 
factors
into account.  If anyone has any less data intensive ideas that might shed

ACH!  Required community service?  Certainly sounds like 'serve Big 
Brother' to me.  A good idea if everyone believes in the exact same things 
(the definition of 'heaven' or total societal brainwashing) but a very BAD 
idea if society allows dissent.  There cannot be a universal consent of 
'community service', unless it's so watered down as to mean only sweeping 
the streets.  A misdeamenor punishment requiring this for those who trash 
the streets sounds much better.

And vice versa.  Let's not confuse slavery with true service.
The main question is whether one's service is voluntary or not.  An
additional question is, who is being served?  The actual community or
an organization that happens to claim to represent the community?
Who is deciding what form "service" should take?

Whenever I work at an event, I produce a piece of artwork to reflect 
upon its significance, such as a tape or a photo montage.  This time it 
takes the form of an online vigniette.  Feel free to forward it to 
anyone--enjoy!

*********************************************************************

I have taken a brief trip into the future and been given the 
opportunity to see how beautiful it will be.  I have returned with a 
renewed sense of hope and optimism for the path that can be taken by 
humanity in its evolution.

My journey began this morning as I dressed for my expedition, pulling 
on a pair of jeans and selecting an appropriate t-shirt ('If Gays and 
Lesbians are given civil rights, everyone will want them').  Digging 
through the pile of shoes in my closet, I found my combat boots, the pair 
which survived hundred of hours of marching, chanting, patrolling, 
holding the line.  Those were more confrontational days, and at times I 
had felt as battered as the worn leather that for nine years had pounded 
asphalt, concrete, mud.  As I bent to lace the eyelets, I smiled to 
think that at the decrepit age of 32 I was coming out of retirement again 
to lend experience to the kids, the youth, the ones who come after to 
claim their own piece of respect.  They weren't going to let me 
enjoy that rocking chair just yet.

Despite the sunshine, an icy wind tore through my clothing as I 
walked down to Dupont Circle.  Would people show?  But they were 
already there, milling in anticipation, setting up booths, readying 
the stage.  No counterprotesters in sight.  The police were relaxed 
and chatty as I reviewed the day's schedule.  Youth Pride was going to 
happen.  As the sun continued to warm, men and women of all ages 
filtered into the circle.  Some brought their dogs.  Some dressed 
in rainbow colors or printed t-shirts.  Some wore vinyl with metallic 
lipstick.  The drag performers splashed vividly in hues of bright green 
and purple, vamping and flirting their way through the crowd.  

The hours blended into a series of sensual impressions.  Jessica Xavier, 
transgender activist extraordinaire, doing hotlicks on the electric 
guitar.  Two girls kissing for a photographer.  A mod guy from the 
Polyester Liberation Organization adjusting his tie.  Sista Face 
braving the chill in an evening gown to give it up to the crowd.  A 
nervous girl about to give her first speakout.  Friends huddled 
together on the grass.  A dog wearing a backstage pass on his collar.

These were youth that had experienced taunts from schoolmates, physical 
assaults, parental betrayal, drug addictions, the worst of treatment 
from everyone, and they were not here to shake their fist.  My 
generation had pounded on the door until it opened a crack, now was 
the time to offer a hand through it.  Today was for saying to the world:  
here I am, I exist, I love, I hope, I dream, I struggle.  They had 
created within this circle of grass a new world, one in which everyone 
could express their individual beauty without restraint.  It would only 
last five hours, but each of them would carry the strength of this 
experience, the knowledge that it could be done, into the larger world.  
In the words of my friend Shelly, spoken by her lover Heidi:

	There is no box that can hold me.  There is no
	category that defines me.  I live outside the
	oppressive binary society.  I live in the margins 
	of the marginalized, because that is where I find
	reality.  That is where I find 3-dimensional thinking
	that comprehends more than just X and Y.  That is 
	where I find room enough to breathe.

dignity of all young people as they discover their identity as gay, 
lesbian, bisexual, transgendered or straight, visit their web site at

Hello Extropians,

I listened to a NPR radio show today about a survey of scientists as to
whether they believe in the existence of a God.   60% don't have any
belief in a God and 40% have varying degrees of belief including one who
called Jesus Christ the most knowledgeable scientist to walk the earth.

The monitor quoted Albert Einstein as referring to a God, indicating
that he had a belief in God but detested the Judeo-Christian God.  I
hear the quote that Einstein said that God did not throw dice in the
creation of the universe.

Heisenberg was referred to as having a belief in a unifying principle.

Could someone comment on the above and give the scientific viewpoint on
God, a metaphysical soul etc.

I found the comments of Anders Sandberg in reference to NDE to be very
informative.  I have a co-worker who had an alleged NDE experience 20
years ago which changed her life.  It seems to have the reprogramming
aspects that Anders referred to.

GENISIS: Tower Of Babel (Ge:11:1-8)

 Now world had one language, common speech.
Man moved eastward, found plain in Shinar, settled.
Man said "Come, make brick, bake thoroughly.".
Man used brick, tar.
Man said "Come, build city, build tower, reach heaven,
make name for us, not scatter over world face.".

 Lord saw tower.
Lord said "One people speaking one language building this will defeat all.
Come, let us confuse language of man.".

 Lord confused language of world, scattered man over world face.
Man stopped building city.
City was Babel.

God is used as a label for the experience of X.

In my (limited) experience, X is either felt as something outside onself
and bigger than oneself, or it is yourself, or unity (all is one etc.).

Both can be described as God, or not. God seems to be a good metaphor,
or label, or personification, for some outer or inner
intelligence/power/&c.

Quantum physicists can talk about nonlocal Information Systems, or Hidden
Variables within the science game but it is clear that these concepts
could equally be labelled God, or divine.

Fritjof Capra, like Einstein, doesn't seem to like the Judeo-Christian God
but he found quantum physics and Eastern Mysticism to be VERY compatible,
especially the unity and oneness aspects.

For me, at the moment, God is just Nick Herbert's Cosmic Glue that must
exist is Bell' Theorem is valid. Or God is really just me, the higher
circuits in my own primate brain.

You are speaking from theory.  In reality, I don't think anyone has yet
shown that a society without compulsion can compete with other societies
in the real world.  I am aware that there are some good ideas floating
around about how to provide for common defense without military
conscription, create an educated electorate and a healthy
information-service-based economy without compulsory schooling, provide a
stable money supply without a government monopoly on coinage, etc. But
until they have been proven to work, it's silly to get indignant about it.

Maybe you have a "right" to absolute freedom from the interference of
others.  So what?  It's irrelevant if it's impractical.  It's childish
to get upset because you don't have something that you can't have.
Maybe we can build these Utopias, but only with a complete restructuring
of our society and culture.  Just grabbing at "rights" willy-nilly will
probably not do it.

And it seems to me you should allow, in your broad formulation of rights,
that people have the right to build communities as they see fit, including
ones that use compulsion, as long as they allow people to leave those
communities.  If there are no non-compulsory communities out there for you
to go to, well, that's too bad, but maybe it's evolution in action.

	With all due respect Michael, we quoted not a single word from the digest.
 We did quote six words from Mr. and Mrs. Dylans little boy Bobbie.  
	A little observation would have prevented this error....very little
observation.
So what was your point?   Do you want to explore this topic or just tell us
what a great place you live in?  Most contributors to this list over-quotes
and usually doesn't bother removing most of what was previously written.   
We usually send pretty clean copy and usually pretty short.   So, what was
your real point?   We don't need your answer as much as you do.
	We did receive some good information privately  from some on this list. 
We understood that was the purpose of the list, sharing. 							ard

Really, Phil, I would have thought that the SOviet Union collapse while
we were in our biggest bull market would be enough of an exclamation
point to put paid the tired old tyrants claim that compulsion is for
your own good.

Its like the Internal Revenue Code: The code itself says that paying
income taxes is entirely voluntary, what they don't say is that while
you can elect not to pay taxes, businesses cannot employ you, banks
won't hold your funds, etc while you are not paying. If they work with
you, they can lose their government approved licenses to operate as
corporations. This is government's  idea of voluntarism: complusory
voluntarism, a nice oxymoronic piece of doublespeak that one would
expect only to see on the pages of Orwell or Huxley.

Yes, the existing monopolies of power all recognise each other's
authority to their own territory, and as a group repress attempts to
change this collusion of tyranny. THis will change with cheap space
travel, one of the reasons they don't want it to become available.

An anisotropic universe is perfectly compatible with the Big Bang, as far as
I can tell.  I haven't read Nodland & Ralston's paper yet, but I have read
their press release and slightly more technical web page
(http://www.cc.rochester.edu/college/rtc/Borge/aniso.html), and I don't see
anything that suggests the Big Bang didn't happen.  The theory they use to
explain their observations does violate the Standard Model, but that's OK,
everyone knows the Standard Model is wrong, and is just waiting for some
observational evidence that might give us a clue of how to fix it.

How does this theory survive in the face of current Hubble data using
the Deep Field Survey measuring the red shift in distant galaxies, and
comparing that to their relative level of evolution as galaxies which
indicate that what we are seeing right now is at least 90% of the way
back to the big bang?

What you didn't seem to observe was that after the material you sent on
the subject, there was the rest of entire digest included in the
message. I can send you a copy of the message if you don't beleive me. I
really don't need this rudeness, I was just trying to make a suggestion
to make you aware of something that you may not be aware of, just trying
to be helpfull. What I sent to you was minus all of the extra messages
from the rest of the digest.

        Psychologically, any idea of a divine, commandeering force is a sure
sign of a weakened grip on reality.  It can be compared to a child's
imaginary friend: the child believes that it is there, though the parent
knows that it is not.  However, though children usually grow out of their
imaginary friend, they don't often grow out of the need for an impetus or
divine force.  One who depends on a god is one who fears responsibility;
this can be proven with the concept of "praying".  Praying *does* have
healing qualities.  This is not because the one who is praying is being
'relieved by God' but because the one who is praying has such a strong
belief that there are other shoulders (God or Jesus') to heap a burden on.
In Einstein's case, he acknowledged the fact that all theorems which he
'discovered' had been created by something else.  He saw whatever this force
was as being 'God'.  He also understood that the Judeo-Christian God was so
convoluted that there was no credibility.  In other words, Einstein ignored
convention and followed what he thought were rational beliefs.

As far as I know, Einstein never expressed a dissatisfaction with the
Judeo-Christian God.  It seems like he should have, but I don't know that he
did.  Could some one fill me in on this.  Is there an Einstein quote wherein
he questioned the existence of God, or the Judaic interpretation of same?

Subject: psychoceramics: Moravec's Mind Age

Nikolai et al.:

A couple of years ago, Moravec sent me (as the Analog book columnist) the
Mind Age manuscript for timely review.  I read it, wrote the review, and
when Bantam canceled the project shelved the review.  Now that you're saying
the book is about to be published elsewhere, I can expect to use the review
after all.  Meanwhile, FYI, here's what I had to say:

        In his 1988 Mind Children (Harvard University Press), Hans Moravec
sketched the future development of robots, proposed that within about 50
years it would be possible to transfer human minds into computers, and
speculated on the replacement of biological intelligence by machine
intelligence.  To him, robots would be the creations of our minds just as
our children are the creations of our bodies, and since it is our minds that
make us most distinctively human, our "mind children" would be our children
in the more important sense. At the same time, mind transfer would offer us
true immortality.
        In Mind Age: Transcendence Through Robots, Moravec tells us that
"Among many nice reviews of [the earlier book] an angry few brandished words
like 'horrific,' 'nightmare' and 'immoral,' and at least one was too irate
to publish."  I find that curious, for to a mind steeped in science and
science fiction since adolescence, Moravec's ideas are not terribly strange
even if they do push the envelope of what even a visionary scientist might say.
        Yet Mind Children was very much a part of a discussion of the
potentials of artificial intelligence and robotics that began almost as soon
as the first digital computers began chewing their bytes.  Norbert Wiener
invented cybernetics to "study brainlike activity in animals and machines."
And in 1950, Alan Turing proposed that if one could not tell the
intellectual difference between a computer and a human conversationalist,
there was no such difference. The computer would be intelligent in the only
way that matters.
        Since then a great deal of effort has gone into meeting the demands
of the "Turing test."  So far success has been only partial, but there has
been enough success to justify immense optimism in the minds of some, such
as Moravec.  On the other hand, others still resist the notion that a
machine, a mere thing, could ever possibly really think. After all, it's too
deterministic, quantum uncertainty is obviously essential to true thought,
and it
couldn't possibly have a soul, a mind, emotions, a sense of beauty, a...
The list of deficits is
endless; it also tends to be revised every time clever programmers figure
out how to give a
computer a new capability.
        To some extent, Mind Age: Transcendence Through Robots is a
recapitulation and updating of the earlier book, reviewing the development
of robots up to the point where they can take control of their own
continuing improvement or evolution.  Moravec devotes considerable space to
what a civilization dominated by autonomous machines must
mean for human economies and does not shrink from the thought that most
humans will be
content to eat the lotus in idle bliss, the few adventurous souls will move
into robotic bodies or cyberspace and go forth into the universe, and
eventually even the robotic superminds will be made obsolete by what can
only be described as an intelligent universe, a universe converted to
computational apparatus and sheer mind in which all reality is virtual.
        Science fiction readers, who have seen many of these ideas before,
find them enchanting. Others find them terrifying, which explains some of
the reactions Moravec receives, even from such scientific luminaries as
Roger Penrose, who has spent a good deal of effort arguing against the idea
of machine intelligence.  Moravec is too polite to call Penrose out in
person, but in his last chapter, he does borrow the form of Turing's seminal
1950 paper to attempt--like Turing--to lay to rest the various objections to
the notion of machine intelligence.  These objections he phrases like so:
machines have no souls, so cannot think; thinking machines cannot be
possible, because the consequences would be too dreadful; mechanical
reasoning is too limited; machines can have no inner experience to give
meaning to their "thoughts" or actions; machines will never be kind, moral,
joyous, perceptive, original, etc.; computers do only what we can program
them to do; computers don't have nerve cells; it is not possible to specify
for a machine what to do in every possible circumstance a human can
encounter; computers can't have ESP (Moravec considers this a genuine
nonissue but deals with it because Turing did).
        Moravec is not always convincing, but I do not think it is possible
to be more so.  The immense leaps in the development of robots and
artificial intelligence that he discusses cannot be predicted confidently
given the present infantile state of the art.  However, it is just as
unreasonable for the opposition to say those leaps cannot be made.  Both
sides display an almost religious adherence to their beliefs.  Certainly
Moravec has faith in his dreams.  His
opponents have faith in tradition. 
        I'm inclined to side with Moravec, and I recommend Mind Age as a
stimulating, provocative treat for your own mind.


Sincerely,
Tom Easton

Surely not if there is a cammandeering force, in reality.

Parents seem to have such narrow reality tunnels.

If you define god as 'one who takes responsibility', yes. But what about a
god who is 'just there' and is just a positive force for good?

Praying, to me, is not about unburdoning (confession maybe!). It is about
magick and a way of concretizing ones will, which can be a psychological
trigger or catalyst. I don't pray anymore, I prefer to cast spells as it
fits me fondess of esoterica and it messes with people's heads, but
praying and magick and psychological therapy are all basically the same,
it's also all NLP and metaprogramming at the end of the day.

And if you believe in metaprogramming, why not a god who is beyond where
you are at at the moment? It is a good metametaphor.

The author was John Donne, the Elizabethan poet, although I think he
wrote it as "No man is an Iland", but spelling was not nearly as
conventionalized back then.

Lord knows what he would have approved of. He was a rake as a young
man, and began his career as a poet writing what I can only describe
as offbeat love poetry. Later in life he became profoundly religious
and abandoned the work of his early life. I have never found much
evidence on his political views, or if he even had any. I'd guess he
was a squishy collectivist, but there is no way to really know.

BTW, "No man is an island" comes from the same text that contains the
words "Ask not for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee".

	A few studies have been done which show an increase in healing of the
patient, even if they did not know they were being prayed for.

Entropy Alert! I object ; - )
First of all-  Money is needed to live with pride, to achieve fame, and to
measure some aspects of success.. as well as being a very good end in itself.
Also - common sense -  no one can DO research without spending a lot of your
own cash, so grants and rewards provide incentive - and to spend a lifetime
doing something, altruistically hoping for "making the world a better place"
is FINE, but I hope it also pays your rent, anyway,  I believe that people
are selfish enough to want life extension for it's own rewards - but
apparently they are'nt motivated YET.
( BTW I mentioned the R.A.W. book in response to an objectivist OBJECTING to
govt. funding for such projects.)

<Can anyone direct me to any books on Creativity, brain function  and 
Cognition? Anders? Mark?>

My favorite book on these subjects (it's not extremely technical but 
seems to cover all the main issues AND covers all the fringe theories 
as well) is Nick Herbert's _Elemental Mind_.  The book is a few year's 
old but I think it's still on the shelves in most large book stores 
(at least in the U.S.).

Here's a couple of extract from my notebooks:

01/14/95. In ch.1 of "Elemental Mind" Nick Herbert gives the best 
explicit description of the various philosophical schools of thought 
that I have ever seen. He calls this the "psi/phi", or mind over 
matter problem, distinguishing Dualistic models of consciousness, 
which maintain "that mind and matter are essentially different kinds 
of essences", where you have epiphenominalists who say "mind is a mere 
byproduct completely subject to matter's motion ... The switch 
controls the light; the light never controls the switch", and animists 
who "imagine that behind every material motion lies an invisible 
spiritual cause", and interactionalists who believe that "neither mind 
nor matter dominates"; and, Monistic models of consciousness believing 
that "matter is all that there is", e.g., William Uttal: "Mind is to 
the nervous system as rotation is to the wheel", which subdivides into 
reductionist materialists who "resemble animists" by believing that 
"virtually any mechanical motion results in some kind of inner 
experience", emergent materialists who "also believe that 
consciousness is a wholly mechanical property of matter, but that only 
very complex systems possess it", and idealists (like Roger Penrose) 
who feel that "the existence of inner experiences is undeniable, but 
... the existence of the external world is not so certain"; finally, 
there is neutral monism that "posits the existence of a single 
substance possessing both mental and physical attributes." Herbert 
goes on to posit 13 criteria that successful consciousness theories 
must explain: mind links, mind maps, artificial awareness, quantity of 
mind, quality of mind, attention mechanisms, sense of self, 
personality, free will, death, mind reach, evolution, and surprise.

01/29/95. In ch.10 of "Elemental Mind", describing the brain as a 
quantum reality receiver, Nick Herbert relates the following subjects: 
John von Neumann was the father of quantum consciousness models; 
Eccles proposal that synapses serve as quantum-actuated microsites 
where the immaterial mind exerts its will on the material brain; Bass 
& Donald's model of "the quantum mechanics of warm, wet switches" 
asserted that "a neuron's ionic channels are the quantum entry points 
for consciousness"; E.H. Walker's "flawed but detailed" theories of 
quantum synaptic tunneling creating "a kind of 'second nervous system' 
operating by completely quantum rules and acting in parallel with the 
conventional nervous system [which] mediates unconscious data 
processing"; Penrose's claim that we need a theory of correct quantum 
gravity to collapse the wave function has the flaw that the Planck 
mass, at which quantum states are collapsed to classical states, "is 
embarrassingly large" [about the mass of a flea]; In other words, many 
objects with large mass could exhibit quantum uncertainties; 
Bose-Einstein condensates, systems where the particles act in concert 
to generate quantum behavior on the macroscopic scale, underly the 
'ferroelectric' proposals of I.N Walker and his wife, Danah Zollar who 
"sees neither matter nor mind as primary in nature. Rather each serves 
as a context for the other's development"; Greg Keith (a "technoerotic 
poet") says "and the I is only an index into life ... I, the constant 
truth that controls our innermost loop. The massless I, dilating at 
dreamspeed, grows coextensive with more and more selves."

And there's quite a bit more.  In particular, Herbert devotes an 
entire chapter to James Culbertson's "spacetime reductive materialism" 
theories of consciousness. I made a lengthy post last fall excerpting 
some of this which is in the archives at
http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.96/2046.html

Some problems with this:
1. Contracts would need to define "development of life extension".
2. People who don't buy this insurance still benefit from development.
3. Research takes time.  Insurance companies need something like 
   long-term contracts to care about long-term results.

Nikolai et al.:

I just checked with Hans Moravec about the publication prospects for Mind
Age.  Here's what he said: 


 You can read a little about it on my page

 http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/

I'm working like crazy (at this very moment, as perpetually for the last
several months) towards September pub [by Oxford Univ. Press].  It's already
kind of
late, and there's still lots to do.  Most time consuming are the figures,
which are benefitting from the latest tech.  I bought a maxed out 300 MIPS
Mac (clone - Power Tower 180e) to do them and have been using it to fullest.
I love the results.  But there's a lot of rewriting also, not the least for
spectacular recent developments.  The "AI power" curve in my web peek will
give you a clue why we're suddenly getting results after thirty years (!) of
ho hum.

				-- Hans

My editor is Kirk Jensen.  He didn't like the "Mind Age" title (too
ambiguous) I'm currently using "Robot, Being: mere machine to
transcendent mind" Robot is sans serif, Being is script in the
current drafts.  It's a pun, but you have to read the last chapter
to get it.  May still change.  I liked "Mind Fire", but that
really needs explaining.

  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

What do you mean BACK THEN? Sorry to be picky but I realized/realised that
the adding of `ized'/`ised' to the end of a word has yet to be made
regularized/regularised.

you have been criticised, satirised and parodized.

I doubt it needs to be said, but the results of a few studies is not very
convincing.  To use the relentless questioning format that I have seen
someone use from time to time...

Who conducted the study?  Are these few studies just the ones that show
some benefit for prayer while ignoring the ones that show no effect?  Were
the people praying for the sick person friends of this person?  If the
study has any validity, I suspect it most probably shows the value of
friendship and knowing that there are people who care about you, even if
you don't know that they are praying.

This was reported all over the shop - certainly the Guardian and New

pattern on their `quilted' toilet roll to avoid unsightly bunching.
Penrose objected, and as far as I know is in the process of suing
them.  The `knight of the realm...' stuff is from his legal
representative, and there's more about Penrose tilings at the
following addresses:

* <http://rysy.msm.cam.ac.uk/~msms/penrose.html>
  Some blurb from Cambridge University about Penrose himself.

  Cut-out-and-colour-in Penrose tiles (toilet paper is a bit flimsy, I
  suspect - try cardboard)

  A Java version of the above: quasitiling in an applet.

Anyone notice an "urban legend awareness" meme lately?  A.K.A. the "Here's
something else that didn't really happen" meme or the "Be careful what you
THINK you know" meme.

It's either:

A. Just me.

-or-

B. There is a lot more awareness of urban myths and legends lately.

The "urban" from urban legend comes from the idea that it is in the cities
where there are a large number of people to spread them (transmitters or
"vectors").  The same happens in the corporate workplace where there are a
lot of people.  And, now with the Internet there are a lot of people sharing
info and spreading stories, some of which are urban myths, for example see
the following list of urban myths that are false.  My theory is that the
Internet has also facilitated the spread of the "Here's something else that
didn't really happen" meme.


* The criminal ring of highly-skilled surgeons who steal kidneys from
unsuspecting victims to sell on the black market.

* The homosexual act of sending a gerbil (or hamster) up a toilet-paper tube
in the anus.

* The helicopter that fights forest fires by scooping water from lake.
Charred body of scuba diver found in ashes.

* People occasionally spontaneously combust and burn to death.

* The razor blade in the Halloween apples and other Halloween candy-tampering.

* Snuff films exist.

* There are satanic symbols on the Proctor & Gamble logo.

* Numerous Internet virus hoaxes.

* Suicide rates go up around the holidays.

* Domestic violence goes up on Super Bowl Sunday.

* People are much loonier (e.g., shoot, screw, etc.) during a full moon.

* "Blue star" or cartoon character (esp. Mickey Mouse) tattoos laced with
LSD is sold at schools to hook kids on acid.

* There was a fried rat served in a Kentucky-Fried Chicken restaurant.

* Aspirin and Coca-Cola taken together get you high. (Nope. May cause insomnia.)

* Henry Ford/Gen. Douglas McArthur/T. Edison/IBM Rep./et al. tests an
interviewee by when they salt their food during lunch.

* Albert Einstein did poorly in school.

* We only use 10% of our brain.

* NASA did experiement on making love in zero gravity.

* No two snowflakes are alike.


And here is an urban legend that is true:

Disney parks are riddled with secret tunnels and surveillance equipment.

No but the protocols that surgeons are using to determine when to start
taking organs shows that the drugs they give prior to "death" are not
helpful to the patient and prevent the patient from clotting any wounds,
and there have been documented cases of head trauma patients at the
Cleveland Center where the time listed on the death certificate as to
when the heart stopped beating was when it was cut out of the patient's
body. This sort of treatment is what engenders the far out stories like
you cited...

it was actually a stalinist torture method in eastern europe, and a

I know, there were a lot of articles in the paper on this last
Superbowl, with interviews of people who run womens shelters saying that
this is true.

I haddn't heard that one, but I had heard that Mikey, the kid on the
Life cereal commercial, had died from eating Pop Rocks candy and
drinking Coca-Cola. False.

Actually a married pair of astronauts did go up 2 years ago, and were
supposed to be doing some "research" on it, at least according to what
the other astronauts said in interviews. If its false, we've got some
astronauts spreading disinformation...

Thanks for the URL about Dr. Timothy Leary's ashes being shot into space
along with Star Trek creator Gene Rodenberry's ashes.  Dr. Tim Leary
bailed out of having his head cryonically frozen.  He seems to have been
on the cutting edge of many endeavors.

Has anyone heard any buzz on Dr. Timothy Leary's last book entitled
DESIGN FOR DYING?  It was co-authored with a Mr. Prince and recently I
noticed in Amazon books that R. U. Sirius is also co-authoring the book.

I think I have noticed something like this. My guess is that people in 
general are becoming slightly more aware of media, information flow and 
memetics, although in a rather intuitive way.

That may be because refutations can spread much more quickly. Rumor 
epidemics usually last until a refutation meme is spread. On the net, 
refutations quickly appear (their hosts often engaging the legend hosts in a 
flamewar), so net.legends that doesn't pretend to be true (and hence 
cannot be refuted) have a higher fitness.

Snuff films are films made for profit featuring real deaths, deaths which
have been effected only for the purpose of the films. Sure, (e.g.) serial
killers have been known to videotape their activities, but the purpose of
the killings has never been to make a commercial movie. Merriam Webster's
10th Collegiate Dictionary doesn't agree with this definition
("characterized by the sensationalistic depiction of violence; esp:
featuring a real rather than a staged murder"), but it is the one used on
alt.folklore.urban, and the one I think we all should subscribe to.

It survives by people fiddling with it by adding new fields, new types of
dark matter, or a nonzero vacuum density (AKA cosmological constant). These
effects  change the acceleration of the expansion so that the universe is
comfortably older than the objects in it.

All the fiddles I understand (i.e. from two years ago) seem to have been
ruled out observationally, but there's plenty of room for new fiddles, or
combinations of two or more old  fiddles.  I can no longer keep track of
which combination of fiddles is the current front-runner.  It remains to be
seen whether the fiddling will suceed, or whether the Big Bang theory will
be replaced by something totally new.  I'd bet on the fiddling succeeding,
but I'm hoping for total replacement.  Either way, progress is being made
very rapidly, and we should know lots more soon.  Science usually doesn't
stay this confused for long.

Actually, this is simple: from a strictly scientific viewpoint God is an 
unsupported hypothesis which does not appear to be falsifiable or 
possible to test in any way. There are of course some scientists

Subject: DHEA, Alzheimer's Disease, and Depression


In 1985, I predicted (copyrighted) that DHEA would be low in
Alzheimer's disease and depression, and that it is the cause. The
first report of low DHEA in AD was in 1989.  I just found the
following report that further supports my hypotheses. 

Wolkowitz OM, et al., "Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) treatment of
depression," Biol Psychiatry 41 (3): 311-318 (1997) 

"Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate, DHEA-S, are plentiful
adrenal steroid hormones that decrease with aging and may have
significant neuropsychiatric effects. In this study, six middle-aged
and elderly patients with major depression and low basal plasma DHEA
and/or DHEA-S levels were openly administered DHEA (30-90 mg/d x 4
weeks) in doses sufficient to achieve circulating plasma levels
observed in younger healthy individuals. Depression ratings, as well
as aspects of memory performance significantly improved. One
treatment-resistant patient received extended treatment with DHEA for
6 months: her depression ratings improved 48-72% and her semantic
memory performance improved 63%. These measures returned to baseline
after treatment ended. In both studies, improvements in depression
ratings and memory performance were directly related to increases in
plasma levels of DHEA and DHEA-S and to increases in their ratios with
plasma cortisol levels. These preliminary data suggest DHEA may have
antidepressant and promemory effects and should encourage double-blind
trials in depressed patients."

==============================================================================
      THE ASSOCIATION FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF CONSCIOUSNESS
             WILL PRESENT A CONFERENCE AROUND THE THEME OF:

       WHAT DOES IMPLICIT COGNITION TELL US ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS?

             CLAREMONT COLLEGES & CLAREMONT GRADUATE SCHOOL
                 JUNE 13-16, 1997: CLAREMONT, CALIFORNIA


The first conference of the Association for the Scientific Study of
Consciousness will be held at the Claremont Colleges, about an hour's
drive from Los Angeles, over four days between the 13th and 16th of
June, 1997. The organizing committee for the conference consists of:

  William Banks: Pomona College
  Thomas Metzinger: Universitat des Saarlandes
  Patrick Wilken: Monash University

Currently scheduled speakers include Bernard Baars, Patricia Churchland,
Alan Cowey, Owen Flanagan, John Gabrieli, Melvyn Goodale, Anthony
Greenwald, Larry Jacoby, Christof Koch, Philip Merikle, David Milner and
Daniel Schacter. Full list of plenary addresses with titles appears at
the end of this announcement.

In addition, there will be workshops on a variety of topics relevant to
the theme of the conference, and paper and poster sessions with time for
discussion.  Workshops are listed at the end of this announcement, after
the plenary talks.

For more information on the conference and more complete descriptions of
the workshops please consult the ASSC website:

=====
THEME
=====

The phenomena of implicit cognition -- implicit memory, implicit
learning, unconscious perception, blindsight, and so on -- have
attracted widespread attention in recent years.  This is partly because
of their intrinsic interest, and partly because the study of these
processes holds great promise as an empirical method for investigating
consciousness.  But although research in these areas has proliferated,
the connections between this research and issues about consciousness
have not yet been fully articulated.  What have we learned about the
conscious mind from the study of implicit cognition?

This conference is intended to address this question, drawing
systematic connections between implicit cognition and consciousness. We
welcome both empirical contributions, using experimental research to
help understand the nature of conscious and unconscious processes, and
theoretical contributions that analyze or integrate existing work.

I've reached a decision!  
My next computer will be a Motorola StarMax: 603e 180HMz, 
32MB, 2.5GB, 8xCD, 28k modem, plus SoftWindows 95, all 
(not counting monitor) for about 16 hundred simoleons.
Not quite the latest thing, but then neither am I.

First you might prove to me that your idea of society works.  What's
your chosen example, the US?  Where hundreds of thousands of innocent
men and women are jailed every year, whole cities are impoverished by
inflation of fiat currency and barriers to business entry, twice as much
money is stolen from working families as is necessary for education, and
yet fails miserably to educate them, tens of thousands are killed by
overregulation of medicine, thousands have been sent to kill and die on
foreign soil for political reasons, thousands more have died in secret
medical experiments and state-sactioned murders?  Is their blood just a
theory to you?  

If it seems silly to you to be indignant about such things, I suggest
that you are simply lucky enough never to have felt the shackles on
your own hands or to have buried good friends.  Utopia might not be
possible, but since I can't run simulations of whole societies to find
out, I must rely on principle and reason.  Reason tells me that a free
society would work, and would be less likely to commit the atrocities
that every govenment in human history has committed.  It would be
inhuman not to work toward that goal.

>Would someone PLEASE tell me how to unsubscribe from this list???

Heres how to unsubscribe:

First, ask your Internet Provider to mail you an Unsubscribing Kit.
Then follow these directions.

The kit will most likely be the standard no-fault type. Depending on
requirements, System A and/or System B can be used. When operating
System A, depress lever and a plastic dalkron unsubscriber will be
dispensed through the slot immediately underneath. When you have
fastened the adhesive lip, attach connection marked by the large "X"
outlet hose. Twist the silver- coloured ring one inch below the
connection point until you feel it lock.

The kit is now ready for use. The Cin-Eliminator is activated by the
small switch on the lip. When securing, twist the ring back to its
initial condition, so that the two orange lines meet. Disconnect.
Place the dalkron unsubscriber in the vacuum receptacle to the rear.
Activate by pressing the blue button.

The controls for System B are located on the opposite side. The red
release switch places the Cin-Eliminator into position; it can be
adjusted manually up or down by pressing the blue manual release
button. The opening is self- adjusting. To secure after use, press
the green button, which simultaneously activates the evaporator and
returns the Cin-Eliminator to its storage position.

You may log off if the green exit light is on over the evaporator .
If the red light is illuminated, one of the Cin-Eliminator
requirements has not been properly implemented. Press the "List Guy"
call button on the right of the evaporator . He will secure all
facilities from his control panel.

To use the Auto-Unsub, first undress and place all your clothes in
the clothes rack. Put on the velcro slippers located in the cabinet
immediately below. Enter the shower, taking the entire kit with you.
On the control panel to your upper right upon entering you will see a
"Shower seal" button. Press to activate. A green light will then be
illuminated immediately below. On the intensity knob, select the
desired setting. Now depress the Auto-Unsub activation lever. Bathe
normally.

The Auto-Unsub will automatically go off after three minutes unless
you activate the "Manual off" override switch by flipping it up. When
you are ready to leave, press the blue "Shower seal" release button.
The door will open and you may leave. Please remove the velcro
slippers and place them in their container.

If you prefer the ultrasonic log-off mode, press the indicated blue
button. When the twin panels open, pull forward by rings A & B. The
knob to the left, just below the blue light, has three settings, low,
medium or high. For normal use, the medium setting is suggested.

After these settings have been made, you can activate the device by
switching to the "ON" position the clearly marked red switch. If
during the unsubscribing operation, you wish to change the settings,
place the "manual off" override switch in the "OFF" position. You may
now make the change and repeat the cycle. When the green exit light
goes on, you may log off and have lunch. Please close the door behind
you.

> twice as much
>  money is stolen from working families as is necessary for education,


So simplistic. Half truth.Somewhat valid comment made less valid by
oversimplifying relationships. Context dropped intentionally.
 
Some families likely feel this is stealing - and the compulsary nature of
taxation does not work out for everyone. This is a valid point. Some find it
acceptable, others not.
Qualified in that light it *could* be fairly called stealing. 
But not if I agree to pay it willingly. And I would.

However, among those who favor educational taxation, some agree that if it
was spent better,  we would willingly pay for social institutions like
schools, and would even spend *more* on education ( for the selfish reason of
wanting a better, more  advanced society) - even some who do not have school
aged children. The problem is far more complex, and in most debates,
arguments abound as to where and how the money is misused and if private
sector schools not controlled by and involving less govt. money would be
better. 
Then we get into voluntary taxation, trusts, school bonds, vouchers, etc.

Apparently your idea of "too simplistic" is "says something meaningful
clearly enough to be understood."  The actual content of the statement,
that public education costs twice as much as private education of better
quality, you evade altogether so you can react to my choice of the
word "stolen" to describe taxes.  Fine, substitute "taken"--a simple
fact of reality you can't evade--and then deal with the actual content
of the assertion, which I stand by.  I also happily stand my my use of
the word "stolen", but if that gets in the way of your ability to apply
ordinary reason to an assertion, then go ahead and pick a less loaded
word for your own use.

I hope we will be able to remedy that in the near future. People are 
already doing alife simulations of simple societies (usually rather 
ant-like) and of course the evolution of cooperation. It would be 
interesting (and probably only a matter of time) to study a more 
realistic model where different social structures could be tested. 
Simulations support reason, at least when everyone is allowed to test 
them and their basic assumptions are known.

Suggestion: why not explain this clearly and logically in a way (say) a 
ten-year old could understand, and then let your opponent put forth his 
model in the same simple way. Then we can start analyzing what reason 
tells us (but don't forget history; reason isn't always right).

True, its a half truth, because the multiplier effects of taxation at
every level of the economy causes people to pay an average of 60% more
than true market cost for anything they buy. THis means that not only is
50% of your income being taken by government in direct taxes of various
kinds, but 60% of the remainder is being taken indirectly. Essentially
people live on 20% of their earnings, while the government lives on the
other 80%. Makes me almost  yearn for the middle ages, when we mere
peasants only expected 10% of their earnings to be taken each year.

Yes, many women voluntarily stay with the husbands and boyfreinds who
beat them regularly too.

I think that the comparison between public and private education is an
excellent example of where free society out performs compulsory society
in every way. Taxation for education probably would be spent more
efficiently if school systems had to compete with each other like
private insitutions do. As a contrast to our monopolistic primary
educational system, we can even look at publicly financed college
education, where colleges do not have guarranteed student bodies, and
have to compete with each other for customers. While our primary
educational system is considered the laughing stock of the
industrialized world, no one can say anything but praise for our college
system. We have free markets and competition to thank for that.

Theatre Games by Viola Spolin.  Mind Magic by Bill Harvey.
Spolin is responsible in large part for Second City.  Many members of
Saturday Night Live came from there, as did Alan Alda, Alan Arkin, George
Segal, Peter Falk, and Barbara Hershey.  Many of todays' most creative
actors began with classes wherein the teacher used this book as a textbook,
including Whoopi and Robin Williams.  Neither of these books teach
anything, they let you learn by experiencing.  Mind Magic is more of an
introduction to yourself and your programming.  It is more suitable for the
extropian types who are interested in reprogramming themselves.  But it
does require that you actually do something besides just read the book,
although that too is useful.

to such deception.
	
  Were the people praying for the sick person friends of this person? 

	They did not even know the person they were praying for.   Also the

being prayed for.
 

If the study has any validity, I suspect it most probably shows the value

	Your suspicions are unfounded, however well intended.

Rhetoric is a wonderful art in its own right.  That many use it as a
substitute for reason is unfortunate, but that doesn't imply that one
can't use it in addition to reason.  Tools are just tools, neither
good nor evil; it is the mind wielding them that determines that.

That would be marvellous.  Axelrod's original result was quite stirring,

Many others have done a far better job of that than I, and I have
little patience to debate what I consider "basics" of libertarian
thought.  I'm more interested in the contentious fringes: intellectual
property law, origination of rights, perpetuities and covenants,
and so on.  Debating whether schools should be private or public is
about as interesting to me as it would be for a physics professor to
debating whether heavy things fall faster than light things.

Perhaps a way to end this is for those who agree with 'required community 
service' give an example of what is required and see how many respond 
opposing this.  I remit, total agreement is fine (but is frightful as 
everyone agreeing on anything is), forcing agreement (as in the US getting 
$16/day for required jury duty...notwithstanding it is a one day jury for 
drunk driving cases to 1 year on a murder case...or longer) not only seems 
dictatorial but seems to violate the very declaration of extropianism.

Forcing agreement forbids dissent.  Will this turn into 'Fine, don't do the 
required service even if you disagree, no problem.  Just don't expect to be 
able to work, bank, or get unemployment' as with the 'voluntary' US tax 
laws.

Tell us when reason isn't right.  (A scary thought when reason is 
wrong...what is left....emotion?).

The proper quote and attribution for "We are already like gods..." is

	"We are as Gods and might as well get good at it."


The author is Stewart Brand, and the attribution I've seen says he first
wrote it for the 1968 edition of the Whole Earth Catalogue.

There are of course God believers who believe that scientific hypothesis
are unsupported and do not appear to be falsifiable or possible to test in
anyway - except within the self-created world of science.

I don't believe in God or science. (Or anything, actually)

Both work, and are useful, but that is all they are, useful constructions.

Anyone who believes science (or God) is real, is just confusing the menu
with the meal.

Science isn't verifiable except within its own game. The same is true of
God. You can't use one to prove or disprove the other - they have both
been hermetically sealed for dogmatic freshness and self-preservation.

We are all playing language games, we are all magicians.

Enjoy...

Wouldn't it be more extropian to not limit your interviews to those
who happen to be physically nearby?  We do not wish to constrain
ourselves to our current biological manifestations, so why require
their presence?

I just saw a program on the discovery channel on this last week. I
imagine that if you use alta vista to search for the terms "red shift"
and "Hubble Deep Field" you will come up with something...

Looked at scientifically, what Phil is saying is, we don't have any data
points for *exactly zero* compulsion.

However, we do have lots of data about *different levels* of compulsion,
and guess how it correllates with quality of life?

> I am aware that there are some good ideas floating

Let's separate some issues:
1) Would anarchy be better if we could make it work?
2) How can we get rid of the hard-to-get-rid-of kinds of compulsion?
3) Is it silly to get indignant in the mean time?
4) What are people getting indignant about in this particular letter case?

1) If you prefer data to theory, freedom seems to correllate with quality
   of life in vast amounts of practical experience across the world and
   through history.
2) As Phil says, freedom has to be actually *achieved* by ideas and work.
3) "Don't get indignant" is like the "Stifle your feelings and
   discuss in logical, emotion-neutral terms" nerd meme I've discussed
   here before.  How nerds convince themselves to conform.  I believe in
   at least trying to be polite, but in the privacy of my own heart I'm
   pissed at jerks trying to tighten the screws and bring the world a
   little closer to a concentration camp, whether out of evil or out of
   daisy-eyed-foolishness--but fool-Nazis make me the more pissed...In
   case you want to talk about how I feel.  But leaving that aside,
4) The particular case is the idea of *adding* a new compulsion that is
   not one of the hard-to-get-rid-of cases like defense against war.

Besides the *general* "oh shucks it's no use hoping" message here, Phil
seems to be saying specifically that incrementally improving things is no
use.  I can't disagree with you more, Phil.  Every little bit of freedom
counts, as does every bit of compulsion.  Your pessimism about anarchy
doesn't justify more government intrusion.  We don't have to wait to make
things better.  We don't have to make things worse while we wait.

>And it seems to me you should allow, in your broad formulation of rights,

Well, no.  No one has a right to come into a place and build their
"community" by violating the (narrow?) rights of the residents.
Once again, your idea of "broadening" verges on passively accepting
whatever happens to be going on politically.  But the steamroller of the
state doesn't need a broadened idea of "rights" to justify what it does.
That's not what the idea of "rights" was invented for.  Rights were
invented to defend the individual *against* "the community".

Phil, you seem to imagine this positive thing called "the community" that
is not raw state power--yet uses it.  I say there's no such nice thing.
There is people getting along like neighbors, doing things as neighbors--
that's true community--and there's the state, a social corrosive.  In
between are people who confuse the two and do bad things with good
intentions.  All of us who don't know how to achieve perfect anarchy
right away can be considered in that middle category.  We are cooperating
with evil because we haven't yet learned how to stop.  But we can at least
refrain from the things we know are wrong.

Sometimes there is.  Check the archives for a thread mostly titled
"Plea" which has a lot of good stuff on the value of rudeness.

It might still be a little more comforting for this person to see
someone in person.  I think that someone should try to see her if at all
possible.
But she should also get on the internet and we could all give her some
help.

I think both avenues should be persued!

I had much the same thought that Annette would probably get a more 
comprehensive and broad-based spectrum of opinion by posting a set of 
questions to the main Extropians list, but nonetheless I have volunteered 
to try to answer Annette's questions in person if necessary (or 
preferably, to arrange a meeting for her with myself and some of the 
other DC Extropians).  I did suggest that email would be easiest for me, 
so if that's amenable to her I may forward her questions to the list.

I'm personally quite fond of good rhetoric, and agree that it is an 
useful tool. In a way it is a way of enhancing one's communication with a 
person (not just for persuasion). But this is also its main danger: it is 
the perfect tool for memes too, since they thrive on powerful 
communication and persuasion between people. So sacred cows (memes that 
secretly link to strong emotions for selfish reasons) of course thrive on 
and use rhetoric a lot.

I found one interesting article in Technology Review about current 
research in this direction, with applications in sociology and economics.

I see your point. But if no physics professors show people that heavy and
light things fall at the same acceleration, then misunderstandings will
flourish and the gulf between the people who know and the people who
doesn't know will widen. I have the feeling this occurs a lot when it
comes to libertarian politics: the people who understand it take it for
granted, and can't understand why so many other people regard it as
lunatic fringe. 

Of course, this list is not intended for discussions of the basics 
either, but I really think it would be helpful if somebody could create 
clear and logical explanations of the basics (say as a website).

Regarding DC-area *journalism student* Annette Ware's interest in 
"conversing" with Extropians *as a research project*.  It may be that 
her course requires her to conduct face-to-face interviews.  If that 
is the case and I was in her position, I might want to turn the 
research into a comparison of the merits of face-to-face interviews 
vs. interviews that could be conducted through the forum of an e-mail 
list.

No I do not have a problem with your assertion of education being badly
managed by the government. Or of taxation being unfair.
The MAJOR difference - which you appanrently missed - is pointing out that
SOME people, not you.. not Mr. Lorrey, not most Libertarians, but this one..
see value in educating people who have no money. In making education
available at OUR OWN EXPENSE to others who have  children but may ( for some
stupid reason) think their children don;t deserve it. I said this is my own
SELFISH desire for a better society. 
I would gladly pay a part of my salary to educate your kid, if you were
stupid enough to want him to NOT go to school - or if you were a poor
provider. I want public education to survive, even if I do ( and I do ) have
my kids in private schools.  Even if that "public" education is privately
funded.


This came in before I unsubsribed, but will not be on list so you may reply
offlist if you like.

One problem I have noted is that many quite interesting threads on these
lists develop new insights into various subjects, diverge and then die
out. Although they are archived, often the real gems are hard to
rediscover, and old questions reappear after a few months. 

What I would like to see if we could distill the results of some threads
into a usable form, such as a web page or an article in Homo Excelsior. 
When a thread starts to get useful, somebody takes on the responsibility
as an editor, bringing together the posts into a whole and then publishing
it. 

The main problem to solve is how to get these editors: while I think just
about everyone here will agree that the idea is good, actually *doing*
something must overcome some mental inertia (especially when many 
participate; diffusion of responsibility is a problem here). Do we have 
any brilliant ideas on how to implement this?

The mailing list for Julian May's Galactic Milieu did something like
this.  We wanted to coalesce the common discussions and the usual
arguments over them.  One volunteer did the basic structure and made up
a list of questions and argument topics.

The writing of answers was done by whoever cared about that topic to put
forward summaries of their arguments and sometimes summaries of opposing
arguments as well.  For example, I picked up "Who is Fury?" among other
questions, and had the fun of presenting my beliefs as well as the range
of common other beliefs.  The organizer then collected the summaries and
stuck them back into her structure.  Voila, super-FAQ, and very little
to talk about afterwards.  Much more useful than an archive.

Who did what sections, or even paragraphs, is clearly labeled at each 
place.  Instant local immortality for anyone who worked on the FAQ.
Forevermore anyone who looks up certain questions will see my name and
the wisdom and fairness of my summaries. :)

So we could try something like that.

sci.crypt's cryptography FAQ is fairly neat; I don't know how it was
made.

On Sunday, April 13th, Jon Buratti, Douglas Houts, and I attended a 
seminar at the Life Extension Society in Rockville, MD.  The speaker was 
Tom Pafford, who hopes to release his new book, "The Super Young," this 
year.

Tom describes himself as a layman who, after retiring several years ago, 
decided to try to find out why some people, like himself, seem to age 
less rapidly than their peers (and Tom does look good for someone in his 
early 50's).  After 4 years of research, and collaboration with Dr. 
Walter Smith (who I believe is a member of the American Academy of 
Anti-Aging Medicine), he has concluded that aging can be postponed and 
lifespan extended by reducing the rate of cell turnover (i.e. the rate at 
which cells die and are replaced), and that free radicals, telomere 
shortening, and blood glycolization may all shorten lifespan.  My 
impression is that his book and program don't really break any new 
ground, but instead represent more of a comprehensive snapshot of the 
current thinking in life extension.

Of perhaps greater interest to those of us in the DC area is his plan to 
open a clinic in Northern Virginia which will feature a program of 
hormone replacement therapy, as well as lifestyle, exercise, and diet 
recommendations.  Tom estimates that he will need approximately $350,000 
to $500,000 to open the clinic.  To that end he is currently focusing on 
securing a loan from the Small Business Administration, but depending on 
how things go with the SBA he may turn to individual investors.  Those 
interested in becoming investors, or in getting additional information on 
the book or clinic, are invited to contact Tom at paffor9@idt.net.

Below is some additional information on the LES from their web page 
(http://www.clark.net/pub/kfl/les/).  DC-area Extropians may definitely 
want to consider membership.

"The mission of the Life Extension Society (LES) is to support research 
and public
education in human life extension. LES published the Life Extension 
Society News
and sponsors speakers and seminars on life extension topics such as 
nutrition and
nutritional supplementation, anti-aging medicine, cryobiology, and
nanotechnology.

LES is a membership organization, with most members being from the 
mid-Atlantic
region. LES membership dues currently are $20.00 per calendar year. New 
members
are always welcome...

The first two phases of cryogenic preservation occur at the site of a 
donor's
deanimation and together are called cryonic stabilization. LES is 
acquiring
cryonic stabilization equipment and supplies and providing them to 
cryonics
organizations for stabilizations in the mid-Atlantic region."

You haven't said whether you've quit smoking or not! For this post 
I'll assume that your heart problem is entirely due to smoking and not 
to other dietary, genetic or lifestyle factors...

Until recently I smoked a pipe, inhaling massive doses of tar and 
nicotine. This had been a 30-year habit.

I was able to easily quit by switching to Nicorette gum which is 
available without prescription.  I'm down to about four 2-mg pieces a 
day.

In my opinion the gum is better than patches because you have to learn 
to control it and it provides relief for the oral-gratification 
cravings.

I still don't like this oral-gratification habit but it's certainly 
better than polluting lungs and heart.

There are plenty of libertarian resources on the net, many suitable
for first-timers.  <http://www.lp.org/> is a decent place to start,
although it's more US-politics oriented.  Friedman's pages have a
lot of great stuff: <http://www.best.com/%7Eddfr/>.

Actually, it's not *that* simple.  In my experience god(s) is not
a single hypothesis, it's more like a spectrum of hypotheses ranging
from an omnipotent and everpresent something (easily verifiable, I
just tried talking with It and It didn't respond---false!) all the
way to a benevolent creator who doesn't talk with its subjects
because they have become wicked (these are mostly unfalsifiable and,
well, useless).  All these hypotheses, if believed in properly, tend
to be excellent placebo cures for a wide range of ailments.

Speaking of placebo: I bought a pair of wrist bands that are supposed
to cure motion sickness by applying pressure to certain points on the
arms, and amazingly enough they work for me!  Who needs God when we
have the Allmighty Placebo.  Too bad It can't cure cancer.  (Hmm,
perhaps it can but it's an undocumented function...  ;)

He also realised that we are all metaprogramming ourselves, on several
levels, every moment of our lives. The `I' we think we are is created by
us.

I don't even have a problem with public funding of education. Its the
monopoly of the market that I find so objectionable and in my opinion,
the big cause of the problems with our public primary education. As
previously stated by me, publicly funded college education is very good
in most areas of the US. Excellent in some. Because individual public
colleges do not have a monopoly on the students resident in their state,
they have IMHO retained a level of quality that one normally sees with
free market services, while the monopolistic primary schools have not.

Likewise, the tax system should have a way out for people who live by
their principles, much like concientious objectors to military service.
There is currently a form one can fill out at the IRS certifying that
the signor is a member of a religion that has such objections to social
security. In exchange for being exampt from paying SS taxes, you refuse
permanently any rights to benefits. If this method were expanded to CO
types, I think that present society will survive handily, while people
who object to confiscation as much as the founding fathers did can live
in peace.

Its time for an anti-trust lawsuit against the federal government.

*** Vitamin E, Parkinson drug may slow Alzheimer's

Vitamin E and a drug used to treat Parkinson's disease may slow the
deterioration caused by Alzheimer's disease, researchers reported
Wednesday. Both substances are already available to the public.
Scientists said there is likely to be an immediate impact on
treatment. The study found that both vitamin E and the
anti-Parkinson's drug selegiline appeared to delay for six to seven
months the milestones of the disease, such as the inability to perform
basic activities of living, severe dementia and death. For the full
story, see http://www.merc.com/stories/cgi/story.cgi?id=2583176-efa

Why not? I think the issue of placebos is very interesting. I'm sure if
51% of the world actively pursuaded the other 49% that a pill could solve
depression, anxiety or even cancer, then the 49% would receive relief from
symptoms almost instantly.

I'm sure most extropians believe that the state of the body is
inextricably linked with mind state. So why not the `belly-button' cure?

Milk, orange juice, aspirin, tic tacs and plain water have all been used
to 'cure' bad trips.

or have i just let the cat out of the bag?

Yes.  We are  "automorphing" ourselves.  (The art of  consciously and

Consciously? Extropians and others perhaps. But I think Neitzsche was
saying that most people do it unconsciously and don't realise that they
are actually a talented artist.

Well, placebo is good but not that good. I have no doubt most of the 49% 
would feel better, especially in the case of depression and anxiety. When 
it comes to somatic illness it sometimes works, sometimes it don't.

I think we are already relying heavily on placebos when we invoke the 
mighty powers of antioxidants, melatonin and rational thinking :-)

Unfortunately placebos work better for people with slightly negative
initial schemata; since a part of their problem is entirely a matter of
attitude they can get an immediate effect, which enhances their faith in
the placebo, making it even more effective. Since most extropians try to
use mainly positive schemata we miss this effect.

The state of my hand is inextricably linked to the state of my
forearm, but if I smash my fingers I think it is unlikely that
rubbing a cream on my forearm will be of much use.

EVLN(automotive fuel cell development raises platinum demand)

LONDON, April 15 (Reuter) - Precious metals refiner Johnson Matthey
Plc said prospects for higher platinum demand were raised by plans in
the automotive sector to develop fuel cell engines.

"For automobile fuel cell engines the requirement (for catalysts) will
be approximately 10 grams of platinum per vehicle. This is three to
four times as much platinum as in the catalytic converter fitted to an
internal combustion engine," the company said in a statement.

Germany's Daimler-Benz AG on Monday announced plans with Ballard Power
Systems Inc. of Canada to bring a new electric car to market in eight
years. The two companies signed a $333 million deal to invest in
developing so-called "fuel-cell" technology.

Fuel-cell engines, which are already powering prototype buses and
cars, produce no emissions and are said to achieve 30 percent greater
efficiency over gas cells. The "cells" are devices that convert fuels
such as methanols or hydrogen into electricity without combustion.

Daimler is targetting initial output of fuel cell car engines at
100,000 units. As well as developing its own model, it will also try
to market the technology to other car companies around the world.

"The objective is really to concentrate on the mass production," said
Ferdinand Panik, head of the project for Daimler.

Johnson Matthew, which also manufactures platinum catalysts for fuel
cells, said the new investment potentially advanced the date for
commercialisation of fuel cell powered cars by five years.

"The announcement significantly improves the prospects for fuel cells
as a major new application for platinum in the next decade," said
Jeremy Coombes, general manager marketing at JM's precious metals
division.

But automotive industry experts said it may take longer to build
consumer demand for the new vehicles.  22:34 04-15-97

Believe it or not (or better, try it), it works. The reason is that the
cold will block the spinal pain gates, essentially the same thing as
acupuncture or rubbing it strongly. Besides, the cold could in principle
numb the nerves. 

Ain't neuroscience fun? :-)

I think this is an important thing, to have an easy guide to transhuman
living. We at Aleph are working at one such handbook in Swedish, but there
is a definite need for an English handbook. 

The closest thing to "extropian ABC" IMHO is Romana's "Five Things You 
Can Do to Fight Entropy Now" - it is brief but good.

Well, I took a look at the websites you mentioned. While they both 
contained introductory materials, they did not explain it as simply as I 
would like it. What I would like is a website showing the bare-bones view 
of various basics, so that one could argue rationally about them ("I see 
here that you attribute X to Y, which makes it rational to do Z...").

This would go for a lot of other theories and models, like 
nanotechnology. Ideally one would have "support and consequence trees": 
the facts and ideas which support and lead to the basic idea, and the 
logical consequences of it. I think it would look good in a graphical 
form, and make discussing them easier.

I don't much like the way that is phrased.  It sounds like something that's
brief is unlikely to be good.  What about "it is brief and good"?  How
about even "it is good; brief, informative, and practical", which would
be my own assessment.

I was referring to Neitzsche himself, and his concept of behavior being
motivated by one's  will to power.  And, further, such power being
manifested in the actualization of the overman's creativity, orginality and
independence.

The phrase sez that people are far more creative than realized.  The
actualization of potential is a talent within itself, and its inward
exploration as well as outward actualization.

OK, I will use something like that in the future. This actually points 
out an interesting bias I think many have: simple communications are less 
likely to be useful than complex communications. Quite wrong, but it 
keeps the bureaucratese and huge self-help books flowing.

The Libertarian and Green and movements are beginning to coalesce 
(thanks to an old economic philosophy that seems new bringing the two 
into greater discussion <http://www.henrygeorge.org> . I am working to 
speed the process.  I am not the only one though.  Check out Dan's 
Geolibertarian Home Page at <http://www.geolib.pair.com> which is good 
place to start your wandering.  Also check out the Libertarian author 
Harry Reid's responses to the Ten Key Green Values at 
<http://www.atlantic.net/~dwatney/reid/reid01.htm> in the section 
labeled "Libertarian and Green Values."  The "Historic Ten Key Values 
of the Greens" are at <http://www.greens.org/gcofc.html> .  I noticed 
that the Extropy Institute lacked a link to "Extropian 
Environmentalism."  May I suggest a page that includes something of an 
updated set of "Extropian, Libertarian, and Green Values" which could 
be quite readable to anyone in the libertarian and green movements.  
The green movement is still somewhat technophobic, but if we were able 
to show them how freedom and technology can address there concerns, 
then we will be long way toward making the Extropian/Libertarian/Green 
ideal a reality.

The nearest thing to a practical (which I assume you mean by "behavioral")
abc of extropianism is Peter Voss's article in Extropy #17: "Extropy Now" I
think you might also include my Dynamic Optimism essay.=20

Which files can you not get your hands on? Without web access, and if you
don't get Extropy magazine, it will be difficult to get these materials.
I'll be putting up a heavily revised version of "Dynamic Optimism" on the
Extropy Institute web site soon, along with "Self-Ownership" which
certainly applies extropian thinking to practical issues.

Also, on practical matters, look for the imminent annoucement of the EXTRO
3 conference. One of the sessions will be on using our extropian knowledge
to make money through investing.

On Monday, April 21, 1997, Eugene Leitl forwarded a post that Anders 
Sandberg made to sci.nanotech about nanodevices in regolith and how 
these might be used to construct macro-scale devices such as 
communication antennas.  As Anders put it:
<Making the nanodevices build something macroscopic can probably be 
done using chemical signals.  A simple example could be that 
assemblers are sensitive to the presence of waste products from other 
assemblers, and tend to move away from them (increasing the spread 
along the surface). One could implement many different chemical 
signals such as "Assembler this way" (to make mining devices find the 
assemblers) or "Build communications link" (produced by nanocomputers 
with no links). This is the fun part, essentially what we need is a 
system of chemical signals not unlike in an anthill combined with the 
morphogenic chemicals used in early development to design the 
macro-level structures. Any good ideas for suitable chemicals and 
organisations of this system? >

Eugene subsequently forwarded a message from Ralph Merkle to the 
Nanotechnology Study Group <NSG-d@world.std.com>, that suggested a few 
URLs that might have been relevant to Anders' query.

However, a quick scan of Merkle's pages at Xerox didn't show anything 
along the lines Anders was suggesting, just the orthodox 
command-and-control nanotech approaches of 'positional control' and 
'self-replication'.  In fact, Merkle suggests (at 
http://nano.xerox.com/nanotech/selfRep.html):
<The mechanical designs proposed for nanotechnology are more 
reminiscent of a factory than of a living system. Molecular scale 
robotic arms able to move and position molecular parts would assemble 
rather rigid molecular products using methods more familiar to a 
machine shop than the complex brew of chemicals found in a cell. 
Although we are inspired by living systems, the actual designs are 
likely to owe more to design constraints and our human objectives than 
to living systems.>

In the same essay, Merkle later says:
<If artificial self replicating systems will only function in 
carefully controlled artificial environments, how can we develop 
applications of nanotechnology that function in complex environments, 
such as the inside of the human body or a (rather messy) factory 
floor? While self replicating systems are the key to low cost, there 
is no need (and little desire) to have such systems function in the 
outside world. Instead, in an artificial and controlled environment 
they can manufacture simpler and more rugged systems that can then be 
transferred to their final destination.>

Congratulations to Anders for coming up with a scenario that 
challenges this approach.

More recently, Eugene posted >H FYI: NASA Explains How Molecular-Sized 
Gears Might Work, a post by Bruce Mackenzie to the NSG forwarding a 
NASA press release from those responsible for the NASA URL Merkle 
mentioned:
<One practical use of nanotechnology would be to build a "matter 
compiler," said Creon Levit, a Globus colleague at Ames. "We would 
give this machine, made of nano parts, some raw materials, like 
natural gas, for example.  A computer program would specify an 
arrangement of atoms, and the matter compiler would arrange the atoms 
from the raw materials to make a macro-scale machine or parts," Levit 
added.>

Later in this NASA press release, Globus is cited saying:
<"We would like to write computer programs that would enable 
assembler/replicators to make aerospace materials, parts and machines 
in atomic detail," he said.  "Such materials should have tremendous 
strength and thermal properties."  Further information on these 
materials can be obtained on the researchers' Internet page at URL:
               http://www.nas.nasa.gov/nanotechnology.  >

Well, I have to admit that I didn't take the time to look at these 
NASA pages in any detail; but, somehow I doubt, from what the NASA 
people have said above, that they have looked at the type of 
approaches Anders was suggesting.

I don't want to restart the flame wars over whether 'positional 
control' is practical for building macro-scale devices or not, and I 
guess I'll just have to wait for Anders to finish his article, but I 
would be very interested to know if he has found anyone working on the 
chemical-signaling approach to nano-construction that he was 
suggesting.

Oh no! The extropians mailing list has become subverted by over-unity
energy schemes, which are currenly plaguing sci.hydrogen (Michael Hannon &
consorts). Unless you are considering cold fusion, which does not work
(whatever happened to muon-catalysed cold fusion?), water is not a source
of energy (which only occurs in the stars and the H-nuke, which fuses
deuterium-tritium, both being hydrogen isotopes). Hydrogen produced from
water by means of (PV-originated) electrolysis is not a source of energy,
but an energy conserve, utilizing your friendly fusion power plant -- the
sun.  Since gaseous hydrogen has a low energy density, requiring costly
and heavy high-pressure tanks, basically the same problems riddling
cryogenic and hydride storage, the best solution emerged so far is
on-board fuel reforming. The resulting hydrogen+carbon dioxide mix is then
converted into electricity by means of a fuel cell, a cold/non-Carnot
device, having the highest energy conversion efficiency known. It is still
below unity, however. I suggest you consult the basic laws of
thermodyamics...

Recently I requested from the participants of  this  list, any and all
information  available here on the net  which  members could provided =

to me in assisting  in my recuperation from my recent heart attack. To
those of you who responded, Thank You, but I must admit I was surprised
at the  list=92s  general indifference to my plight. I should have known
that  discourse on God, the lack of God, the existent of God, requires
the total commitment of all the available neurons of the  members of
this list.  Let me help you in your discourse, first you must have a
heart  attack,  then go to any major hospital=92s  ER, and  lastly  you =

must believe that death is only 5 feet behind you, and gaining with each
second that passes.  After that, you might reprogram  your discussions
concerning God. =


You remind me of what  President L. Johnson once said in his description
of the Washington Press Corp.
=93 I wish one of those Bastards had run for Dog Catcher. before coming t=
o
this town=94   =


I don=92t contribute to this or any other list,  only because I have
nothing to contribute, this is either caused by the lack of knowledge or
the fear of  an intellectual discourse with people more glib and more
intelligent than myself.

I can not teach, all I can do it learn.

But, I have now something to say.  A new drug  lipitor, approved by the
FDA 12/6/96.  If you take it should  lower your  lipids by 50%. Drug  =

has been available in Europe but not here in USA.

Concerning  my  smoking, I  have been smoke free since 01/01/97. =


I have used the NQ system, commonly referred to as the patch  among us
smokers.  Although this system was a  excellent  aid while quitting, you
must be Very careful with it=92s use.  It was a direct contributor to my
visit to the  ER.   After smoking over 40 years, I had narrowed my
arteries, but  was not experiencing ill health.

With the patch , I was able to quit smoking, but the strength of the
dose had  narrowed the arteries more that smoking two packs a day.  I
did not experience pain in the chest caused by this narrowing, instead I
had a  referred pain in the left shoulder.   The Doc said I had =

strained a muscle , and with proper rest this pain would disappear. =

That was on Monday, Tuesday I was in the ER.

So my contribution to this list is,  If you quit smoking and use any
aid, gum or patch, you must assume that any pain, repeat any pain, must
be assumed to be heart related.  Second, for those you who have a high
lipid count, try lipitor, it works better than Bran muffins.

Why do you interpret lack of response to indifference?  I assume that
most of us, like me, simply had nothing to offer you.  Recovery from
heart conditions just isn't a very extropian topic (to be fair, neither
is God, but I don't much bother with those discussions either), and
there is no reason to suspect that anyone here has any expertise in
the field, or any reason to benefit from discussing it.  You have a
serious medical condition.  See a doctor.  What do you need us for?

If you had asked a more specifically extropian question, like "My
doctor prescribed drug X; how would that interfere with my taking of
nootropics?", then we might have been of some value, but even then I
suspect that most of us simply don't know, and are unwilling to guess
in public.

Well, there's a reliable scientific source.  Please read the statement
to which you responded: it doesn't deny that Hydrogen is a useful fuel;
of course it is.  There's no cover-up.  Everyone knows exactly what it
does, and how to do it.  The unfortunate fact is that /producing/ it
by electrolysis takes more enegry than can be generated from combusting
it.  A hydrogen-fueled car may be useful for some applications, but it
is not practical with present technology, and it is not zero-emission
if you include the emissions of the power plant used to produce the
Hydrogen.  There's no conspiracy, and there's no free lunch.

I have this friend who is in a graduate visual arts program at George 
Mason.  Lo and behold, in his art/media/philosophy/crit class, they 
studied the works of Orlan and other members of the Fluxus group, 
which leads him to mention that he has this friend who is hooked into 
this crazy idea called transhumanism that relates to this type of 
art.  

I sent a followup email to his professor to clarify a few points, and 
the next day, this professor grabs Michael in the hallway to ask him 
to give a lecture the next day in class on the subject of 
extropianism and transhumanism!  Unable to reach me that day, he 
frantically downloaded everything he could find, found a few notes I 
had scribbled in one of his books, and winged it for 45 minutes.  He was 
too embarrassed to tell me what he had actually said, but evidently the 
class members showed a high level of interest.  Hopefully I or someone 
else local can give a talk for this professor's next class cycle, with 
more preparation.  But I told Michael that for effort alone he gets a 
gold star!

The guy in Psychedelic Illuminations had the plans and said that the car
worked. Why would he lie? He didn't mention power plants producing
hydrogen. He just mentioned water and a few (small) batteries.

I cannot remember the details, maybe someone could post them so that we
can clear this issue, I'd like to know if the guy is a barefaced liar!

Someone suggested that the cholinergic systems may remain intact with age or 
even hold regenerating capabilities. Yet it is this very system's 
degeneration that is implicated in Alzheimer's and other age-related 
dementias. My work is in the aging brain and I have yet to see someone whose 
neurologic function is preserved despite a deteriorating body. Further, any 
number of common diseases and syndromes associated with aging, such as heart 
disease, stroke, high blood pressure, etc., have significant effects on the 
brain, such as affecting its blood supply. In the real world the mind is 
inseperable from the body. I can't imagine how one can conclude that the brain 
has even a theroetical lifespan seperable from the rest of the body. Be nice 
if some evidence could be presented, or even an appeal to authority by way of 
a reference...

The best I could tell you would be to do an AltaVista advanced query on
"(recuperate OR recuperation) NEAR "heart attack".  You can also check
out Medline.  There's an abstract search engine there, and there also
happens to be an article on eating habits and heart health.  The URL is
http://www.healthgate.com/HealthGate/MEDLINE/search.shtml.

You were obviously extremely frightened by your experience.  Certainly I
would be too, but even if I become frightened enough to start believing
in God (unlikely), I'll want to make sure my friends are ready to execute
my cryonics arrangements -- I have a lot more confidence in them (the
friends _and_ the arrangements).

I can see you're feeling hostile about your reception.  I on the other
hand am feeling unfairly attacked, perhaps taking too personally your
inclusive "you".  I'll put it behind me -- I hope you can too.

The people here are certainly glib and intelligent, but I can hardly
believe that the people on every mailing list you come across are more
glib and intelligent than you are.  Being able to spell "participant",
"recuperation", and "experience" puts you a cut above a lot of people
right there.

I hate when people run themselves down that way (maybe I'm sensitized
because I've done it so often).

Congratulations!  Keep up the good work, and don't be surprised or
disheartened if you still feel cravings after a year or more.

How are you doing with cutting your nicotine dose?  Patches are
better than smoking, but as you've discovered the hard way, nicotine
is still not good for you.

BTW -- how much exercise do you get?  If you're eating those bran
muffins, and your fruits and vegetables, that may be the next thing
to tackle.

Yes, the car works, as we already said.  Of course it does.  Everyone
knows Hydrogen power works.  It's old technology.  No big deal.
Now, the $64,000 question: where does the Hydrogen come from?  From
water.  How do you extract it?  By electrolysis.  How much power does
the electrolysis take?  More than produced by the combustion of the
resulting Hydrogen.  No free lunch.

"Why would he lie?" is the mantra of conspiracy loonies everywhere,
and is an irrational question.  People lie because sometimes it's
in their interest.  To sell magazines and books.  To get publicity
they wouldn't otherwise.  To embarrass people they feel inferior to.
Because they heard something and don't have the ability or inclination
to verify it.  Because it's fun.  To cover their asses or hide their
tracks.  Because they're insane.  Take your pick.

	The Sovereign would use the "we".  Any who must answer to the Sovereign

commonly called our personality is but a collage of masks (L. persona) 
When one recognizes they operate behind various persona, they begin to

I had the immense privilege tonight of attending a lecture by Max Perutz 
(Nobel Prize, chemistry) celebrating the life and accomplishments of 
Lise Meitner, whose work led to the discovery of nuclear fission.  It 
was refreshing to hear that this female genius was respected and 
esteemed by the top physicists and chemists, and the relevant 
obscurity of her career had more to do with the disruptions wrought 
by the two world wars.  

A distinguished audience including friends of Perutz and prominent 
members of the scientific community gathered in the elegant main room 
of the Chancery of the Embassy of Austria.  Somehow the Library of 
Congress was persuaded to release their collection of books on 
Meitner for the evening. Accompanied by slides of historical photographs, 
Perutz provided both an historical overview and his own personal 
insights into that turbulent period of history as it was experienced by 
the great scientists of the era.  He described Lise as a woman who 
'combined a brilliant mind with a warm heart, compassion and a sense of 
humor.'  

The stories he told reflected the quest for discovery and 
pure joy of pursuing the frontiers of the new sciences, and this 
positivity infected the audience.  Upon the announcement that an 
element discovered in 1982 has been named 'Meitnerium', a great round 
of applause broke out.  When we adjourned for chemical experiments 
involving wine, I was able to have a few words with Mr. Perutz, wherein 
I found him a friendly and upbeat person.  Many thanks to the 
Austrians for providing such an informative and entertaining evening.

*A brief summary for those interested:*

Lise Meitner was born into a Viennan Jewish family and was raised in 
an intellectual atmosphere.  Although official schooling for women 
ended at the age of 14, Lise obtained private lessons and eventually 
entered the Vienna University, where she studied under Boltzmann.  
Moving on to Berlin, where she was to remain for 31 years, she 
attended Max Planck's memorable debates with the logical positivists 
who declared that atoms simply couldn't exist because they couldn't 
be seen.  In her first job, she was banned from the chemistry lab and 
had to set up working space in a woodshed, because women weren't 
allowed in the main lab!  This proved only a minor setback as her 
work progressed, and the discovery of X-rays led to exciting work in 
radioactivity experiments.  An hypothesis formulated by Lise, 
Frische (sic?) and proven by Hahn's experiments resulted in two papers 
that established fission as a reality and led to the infamous  
memorandum to the British government detailing how to construct an 
atomic bomb.  

During World War I, Lise worked as an X-ray nurse on the Eastern 
Front, the Italian front, and then the Russian front.  Upon her 
return to Berlin, she took a university position and began a lifelong 
collaboration with Otto Hahn.  Just prior to World War II, as the 
Nazi laws took effect, Lise was denounced by one of her younger 
colleagues.  Invitations for safe haven arrived from colleagues around 
the world, but she waited too long and became trapped in Berlin.  A 
group of Dutch physicists organized a complex rescue operation 
involving the Dutch border guards, and Lise fled into Holland with 
only two suitcases and ten marks.  Unable to find work in Holland, 
she left for Stockholm just in time to avoid the mass deportation of 
Jews.  Sadly, she remained stranded for many years in Stockholm 
without money, equipment, or trained assistants who spoke her 
language.  

In 1962 she retired to Cambridge, where Max Perutz met her 
and later nominated her for the Ferme Prize.  She was awarded the Ferme 
Prize two years prior to her death.  Although nominated twice for the 
Nobel, she did not receive it, first due to confusion over which 
committee should judge her work, and secondly due to the immense 
communications problems during the WWII.  It is somewhat fitting that 
the Ferme Prize should be awarded to her, as Ferme used his own Nobel 
Prize money to secure escape to the U.S. for himself and his Jewish 
wife.

Have you ever read Hazlitt's "Economics in One Lesson"? "Tanstaafl"

is a useful heuristic and a reminder. _Somebody_ paid for that pizza.

Is that being "picky", or just telling the truth?

Hi,

You might want to check out "Protien Power" by Michael R. Eades, M.D. and
Mary Dan Eades, M.D.  "Why too many carbohydrates in your diet stimulate
your insulin production, which actually makes your body store fat." There's
some info in there about improving your total cholesterol/HDL ratio with
diet. The jury is still out, but I lost fat, lowered my triglycerides by 200
points, lowered my total C, lowered my LDL, raised my HDL (slightly), with
the low carb diet described in the book. See also "The Zone" by Barry Sears.

I'm not indifferent; it's just that there's nothing I can tell you that your
doctor won't already know. Eat less, eat healthy, exercise, take an aspirin a
day, etc, etc.  By "virtue" of being the leading cause of death, heart
attacks are well-understood.

I'm not entirely unfamiliar with that.  I've had a stroke and gone to the
hospital unable to walk straight, speak clearly, write, or distingush between
dream and reality.  I was informed that this was AIDS, and when it became
clear it wasn't that, that it was an inoperable brain tumor (it wasn't that
either).  As it developed, it was just a stroke (embolic or migrainous), and
a small one, and I recovered.  Although the experience changed my faith in
doctors' accuracy, it didn't change my non-faith in God(s).

Philosophical nit-pick: The logical positivists would not say this. They
would say that the question of the existence of atoms is meaningless *if*
they cannot be observed. Any statement that cannot be broken down into
directly observable entities is meaningless to the logical positivists.

Interesting bit of scientific history Kathryn.

But note that Sears, while making large amounts of money from marketing his
books, nutritional programs, and other products, has not actually bothered
to scientifically validate his claims. His book sounds quite plausible, and
I think it makes some good points, but his main claims are far from well
grounded in studies. His grand claims are backed by results from a tiny
number of people. It makes sense to me to lower carbohydrates (compared to
the US average), especially those with a high glycemic index, but Sears
particular claims go way beyond the evidence.

Thomas Petzinger Jr's "Front Lines" column in today's Wall Street 
Journal reviews a little-known book by Abraham Maslow (of 
self-actualization fame) from 1965 called _Eupsychian Management_ that 
Peter Drucker calls "by far Maslow's best book".

The entire book is available on the Web at
http://www.scarletfire.com/maslow.

I browsed through some of it and it looks fairly extropian at a 
glance, though much of it will probably seem like 'common sense' to 
most of the people on this list.

Speaking for myself, the cost in dignity and risk of disease would be
considerable, much greater in fact than the cost of the pizza.  Even if
this was not a factor, some work has to be used to get the pizza out of the
dumpster.  A very cheap lunch may be possible, but not a free one.

That is the whole point, the quantities we are talking about are not
observed in multiples of some invariant "unit".  Take muon decay as
an example.  To the best of our knowledge, muon is an elementary
particle.  It decays into an electron and two neutrinos.  If what you
are saying were true, momentum of the electron in the rest frame of
the parent muon would be quantized, meaning it could only have values
from a discrete set, and the spacing between the possible values would
be some constant.  This is not observed.  Electrons from muon decays
have a continuous momentum spectrum, and the probability distribution
of that spectrum can be calculated with little sweat.

Mass is equivalent to energy, and also doesn't come in discreete
steps.  It was fashionable in the middle of this century to split
mass eigenstates by their intrinsic width into "particles" and
"resonances", but in fact there is no logical difference between
the two.  What I'm saying is, every particle that decays has a
fuzzy mass.  The exact amount of fuzziness depends on how quickly
it decays.  For example, a rho is sort of an excited pion, and its
intrinsic width is about ten percent of its mass.  It decays into
two pions most of the time.  There is nothing discrete about its
mass.  You can observe a rho at 770 MeV as easily as at 770 plus
pi MeV.  Both particles are equally real.

It is certainly true that some observable quantities, like spin, have
discrete (you prefer "digital") spectra, but energy/momentum/mass do
not.

No, you cannot count crests of a single photon.  By "counting" a single
crest you are destroying the photon.  This particular fact is the gist
of the Heisenberg inequality and its most "intuitive" explanation:
"counting" a crest of a photon means measuring its electromagnetic
field, but the photon itself _is_ electromagnetic field, so you are
in fact having it interact with something and therefore destroying
your original photon.  You may still be left with a photon, but that
won't be your original photon.  Counting crests is just a mental crutch.
A gedankenexperiment if you will.

Now, don't confuse this with interference.  Measuring interference is
counting crests of an _ensemble_ of particles.  Yes, you can count
one point three crests, for example by fitting a sine function instead
of counting peaks.  And yes, adding another crest will improve your
measurement by reducing the error.  This is not the same as counting
crests of a single particle.  Interference is a beautiful quantum
phenomenon in that it defies "intuition" in a maximal way.  Even if
you send particles one by one through a contraption that makes them
interfere, you will still see the interference pattern.  The only
"intuitive" (i.e. classical) explanation is that single particles
self-interfere, which is of course horse manure.  Quantum mechanics
is simply not intuitive to a classically indoctrinated mind, as you
aptly put it:

Again, don't forget that all these weirdnesses are problems of
interpretation, not of quantum mechanics itself.  QM works.

True, and the shift is not discrete.  It is continuously variable,
so in principle you can make any source emit on any (non-quantized)
wavelength.

It doesn't matter.  The point is that c and h are more fundamental
than meter or second.

Exactly, nail on the head.  It is the relationship between the two
constants that is fundamental, not the value of the units we choose
to express them in.  Or, as Jay Reynolds Freeman noticed:

What would "directly observable" mean?  Eyes?  Light microscope?

1) Obviously, the first step is to quit smoking. If you do so, in a
   few years your risk of cancers and heart disease will dramatically
   fall, although not quite as low as it might if you had never
   smoked.
2) Your second big risk factor is diet. Dean Ornish's studies show
   that moving to a low fat vegan diet is one of the few documented
   ways of reversing the progress of heart disease.
3) Various and sundry antioxidants, especially Vitamin E, have been
   shown to have beneficial effects in the long term, although I have
   no idea if the literature has any evidence for what their impact
   might be on someone who is already suffering from heart disease.
4) Moderate exercise is also in order, according to the experts.

and finally,

5) Have you made cryonics arrangements for yourself yet?

Good questions, and they point to major problems with logical positivism.
Today's descendents of the logical positivists are the empiricists like van
Fraasen. I find far more plausible the scientific realist approach which
lets you talk meaningfully about entities that cannot be directly observed
(with unaided human senses) or observed at all (they can be inferred by
their effects).

For an excellent argument on this issue between the two viewpoints, see

just from what you just said, I can tell that he is a liar. There is
absolutely no way to move the entire mass of a car with the output of a
few "small batteries". At best, a few motorcycle batteries could power
an electric motor on a car for a few hundred yards. It does not matter
if you are turning the electric potential into electrolysed hydrogen in
the process, except for making the process even more inefficient, as
combustion engines are less efficient than electric motors, with the
exception of constant load turbine generators. The thing you need to
understand is that the amount of electricity you have in the batteries
limits the total amount of hydrogen you can produce, as electrolysis
merely stores that energy in the hydrogen molecules. Unless he is
claiming that he is getting energy from a cold fusion process, there is
no way he can justify powering an automobile on the energy in a few
small batteries, and even then, he must have a really good CF technology
to produce a minimum of 200% surplus output to be usefull in propelling
a car.

Using hydrogen as an energy source for ground transportation, despite
being the pipe dream of Greens everywhere, has not made an entry into
the market because it is technolgically and economically unfeasible
until the price of oil reaches at least $60 per barrel, i.e. not in the
forseeable future. Remember, you need to make that hydrogen at power
plants, and without nuclear plants, we are talking about fossil fuels
(if all of the wind and water power in the world were harnessed with no
consideration for environmental effects, it would add up to less than
15% of current demand; with automobile power demands on the grid, expect
this to be less than 3% of demand). While the concept of producing all
power at power plants where generators run at maximum efficiency
(75-95%) on a constant basis is an optimum one, using hydrogen as a
medium of transporting that power is not. 

WHile hydrogen is light, it is also very bulky, and has a very lower
power density, as bad or worse than current electric batteries. It is
also extremely corrosive, making storeage, pumping, and engine parts
very expensive to build and maintain. Use of this fuel is also not 100%
efficient either, contrary to the prior writers statement. The most
efficient hydrolysis of water attains 98-99% efficiency, while the
motors in cars that would burn the hydrogen have the same levels of
inefficiency as current motors, as that is what they are. An internal
combustion motor is at shaft typically 45% efficient, while the
efficiencies of the power train and surface and atmospheric drag cause
this rate to be degraded to around 18-24% or less, no matter what fuel
is burned. Hydrogen also burns very hot, requiring materials of higher
temperature endurance than normal engines.

Until fuel cells become compact enough to be really usefull, which I
think will happen in 5-10 years at most, the optimum power system for a
car is a small 15kW gas turbine generator running electric drive motors
and maintaining an electric charge in a battery system 1/10th the size
of that currently used in electric cars, which is only needed for on
demand power needs (acceleration). The turbine runs at constant max
efficiency, like a large power plant, is compact, with a high power
density.

And where does the power come from that turns the water into hydrogen
and oxygen? Power plants, of course.

How much does this cost?  Can you provide any URLs on this?  Thanks.

I'm not satisfied with how well the Extropy Institute web site shows up on
the search engines, especially now that we're about to get the word out
about EXTRO 3.

I welcome suggestions for registration services. I have information from
Central Registry which looks good, though it costs $249. For that they
register you with 550 indexes and directories. They claim to be the oldest
registry and the most comprehensive. Does anyone know if they are good? Are
there others services practically as good but less expensive?

Thanks for any suggestions,

Max

No, it wouldn't; in fact, the false vacuum hypothesis makes it worse.
If this hypothesis is true, it means that there were no technological
civilizations in our galaxy until extremely recently: at most 50,000
years or so.  

Actually, I think that this is a pretty good argument against the
hypothesis that we're living in a false vacuum and that it's
easy to induce a phase transition.  If it were that easy, then
someone else would probably have done it by now.

(But I admit that I get a kick out of imagining protests outside the
construction site of the next major accelerator, with protesters
waving "SAVE THE UNIVERSE" banners.)

We see two things: an old universe and an empty universe.  This theory
explains one (emptiness) at the expense of the other (age).  Your
choice between this theory and a theory that advanced life is just
very very unlikely depends on your prior expectations.  If you can't
swallow life being that unlikely, you might rather swallow us remaining
in such a remarkably old universe.

As a researcher myself, I can attest that we do not know what we are

research". :-)

Hi.

I would highly recommend the Exploit submission wizard available from
http://www.exploit.com/.
Not only is it much cheaper (~$30 ?), it is as comprehensive as most
anything else out there.  A lot of "submission services" use this tool.

I know of many people and organizations who have used it with great success.

Quanitity of listing is useless.  What counts is consumer attention,
which is dominated by the top dozen or so indexes (Yahoo, AltaVista,
Excite, ...), which are all free.  Who care's if some podunk index
lists you or not if nobody looks there?

Seems to me, the best strategy is a little simple elbow grease.  Sit
down at each of the big indexes, look for subjects related to you,
and send mail to whatever lists you find.  If you can't find them on
the first pass, they don't matter; and if those 500 lists aren't the
ones found on a related-subject search, they don't matter either.

Also--and this is an important underappreciated matter--keep your
HTML clean and searchable.  Make sure your headers are actually
in header tags, that you include appropriate keyword METAs, that all
text is entered as actual text and not just graphics, that all the
graphics have ALT tags, that you don't play tricks like capitalizing
words like "<font size=+1>E<font size=-1>xtropy", etc.  Things like
that make it harder for search engines to find keywords and index you
appropriately.  In other words, write to the medium: HTML is a language
of content and structure, not appearance and style.  You need style as
well, of course, and that's what style sheets are for.  Unfortunately
the big two browsers don't yet correctly support style sheets (IE 3.0
supports most of it, Netscape not at all), so you'll have to do some
embedded style work until Netscape gets off their ass and does it
right, but you can still be kind to the robots without sacrificing too
much style.

Thanks, although I must admit I wasn't interested (or even aware) of the 
difference in approach. I have probably been dealing with the biosciences 
too long :-)

I actually think we need to learn how to build general purpose nanites
that can work in complex environments, although it is a good idea to 
shelter the assemblers. I'm more and more coming to think of my system as 
an ant-colony: worker nanites dig our raw materials and extract energy to 
feed a pampered central assembler making new hives. It works in nature 
and ought to work well in regolith.

Me too :-) I know some alife people are working on ant-like simulations of
chemical signals, but I would like to do morphogenesis too. For example,
once the colony has reached sufficient size it should react and change its
behvior. This might be acheieved by having each nanite produce slight
amounts of a signal substance, and when the concentration goes above a
certain level the assembler begins to build nanites to build new hives, or
parts for a macroscopic project. Almost exactly what happens in slime
molds. Once the hives or parts are finished, a chemical signal would stop
their production and a new phase could begin. If a hive was damaged, it
would revert to the more basic rebuiilding level before working on the
macro level.

The problem with gas turbines, even if you buffer the energy like you
describe above, is that they are inefficient in city driving environments.
A car driving on surface streets or rush hour traffic spends most of its
time at idle or near idle.  If your commute is anything like mine, your
small battery buffer would become full quite quickly, forcing you to idle
the turbine.  Since idling turbines are horribly inefficient, I suspect the
actual savings from this configuration would minimal.  If we applied
turbine technology to highway driving, then you would see significant gains
in efficiency, but in this instance you don't really need the electrical
conversion anyway.

I've driven a turbine powered car before, and they are very nice.  Lots of
power and very smooth acceleration.  Supposedly some company is working on
a prototype turbine that can idle nearly as efficiently as a vanilla
internal combustion engine.  Turbines actually make a lot of sense if you
are looking for a lot of power in a compact package.  The turbine car that
I drove put out in excess of 600 horsepower, but was as fuel efficient as
most sports cars in the 400 horsepower range.

I don't get it.  I assume "this theory" refers to "Changed space-time

still has to be unlikely, or we'd be dead already because the universe
is old.  So it doesn't help anything.

The batteries do not power the car, they power the process. Whatever that

The key to electrolysis is, as many with a passing familiarity with the
English language may deduce, electricity.  Sure, you could split the water
molecule with an on board battery and then combust the hydrogen, but that
would be like running a sail boat with a fan when you could just as easily
get a boat with an engine.  Use the electricity directly.  It would be
considerably more efficient that way.
Also, an incredibly efficient power source would not ruin the economy.  If
the oil companies owned it, they could simply sell it for an enormous price
and invest the proceeds in some business that would turn a profit.  If
someone else owned it, the ICE would go the way of the horse and buggy. 
That did not ruin the economy.

Apologies to all those who have actually taken chemistry and know something
about price theory.

Danny,

I read the same article but do not have it with me. Could you post it here
as I am in agreement with you, but am willing to be called naive AFTER,
and only after, the disenters have read it.

Ah, so he's not lying, he's just too stupid to do the calculations
right, because he's not adding the energy of the batteries to the
input side of the equation.  Batteries get charged somehow.  Producing
Hydrogen by electrolysis is an old well-known process, and the amount
of energy required to produce a mole of H2 from water you can look up
in any first-year chemistry text, where you can also look up the energy
produced by cumbusting H2.  You can't dance around the laws of physics,
no matter how hard you wish upon a star.  If the thing actually worked,
the man would be a billionaire, not a crackpot writing for a
third-class magazine.

If someone puts the article on the net, I'll waste a few minutes
reading it--it might be entertaining--but until then, I see no further
use for spending more of my time pointing out the obvious.

Why should I feel particularly interested in your plight? I don't mean this
as a flame, but really why should I? You are a complete stranger to me. You
are not a close friend. Lots of people die everyday. You say in your first
message that you smoked 2 packs a day for forty years. Then you got a heart
attack. Wow! Its hardly surprising. Perhaps the only surprise to me is that
it was a heart attack and not cancer. As someone else has said you have a
serious medical condition and you should be getting serious medical advice,
not getting irritated that complete strangers, who are not medical experts,
for not sending you lots of pseudo-medical advice. I'm sure if you are not
careful you'll get lots of 'helpful' advice from all sorts of people
online.

If you want any advice it would be to take into account that lifestyle
factors are the leading cause of death in our society and diet is
undoubtedly a major factor in many people's unhealth. I have a vegan diet
which is a straighforward way of increasing the amount carbohydrates in
your diet and cutting down the amount of fat. And even being doesn't mean
that you'll eat well you have to be careful to ensure that you get adequate
nutrition (and I still eat more fat than I would like). If in addition to
following a good diet you get regular exercise you'll have made a major
step towards better health. No doubt there are many other things you could
do - like going on a calorie restricted diet - but simply moving towards a
healthy diet, not smoking and getting regular exercise you will have moved
much more than most people in the West towards significantly longer life
expectancy. Obviously given your heart problem you should be very careful
with the amount of exercise do, but I am sure your doctor can advise you
properly.

best wishes,  patrick

>The Libertarian and Green and movements are beginning to coalesce

>into greater discussion

I think there is a lot of room for greater use of libertarian thought in
Green philosophy. Simple economic arguments are uncomfortable to many
Greens. It clear that here in Australia there is a massive subsidy to the
forest industry by the government. The government not only builds roads in
the forest for the logging industry, but does all the clean up and planting
of new trees after logging has finished. This tax subsidy allows woodchips
very cheaply at $70 a tonne which is particular ironic as surveys
repeatedly show that around 80% of Australians don't want forests logged in
the first place. However trying to get Green groups to push a rational
economic line is particularly difficult. There is a strong almost religious
fervor against all economic arguments. Money to many in the movement is
seen as a tool of the devil.

I would very much appreciate getting a better understanding of how
libertarian thought can be meshed with the idea of public property.
Wilderness areas to the Greens are common property to all and must be
managed as such by a government body and this I think (from my shallow
reading of libertarian philosophy) would be a major sticking point between
better integration of the two groups.

Electrolysis probably can be done in a car--but be careful going over bumps, especially when working on sensitive areas like the upper lip or bikini area... ;) ;)


As for positive-sum water dissociation--I'll believe it when I see it.

Every time *I've* done 2(h2o)-->2(h2) + o2, it stopped when I pulled the plug, and it cost me electricity to do it at all.


Back in the earlier part of this century, people were routinely taken in by the "pill that runs a car on a tankful of water".


When it wasn't an outright fake, the pill was calcium carbide--just

a slightly more subtle fake.


I am not calling anyone a liar--but I'll only believe it when I can see a working unit, and tear into it to my heart's content.

Sender: postmaster@extropy.org

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

I watched a documentary by David Suzuki on population growth recently. Paul
Ehrlich was featured prominently and his famous bet with Julian Simon about
commodity prices was also mentioned.

The story I had heard previously was that Simon's challenge to Ehrlich was
to choose any non-governmentally controlled commodities, choose any period
of time greater than a year, put up a $1k and if the prices went up Simon
would pay Ehrlich (and others involved in the bet) the difference, while if
the prices went down they would pay him the difference. In the end
Ehrlich's group chose five metals - chromium, copper, nickel, tin and
tungsten - bought $200 worth of each on paper and set a ten year time
period. All the prices went down and they lost $576.07.

The story told in the documentary what that Ehrlich's group was basically
only allowed to chose metals - no other commodities were allowed. They also
didn't mention the amount of money he lost or the fact that he was able to
choose the time period.

They did mentioned that much more recently there has been a second
challenge by Ehrlich to Simon, but that Simon had not taken up the bet.
Does anyone know what's become of this second bet? And what the true story
of the first bet is?

The program itself was irritating is many ways. One stupidity that
particularly irritated me was Ehrlich saying things like its impossible for
an economy to keep growing indefinitely - implying that it would be against
the laws of nature. No mention or even conception of the fact that
non-physical resources could make up a major part of a growing economy.
Does anyone have any figures on what part of the growth in the global
economy in the last 50 years has been based on non-physical resources?

best,  patrick

If more people could accept that they are wrong instead of clinging to 
erroneous beliefs by principle, then we would be a great step closer to 
transhumanity. 

Hmm, could somebody please remind me of what I am wrong about? :-)

I read an Extropian posting on Moravec's book MIND AGE.  I called the
Philadelphia library and it is not in the system.  I called Barnes &
Noble bookstore and the clerk said it is not in print.  I checked Amazon
on-line books and it was not there.  Where can I get this book?  Or do I
have the title wrong?   I already read MIND CHILDREN.

Some time back, I began putting together an "extropian environmentalism" web
page:

        http://users.aol.com/gburch1/exenv.html

I would GREATLY welcome additional input to it and suggestions for links.  I
found The pointer to Harry Reid's commentary on the "Ten Green Values" very
interesting and will likely add a link to it in my environmentalism page.

Also, I encourage anyone interested in these questions to come along on
EXpedition 97, a backpacking trip this summer (details on the web page noted
below): I'm sure questions about environmentalism will be on the agenda
around the camp fire!

I think this is wrong -- the reverse of the truth. Simon wanted to renew
the bet, Ehrlich refused, and Simon left the bet open. Ehrlick apparently
isn't that confident about his views, though still goes on to write
dangerously false bestsellers.

This is one of the most idiotic things I've heard of late.

We've got these little laws of physics called the Conservation of Mass
and Energy. Burn hydrogen and oxygen, get water plus energy. Add
energy to water correctly, get hydrogen and oxygen. The amount of
energy you get burning hydrogen and oxygen is exactly equal to the
amount you have to spend to make that much hydrogen and oxygen from
water.

In other words, BULLSHIT. You *can't* make energy by electrolyzing
water and burning it, since you needed at least that much energy to do
the electrolysis. I don't care what you read on the net, or what
government conspiracies were invoked. It doesn't work.

Next you'll be telling us about how you were abducted by aliens, and
how if we only pray enough we can cure cancer.

I will concur with Lee's first statement here.  I also had assumed that 
people would contact you via private mail if they had advice or 
insight into your condition.  I am sure that most who read your post 
would offer their sympathy, but sympathy would not necessarily be of 
the greatest use to you right now.

On the other hand, we should feel free to ask life advice from each 
other, utilize each other as resources.  Persons who pioneer 
transhumanist thinking can at the least be misunderstood and 
at the worst become isolated.

Because it is common knowledge to many on this list, I can tell you 
that I do relate to your condition in that I have also experienced 
recovery from near death.  While very difficult to endure at the 
time, it proved to be the most incredible learning experience of my 
little life and became a source of strength and perspective. When 
faced with the tremendous effort required to walk, talk and speak 
again, you have to know why you are undergoing that, what your goals are, 
what life is worth in the most basic of calculations.  And while 
others can help you with the physical and medical aspects of this 
process, the rest of it involves you facing yourself and that line 
that delineates our existence, without the comfort of the minor 
illusions humans conjur to ease their passages in life.  This 
exploration is every bit as dangerous and exciting as that taken by 
the astronauts who shoot off into space, and the knowledge gained is 
just as important to our advancement into whatever future forms.

Take care,

Kathryn Aegis

Patrick Wilken asked about the most recent wager between Paul Ehrlich 
and Julian Simon:
<The story told in the documentary what that Ehrlich's group was 
basically only allowed to chose metals - no other commodities were 
allowed. [SNIP] They did mentioned that much more recently there has 
been a second challenge by Ehrlich to Simon, but that Simon had not 
taken up the bet. Does anyone know what's become of this second bet? 
And what the true story of the first bet is?>

Just this past week, Simon wrote a commentary on this in the Wall 
Street Journal.  Ehrlich and company lost the first bet and paid up. 
 As for the second bet, Simon said they could pick any measure(s) of 
growth they liked and he would bet that over a period of ten years or 
more the measure would increase.

I'm not sure I remember all the details, but apparently Ehrlich wanted 
to use something like the amount of ozone in the atmosphere as a 
measure of progress and Simon said, no, it would have to be some 
measure of economic growth.  So now, according to Simon, Ehrlich is 
running around saying that Simon will no longer risk betting on 
progress in the future.

I'm not sure about the 2nd bet. But, Wired magazine published a story about
Simon called "Doomslayer." I think he was on the cover. Here's part of the
article that tells the story of the 1st bet:

---------------
. . . The battle lines now drawn, it was not long before Ehrlich and Simon
met for a duel in the sun. The face-off occurred in the pages of Social
Science Quarterly, where Simon challenged Ehrlich to put his money where his
mouth was. In response to Ehrlich's published claim that "If I were a
gambler, I would take even money that England will not exist in the year
2000" - a proposition Simon regarded as too silly to bother with - Simon
countered with "a public offer to stake US$10,000 ... on my belief that the
cost of non-government-controlled raw materials (including grain and oil)
will not rise in the long run." 

You could name your own terms: select any raw material you wanted - copper,
tin, whatever - and select any date in the future, "any date more than a
year away," and Simon would bet that the commodity's price on that date
would be lower than what it was at the time of the wager. 

"How about it, doomsayers and catastrophists? First come, first served." 

In California, Paul Ehrlich stepped right up - and why not? He'd been
repeating the Malthusian argument for years; he was sure that things were
running out, that resources were getting scarcer - "nearing depletion," as
he'd said - and therefore would have to become more expensive. A public
wager would be the chance to demonstrate the shrewdness of his forecasts,
draw attention to the catastrophic state of the world situation, and, not
least, force this Julian Simon character to eat his
words. So he jumped at the chance: "I and my colleagues, John P. Holdren
(University of California, Berkeley) and John Harte (Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory), jointly accept Simon's astonishing offer before other greedy
people jump in." 

Ehrlich and his colleagues picked five metals that they thought would
undergo big price rises: chromium, copper, nickel, tin, and tungsten. Then,
on paper, they bought $200 worth of each, for a total bet of $1,000, using
the prices on September 29, 1980, as an index. They designated September 29,
1990, 10 years hence, as the payoff date. If the inflation-adjusted prices
of the various metals rose in the interim, Simon would pay Ehrlich the
combined difference; if the prices fell, Ehrlich et alia would pay Simon. 

Then they sat back and waited.

Between 1980 and 1990, the world's population grew by more than 800 million,
the largest increase in one decade in all of history. But by September 1990,
without a single exception, the price of each of Ehrlich's selected metals
had fallen, and in some cases had dropped through the floor. Chrome, which
had sold for $3.90 a pound in 1980, was down to $3.70 in 1990. Tin, which
was $8.72 a pound in 1980, was down to $3.88 a decade later.

Which is how it came to pass that in October 1990, Paul Ehrlich mailed
Julian Simon a check for $576.07 . . . .

The list archive on the Web seems to be broken; unless my browser is on
the blink the by-date archive hasn't been updated since early April. I'm
not sure about the by-thread archive, but that appeared to be out of date 
as well. Since I'm only logging on from home once or twice a week I'd 
like to be able to read the list at work over the Web.

I am no geologist.  I am no economist.  To say we are running out of any 
mineral (except oil) just basically seems silly.  The earth's crust should 
be strewn with every mineral known to man (and then some....wood and air is 
a far more known limiter).  It may take a little bit more searching and 
deeper digging to find them but we have only scratched the resources.  Oil 
may be an exception, but we may still have vast resources we haven't found. 
 Oil may also be in it's last gasps.  Shale oil is another matter.  But 
chromium?  Copper?  Tin?  Nickel?  The 'mother lodes' of these minerals are 
probably just the tip of the iceberg of resources hiding in the crust (the 
deepest mine is only a mile or two down, correct?  Anyone attempted mining 
Greenland?)  Prices may rise, because the monopolies can do it, but we 
won't run out of these metals.

The popular belief we ARE running out of basic minerals may spawn a new 
interest in space travel/space engineering as we can get these from the 
moon and/or asteroids, a good thing.

-----Original Message-----

You could name your own terms: select any raw material you wanted - 
copper,
tin, whatever - and select any date in the future, "any date more than a
year away," and Simon would bet that the commodity's price on that date
would be lower than what it was at the time of the wager.

Ehrlich and his colleagues picked five metals that they thought would
undergo big price rises: chromium, copper, nickel, tin, and tungsten. 
Then,
on paper, they bought $200 worth of each, for a total bet of $1,000, using
the prices on September 29, 1980, as an index. They designated September 
29,
1990, 10 years hence, as the payoff date. If the inflation-adjusted prices
of the various metals rose in the interim, Simon would pay Ehrlich the
combined difference; if the prices fell, Ehrlich et alia would pay Simon.

[SNIP]

Between 1980 and 1990, the world's population grew by more than 800 
million,
the largest increase in one decade in all of history. But by September 
1990,
without a single exception, the price of each of Ehrlich's selected metals
had fallen, and in some cases had dropped through the floor. Chrome, which
had sold for $3.90 a pound in 1980, was down to $3.70 in 1990. Tin, which
was $8.72 a pound in 1980, was down to $3.88 a decade later.

Which is how it came to pass that in October 1990, Paul Ehrlich mailed
Julian Simon a check for $576.07 . . . .

DO a search for the term "hybrid electric vehicle", which is what the
correct terminology for this sort of vehicle is. Several of the big car
manufacturers have made test vehcles using this system, including GM,
and the Electric Power Research Institute has  done a study on the
concept which is available, possibly also available through the Dept. fo
Energy. An additional term for more discriminating searching would be
+"gas turbine", to make sure you get just those types of vehicles in
your info.

A 15 kW turbine generator is only the equivalent of about 12 hp (
corrections anyone?), which is considered the nominal needs of
overcoming rolling/ atmospheric friction for a normal car, plus
accessory power needs. WHile your objection of idling while topped off
is true, that would not be a normal case, and the turbine would
typically be shut down. Additionally, you are right that a hybrid
vehicle is a highway/long commute/trip/vacation/rural area type vehicle.
In the case of an urban commuter, such a vehicle would not have any
need, as a normal electric vehicle would be optimal for that, with a
commute of less than 20 miles and accessible power jacks on either end
of the trip for recharging. The hybrid is being developed for those
non-urban markets where electric vehicles still have power and range
problems.

Here's a tip: in the header of your pages, put a paragraph of 0 size
type that has multiple copies of all the key words and phrases. Since
the header is what gets read first, even engines that read only the
first 50 or 100 words will flag you as having multiple mentions of the
key phrases you think people will use to search with, so your pages will
come up first on the returns list as having the most relevancy to the
query.

I've used the private registry services, and they are a pain in the
butt. Each still expects you to fill out all the info for each type of
search engine. Just to register a corporate site I authored with 20
engines via the Submit It site, it took a day and a half of work online
to fill out all the forms and reply to their email replies for verifying
the data, plus fixing the inevitable screwups their automated systems
cause.

I find that working with link exchanges is best, cause when someone else
registers their pages, and they have links to you, the spiders follow
the links to you. My "Mikey's Rail Nut Heaven" page wound up registered
with a few search engines within a few days of me putting it up cause
someone else found the page via my main page and liked it so  much they
put up links to it.

Keep in mind, despite their requests to only register one page on your
site, everyone ignores it and registers all their pages, cause otherwise
the spider takes 4-6 months to check out all of the pages, never mind
what they say about 2-3 day service. SO if you've got time on your
hands, register all of your pages, but edit your pages a head of time
with the little keyword gimmick to make your pages have extra relevancy.

WHere is he getting the power to electrolyse the water? From power
plants of course. I highly suggest that you get some hard facts on how
much power his system demands from the grid. 

His claim of his vehicle "ruining the economy" is a bit extreme but not
totally false, as the economy is not built for his technology. The
problem is that there are not enough power plants to meet the needs if
everyone converted to electric/hybrid/or hydrogen type vehicles. The
reason why the California ZEV law mandating 3% of vehicles be electric
ONLY mandates that 3% be electric is that California has a power surplus
equal to what the additional demand would be if 3% of all car owners in
the state converted to electric vehicles. With electric rates among the
highest in the nation, when they export their surplus power to places
like Washington or Oregon, they get only half the amount they get from
customers in their own state, so they'd obviously like to make top
dollar on every kWh they sell, and if they keep that power in their
state and sell it to electric car owners, they make more profits. The
reason why the state kept the level to 3% of car owners is that if more
people converted than that, then demand on the grid would go up, which
would 1) cause more power plants to be built, and 2) electric rates
would go up due to market pressures.

Politicians like keeping the status quo as quo as possible.

As Wayme's buddy Garth said, "We fear change..."

Remember, if it takes more searching and digging to get it, the recovery
costs are going to be greater, thus the price will go up. However, two
factors countered this basic rule:

1) the Soviet Union collapsed. Now that communism is on the outs and
Russia and its client republics are now nominally free markets, they've
flooded the worlds markets with metals, gas and oil, commodities which
are in greatest abundance and purity in ores only in that area
previously off limits to western development and exploitation. So in
effect, in 1990, the free worlds natural resources effectively doubled
overnight, which would obviously lead to lower prices...

2) Recycling. Once a commodity reaches a certain price level, and
remaining natural sources become that much less pure, thus raising their
cost of recovery, then recycling of those exiting supplies of
commodities becomes an economically cost effective proposition. The big
stubling block is that the cost of entry into a recycling supply engine
is steep to begin with due to the political capital needed to be
expended to change people's operating habits. Once this is attained
however, the unitary cost of recycling drops as people's new habits make
supplies of recycled commodities so abundant that demand for new
commodity resources drops.

Additional factors include all sorts of technological changes that
reduce demands for various commodities. Fiber optics have reduced demand
for copper, for example. The place to look for commodity price rises is
in materials that have very little use today, but could become very
useful with new technologies. Just look at the need for high purity
silicon and gallium arsenide that the computer industry has spawned. 30
years ago silicon, also known as sand, was among the most useless items
around, except for nice beaches, traps on golf courses, and for use on
winter roads...

This thread reminded me of a paper from my "Science, Reason, and
Rationality" class last semester.

On the topic of Hacking's arguments against anti-realism:
---------
     "One area that I think Hacking does not explore in enough depth is the
anti-realist reliance solely upon the senses...  I would have explored this
topic further. For instance, what would an anti-realist, who would deny the
existence of infra-red radiation, think of a picture taken with a thermal
imaging device? S/he would say that we have no way of knowing if it
represents what is real. What would an anti-realist say, however, about a
person who could see into the infra-red spectrum because of a genetic mutation? 

     Taking this line of questioning further, what if genetic engineering
eventually allows us to enhance our current senses, allowing us to detect
the polarization of photons, or even to design a completely new sense, such
as the ability to detect ionizing radiation on our skin?
----------

I went on to point out that changes in human senses, whether from random
mutation or engineered, would cause problems to the anti-realist position.
My professor didn't think that this refuted the anti-realist argument to any
extent. I don't know if his reaction was because I misinterpreted the

it, or because this would blow such a big hole in anti-realism that it
wasn't readily apparent. Comments on this from the philosophy of science
heavyweights on this list would be appreciated.

Sometimes yes but not in general. When an excited mercury atom returns to its 
ground state it emits 2 photons, the two are forever linked even if they are 
on the other side of the universe, you can make a destructive measurement on 
one and it will tell you what the measurement of the   correlated, still
existing photon must be. This sort of thing was done by Clauser and Aspect in 
their experiments on Bell's inequality that proved it  was violated.

It's not just spin that's digital, so is the quantity of electric charge,  
and the type of electric charge (2), and baryon number, and electron family 
number, and muon family number, and magnetic moment, and parity, and the 
number (6) of different types of quarks, and the number (3) of "color" 
charges that quarks come in. 

Even polarization is digital, sort of. Pick a direction at random, and for  
any photon of unknown polarization there are only 2 choices, it must be 
polarized in that direction or at right angles to it. If it makes it through  
your polarization filter, it could make it through a thousand set in the  
same direction, and so could any twin photon correlated with it. If it  
doesn't make it through then the photon was polarized at right angles to the  
polarization filter, as can be proven by the correlated photon.

If it decays into something lighter and more stable then it can't be  
very elementary.
           

        >If what you are saying were true, momentum of the electron in the

I see your point and it's a very good one. The energy (and thus the momentum  
too) of the electron is indeed random and limited to the range from zero to 
52 MeV. It's interesting that the range of energy of something like an alpha 
particle given off by a nucleus in not continuous, because it's the only 
particle given off in the decay reaction. When the muon decays on the other 
hand, 3 particles are created and the electron must share the energy with the 
other 2 particles in an arbitrary ratio. I'll just have to find comfort in 
the fact that the total momentum in the rest frame is quantized, to zero in 
this case. :>)
           
I could eliminate all my problems with energy and momentum if I could invoke 
digital space and time, in a way that would be a cheat but in another way it 
wouldn't be. Today's Physics can tell us nothing about what happens when time 
gets smaller than The Plank Time of 5.4 * 10^-44 second or distance gets 
smaller than The Plank Length of 10^-33 cm, photons of that wavelength are so 
small and have so much energy that they become Black Holes, and  Black Holes 
contain a singularity. We had no choice, we've already made a defacto 
quantization of space-time. However, I admit I'm not comfortable using this 
dodge, because at these very small distances Quantum Mechanics and General
Relativity and not compatible, so obviously the last word has not been spoken. 
We need a quantum theory of gravity before we can know for sure.                                  


        >The point is that c and h are more fundamental than meter or second.


Yes, but not more fundamental than space or time.               
                 

        >don't forget that all these weirdnesses are problems of
        >interpretation, not of quantum mechanics itself. 
           

I disagree, an interpretation is part of any theory, quantum mechanics has 
several, all weird.   


        >QM works.


I agree, in fact I would say that no theory in the history of Science has 
been more successful than Quantum Mechanics. It works, it's true, it's crazy.

        Saddam, The Father of All Clones

        By Caroline Lees

        IRAQI scientists have been given the mother of all biological 
        challenges - to clone their leader, Saddam Hussein. ...

        News of Saddam's interest in producing clones of himself will
        undoubtedly reinforce the international clamour for experimen-
        tation with human cloning to be banned. Experts have already 
        argued that the technology could be dangerous in the hands
        of "unscrupulous scientists".

What an unenlightened response.

I am sure you cannot deny that the above phenomena happen in some form.
And I'm equally as sure that you do not know the explanations for said
phenomena, or that they ARE bullshit.

I flunked too. The parrot thing is either:

  A. Nonsense

  B. In code (you need to know the code to understand it or you need to be
     clever enough to figure out the code in order to understand it).

My guess is A. (But, maybe that's because I don't know the code and/or I
haven't been able to figure out the code.)

 Do parents usually have more interest in the welfare of asexually
produced children than in sexually produced children? There are
obvious cases in which the answer is yes (DNA-controlled organisms
or software that normally reproduces by making exact copies), but it
isn't obvious that those cases will predominate in the future, or
that asexual reproduction will predominate.
 Asexual reproduction has always been possible for DNA. DNA has evolved
the more expensive sexual reproduction because it produces better
adaptation. I haven't seen any reason to think that a permanent change
to this principle is about to happen (although short term fluctuations
in the ratio of asexual to sexual reproduction are likely as new reproduction
mechanisms are tried).
 Even if a large surge in direct copying of life happens, I'm uncertain
whether that means the "parent" has more interest in the "child"'s welfare
than with asexual reproduction. If I've already made 1000 direct copies
of myself but only one sexually produced child, will copy #1001 really
be more valuable than unique child #2? Under natural selection as it has
worked for biological organisms, the answer would clearly be yes if we
ignore the adaptive benefits I mentioned in the prior paragraph. But I
suspect that depends on all organisms having roughly equal impact on the
system. I can imagine a trillion copies of myself dominating any analysis
that measures an "average" individual, but being irrelevant to the behavior
of society because most copies are kept isolated as part of experiments
I'm running. (Or is it only the aggregate value of the offspring rather
than the marginal value of the next offspring that matters for the effects
you mention?)

 [Apologies for the slowness of my responses; I've been working too hard].

Julian Simon is an economist and I think one of his main points is that
throughout history scarcity itself has helped to preserve the Earth's
natural resources. As long as a resource is considered useful, it is
considered valuable (and worthy) and it will have a price. The more scarce a
resource becomes, the higher the price will go.

As the price goes up, the number of buyers who think it is still worth the
price will go down. This has a similar effect as conservation, i.e., fewer
users of a resource.

Simon uses fossil fuel as an example. He says we will NEVER run out of oil.
Technically, he's probably right. As oil becomes scarce, the price rises. By
the time the price becomes cost-prohibitive, other useful alternatives or
substitutes will be invented or discovered. By the time we have very little
oil left, it will be so expensive that no one will want to buy it, so we
will never really run out.

 Last year I saw Jim Rogers (who wrote Investment Biker - worth reading)
on CNBC challenge Simon to a bet about the change in prices of metals or
other commodities over the next few years. Simon declined to bet. Simon
probably has some clues about economic cycles and tries to bet only
when pessimism about resource availability is abnormally high.

The whole deal on this water car and why the government doesnt like it is
that ANYBODY can convert their car to run on water through a simple process
of building a hydrogen converter and changing some things in the engine,
putting the oil companies out of business, and ruining the pacts they have
with the government and the economy.

 WHere is he getting the power to electrolyse the water? From power

Actually, I believe the power comes from the alternator.

      By CONNIE FARROW
      ST. LOUIS (AP) - The prize: $10 million. The task: launch a
spaceship that can give the average person a weekend trip in space.
      So far, 10 teams have registered to compete for the prize. The
contestants range from inventors and company presidents to a
serviceman and a retiree.
      The X Prize Foundation is offering the $10 million prize in the
hope private enterprise will build a new space travel industry. The
successful contestants must be able to build a spacecraft that can
carry three adults 62 miles into space, can make two flights in two
weeks and can land intact.
      Peter Diamandis, a 35-year-old with a medical degree from
Harvard and an aerospace engineering degree from MIT who heads the
foundation, said his generation grew up believing ``2001: Space
Odyssey'' was more than a movie.
      ``Many people felt we clearly would have low-cost access for
paying tourists in space by this point,'' he said.
      Diamandis is not alone in his dream of vacations in space at
``orbital hotels'' with panoramic views of the Earth. When he
announced the prize last year on the Gateway Arch grounds in St.
Louis, the crowd included Buzz Aldrin, who walked on the moon with
Neil Armstrong in 1969, and Burt Rutan, who created the first plane
to fly around the world without refueling. Rutan was the first to
announce his intent to enter the X Prize competition.
      Although the private sector must build the winning rocket, NASA
Administrator Dan Goldin said the government would provide any
technical information that has been made public and make available
equipment for purposes such as wind tunnel tests.
      Paul Tryon, a 65-year-old retiree from the St. Louis suburb of
Hazelwood, was the ninth contestant to enter. He has more than 34
years experience in aeronautical engineering, having worked for
McDonnell Douglas and Bell Aircraft.
      ``I definitely think it can be done,'' Tryon said. ``I think it
has to be done if we're ever going to make serious use of space.''
      Although most contestants won't talk in detail about their
plans, Tryon said his initially involved using an F-4 military
aircraft, which was built by McDonnell Douglas and is no longer
used in the United States. He figured he could overhaul the control
panel so the plane would go faster and make the altitude.
      ``My personal opinion is that you'll never be able to get the
American public into something that looks like the Apollo,'' Tryon
said. ``I think they'd be afraid of it, and frankly I think they'd
be justified.''
      The Air Force has since rejected Tryon's request to use an F-4,
leaving Tryon back at square one.
      ``I'm not sure if I'll be able to carry on,'' he said. ``I don't
want to develop a plane from scratch.''
      Robert Zubrin, co-founder of Pioneer Rocketplane in Lakewood,
Colo., said he was putting together a team to raise capital and
build his spacecraft. Tony McPeak, former Air Force chief of staff
and a four-star general, is among those he has recruited, Zubrin
said.
      ``The same vehicle that we are developing for the X Prize
competition will be able to launch satellites at half the current
price or be able to fly passengers from New York to London in less
than one hour,'' Zubrin said.
      Teammates Gary C. Hudson, president, and Bevin McKinney, chief
executive, of HMX Inc., California, have been designing and
building launch vehicles for more than a decade. The two are
already doing some sheet metal work, according to Collette Bevis,
spokeswoman for X Prize Foundation.
      Rutan, president of Scaled Composites in Mojave, Calif., has a
formidable track record in aeronautical engineering. He created the
Voyager, which in 1986 became the first aircraft to fly around the
world on one tank of fuel.
      ``I believe that we have to have tourism, and I am tired of
waiting for someone else to do it,'' Rutan said. ``Compared to the
difficulty, danger and expense of flying in the 1920s, in relative
numbers, leaving the atmosphere is a piece of cake.''
      The announcement of the prize came on the 69th anniversary of
Charles Lindbergh's solo, nonstop flight from New York to Paris.
That flight in his Spirit of St. Louis single-engine plane took
place May 20-21, 1927.
      Lindbergh won a $25,000 prize offered by New York hotel owner
Raymond Orteig in 1919. Eight others grasped at the prize but
failed. Lindbergh was backed by eight businessmen.
      Like Lindbergh, the not-for-profit X Prize Foundation has
received support from St. Louis business leaders, who have donated
$1 million for operations of the foundation. They're working on
raising the $10 million for the prize.
      The prize's sponsor ideally would be a company, looking to
target men ge 20 to 50, but individuals also have been approached,
Diamandis said.
      ``This is not science fiction, this is real faith,'' he said.
``The fact that we have 10 teams registered so far shows that the
will, the drive and the technology is out there.''
      Diamandis predicted that someone will win the X Prize in three
to five years. ``And one to two years after that, we will have
commercial tickets available for sale,'' he said.
      Although some make fun of the X Prize, Diamandis believes he'll
have the last laugh. ``The best way to predict the future is to
create it,'' he said. ``And that's what we're trying to do.''
      For more information on the X Prize, see the foundation's web
site at www.xprize.org.

Perry was putting a little strongly perhaps, but I can understand his

On the contrary, alien abductions and prayer cureing cancer are every bit as 
Scientific as a water powered car.

Well, it seems to be done by resurrecting the last of the classical 
economists Henry George.  Toward the end of the 1800's, he wrote a book 
called _Progress and Poverty_ ( available online at 
<http://www.henrygeorge.org/pplink.htm> ) which sold 3 million copies 
and sparked off the progressive movement.  It provides subtle arguments 
against Marx and not-so-subtle arguments against Malthus.  The strict 
georgist libertarianism of the kind that Henry George advocated can be 
seen espoused at the Dan's Geolibertarian Home Page 
<http://www.geolib.pair.com> which has a page called "Greens and 
Libertarians:  The yin and yang of our political future"
<http://www.geolib.pair.com/essays/sullivan.dan/greenlibertarians.html> 
which I highly recommend.  The progressive libertarian caucus within 
the Democratic Party of the US known as the Democratic Freedom Caucus 
<http://www.progress.org/dfc> was founded by the same fellow that 
started the Maryland Chapter of the Green Party. 

But perhaps I'm putting the cart before the horse.  Let's get back to 
basics for a moment shall we.  First thing that you must understand 
when talking to Greens are the green values.  "The Original Ten Key 
Values of the Green Committees of Correspondence" with the questions 
used to clarify them can be found at <http://www.greens.org/gcofc.html> 
and Harry Reid's response to them can be found on page 
<http://www.atlantic.net/~dwatney/reid/reid01.htm> in the section 
labeled "Libertarian and Green Values."  We are infinitely compatible 
movements with similar roots and understanding this will help us both 
get that much closer to reaching our goals.

children by mixing genes from more sources than sex could have

Whether this 'asexual' reproduction matches what was being talked about

yet, but Robin's comments made me think that the mechanisms were based
on the children being genetically identical to the parent, rather than

As is technology (aside from cellular telephones, which many of them seem
to own; I've never seen such a concentration of cellphones as the time I
visited a protest camp against one of the new roads here). Frankly, many
of the Greens I've met just seem unable to operate in modern society and
hence dream of a return to some kind of agrarian wonderland. Most of them
are nice enough people but they're not very concerned with practicality,
which is why I doubt that you can get them interested in libertarian
ideas.

Easy; the public who want to 'protect' the land create a corporation which
buys it and holds it for them. This already happens in some countries
(e.g. the 'National Trust' in the UK which owns a lot of land and old
buildings). Of course the Green objection to this would be that they're 
not into materialistic goals like making money, so they wouldn't be able 
to afford to buy it.

However, some of the British Greens have used this tactic in the past to
prevent development of woodlands; they bought the land and split it into
thousands of plots which they sold off to individuals for a few pounds
each. Then when the government wanted to buy the land to build on they had
to at least try to hunt down every one of those people to buy up their
little plot of land. AFAIK it delayed them for quite a while and was
probably at least as effective as their more confrontational tactics.

Hal,

Thanks for that great bunch of libertarian Green links - just what I've
always wanted!

But that FREE URL didn't work, the correct one is:-

And where is the alternator getting its power? SOrry, you are talking

Every photon has varying degrees of vertical and horizontal
polarization. When you use a polarizing filter, all it does is filter
out the amount of polarization in a photon that is at right angles to
it. If you have a photon with 45 degress of polarization and an
amplitude of 1.414, its amplitude is reduced to 1 as it loses one or the
other leg of polarization to become oriented at either 90 degress or 0
degrees. Imagine it as a vector equation with a 1/1/2^1/2 triangle.

WIth all due respect, as a libertarian, and as someone who has spent
more time in the outdoors than 99% of the Greens out there, as someone
who takes a personal and active role in the management of wildlife, and
conservation of natural resources in this State, I must say that most of
what the Greens political groups say is complete and utter BS.

Almost every state has an organization that operates as a land trust.
THey prosthelytize with land owners to add covenants to their deeds
agreeing that so much property will be permanently barred from
development. In return, they often get much lower property tax rates
(which here in NH means big bucks). The property typically stays in the
hands of the owners, so environmentalists do not have to go around
buying property.
This is not a new thing. THis is also done with rain forests in Brazil,
Costa Rica, Chile and Peru. Kind of makes environmentalists put their
money where their mouth is.

There is also the effect of increased prices on recovery cost
effectiveness. WHenever you hear of someone saying there is only 30
years worth of oil left, they mean that there is that much in reserves
available that are cost effective enough to recover at today's market
prices. Obviously there is plenty of oil that is too expensive to
recover right now, but as demand rises and prices inflate, those other
reserves become cost effective. This is one of the little lies that
environmentalists and conservationists tell to get support, because they
imply to the less intelligent people that there is ONLY 30 years worth
of oil at ANY  price left. There is literally  a HUGE supply of oil in
the ground, enough that it will be a few thousand years before we use it
all up at a minimum.

No!  No!  Never do such a hideous, incompatible, dishonest thing like
that.  Some search engines have expressed interest in taking appropriate
countermeasures to such subversion, and I applaud them for doing so.
HTML written correctly, with keywords placed once in the header in META
tags, with headers marked properly and not obscured by Netscape tricks,
with ALT text in all the images, and correctly spelled and structured,
will be well-indexed by every present search engine, and any future
engines that base their algorithms on the design of HTML.  Wasting one's
time fooling the existing naive engines will only require you to redo
it later, and detract from the value of efforts trying to make search
engines useful.

You can't change the amplitude (color) of a photon, the energy of a photon  
in a vacuum is determined by its wavelength and nothing else.
               
If a beam of light is polarized at 0 degrees and you set your polarizer at 
X degrees then the number of photons in the beam will be reduced by  
[cos(X)]^2, for 45 degrees that is 50%. For an individual photon there is a 
50% chance it will make it through and a 50% chance it will not, if it does 
make it through the amplitude has not been changed at all, if fact nothing at
all about the photon has been changed because it has ALWAYS been polarized at 
exactly  45%. I don't claim this is a sensible way to run a universe, but it 
has been conformed experimentally, some call it "Quantum Weirdness".
               
Some atoms produce 2 photons of the same polarization but traveling in 
opposite directions, so if you measure the polarization of one you know the 
polarization of the other. A billion years before I was born somebody in the 
Virgo Cluster started making pairs of such photons that have identical but
unknown polarization. He sent one stream of photons to the earth, a billion 
light years away, he sent another stream of photons to the Coma cluster in 
the opposite direction from the earth a billion and one light years away. 
A billion years later on Earth I spin my polarizer to a random direction,  
record the position, observe if the photon made it through the detector or not 
(a 50, 50 chance) then record that too. Now I spin the polarizer again and do 
the same thing for the next photon (again a 50, 50 chance) and then for the  
next several thousand photons. I know that a year from now a friend of mine 
in the Coma Cluster will perform the exact same experiment on his stream of 
photons and I decide to visit him. I get in a space ship with my records and 
blast off for the Coma Cluster at 99% of the speed of light.
               
After 2 billion years I arrive in the Coma Cluster and compare notes with my   
friend. I notice that the direction I had my polarizer turned to and the 
direction my friend had his turned to were different, not very surprising  
since both were picked at random, but then I find something astounding,   
the square of the cosign of the angle between the 2 detectors for each photon  
is proportional to the probability that a photon will make it through my   
friend's detector.

I have instantly changed something that is 2 billion light years away and was   
made long before dinosaurs walked the earth. Pretty weird. Unfortunately this   
effect can not be used for faster than light communication because before I   
arrived with my records the results of my friends experiment looked random  
to him, it's only when he compared his results with my records, and that can  
only be done at the speed of light or less, did it become obvious that 
turning my polarizer and observing the results instantly changed his photons 
far away. Nevertheless this does have a practical benefit, you can use it to 
make a communication link that is absolutely secure, it's already been done 
and not just in the lab. Recently two banks in Switzerland used Quantum 
Cryptography to send secure financial data to each other.

Okay, this time I'm replying to the list on purpose rather than by
accident.  Kennita says:

>>>...  You're supposed to screw up your eyes, look off into space for

Kennita, you're not the only one.  Sorry, the thing about "getting it"
was a joke.  The piece itself was meant as, well, what it was: a
series of semi-related things that look like broken beginnings of jokes or
koans or dreams or short stories... all pasted together in a fast sequence
so it looks like it's a poem or song lyric, or trying to go somewhere.

> A couple of times I thought maybe I did, but when I checked, what
>I was thinking didn't make sense.

Oh!  In that case, you *did* get it!

I've just finnished a couple books by Thomas Moore: _Care of the Soul_ and
_The Re-Enchantment of Everyday Life_.  One of the things he stresses
repeatedly is that good art, like myths and dream imagery, doesn't
admit to any single interpretation.  Instead it gives your mind something
to get interested in, wonder about, vamp on, get lost in, etc.  "Tell me
if you've heard this one" was my first piece of, er, improvised writing
since reading Moore.  The things in "Tell me" that look almost sensible I
didn't think about until after I'd written them.

I think Franklin VanArdoy gets a B.  Extra points for saying it's a
schizophrenia test, but then points off for saying "You don't want to
pass it."  How mundane!  What is this world coming to!?

Hal Dunn gets a B, too, for saying it's either nonsense or code.  True,
but *then* what?  The correct response to nonsense would have been to
decode it.

Shaun Russell gives *me* a B, I think (honored if so), by saying "...it has
you thinking, doesn't it?"

Thanks, all.

Just want to point out that the 50% probability of the photon getting through
is determined by something called a "probability amplitude," which (in
this example) *is* (a complex number with an absolute value of) .707...

I mean, the (okay, well, a) wierd thing to me is how the good old electrical
ideas of amplitude and power are still there, with power being the square
of the amplitude, only now power is likely number of (or chance of) photons
and amplitude is this strange complex number that spreads out just like
an electromagnetic wave, getting diffracted and reflected and refracted
and interfering with itself...until it comes to some place where you *look*
at it, at which point (and only at that point) you have to *square* it to
get a probability.  Brr.

I mean, like, power is the square of amplitude because voltage both
pushes more electrons through a resistor and means each electron does
more work.  But what's the equivalent of current and voltage for
probability, you know what I'm sayin'?

Of course it all makes "sense" if you look at it as a wavefunction within
which (if you're so inclined) you can see a structure of branching universe
histories, from within "most" of which life seems to obey rules of physics
with some constrained chance thrown in...

Anyhow, if reality is digital, how come it keeps splitting into branches
at such an alarming rate, without getting any grainier-looking in the
process?  I mean, with an infinite supply of bits you might as well be
analog, if you know what I mean.

I agree, although I prefer art that gets you thinking about some more 
definite area. Still, it was a quite amusing trick (I didn't have the 
time to get involved in interpreting it).

Sometimes art can be quite subtle. One of my favorite "artworks" was when
Dan Wolgers made an installation for an exhibition about "The Human
Condition" a few years back: he stole two benches from the exhibition hall
and sold them.  In the ensuing uproar he got quite many swedes to argue
about the nature of art, which would never have happened otherwise. The
big question is IMHO if his theft was the artwork, or the ensuing
controversy which he had clearly anticipated. 

I wonder if one could extend this form of ideas of provoking thinking to 
other areas, such as science.

Fine, condemn me.

If this list has such a 'mechanism' then consider me un-subscribed - I am

I actually got a double A in science. This was in a country in which

I understand. Good luck to 'the best of you' in deciding what isn't.

I am currently interested in what is and what maybe. I think this

A Warhol original is something touched and manipulated by Mr. A Warhol
himself. He used to sign Cmabell's Soup tins and give them to friends so
they could own a Warhol original. A squiggle on a can of tomato soup was
worth thousands of dollars overnight..... why? .... because the High
Priests of art, the critics of the time, said that anything that Andy
touched was gold dust.

Warhol was a magician who created a currency and laughed all the way to
the bank

I would like to ask, 'what is the differnce between this artist sorcerer
and any scientist who has a particular 'theory'?'

Surely both are playing the currency game and neither represent any
objetive truth.

>  

In my own defense, I would like to emphasize the passing of the test over the
test itself.  
For anyone who has spent time in a county or state psychiatric facility under
court order or threat thereof, no explanation is necessary.  It is for those
who have not *yet* encountered this barbarism that I defend my statement.
Different states have different labels for the incarceration without trial of
persons to be held in psychiatric facilities.  In Arizona, where I worked in
such a facility, a court ordered psychiatric evaluation is called a Title 36,
which is often "upgraded" to a Chapter 36 Psychiatric Treatment.  The latter
is the equivalent of imprisonment--should the C-36 patient refuse treatment,
ie refuse to be medicated, he will be physically restrained and injected with
an assortment of psychotropic chemicals until he submits.  The former is
typical of the Catch 22s found in our legal system.  Any patient under a T-36
may refuse treatment, but his refusal is documented and presented before the
court in the C-36 hearings.  You see, a sane individual would never refuse
treatment.
We had a lawyer who was court ordered for a T-36 last summer.  He came in
speaking about covert CIA operations to which he was privy.  He also claimed
that he had a Mercedes Benz 600 with an AMG engine, specific modifications,
etc.  In the privacy of the nurse's station several of the nurses would laugh
at the gentleman when he would talk about the CIA activities abroad.  That
was until one day when an LPN documented the subject matter of her dialogue
with him and joked about the latest dilusions to come from this
schizophrenic.  Fortunately for our abused lawyer I was familiar with every
one of the incidents he had just cited, and gave additional information on
each.  Unfortunately for him I was not invited to testify at the C-36
hearings.
And I take no pleasure in admitting that I myself have been on both sides of
this punishment.
So perhaps passing a test for schizophrenia isn't so desirable after all.
By the way, after the lawyer was released, with a court order to return daily
for continued medication, he drove past me while I was pedaling back to
campus.  His Mercedes Benz 600 sped passed me in what seemed like a 0-40mph
acceleration in about 3 seconds.  ;-)

I see that you are one of the members of the population Piaget found

Tell you what. Convert your car. Show those evil government types a
thing or two, eh? Its not like they can't keep you away from all the
water you'd like to run your car.

Now go away and call back when you've done it.

Really! PLEASE!

> I am sure Da Vinci or Picasso would have both failed your little test.

Da Vinci was considered a scientific genius in his own day, and
probably would have passed any test given by his contemporaries.

Picasso was an artist, and I am not sure I would have cared to hear
his opinions on subjects like medicine or how to propel cars.

I suppose that tells you how low the standards have gotten in the
U.S., eh?

Look, go off, convert your car to run on nothing but water
(electrolysed by the current you get from the alternator), and hail a
passing UFO.

When I started this mailing list (a long, long time ago in a galaxy
far, far away) it was not supposed to be for a bunch of fuzzy-headed
UFOlogists debating whether the government was trying to keep cars
running on water away from the public. It was supposed to be an oasis
for our little clique -- unashamedly so.

I'm not embarassed by the idea of a private space for friends to
unwind, let their hair down, and happily chat away about whether it
was more likely that people would go back to the gold standard under a
free banking regime or use some other sort of backing, or to discuss
whether beta carotine is or isn't something you should be taking to
extend your life, or to exchange information on whether the state of
the art in space launch vehicles is actually progressing.

I have nothing against the existance of other sorts of people, but in
a world hostile to pleasant conversation among people with whom you
share a rationalist anarcho-cryonicist world view, it seemed nice to
have an online space of our own.

Look, FEEL SUPERIOR if you want to. I don't care how you feel. I just
don't want to have to waste my time reading about crap. Maybe you are
right -- maybe we're all idiots for not believing in the water powered
car running off of hydrogen electrolysed with the alternator -- but
frankly I'd be happier if you left us to our fate while you prayed for
the return of the aliens who will come bearing the magic water power
machines.

This is my recollection of the second bet, as recounted both in Simon's
editorial in the Wall Street Journal and some other source I forget.  It is
medium accurate.  

Simon offered to bet that *any* statistic that measured human welfare would
improve over the next ten years.  Erlich offered to bet on several
statistics, among them the carbon dioxide content of the air, and Brazilian
air pollution rates.  Simon refused to bet on CO2, saying that it was not
clear that the composition of the air was related to human welfare in any
way.  I forget how he got out of the Brazilian air pollution one. 

Frankly, I think Simon made an offer that was far too open.  As far as I can
tell, air pollution is *popular* in Brazil, because the current boom in
industry is making lots of poor people rich, and rich people richer. The
usual historical pattern is that after people have been rich for a while,
they get fed up with bad air and do something about it.  But Erlich is
almost certainly right that it will be worse in ten years than it is now.
There are lots of statistics that Erlich could have picked; he just has to
choose a small enough area, and pick a statistic that measures a problem
produced as a by-product of something that lots of people want.

Since I first joined the Extropians list I have had to be disabused of a
number of fallacious notions.  General appeals to laws-of-whatever didn't
help.  Only being taken step by step through the process of determining
that 0 did not equal 1, and being shown where the error crept into the
proof that it did, allowed me to see that the impossible actually wasn't
true.  The Monty Hall door-choosing probability problem (on which I think
some people disagree to this day) also comes to mind, and there are others
that don't.

The point is that saying that something "violates the laws of physics"
doesn't convince people -- being open to input that seems to violate the
known laws is what allows people to discover new ones.  And calling the
people names *certainly* doesn't convince them.  Look at the proof
yourself, find the erroneous step, point it out, and explain where
necessary.  Just saying "there's an error there somewhere" is either
presumptuous, naive, or lazy, depending on the attitude with which it's
said.  Most things are obvious once you understand them.

If you can't calmly convince a single intelligent and sympathetic person
of where the law of conservation of energy is violated in this instance,
how do you expect to convince (mostly less intelligent and less
sympathetic) people of things more important to you?

Every time I see misunderstanding handled in such a dismissive and
contemptuous way, I think I gain further insight into why Extropianism
(with its cousin Libertarianism) hasn't taken the world by storm.

For people who wonder what the foofaraw is all about, and how people get
such ideas, check out:
http://www.real.net.au/music/Bands/insurge/politics/energy/energy_essay.html
and for something somewhat more likely to work (?), try:
http://www.virtualpet.com/rbbi/folders/fuel/a-21.htm
I just told AltaVista to find "car NEAR water NEAR fuel NEAR hydrogen" for
the first one, and "car NEAR water NEAR power" for the second.  Not very
good queries, but I came up with them in under a minute.

The world would probably be improved by a Web page debunking some of the
claims in the first one, without reference to name-calling.  I'd write
one myself, except that I don't know my physics well enough to explain
the matter clearly.

We don't know that life like us isn't terribly unlikely.  What we
observe is that, conditional on observing anything at all, we observe
an empty and old universe.  The fermi paradox is the the conflict
between our observation of an empty universe and expectations that we
should see it full of life.

There are two recent trends, both of which favor asexual reproduction:

1) Until recently, organisms have had very little occasion to make
long-term investments other than children.  So the investment benefit
of asexual reproduction has been moot.  But now humans do have to
choose between "consuming" their own ability to have more children
now, and investing toward their children's ability to have more
children later.

2) Until recently, orgnisms have had very little effective means to
communicated information about how to build better organims, other than
via sexual reproduction.  Now humans can exchange culture and memes,
and and uploads & A.I.s may be able to buy and sell new designs for
their componenets and new knowledge on a truely vast scale.  Sexual
reproduction won't be needed to exchange this information.

But the probability of the photon making it through a second polarizer set 
the same way as the first is 100%, the probability of it making it through a 
second polarizer set 90 degrees from the first is 0%. The same thing is true 
of a correlated photon and it doesn't matter how far away it is from me or 
even if the two photons were made long before I was born, somehow the photon
"knew" its mate would someday interact with my polarizer and it "knew" what 
direction I would set it to. I'm not saying this makes any sense, but it has 
been confirmed experimentally.

That is indeed a very important question because the reference point actually  
determine some of the physical properties of the photon, the really weird 
part is that you get to decide what reference point to use yourself, even for 
photons made 10 billion years ago. A photon is heading toward you that you 
wish to measure. Pick a direction at random, any direction at all, and give 
it a name, "horizontal" sounds nice, draw a line perpendicular to it and give 
it a name too, I like  "vertical". Turn your polarizer to the horizontal 
position. If the photon makes it through the polarizer (and there is a 50% 
chance that it will) then the photon is polarized 100% in the horizontal
position and always has been, even if it started it's journey from a distant 
galaxy to your detector ten billion years before you decided in what 
direction to turn it. If the photon doesn't make it through the detector then 
the photon was always in the vertical position. The same ridiculous situation 
is true for the correlated photon, even though it never came anywhere near 
your polarizer. Pretty weird.

The currency Warhol traded in was exactly the same as all others, and
very real: human desire.  The theories created by science or economics or
any other philosophy are every bit as quantifiable and testable as Mr.
Warhol's bank account.

Anyone who believes there is no objective truth I sentence to standing

Since its all relative anyways, you can pick your own plane of
reference. However, being currently earthbound, with an atmosphere which
has a natural inclination to polarize sunlight vertically, more or less,
depending on weather, the first discoverers of polarization were also
earthbound and therefore horizontal and vertical are in reference to the
observers position on the earth.

Mike, I think your gesture of rebellion or defiance here is misplaced. 

You are of course free to believe what you like, but whether you like it
or not, your belief bears a certain relation to reality, to the way
fings really is (as opposed to the way you or I think they are); and the
scientific consensus would say that the belief in that kind of car is
just fruitless - it isn't possible, it couldn't be made.  

Now that's just an opinion too, of course, but if you were to question
it, you would find lots of quite convincing arguments based on demonstrations
you could verify with your own senses, and would have to accept if you
accepted the validity of your senses as giving a good image of reality
most of the time, in normal conditions.

An abstraction just occurred to me related to the above:- that the
supply is virtually infinite because matter could, at the extremest limit,
be transformed (recycled?) into oil, if we really wanted it, and had the
technology.

Well put, Kennita.  I would just say, to balance it back the other way
just slightly from where you leave it, that this is a list in which *
critical thinking* is important.  I think Mike offered the car thing in a
spirit of critical (political) thinking, and while that's great, and
while I think his critics were a bit rude in a human sort of way, still,
he's got to take the criticism seriously if he wants to participate in
that critical spirit.  (The thing is, I'm sure his critics would have
some sympathy with his political point in itself, to some extent -
perhaps that might be a more interesting topic?)

Here's a concept: If you send out a message, repeating itself so anyone
can tune in at any time to get the gist, that basically tells them to
focus their polarizers on this source, and a set pattern of H and V
alternations with a polarizer, can't you use that to set up a carrier
wave with which you can communicate by putting signals on top of the
carrier wave? if you know what the normal pattern is ahead of time,
shouldn't you be able to use induced abberations in the pattern as a
signal?

In the one case, the 'cognoscenti' collude with Warhol, and the value
could be totally a human creation (although some of the cognoscenti
might claim to see something objectively valuable, some 'statement'
perhaps, in Warhol's magic trick); in the other case, nature 'colludes
with the scientists - or rather, it either colludes or it doesn't.

Having just checked many of the usual sites I use for good debunking
info, I must admit that there is very little on the old water-power
scam.  I had assumed that such info would be plentiful; such good
resources like the Skeptic's Dictionary, urbanlegends.com, and others
have lots of good rational analyses of such claims, but this specific
one is under-documented, so I suppose I do bear some culpability for
assuming that our proponent had more resources than he actually did.
I'm sure a more thorough search might turn up something better, but
I doubt our particular reporter would have been swayed by calmer heads
anyway, as his credulity seemed unswayed by any of the replies, and I
didn't think a suggestion to read the whole set of Feynmann Lectures
on Physics would be very welcome, although that's really all there is
to say.

Actually I find the political claim--the idea that some unnamed agency
of government might be capable of supressing a spectacularly valuable
invention, that it would be in their interest to do so, and that the
effect on the economy would be anything but positive--even more ludicrous
that the pseudo-scientific claims, and strong evidence that the author
is not merely a harmless crackpot but trying to perpetrate a deliberate
fraud upon his readers for some purpose I can only speculate.  And while
I might have some sympathy for innocent dupes, I have none for criminals.

If we skip details about *how* genes (that is, the information that
is used to produce an offspring) get from here to there, the distinction
between asexual and sexual reproduction boils down to *where* the
information comes from.  Does it all descend from the information that
originally went into the parent, with no other input, *or does it come
from more than one source*?  If the latter, that's sex in my book.

Robin, you are clearly using a different definition of "sexual
reproduction" since you are talking about different ways of
exchanging information (the essence of sex as I see it)--what is your
distinction and why is it interesting?  Are you only talking about
*current* methods of mixing information vs... *all the possible other
ways*?  To me, most of the possible ways of mixing information
are even *more* sexual than the current two-parent, crossover-only
methods.  Why do you use the term "asexual" for these more-sexy methods?

One way of making the distinction (motivated by your question of how
people's behavior and repro strategies might change) would be: does
the contribution of the other parent come as a package deal?  Even
if genes become nanite subroutines sent over the internet, package-deals
would still be possible.  (N mutually suspecting parties can agree to
put their separate contributions into a box where
some agreed-on process determines the combination.)  Maybe package
deals would have a long-term advantage over finer-grain choosability...

I think this just means, reproduce now (with current methods) vs.
invest, then reproduce more wisely later?  The sexual/asexual question
seems independent here, even with your definition.  For instance, I
could become rich and marry a carefully selected mate who was
capable of bearing large litters, and fund the raising of all these
kids.

You seem to be saying, the *old way* of exchanging info is limited,
and there will be more interesting ways.  Yes, you're right!

But still it's sexual reproduction, in the sense that all the things
we know about sexual reproduction (and the comparison with asexual
reproduction) still apply, right?  I mean, for instance, observations
about selfish genes, or dynamics where two synergistic genes build up
slowly in a gene pool, then suddenly take over when they reach a threshold
of popularity, etc.  Phenomena that biologists think of as applying
only to species that have sex.

The reason I ask is that I could imagine things that would really
deserve the term asexual--hermits going off and purposely isolating
themselves from contamination by others' ideas--that might be
interesting to compare with idea-mixing reproduction, although I
still guess this asexual route in this sense would be a minor niche
if viable at all.

`And always has been', as I understand it, is the *common-sense error* in
interpreting QT.  Actually the state is not fixed *until* the interaction,
which is what makes non-local connections weird.  A different relativistic
reference frame can show that your distant pal was the one who `first' set
the polariser, entraining the result you see here and now.  Without
simultaneity, traditional causality vanishes.  Strange world.

I'd like to clear up the following:

a) Mike Rose, me, did not post the original 'water-car' mail
2) he dosn't believe the car works
c) nor does he believe is doen't/couldn't
iv) he was just interested in the fact that some guy had managed to get
   his 'theory' published, and that the guy must be lying if his opponents
   are correct. The article seemed to say that he rides this car 
   regularly.


I just wanted to know if it was an outright lie, the product of delusion
or something some people may have missed. Seeing as none of the opponents
seemed to have read the offending article I am still uncomfortable with
picking any one of the above.

Thanks....

Okay, but what about the scientists who find what they are looking for in
nature? The ones who seem to actually 'create' the phenomenon?

We are PART of nature, we grew out of it, we weren't placed here as
objective observers by God. We grew out of that which we observe and we
cannot separate the observer from the observed (except in thought and
language).

Proof of LSD causing chromozome damage has been both 'proved' and
'disproved' by teams of researchers for and against the theraputic use of
LSD.

Also, light can be seen as particles or waves, depending on the observors
assumptions, techniques, biases etc. etc.

So which is the TRUE NATURE of light? Or is it true that there is no
nature aside from the observed (and therefore created)?

To paraphrase Heisenberg et al, to observe and study nature we need to
isolate it, but to observe it we need to have interaction. The last link
in the chain of observation will always be a human nervous system, which
is not only full of quantum uncertainty but is also result forming in
itself.


just a few thoughts... I dunno.

That's the Copenhagen interpretation, it's pretty much consistent with 
observation but certainly not the only interpretation that is. In the 30's 
and 40's it was the only game in town, it has lost a lot of steam since then 
but it's still a leading contender. When the change happened is debatable, 
but In any interpretation something I did changed a photon 10 billion light 
years away and whatever transferred this change contained neither energy nor 
information and must have moved faster than light.

True. What Einstein tells us is that event A could happen before event B in 
one frame of reference and event B could happen before event A in another 
frame  of reference and both viewpoints are equally valid. He also tells us 
that the space-time distance between any two events is exactly the same in 
any frame of reference. In my example I used the viewpoint that my experiment 
changed my friend's experiment 2 billion light years away, and it was a 
perfectly valid viewpoint. Equally valid would be the idea that my friend's 
experiment changed my experiment 2 billion light years away.

Well, what about FDA shenanigans?  As a libertarian, surely you think
there's something a bit fishy going on there?  It's not too much to
extend one's paranoia a bit more, is it?

This is not the National Inquirer, it is the Extropy List, but there does
seem to be an inquistion by some self-dubbed high priests of
knowledge/reality.

(reminds me of Robert Anton Wilson's 'New Inquisition'. W. Reich
would have been given hell by some of you guys, keep up the good work
people like him shouldn't be given a voice!!!!!)

Keep the thumbscrews on the truth

Of course--criminals are criminals whether in or out of government.
How does that relate to our discussion?  I don't see any connection.
If by 'paranoia' you mean 'distrust of government', then that's fine
with me.  I never expressed any trust in them, I merely find it
absurd to grant them the competence and power to do what it was
suggested they are doing.  I wholly grant that they are capable of
sinister motives--in fact I assume it.

But I don't let my speculation about people's motives cloud my
judgment of facts.  I don't take sides, I hold principles.

Here we go name-calling again.

This calls to mind a corollary to Murphy's Laws that I read long ago,
called something like Wilkinson's Razor:  "Never attribute to malice
what is adequately explained by stupidity." (substitute "ignorance" if
you like).  My own personal law goes like this:  "Whenever you think
'Nobody could be that stupid!', you're wrong.".  I just thought of it;
if you quote it, please to refer to it as "Watson's Law".  Perhaps I was
inspired by watching an episode of "The World's Dumbest Criminals".  If
you find that somebody's claimed it already, let me know and I'll credit
them from now on.

That aside, I'm not saying that the original claimant was stupid, though
I think he's sorely mistaken, likely having missed some fallacy in the
argument presented to him -- I use my laws mainly to remind me that
there's no percentage in thinking that people do bad things on purpose.
As Worf once said on ST:TNG, "A siege mentality is ultimately self-
defeating." (my favorite quote of his, after perhaps "They roar -- and
hurl heavy objects." -- but I digress).

No sense beating on hundreds for believing in water-powered cars when
there are still billions who believe in God.

Nerds on their little nets agree... :-)

The problem is that in many fields it is extremely easy to influence an
experiment with one's preconceptions, and even easier to interpret the
results in the way that fits them (psychology is a wonderful example). 
Especially if you have a firm emotional belief about the subject (imagine
that you are a scientist looking at the dangers of a illegal drug or a
scientist looking at the possible side-effects of a vitamin - guess which
scientist is most likely to find chromosome damage?). This is one reason
scientific methodology has to be so strict and conservative: to weed out
observer biases in the long run and retain the facts that remain true
regardless of who sees them.

Well, in many cases it is convenient and in some cases it is quite 
reasonable. Ideally, you should be keenly aware of how you as an observer 
influence things and take them into account (if possible), but it doesn't 
mean the observer is always significant for the experiment.

No, your assumptions won't change light: a photoelectric experiment won't
cease to work just because you don't believe in photons, just as a
two-slit experiment won't work when die hard particle-believers are
present. Both reveal objective facts about reality which shows that both
groups obviously are wrong (the truth is of course simple: light isn't
particles or waves, it is something else that can behave like both).

for his trouble.

This is an excellent example of why I almost never use sarcasm.  I've
virtually never seen it work as well as honesty, especially on people who
are already pissed off.  In cases such as this one, either ignoring the
emotional outburst, or posting (or better yet emailing privately) a message
such as "Please don't spam the readers for the sins of the writers.", or
even posting to the list a genuine expression of frustration that people
make such outbursts in public, would likely have been preferable.

There is little or nothing to be gained by venting frustration or annoyance
with such barbs (people have been shot for even less; fortunately that's
unlikely here).  I'm not sure there's much to be gained from my posting
this message, either, but I feel like I have to try because I'd rather
live in a world where people didn't resort to such heavyhanded (in the
one case) or backhanded (in the other) rhetorical devices.  I can only
hope that because I wrote this, one or more people will think twice, go
get a drink of water or whatever, and decide to make a more constructive
post than they otherwise would the next time they are provoked or upset.

Now off to go do what people pay me for, which somehow doesn't seem as
important as this....

I recall a short Science News story from the late 80s where some 
researcher discovered that use of cannabinoids (in rats or humans?) 
created a supplementary network of neural connections in the brain. 
 The biased researcher, of course, immediately called this "brain 
damage".

But what a difference that exception makes!

You might find the following quote on this issue of interest:
<An epistemology is a theory or practice that establishes the 
conditions that make knowledge possible. There are many 
epistemologies. Religious mystics, and even some physicists [55], 
believe that higher knowledge is achieved by a state of ineffable 
oneness with a transcendent reality. Mystics do not make epistemic 
cuts. While this may work for the individual, it does not work for 
populations that require heritable information or common knowledge 
that must be communicable [5]. Knowledge is potentially useful 
information about something. Information is commonly represented by 
symbols. Symbols stand for or are about what is represented. Knowledge 
may be about what we call reality, or it may be about other knowledge. 
It is the implementation of "standing for" and "about" - the process 
of executing the epistemic cut - that artificial life needs to 
explore.

Heritable, communicable, or objective knowledge requires an epistemic 
cut to distinguish the knowledge from what the knowledge is about. By 
useful information or knowledge I mean information in the evolutionary 
sense of information for construction and control, measured or 
selected information, or information ultimately necessary for 
survival. This is contrasted with ungrounded, unmeasured, unselected, 
hence, purely formal or syntactic information. My usage does not 
necessarily imply higher-level cognitive concepts like understanding 
and explanation, neither does it exclude them.>

The above is from Howard Pattee's essay "Artificial life needs a real 
epistemology" at

I'm prepared to be wrong. I've been wrong many times in the past and
expect to be wrong many times in the future.

On the other hand, one has to maintain a certain minimum standard of
mental hygene in order to get through your average day. If you don't
maintain a firm and critical understanding of the likely effect of
walking in front of a bus, or handing over your money to a con man,
you won't get very far.

Given this, a balance has to be struck between spending one's days
assessing every claim one hears with full attention, and ignoring all
claims.

The way most of us have done this is to assess the strength of given
laws of science we've learned over the years, especially based on how
often and how well they have been demonstrated, and to give less
credence to unusual claims that violate strongly demonstrated laws,
and more credence to those that do not violate any laws or only
violate those that have "problems" with them anyway. The more
extraordinary the claim, the better the evidence had better be.

Thus, I'm not going to waste much time on people claiming that they've
built a "water powered car" that works by perpetual motion
mechanisms. Why? Because it violates too many strongly held laws. I'm
happy to believe in it if someone will drive it up to me and let me
take some time actually examining it and I find it works, or if
someone who I strongly trust has done so. Otherwise, I've got too many
things to do in my day, and too many idiots come up with this sort of
extraordinary claim too often without any evidence backing them at
all.

The probability of it being real is microscopic, especially if its
"easy" to build, so the likely benefit to me of believing in its
reality if its real (measured in dollars) times the probability of of
it being real is a tiny fraction of the money I've already lost
thinking about it. Even spending the time I've spent thinking about
this silly water powered car has likely been far too much thus far, on
a cost/benefit analysis.

I think the example of the charge of LSD causing choromosomal damage is
really much more an example that people will believe what they want no
matter what reason, logic or good scientific proceedures suggest - rather
than that truth is in some way relative. I hope people forgive the long
quote. I think its remarkable how long this meme - LSD causes chromosome
damage - has lasted given that it was basically caused by two bad papers
published in the late 60s and disproved comprehensively also in the late
60s.

>From the "Psychedelics Encyclopedia" by Peter Stafford (1983, pp 60-61):

"In 1967, Dr. Maimon Cohen, a geneticist from Buffalo, NY, made an
announcement that significantly prejudiced the public's view of LSD.
Returning from a visit to the Haight-Ashbury area, Cohen decided to examine
chromosomes from a 57 year old man who had been given LSD on four occasions
during a 15 year hospitalization. The patient was found to have more
chromosomal breaks than usual. Dr. Cohen also spilled LSD into a test tube
containging human cells and observed damage to the chromosomes. Later it
was pointed out that similar results cold be achived with the same amount
of milk and that Cohen's patient had recieved regular treatments of Librium
and Thorazine, now proven chromosome-breakers. Nonetheless, on the basis of
his examination of the single patient and his cell-spilling experiment,
Cohen published his conclusions in Science. By evening the charge that LSD
could break chromosomes was in all the nation's media.

Shortly thereafter, two doctors in Portland, Oregon reported that they had
found an excess of choromosomal breaks in users of street acid. The chart
they provided revealed that extra breakage occured only among users of acid
who were also users of amphetamine, which as since been established a
chromosome-breaker. Once again the papers had a field day. A full-page ad
for a McCall's article on LSD featured a baby broken into parts. Ironically
the article itself cast doubts on the charge of chromosomal damage.

Retractions on mistaken opinions and findings about the use and effects of
LSD are quiet and very rare, and so it was in regard to the chromosome
charge. Even though studies conducted by the National Institute of Mental
Health and others disproved the allegation, even though Timothy Leary's
chromosomes were examined and showed no abnormal breakage, even though
other drugs have now clearly been established to be choromosome-breakers
while LSD has not, the media took little if any notice of the new
evidence."

Yes, your definition of "sexual" is vastly more liberal than mine.
My use of the term comes from precise mathematical models of evolution
of genes, while your use seems more metaphorical.   The interest in
these precise models comes, as usual, from the fact that one can work
out concrete conclusions from them.

Let me suggest that it is useful to distinguish the evolution of
values from the evolution of "facts", or beliefs about facts.  The
space of possible basic values is much smaller than the space of
possible fact beliefs; so I think it is plausible to think in terms of
an evolutionary equilibrium of values even when fact discovery is
still going strong.  I started this discussion citing papers on basic
value evolution, and my conclusions are mainly regarding that: asexual
reproduction of values has strong advantages when investment matters.

Reproduction/dissemination/etc. of facts/beliefs is another matter.
Here I agree that organisms will not want to limit themselves to
beliefs inherited from a single parent, and while inheriting beliefs
from two parents is better, humans and their descendants can do much
better than this.  Here I find it more valuable to look at genetic
selection of general policies for evaluating and sharing beliefs.

Yes you could, but the question is whether you would.  Sexual vs.
asexual models have differing implications regarding selection of such
investment policies.

Yes, he claims that it works, drives the car regularly, even showed it to the

There are lots of urban legends out there about great inventions that have
been suppressed by The Powers That Be.  In these stories, They seem to use
threats, media blackouts, and murders that look like accidents.  I am
willing to believe that all such stories are bunk.  However, there is
another way to suppress an invention: licence the patent, and then don't
manufacture it.  This is entirely legal, though people don't tend to talk
about it, as it is anti-social. Does anyone know of a time when this has
definitely happened?

Let me tell a story of a time when this *might* have happened.  A friend of
mine came up with an idea for an easily manufactured consumer gizmo that
would distribute many millions of dollars a year in revenue away from the
big long distance companies, particularly AT&T.  My wife and I hoped to
capture some of these millions, so we looked into patenting it.  Alas, a
patent search revealed that exactly the device in question had been patented
in 1993:  

http://patent.womplex.ibm.com/details?patent_number=5425085

The company that got the patent is a small phone-equipment manufacturing
firm that would be perfectly placed to build the device and make a ton of
money.  But it's four years later and they haven't.  Why not? 

I will now speculate recklessly.  

I estimate the device could be sold for $80 with a manufacturer's profit of
$10. The average customer that buys this gizmo will save $300 per year on
phone bills, which will cost AT&T about $70 per year.  It is worth it for
AT&T to pay the inventor any amount between $10 and $70 per unit to make
this gizmo not be sold.  If I had the patent, I'd probably take them up on
it.  Millions of dollars, for not working.

Has this actually happened?  I don't know.  But it could.

There was an front-page article in the Wall Street Journal, either 
this month or last, about a man who has made millions doing just what 
you describe.  It discussed many of his tricks, such as scouring 
scientific journals for info and then patenting something vague or 
general related to a technology that looks promising.  Precisely 
because his patents are so vague, they lurk, semi-approved, in the 
system for years.  Of course, he never bothers develop the invention, 
but waits until some other company does and then his lawyers pounce 
with claims of patent infringement.  As I said, he has gotten quite

650m children live on less than $1 a day

Friday, 18 April 1997: Over 650 million children
currently exist on less than $1 a day, according
to UNICEF.

"Contrary to what the world might expect, the poor
are getting poorer, the number of poor is
increasing, and the disparity between rich and
poor has never been greater," said UNICEF
Executive Director Carol Bellamy.

According to statistics released by the World Bank
in World Development Indicators 1997, more than
1.3 billion people currently live on less than $1
a day, and a further 2 billion are only marginally
better off. UNICEF believes that children account
for at least 50 per cent of the total number of
poor people.

"These figures provide further distressing
confirmation that the scourge of poverty is not in
retreat. More children are living in poverty today
than ever before, " said Ms. Bellamy.

UNICEF argues that the past 50 years have seen an
increase in the number of poor in the world. This
is notwithstanding numerous initiatives -- such as
structural adjustment, support for private
investment and efforts at debt reduction -- all of
which have been designed to increase economic
growth.

Between 1988 and 1993, the number of people living
below the poverty line of $1 a day increased by at
least 20 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa and in
Latin America. The numbers also increased in South
Asia and in the Middle East and North Africa.

Levels of income disparity between the richest and
poorest 20 per cent of the world population have
increased from 30:1 to 61:1 over the past 30
years, and Ms. Bellamy argued that inequity in the
distribution of wealth and resources explains the
rising number of the poor.

UNICEF has documented many instances where
impressive progress in the well-being of children
has been achieved without economic growth, through
the investment of limited resources in basic
services, such as health and education. Zimbabwe
increased primary school enrolment from 1.2
million to 2.1 million pupils and expanded its
immunization coverage from 32 per cent to 75 per
cent during the 1980s at a time of stagnating
average per capita income. In India, the state of
Kerala reduced its infant mortality rate from 55
to 17 per 1,000 live births between 1976 and 1992,
despite very slow economic growth.

In contrast, significant but inequitable economic
growth in other countries has led to actual
increases in the level of real and relative
poverty. For example, Botswana recorded very rapid
economic growth of 10 per cent per year in the
1980s, but the number of poor in the country did
not decline. Brazil and Honduras saw an increase
in both the number and proportion of poor people
during the 1980s, despite a reasonable rate of
economic growth.

"The eradication of poverty must be at the centre
of our development efforts into the 21st century.
For as long as poverty is allowed to grow
unchecked, child malnutrition, preventable disease
and widespread illiteracy will continue to
thrive," said Ms. Bellamy.

Eastern Europe reform leaves children behind

Monday, 21 April 1997: Social reform in Central
and Eastern Europe, the Commonwealth of
Independent States and the Baltic States has been
piecemeal and uncertain in its aims, strategies
and funding, says a UNICEF report issued today,
which adds that economic reform planners have
overlooked the welfare needs of millions of
vulnerable children.

Launching the report entitled Children at risk in
Central and Eastern Europe: Perils and promises,
in Bonn today, John Donohue, Director of the
UNICEF Regional Office for Central and Eastern
Europe, Commonwealth of Independent States and
Baltic States, points in particular to the fate of
the one million children in public care, trapped
in the gulf between economic progress and social
impoverishment.

"At the beginning of the transition to market
economies," Mr. Donohue said, "hopes ran high that
the sub-human conditions prevailing in some
children's homes would soon disappear. But
numerous difficulties have stood in the way of
major improvements in institutional care or a
shift to more humane options for children without
parental care. Even more worrying, there has been
little change in attitudes and too many children
are still being abandoned to state care. In some
countries, like Moldova, Georgia and Armenia, the
public child protection system has virtually
collapsed. In most of the countries in transition
-- not only in Romania, which has received most
publicity -- the rates of children in public care
have increased."

This increase, beyond being a serious problem in
its own right, is also an indicator of the higher
risks many children have been facing during the
transition years. Many families have had to cope
with a devastating deterioration in their material
conditions. Skills, social values and coping
strategies developed in earlier decades have
proved vastly inadequate. Poverty and social
dislocation have put enormous burdens on families
who often have limited capacity or experience in
taking responsibility for their children's
welfare, traditionally the task of state
authorities. Since child monitoring and checking
mechanisms, including those normally to be
expected in school and health systems, have been
eroded and are in need of reform, children are
suffering.

The answer, the report says, lies in political
will to put the needs of children high on the
reform agenda. New and humane social welfare
networks would benefit all children in Central and
Eastern Europe. Fears that only the poor,
marginalised and excluded would be helped are
misplaced.

The publication, covering 18 countries in the
region, is the fourth in a series of monitoring
reports that have grown in coverage and impact.
Since the first report was released in November
1993 covering nine countries of the region, the
scope of the research has expanded to take in 18
countries: Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus,
Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia,
Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Slovakia,
Slovenia, Poland, Romania, Russia and the Ukraine.
The reports are prepared by the UNICEF-funded
International Child Development Centre in
Florence, Italy, and are intended as a "tool to
alert public opinion and public authorities to the
problems of children and other vulnerable groups
in transitional economies, and to forge
international cooperation to improve the situation
for children in these countries."

The latest report chronicles the substantial
income drops families have experienced, rampant
unemployment and family benefit losses in many
Central and Eastern European states and, in
countries of the former Soviet Union,
sky-rocketing wage inequality. It analyses the
welfare impact of increasing trends in
single-parent households, falling birth rates and
growing divorce rates. Additionally, it documents
children's exposure to conflict and displacement
in the region, and the hardships that result.

Poor nutrition, alcoholism, smoking, stress in the
workplace and at home, increasing violence and
premature death are also taking their toll. In the
former Soviet Union especially, there has been an
unprecedented increase in the deaths of
working-age men. Across the region as a whole,
hundreds of thousands of children have experienced
the premature death of parents (mostly fathers but
also mothers) in their prime child-rearing ages.
The most obvious risk children face from these
traumas is orphanhood. The report estimates the
increase in the number of children and teenagers
who have lost a parent over 1990-1995 at about
700,000, three-quarters of them in Russia.

However, the underlying potential risks are
multi-dimensional and go well beyond the numbers
of premature parental deaths. The pressures of the
transition appear to be splitting families apart
and eroding parental responsibility. In addition
to higher divorce rates, fewer divorced fathers
provide regular support to their family now; the
number of criminal cases for non-payment of
alimony, for example, is rising in several
countries.

Health and education risks have also increased.
Today parents can no longer count on universal
public health and education systems nor on the
same levels of efficiency in these systems to
screen and check for risks their children are
facing. Parents are having to take greater
responsibility for the development of their
children at a time when they are less able to do
so and when child health and education needs are
rising.

Former full enrolment in primary schools has
ceased to exist and the growing use of fees means
that it is children form poorer households who
face problems of access to pre-primary education,
extracurricular activities and remedial help. In
Russia, for example, some 5 per cent of primary
school students -- about 100,000 in each grade --
appear to be out of school. In Romania, secondary
school enrolment rates were down 14 per cent in
1995.

Deprived of society-level protection mechanisms,
children and adolescents in particular are falling
prey to drug abuse, alcohol and tobacco addiction,
violence, child prostitution, sexually transmitted
diseases including HIV/AIDS, and crime. A rapid
assessment survey of drug abuse in the Czech
Republic completed in 1996 found that drug abuse
is no longer only a problem of homeless and street
children, but is gradually becoming "normal" in
secondary schools. Among students surveyed, 14 per
cent were regular drug users and 37 per cent
reported having tried drugs at least once. Teenage
suicide is also on the increase in many countries
of the region, including all Central European
countries (except Hungary), the Baltic and many
countries of the CIS.

Finally there are also indications of increasing
child morbidity rates. The transition has seen a
marked growth in the incidence of infectious
diseases such as diphtheria and tuberculosis,
particularly in countries of the CIS. The
reappearance of these "diseases of poverty" is
especially troubling, as they had been nearly
eradicated.

"In short," Mr. Donohue warns, summing up the
conclusions of the report, "it may prove much more
difficult to address adequately the risk
situations than was anticipated at the close of
the 1980s.

"Traditional family support systems offering cash
benefits and in-kind services in many cases do not
reach the needy or provide appropriate help. There
is an acute need in the whole region to encourage
and bolster the development of a full new
infrastructure of family support, focusing on
providing a flexible range of community-based
social services for parents and children in need.
These could be provided by local and national
governments as well as, with public encouragement,
the voluntary and private sector. Health,
education and social welfare agencies need to work
together to provide such services. All the
governments of this region have signed the
Convention on the Rights of the Child. It is time
to turn the promises of the Convention into
reality and put the needs of children first."

The US tried to do this with the RSA cryptosystem, which was at one time
patented by Public Key Partners, who made no software and issued no
licenses.  That effort failed, but they are still trying to supress it
with ITAR, preventing export.  That too will fail, miserably, despite
support from Congress and the White House, because international
competition won't allow us the luxury of not using something as important
economically as public key encryption.  They'll try their damnedest, and
may keep it down for a short time, but eventually they will fail.  You
just can't stop the momentum of economically important discoveries.

Welcome to the wonderful world of Science, it's not nice, it's not polite,  
nothing is more fulfilling to a Scientist than smashing somebody else's 
theory into a quivering bloody heap begging for mercy. Take no prisoners is 
the rallying cry, look for the slightest logical flaw, the smallest possible 
crack, then use it to pry open the entire theory and expose the disgusting 
stupidity inside for all the world to see. And that is EXACTLY what they 
should do because nearly all theories are wrong. The few ideas that survive 
this brutal process are possibly true and certainly tough as nails, they have 
to be. Historically one of the very toughest of these is the law of 
conservation of energy, it has withstood fierce attacks by brilliant minds 
and come out without a scratch. If it were untrue we'd need to throw all the 
Physics books written in the last 300 years in the garbage, if the evidence 
was strong enough I'd be willing to do just that and start from square one, 
but it would take one hell of a lot more that some Bozo saying "Trust me. 
Why would I lie?"

Perpetual motion machines are a dime a dozen, crackpots have been making them 
for thousands of years, life is short and I see no reason to spend any more 
time studying this one than the millions of other such designs.

Once corporations were illegitimately recognized as individuals (a form of
group rights thoroughly destructive to individual rights), the primary
usage and utility of patents changed radically.

In "The Evolution of Technology" (1988) by George Basalla, it is explained:
 "Once the corporation gained control of patents, the monopoly was used to
suppress any inventions that might harm its own products or enhance those
of a rival....  Researching new frontiers of technological knowledge might
be far less productive than, in the words of a Bell president, occupying a
technical field with 'a thousand and one little patents and inventions.' 
The prevention of competition was just one of the new uses Bell, and
others, found for patents.  Patents also could be acquired to frustrate a
competitor's attempt to secure a strong patent position through its own
research efforts.  Finally, patents are often used to provide a strong
bargaining chip that, at the right moment, can be traded to a rival for
other patents or concessions.  Patents obtained for defensive purposes
often remain undeveloped.  Instead of serving as a source of innovation,
research becomes part of a business maneuver aimed at preserving the status
quo, or at least assuring that novelties will emerge at a slowed rate."

The international cartel of corporate commercialists maintains monopolistic
patent practices; in the absence of this cartel, patents might not be
useful at all considering the accelerating product cycle times we are
experiencing.

Were I in such a fortunate position, I would not accept the first offer.
Even presuming that ATT makes their best offer first ( which from a game
theory perspective is probably unlikely ), some other big company might
beat it. So it would be to my advantage to go public and solicit offers.

Also, why are we being so generous selling a device for $80 that saves
the buyer $300 per year?  Does it only last for three months?  It seems
if it has a mean lifespan of several years minimum like most appliances,
the minimum selling price should be upwards of $500.

I suspect that it hasn't happened.

This is an asymmetrical comparison because you use the word "basic"
on only one side. I doubt that the space of possible basic values
is much smaller than the space of possible general epistemic
principles (reasons for choosing to treat a piece of information in your
head as if it were factual). I also doubt that the space of possible
specific valuations in concrete situations is much smaller than the
space of possible beliefs.

You can't value or disvalue what you can neither perceive nor think
about, and the pace of fact discovery is increasing the number of things
that we can perceive and think about. This is particularly the case in
neuropsychology, economics, and human ethology. I wish that the current
human cultural situation represented an evolutionary equilibrium of 
values (it would make me feel much safer), but this is such a complex
question that I am cautious about prematurely closing it.

New knowledge may have no logical effect on values, but I'm quite sure
it has a psychological effect on values. And rates of knowledge change
have been geographically lumpy over the last few hundred years. This
argues against the idea that current human values are in equilibrium.

Actually, we do have the technology.  Synthetic motor oil for example.  But
that is not the problem.  You have to get energy from somewhere to make the

        A week or so ago I was having a discussion with my physics teacher
about  creating geological capacitors for storing lightning as a cheap power
source.  A trivial and fun conversation, but near its end he started talking
about how some revisionist  tech-hostorians believe that ancient monoliths
like the pyramids and ancient mexican monuments were in essence the
capacitors we were talking about.  A few simple tricks of electricity would
give a great deal of power to the theocracy that ordered the building of
these monuments. For example if an egyptian priest were able to fry a
heritic to a cinder using the restrained power of ligntning or even simply
make lightning dance from his fingers or his hair stand up on end while in a
religious trance then this might create a certain deification of priests
even though they could be killed easily by common men and mobs.  
        However, when writing a paper recently I was struck by a quirk of
the practice of cryonics, that the ancients may have already tried it.
Ancients were placed in waiting chambers (tombs as we like to call them)
after having their bodily fluids drained and then stored.  Kind of like full
body cryo-preservation with out the cryo bit, which is a little hard to come
up with in the middle of the desert.  But they did know that the hot dry air
helped prevent decay so they built their preservation centers inthe desert
and filled them with all the prized objects and even preserved the loved
ones along side the important officals (it wans't just for pharohs) as if
they might someday be revived and have a need for gold and companionship
when their medical sciences, they had them to be sure could help the expired
pharoh or general or administrator.
                
                                Another fun trivial fun line of though like
the pyramid-capacitors but it is interesting and I am wondering what
everybody thinks on the subject.

Yes, the better distinction is between small spaces, which include
both basic values and general epistemic principles, and large spaces,
such as lots of little new facts.  For evolution in small spaces, the
information sharing function of sex is less important.  So I should
restate my claim as that evolutionary pressure on small spaces, such
as investment time-discount factors, should prefer asexual
reproduction.

I do think there is also an asymmetry between facts and values in that
it is plausible to think of context-specific values as generated
locally from facts and general values, while this is less plausible if
we switch fact and value.  We really need lots of small fact info from
other organisms, but its not clear we need to share context-specific
values.

>argues against the idea that current human values are in equilibrium.

Yes, we are likely way out of equilibrium.  That is the motivation for
trying to analyze what a future equilibrium would be.

It is of course a nice sentiment if it is voluntary.
It is important to note that while there is certainly a lot that additional
money can do for these people, welfare cannot completely eliminate poverty.
 In the Newsweek of May 5 there is an article titled "The Culture of
Poverty."  It reviews a study called "What Money Can't Buy" by economist
Susan Mayer of the University of Chicago.  It says that the poor (this is
the US we are talking about, not places with real poverty) are different
from the not poor in ways other than money.  Specifically, diligence,
honesty, good health, and reliability are the key factors.  A child must be
raised with parents that instill these values for them to have a good
chance in life.  Sending welfare checks will not help assure that these
values are taught.  I am not suggesting some plan of government
intervention to correct this problem.  I am just saying that poverty cannot
be eradicated with the economy like it is.  We will have to get to the
point where everyone is so rich, that those who lack the valuble values
mentioned above can live well through charitable organizations.  That is,
supplying someone with constant nutritious food, medical care, and housing
is as cheap as giving them some change is today (raise this figure if your
a little more generous or willing to pay a little more to get them off the
streets and into their clean, well lit lower class housing).

Paragraphs will return next posting.

      Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, Switzerland.
                         September 24-26 1998


    The idea of evolving machines, whose origins can be traced to the
cybernetics movement of the 1940s and the 1950s, has recently resurged
in the form of the nascent field of bio-inspired systems and
evolvable hardware.  The inaugural workshop, Towards Evolvable
Hardware, took place in Lausanne in October 1995, followed by the
First International Conference on Evolvable Systems: From Biology to
Hardware (ICES96), held in Japan in October 1996.

    Following the success of these past events, ICES98 will reunite
this burgeoning community, presenting the latest developments in the
field, bringing together researchers who use biologically inspired
concepts to implement real systems in artificial intelligence,
artificial life, robotics, VLSI design, and related domains. Topics to
be covered will include, but not be limited to, the following list:

    o Evolving hardware systems.  
    o Evolutionary hardware design methodologies.  
    o Evolutionary design of electronic circuits. 
    o Self-replicating hardware. 
    o Self-repairing hardware. 
    o Neural hardware.  
    o Adaptive hardware platforms.
    o Autonomous robots.  
    o Evolutionary robotics.  
    o Bio-robotics.
    o Applications of nanotechnology. 
    o Biological- or chemical-based systems. 
    o DNA computing.

Definately.  There are 65 alternative energy patents bought up by the oil
companies and they're not using them.  When asked why they dont they reply
"Only when we have to".

	Waaiit a minute!  I saw a documentary on TV
recently that described a fuel made from about half water
and several other ingredients.  It has been approved in Nevada.
Costs several hundred dollars to convert your car.  The fuel
costs almost as much as regular gasoline, but the excitement
is that it generates half the pollution!  The non-water half of
the mixture is several things, including:  a cheap petroleum
byproduct that is emulsified into the water.  It looks like milk.
	I think that I have this show on video tape,

PS.
	Yes, I saw a water-powered car on TV.

	BUT:  it's only half water, and the energy
                            comes from the fuel it'self, just
	          like any other fuel.  It's not cheap.
	          It is cleaner.

This weekend's Foresight Senior Associate Mini-Gathering in Palo Alto was
supposed to be a minor event, but it isn't working out that way, so we
thought we'd better let you know in case you choose to join up and come to
the meeting.  (Also, feel free to forward this info to interested friends.)
The primary topic, as usual, is nanotechnology.

The biggest surprise is that Marvin Minsky, an Advisor to Foresight, will
be coming and will speak.  "About what?" you may ask.  With Marvin, one
never knows, but it is always fascinating.  Probably it will at least touch
on nanotechnology.

Other confirmed speakers include: Eric Drexler, Ralph Merkle, Al Globus,
Deepak Srivastava, Gayle Pergamit, Terry Stanley, and myself.

In the Senior Associate tradition, we will be asking various attendees to
say a few words informally.  Here are some folks who will be there and who
we hope will step up to this, with speculation on what their topic might
be: Marc Arnold (on the Feynman Prizes and why prizes are a great
motivator), Wayne Gramlich (Web Enhancement), Thomas Landsberger (life
extension), Jim Lewis (the Foresight and IMM web sites), Tom McKendree
(nanotechnology for space development), Chip Morningstar, Ed Niehaus (PR
issues in nanotechnology), Steve Vetter (investing in nanotechnology), Jim
Von Ehr (his nanotechnology startup).

This is not an exhaustive list by any means; the attendees are many of our
favorite folks and virtually all of them have fascinating things to say,
either to the group or one-on-one.

If you want to come and haven't let us know yet, please do so IMMEDIATELY
by email (office@foresight.org), phone (+1 415 917 1122), or fax (+1 415
917 1123).

The fee is $95, to cover our direct costs for food, etc.  The meeting is
open to Senior Associates of Foresight, IMM, and CCIT; Senior Associates
pledge at least  $250 per year for five years; donations are
tax-deductible.  The meeting is off-the-record; no press coverage.

What to bring: videos to show (label with your name), favorite books to
tell us about (again, label with your name), software on laptops (security
of these is up to you -- one never knows in a hotel), favorite URLs, your
resume if you'd like a new job, and a swimsuit so you can take advantage of
the heated pool.

Hours are Friday, May 2      8 pm -10 pm   Reception (i.e. party)
          Saturday, May 3   10 am - 5 pm   Sessions
          Sunday, May 4     10 am - 5 pm   Sessions

Dinners are self-assembling.  Weather will probably be sunny, in the 70s
(F) or possibly the 80s.  Accommodation arrangements should be made
directly with the hotel; request hotel information when you contact us.

We hope to see as many of you as possible.  This is shaping up to be an
extremely enjoyable meeting.

I just thought you *couldn't* mean the real definition, you must have
been talking about some old-fashioned DNA-specific thing.  But it
looks like you're serious:

Okay.  Interesting.  You really are saying asexual reproduction,
not accepting others' input, is best for "basic values."

But isn't the only value, as far as evolution is concerned, to
reproduce?  Doesn't that mean that *that's* the only thing that will
be reproduced "asexually" (the distinction is almost moot when this
value is identical for every individual) and everything else amounts to
beliefs about *how* to reproduce, which will reproduce sexually?

It all has to do with discounting the future savings. Money in your
pocket today is worth more than the same amount 4,6, or 12 months later.
People who live tightly or in the red discount future earnings heavily.

Additionally, if there is an option that cost half as much but saves
more than half or even just half of the savings, then one is more likely
to invest in the cheaper option due to the lower cost of entry.

Of course it does. The engine will never put out as much energy as it
consumes, and electrolysis will never produce as much fuel as its power
source, the engine, burns to produce the energy needed.

What sort of engine is it he is using? If it is an internal combustion
engine,  you can expect a peak efficency of 46%. With an electrolysis
system with a maximum efficiency of 99%. Assume an engine which puts
half its output toward propelling the car, and half which produces
electricity for electrolysis. SO for every 100 units of hydrogen
consumed by the engine, it produces enough electricity to produce 23
units of hydrogen fuel. If the system starts off with 200 units of
hydrogen, and uses 100 per hour, the after one hour of operation there
will be 123 units of hydrogen in the tank. One hour later, there is 46
units of hydrogen left. 46 minutes later there are 17 units of hydrogen
left,and 15 minutes later there are only 6 units left, and so on.

SO, essentially, such a system requires 7 hours worth of electrolysis to
produce a little over 3 hours of automotive propulsion, for a cumulative
efficiency of of just over 45%. Now, this is merely the engines
efficiency, which does not count the losses due to powertrain
efficiency, rolling and aerodynamic drag, etc.

Right on. AND, as market demand rises, inflation will eventually make
space travel, even using existing technology, cost effective. The day
you spend $1000.00 for a burger (and think you're getting a deal) will
be the day you can fly to the moon for a million bucks as part of a fare
ware among space lines. Once we reach that level, our resource base will
be infinite. Going the other way, using nanoassemblers takes recycling,
efficiency, and conservation to an extreme, which will make resources as
cheap and easy to obtain as air, while the tools that create them and
use them in ever increasing complexity will be costly at first, but will
be used like PCs to build better versions of succeeding generations of
themselves for less.

Please bear in mind that one can have inflation AND decreasing resource
costs at the same time in an economy, as more and more economic value
has to do with work, intellectual property, services. One can even have
rising resource costs in dollar value becomeing relatively cheaper over
time, as they become smaller and smaller parts of the economic pie.

I don't know about this commercial trick, but I am personally familiar
with the Defense Department's practice of classifying patent
applications. Every patent application that comes into the patent office
is reviewed by a military liason. Anything with defense applicability,
or even merely can be considered a threat to "national security" (i.e.
anything that threatens the status quo), is classified, which means that
while you cannot get a patent, the defense department gives your
invention to a defense contractor via a laundering system that involves
national labs like Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos, Battelle, and
Phillips. This process "cleanses" the invention so the contractor can
legally make millions and billions of dollars off of your invention
while it is classified. Only once your invention has been declassified
can you receive a patent, and by then there are one or more defense
contractors who have already patented more advanced versions of your
invention, so you typically cannot get a patent by this time. Of course,
they typically do not declassify it until it has no remaining commercial
value.

This happened to me with a device I invented that does some fun things
with police radar. It also happened to a guy I know who is an
oceanographer at UW. He invented an underwater microphone to listen to
whale songs and underwater seismic activity. Turns out it is so
sensitive that the Navy classfied it due to its potential for use in
anti submarine warfare. Being rather miffed, and having the resources of
the UW behind him, he brought the Navy to court. Evnetually they settled
out of court. Now the Navy is the only licensee of his invention, in
return for which, accredited scientists can have free access to Navy
underwater listening stations at scheduled times, as well ass access to
tape archives that have been "filtered" of sensitive content.

I think you should include some technical details so that we can
bash them unmercifully and see if they hold up.

In particular, please tell us:
1) How was it charged?
2) What was the insulator?
3) How was the discharge controlled?

I am going to be travelling to the States in about a month and its a fairly
long flight from Melbourne to LA (16.3 hours be precise) and wondering if
any of you could recommend any recent good science books? The extropian
reading list supplied when you join is good, but I've basically read all
the books on the list and they are fairly old (though still good) and I am
looking for something published in the last couple of years. If its out in
paperback that would be a plus, hardbacks are particularly expensive here
in Australia, but that's not essential. I saw Ed Regis's book
Nanotechnology in the window the other day. Any opinions on that? Are there
any good books that cover current work in genetics? I did a sub-major in
genetics at university, but that was years ago and it would be good to get
up to scratch a bit in this area.

best,  patrick

If 'the media' do not publish it when it DOES work, then it seems obvious
that 'the media' could publish when it DOESN'T WORK.

I know many people (mainly Discordians (hail Eris!)) who have got some
great hoax articles published. Are you seriously saying you believe
everything you read?

Most journalists check their facts less vigorously than most scientists,
the scientific literature is riddled with rubbish, imagine what crap us
journos are feeding you. We have little peer reviewing, the public are the
only ones who really check up on us, and most people on the street think
"You think they'd publish that if it didn't work? I dunnOOooo......"

Try "The Human Blueprint" by Robert Shapiro, the book is ancient, almost 
5 years old, but very good. I presume you've already read "The Selfish Gene" 
by Richard Dawkins, if not, shame on you. I just bought Dawkins new book 
"Climbing Mount Improbable" today, if it's no good it will be the first bad 
book he ever wrote.

Yes, I thought it was excellent. If you know nothing about Nanotechnology 
this is the place to start, by the way it's called "Nano".

"Surely you're joking Mr. Feynman" by Richard Feynman is the perfect book to 
read on an airplane, it's both funny and profound and about one of the most 
brilliant men of the century.

A lot of people hate "The Physics of Immortality" by Frank Tipler, but not me, 
I thought it well worth reading.

The best science fiction novel I've read in years is "The Silicon Man" by 
Charles Platt.

If I was stranded on a desert island and could only have 10 books 
"Godel Escher Bach" by Douglas Hofstadter would certainly be one of them, 
as would "The Tao Is Silent" by Raymond Smullyan.  Smullyan is a mystic and 
I don't agree with everything he says, but it's an absolutely wonderful and 
brilliant book. Before I read Smullyan I thought that all mystics were fools,
now I know that is not true, only most of them.

Perry complained at length about CALYK, and his inane hydrogen car, taking
up space on the list.  Here's how I avoid being annoyed by such things.  

I subscribe to the Filtered Extropians list, promulgated by The Low Golden
Willow, phoenix@ugcs.caltech.edu.  This list broadcasts a daily compilation
of all the messages sent to the main list that are by authors that Mr.
Willow likes.  I also subscribe to the main list.  My mail reading program
(Eudora)  sorts the messages so I can look at the filtered version first.
If I see an interesting thread in the filtered version, I can dip into the
full list and read the entire thread.  I also read messages in the full list
from people whose names I don't recognize, so I don't unfairly exclude
people just because they're new.  Otherwise, I just delete the messages from
the full list unread.  My tastes seem to be sufficiently similar to Mr.
Willow's that just reading the filtered list means I don't miss much good stuff.

In short: why read the National Enquirer when you can read the Economist and
merely refer to the Enquirer?

Here's a pre-emptive strike against those who will accuse me of elitism:
Please come join the elite!  All you have to do is think well and write well!

Oh, I'd contact all three big long-distance companies.  But AT&T has by far
the most to lose, because they have the largest market share, so they'd
probably pay the most to suppress it.

Well, I'm simplifying.  Actually the right business model is to sell it for
$80 and then charge the customers half the money they save every month-- $6
or so.  But even if we couldn't charge them by the month, it would still be
the right thing to charge $80 for them.  Consumers don't buy money-saving
devices unless they pay for themselves in six months or less.  It's crazy,
but my business-savvy wife says this is a well-known fact of retailing.  I
knocked another factor of two off that because at least at first, they will
be unproven devices, and consumers will be wary of dropping $150 on them.

The reason it makes sense for AT&T to buy this invention is the irrational
short-termism of consumers, and the high information cost of convincing
consumers that it really worth, as you say, upwards of $500.  Unlike the
consumers, AT&T is long-term, and willing to be convinced by e.g. a
prototype deployment with 100 customers, which would only cost $150,000 by
our estimates.

In a market meeting classical criteria of efficiency, this kind of
suppression would not make sense: the customers would pay what the device
was worth, and the former supplier (AT&T) would be screwed, because they'd
lose just as much money by  buying the patent as by losing customers to the
competition.

Actually, all he would need to read is the chapter entitled "Conservation of
Energy", in either the Feynman Lectures on Physics, or in the new book Six
Easy Pieces, which collects six lectures from the big books that are
particularly easy for the public to understand.  That chapter is amusing,
entirely clear, entirely convincing, and sufficiently simple for an
intelligent child to understand (I know this because I read it when I was an
intelligent child.)  People who don't believe in the conservation of energy
should read this; if they still disagree, we can at least have an
intelligent debate.

Richard Feynman (who was also my father) divided perpetual motion machines
into Perpetual Motion Machines of the First Kind, which violate the first
law of thermodynamics (AKA conservation of energy), Perpetual Motion
Machines of the Second Kind, which violate the second law of thermodynamics
(entropy must increase), and Those Other Perpetual Motion Machines, which
purport to get their energy from other laws of physics.  

CALYK's alternator-drives-electrolyzer-drives-engine-drives-alternator
machine is a typical example of the First Kind.  They are the most common
kind, and usually pretty lame. 

The Second Kind is rarer; the only example I'm familiar with is one that my
dad showed me the plans for.  Once in a while, someone would come to him
with a perpetual motion machine prospectus and ask if it was a good
investment.  One of these was a machine that claimed to extract heat energy
from the air and run a generator with it.  They had built half the machine,
which worked as far as they could test it, and were looking for gullible
investors to pay for finishing it.  By carefully going over the immensely
complex  plans, my father and I found a "heat exchanger" that was supposed
to take warm freon and cool air, and produce hot freon and cold air.
Naturally, this heat exchanger was in the as-yet unbuilt portion. 

Those Other Perpetual Motion Machines get their energy from heretofore
unknown physics, like cold fusion, vacuum fluctuations, or secret new
physical laws that will be disclosed only on the payment of $1,000,000.
These are worthy of much more serious physical investigation, since it is
entirely concievable that someone will discover a new easy way of making
energy.  Cold fusion is the most famous recent example of this type. It's a
pity it doesn't actually seem to work. 

Back around 1970, my father went to a public demonstration of one of Those
Other Perpetual Motion Machines. He discovered an electric cord running out
of the back of the machine, plugged into the wall.  When he unplugged the
machine and pointed out to the inventor that a perpetual motion machine that
had to be plugged in wasn't really perpetual, the inventor pushed a button
on the control panel and the machine exploded.  Several spectators were
severely injured; I believe one man lost an arm.  The inventor sued my
father on the grounds that he had caused the explosion; my father suspected
that the explosion was deliberate.  The trial ended up with my father not
having to pay.

1) Pyramids, water cars, yogic levitation, etc.

For those of you who would like to turn this list into the National
Enquirer, and want to tell us all about how evil the supressors of
Earth Shattering Technology are, just accept that we are a bunch of
ignorant jerks, unsubscribe, and find another group happier to listen
to you.

2) Save the poor third world children, win valuable prizes!

The thing that will help the poor worldwide far more than anything
else is economic development, and the only thing we know of that
actually causes economic development is free market capitalism. I
would have thought this was more or less accepted here in the Rabid
Heart of Extropian Thought.

	Kennita,   "sarcasm"?  We did not know who wrote it or why.  As it was
repeated over and over, it appeared to be a joke of some sort and our
response was in the spirit of humour.  That someone left such a message in
the first place as a serious response to something on this list was not
considered since there was nothing preceeding it which indicated that to be
the case.
	Thanks for your concern though.

	John,  we have no idea how many mystics you have met, talked with, etc.
and perhaps your statement about thinking "all mystics were fools,..." was
made in light-hearted jest.  We have met many mystics and many people who
claimed a belief in mysticism.  There is a great difference between both
groups.  We found people from all walks of life, including scientists,
doctors, lawyers, libertarians, Christians, Jews, Moslems, Hindi, Jains,
Bhuddists, etc. who have had the mystical experience.  They share many of
the values of Extros.  They see no need for the State or for organized
religion and recognize that both are instruments of control of the
individual.   Many mystics continue to go to their original place of
worship and there they try to reach people using their own teachings as a
springboard.   Lucifer, the well-known mystic, did the same thing in his
travels through Persia, Afghanistan, Nepal and Kashmir; stopping to learn
the "scriptures" of the natives and then teaching the mystical viewpoint
which originated the religion.   He tried it with his own people but
received a hostile response and returned to Kashmir. 
	Many people admired by Extros were mystics, including the father of the
modern scientific method, Francis Bacon.  Michael Faraday, Isaac Newton,
Thom. Jefferson, Thom. Paine, Benj. Franklin, Leonardo da Vinci, and Albert
Einstein were also mystics.
	Perhaps the problem lies with those who have a belief in mysticism, rather
than a true mystic?
	Believers, in mysticism or anything else, rarely stop to question their
beliefs.
Often we found believers who brought unconsidered ideas up and tried to
attach them to mysticism.   Certainly we have found many books, claiming to
be "mystical" or claiming to present "mystical" concepts, which were off
the mark. 
	What do you say?
