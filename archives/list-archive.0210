Great article, Ron.  I have been pondering something
which Dr. Sowell comments on: the low IQ seen in isolated
white communities.  After having seen that firsthand,
I am convinced it isn't just my imagination or some
stereotype.  It is very real.

My question then is "what is the mechanism
that could cause low IQ in these isolated communties?"
I suggested one: those with brains or ambition leave
town, and the breeding is left to the stay-at-homes.

Do we need any other explanation beyond this one?
Could inbreeding play a role?  Would that in general
reduce the *average* IQ of an isolated community?  spike

Not so fast. Clearly these towns are not `isolated' if smart children can
leave. What they are, presumably, is small and unattractive, with no local
prospects for smart people. So suppose it's true that by and large everyone
of IQ greater than 115 and certainly 140 shoots thru quick smart and heads
for the Big Smoke. Is the implication of `the breeding is left to the
stay-at-homes' that those having children in town must produce kids with
genomes ever more conducive to stupidity? Maybe not, since with each
generation the same social and economic effects will draw away the smarter
kids. Maybe it's like the lottery: everyone in town has a chance of
winning, and once you win you leave the god-forsaken hole and head for the
beach. This doesn't make it harder for succeeding generations to win the
lottery.

I really don't understand the motivation, but then I find it hard to
comprehend why TV ads shriek moronic crap in my ears and eyes until I hit
the mute and turn shudderingly away. I assume radio and TV `commercial
messages' with brand recognition must be successful on some marginal level
in inscribing one option rather than another on brains that have
consciously averted their gaze. But that doesn't work with spam. Each day I
have to hose out a dozen or more items of crapulous gibberish that only
someone terminally lonely or stupid would even open and read, let along
respond to. So why do they get sent? Someone is paying for this `service'.
What in dog's name are they getting in return?

I think SPAM is more of a virus than a marketing tool. It seems to be
completely untargeted. Most of the SPAM I get originates in the USA, and even
if for some unaccountable reason I wanted to take up an 'instant guaranteed
mortgage' offer, it wouldn't be valid in the UK anyway.

It's got a life of its own. Even if I block a domain it just evolves a new
random domain handle and re-sends the same trash. I wonder how much bandwidth
SPAM takes up on a daily basis?

Personally SPAM puts me off a product and I'd go out of my way not to buy
anything from a company involved in SPAMing. So maybe it could be a marketing
tool after all, in the field of negative advertising...?

Well, Chris or Ron, someone has to break it to Dr. Sowell
that race is an invalid concept, and that all his many
books are for naught.

I have taken it upon myself, meanwhile, to break it to the
San Francisco board of supervisors that breeds of dogs likewise
do not exist.  Ordinances are actually being enacted affecting
*some* so-called breeds in favor of the rest of the so-called
breeds!  Can you believe it?

As Chris put it so well,

> Any studies done in the US that try to correlate
> anything with Race are nonsense

and I'm sure that the same is true with respect to all the
higher animals.

It boggles the mind how the uninformed masses have, all
these years, believed that races of people and breeds of
dogs actually exist.  Think of the embarrassment at the
NAACP, the KKK, and all the civil rights marchers when
they discover the truth!

I think it boils down to "There's one born every minute". Just recently 
a secretary in a legal firm fell for the nigerian scam and milked the 
companys assets for a large sum of money.

And if somebody can believe something like that, only the sky is the limit.

Furthermore a lot of spam has the form of a Ponzi scheme. So while 
people often believe that someone down the line will get cheated out of 
their money, they don't believe it will be themselve. They will be the 
one able to bail out in time.

Now that distinction I do understand.  I think that what
you are aiming for is what I usually take for granted,
namely, a civilized discussion of an issue where both
sides conduct themselves courteously and with respect,
and in which each side is trying as articulately as
possible to write persuasively of what they feel or
reason to be the case, and try to see exactly where
the other party is going wrong.

Now one might criticize the paragraph I've just
written as depicting the parties as too closed-
minded.  But if I'm right that actual ideological
differences lie very deep indeed, then this is the
most that can be hoped for while discussing *issues*.
That is, whether it's *Iraq* or *profiling*, the 
best that can be hoped for are interesting discussions
that permit each party to raise objections to the
other's vision and to articulate their own position.

The "meta" on the other hand that *I* was getting at
is rising above ideological differences *entirely*.
In this kind of investigation, one strives to have
one's writing or points to be completely independent
of one's ideology.  Operationally:  if it can be seen
what your allegiance is from what you have written,
then you have failed.

Observe that no one could tell from what we have written
above what are our positions on the political spectrum.

In *this* meta mode, one attempts to objectively 
explain why rightists are to the right and leftists
to the left, that is, what psychology or values
at root distinguish them.

Great!  I've always looked for them, but never have

But I believe your analogy badly flawed.  Were our
differences mathematical, or even scientific, then
time would greatly serve to show one side, as you
so delicately put it, *wrong*.

Do you have any good examples where history has
indubitably concluded that one side was *right*
and the other *wrong* in any intensely ideological
debate?  Even today it is hardly decided who was
right in the partisan battles of ancient Athens.

I accuse you of thinking that your side of the
political spectrum is right in the same way that
Darwin turned out to be right.  Whereas I think,
quite on the contrary, that my side of the political
spectrum is *right* only to the extent that I
approve of certain values (e.g. "equality" vs.
"total wealth production", or vice-versa). 

(To amplify on my last example, some people hold 
equality of distribution to be much more an important
factor in modern economies than other people.  The
latter are more willing than the former to sacrifice
more equal distributions for the sake of greater
growth, etc.)

Oh yes, indeed.  Some people certainly have stronger
stomachs than others, and some of us make a greater
effort than others to work unpleasant truths into our
belief systems.  One only needs to consult an objective
list of holocausts like the ones you published, to see
that everything unpleasant to one's position on the
political spectrum cannot be written off as mere work
of those rascally conservatives (liberals).

I don't quite get your joke.  I guess that by your
"devil" you mean one of those unfortunates who
doesn't have any independent yearning for the truth
and whose beliefs cannot be falsified by more data?
So one of those people you keep complaining about
could have written everything that I wrote before?
Yes, but so what?

You mean because they refuse to see the light as
propounded by your own personal political god?
If not that, then what other sort of truth did
you see people resist?  Mind you, I can't make
any sense of what you're saying unless you mean
that they just point blank rejected a fact that
had been shown to obtain from a credible source.

I understand how resort to "values" can be a face
saving argument.  As far back as when I was ten
years old I tried to save the face of a friend
who couldn't keep the rhythm in our little clarinet
duet.  As we kept failing, I informed his mother
that "it is almost impossible for us to really 
do it exactly together", though now, of course,
I realize that I wasn't fooling her a bit in all
probability.

But this is *not* like that.  Jeff, do you suddenly
think that it's going to be REVEALED whether the
conservatives or the progressives were *right*,
and all on the losing side who are honest will
suddenly confess their errors?

Well, throw all those, the blind, or stupid, or less
educated, or immoral out of the equation for a minute.
Are any remaining on that side of the political spectrum
you oppose?

Yes, but my point is that one *can't* know that.
You can *try* to watch yourself, of course, but
the best that you can ever do is face inconsistencies
in your own belief system and rectify them.  And
that can always be done, else all the liberals
(conservatives) would long ago have gone extinct,
just as the Ptolemaicists have.

But all you can mean by that, if we are speaking

with the *you* of now.  You *can't* know that 
given another fifty years you won't change sides
again!

Well, good for you.  I also feel myself adrift
politically, though moving very slowly.  Unlike
you, however, I don't find little *bits* constantly
that need to be purged.  An interesting difference.

Well, yes, I did expect that you would agree that

a more sincere desire to find the truth than some
on this list.

I think that you are dodging the question.  Yes, we
know how entrenched administrations in power in
Washington (or in the Kremlin) can do amazing
ideological gymnastics when it suits them.  I meant
by "side" left or right.  Do you think that one

You do mean one of (left, right) I take it?

I think that a number of ideological differences can
be shown to rest on irresolvable differences in 
values.  For example, person A may find education to
be *so* important that he violates his usual libertarian
principles to support public education, but in every
other way agrees with person B.  They may both be
devout truth-seekers, but can not progress on resolving
their dispute.

That kind of debate *is* totally different from left-right
debates, which, I believe, ultimately rest on values.  For
example, what is the value cost of holding one gender up
to potential ridicule?  For some, the cost may be so low
that they don't even bother to frame sentences in a 
sensitive way to avoid insulting one gender.  For others,
the cost could conceivably be so high that even *investigating*
a field of inquiry that *might* prove embarrassing in terms
of respect or stature to one gender must be forbidden.

>  Maybe I'm misunderstanding what you mean when you call me a truth seeker.

To me, that's evidence that you are a "truth seeker", which
is an unwieldy concept that emerged in a discussion that I
was having with Jeff in this thread.  Jeff characterized
those who are *not* truth-seekers this way:

"Regard for truth is demoted to 'how can it help me win',
which is contempt for truth."

and this way:

"The main difficulty is the subversive participation of
individuals who refuse to follow the rules, and the
corruption of discourse--and trust--that results from
the failure to censure or exclude them."

For example, I do hear some talk show hosts who simply
go silent when someone from *their* side makes an
outrageous statement.  Whereas one extremely prominent
talk show host that I listen to a great deal goes out
of his way to criticize one of his followers who has
gone too far.

The latter, I think.  I think that it's impossible to
*entirely* keep our own hidden motives from affecting
our conscious thoughts and calculations.  But your
question does help o show up the limitations of the
concept "truth seeker".

:-) 

Actually, since being blond is recessive and not a strong disadvantage
it is very unlikely to vanish even if we do our best to intermingle our
genomes.  I guess the only thing that will really get rid of the gene
would be if we for some reason got rid of hair altogether (to fit in
with the 50's concepts of bald-headed superhumans?). But in the diverse
future we envision, I guess the biggest risk is simply that the
naturally blond gene gets lost among all the other new and weird hair
colors. Is that a primordial blond, an ultraviolet blond or someone with
chromophores?

As for my project of raising the IQ of blond people, I'm still working
on my current test subject (myself). So far there has unfortunately been
little evidence for higher intelligence...

The one good thing about the rat race is that it makes the average rat

Not necessarily. A two-party system promotes more polarization than a
multiparty system, it seems (after looking at my polsci visualisations) -
all the six major political parties of Sweden think roughly the same,
with different biases (do you want green-flavored, left-flavored,
liberal-flavored or classic social democracy with your taxes?). The
important thing is whether new and different ideas can break into the
system. Right now the party systems in western democracies seem to be
hardening in a worrying manner, which means that they won't easily adopt
new ideas or worldviews. 

For example, suppose I wanted to influence my government the traditional
way. That would involve joining a party, and then spending around 8
years showing my loyalty and reliability; after that I would maybe get a
chance to be elected. Of course, if I disagreed with the party line I
would have to vote according to it anyway, or (and this was claimed as a
wonder of democracy by a politician just last week) I could get a
temporary replacement to vote correctly while I was standing aside
righteously. To affect the party line I would have to get into the deep
networks and councils, a process that apparently takes many decades of
intrigue. Understanding the political culture and its codes is essential,
which explains why so many Swedish politicians are second (or third!)
generation politicians.

Of course, there are other ways of influencing politics; becoming a
politician to influence politics right now is like trying to influence
the layout of a road by becoming a roadworker. The real place to be is on
the memetic battlefield of society, making others understand and
appreciate new concepts and convince them that they need to be
implemented. That may still run into problems if you end up with a
political class isolated from everybody else and their worldviews.

Transhumanism in suits and ties works, but it is hard work. But
the conference food is usually good :-)

Olga,
       I had the luxury of watching several sets of hearing before the 
Senate, at that time, in their entirety.  Among the ones I watched in its 
entirety were the hearings of Clarence Thomas.
       Clarence Thomas was an absolute gentleman and a credit to his country 
facing that group that he so accurately described as a "high tech lynch mob."
       As I listened to those hearings over a period of several days it 
became apparent what Clarence Thomas' sin was and is -- he got off the 
plantation and built his own life without being beholden to any of those that 
thought they owned him.
       I will always admire that man for being able to face that mob day 
after day, never giving an inch, answering every charge no matter how 
transparent, and never acting any less than a complete gentleman.
       I cannot sit silently and hear the good name of a person such as 
Clarence Thomas trashed.
Ron h.

BTW, now that I have answered the comments about Clarence Thomas what does 
that have to do with Dr. Sowell's column on IQ?

Spike,
       I really don't know.  There is an old joke among hillbilly guitarists. 
 If you go into the same room with Chet Atkins (or some other expert 
guitarist) you'll have to either lay your guitar down or ask for lessons.  I 
find myself in that same position with Herrnstein, Sowell or Williams -- 
actually there are some others.  Refering back to the joke, I have to either 
lay my guitar down or ask for lessons.
       But if I can make a very general observation.  I start with a 
conclusion based on personal experience.  Anyone that thinks blacks are 
"dumber" is deluded.  I also believe Herrnstein, Murray, Sowell, etal has 
uncovered evidence that blacks have gotten the short end of the stick.  
       We have a lot of evidence that point to the same conclusion in 
different areas.  A black male, I am told, will live roughly ten years less 
than a white male -- the difference being the additional stress that the 
black male endures.  The same parallel shows up with women.
       John Taylor Gatto makes some comments about how the black student got 
short changed when he tried to learn to read.  The same argument holds today.
       If I can expand my comments to include the territory you were taking 
in.  In the factorys when I am in factorys located in white slums I see the 
same stuff as you would see with any other underclass.  I recently read a 
book about conditions in England among the underclass, same thing.  In fact 
the authors Davidson and Rees-Mogg report that if you go into a major city on 
any of the continents on Earth and seek out the slums you will see and hear 
the same things -- only the language and skin color changes.
       But the criticism of TBC and others covers up the fact that here in 
the US we have a problem that is our responsibility and need to find out what 
we are doing wrong.

### Actually, whenever a smart person leaves town, he/she takes the smart
genes away. If you conceptualize mating with a smart person to produce smart
offspring as winning a lottery, then these genes are the winning tickets.
The not-so-smarts remaining in town are left playing a lottery with fewer
and fewer winning tickets.

### Yes, inbreeding is associated with a significant drop in IQ. Additional
factors in isolated communities might be lack of adequate nutrition, lack of
intellectual stimulation (which results in the inability to intellectually
stimulate others, which results in the inability...yes, the vicious circle).
In fact, the interplay between minor genetic differences and minor initial
environmental differences can magnify differences between groups quite
significantly. Slightly less smart persons produce or seek environments
which are less conducive to their intellectual development. This observation
is the basis of Dr.Flynn's recent explanation of the Flynn's effect, at:
Dickens WT. Flynn JR.,Heritability estimates versus large environmental
effects: the IQ paradox resolved.,Psychological Review. 108(2):346-69, 2001
Apr.

Abstract
Some argue that the high heritability of IQ renders purely environmental
explanations for large IQ differences between groups implausible. Yet, large
environmentally induced IQ gains between generations suggest an important
role for environment in shaping IQ. The authors present a formal model of
the process determining IQ in which people's IQs are affected by both
environment and genes, but in which their environments are matched to their
IQs. The authors show how such a model allows very large effects for
environment, even incorporating the highest estimates of heritability.
Besides resolving the paradox, the authors show that the model can account
for a number of other phenomena, some of which are anomalous when viewed
from the standard perspective. [References: 65]

I would expect it had far more to do with environment.
Isolated environments aren't very stimulating, and there's
not much to make people get smart.  People emigrate
for a variety of reasons - ambition *and* desparation,
most of which aren't linked to intelligence.  Of course,
you're right inn that the bright ones of any given
generation will be mostly gone by 25, but they'll get
replaced by others for some time.

Yes, but the effect would be really small.  First cousin
marriages have a negligeable impact on most parameters
and it would take several centuries of absolute genetic
isolation for a village of 100 to reach that level of
inbreeding.

### This critique has been leveled against IQ tests before. There is a
number of studies refuting it. For example, there is a clear positive
correlation between the g-loading of a test item and the amount of
Black-White difference. If indeed Black test takers were less motivated,
they would fail on the items with lower g-loading (like the digit span) to
the same extent as on the highly g-loaded items (like the reverse digit
span). Of course, unless you postulate that these test takers actually
recognize the g-loading of an item and selectively suppress their responses
to the highly g-loaded ones.

It's a numbers game.  TV and radio ads cost lots of
money.  A successful ad campaign pays that money back
in increased sales.  This is so effective that almost
every major corporation uses some form of advetising.

Spam is not anywhere near as effective as a well
crafted media blitz, but is doesn't have to be.  The
monetary investment required is almost zero (a single
individual's time) so ANY return at all... any... is a
profit.

So invest 100,000 to increase revenue by 20% or invest
< 100 to increase revenue by 1000%

The problem is that spam is so cheap that it only
needs to be read by a small number of people and
responded to by a fraction of a percentage point to be
cost effective.

An ad campaign that generated 5 responses out of a
million views would be considered a colossal failure,
but a spam campaign that had the same results would be
a huge success.

My first instinct is to say that isolation *is* the mechanism in this 
scenario.  In larger cities* exposure to new ideas and experiences are 
cheap and easy to come by - so even if one's IQ is low due to genetic 
reasons it can perhaps be overcome.  But there we find ourselves on the 
slippery slope of a nature/nurture debate.

* - it occurred to me that this is probably true for smaller, 
well-connected locales as well.  Boulder, CO came to mind.  Not quite 
as big as Denver, but still well-connected and diverse enough to open 
one's horizons.

It took me about a month to train Apple's Mail.app to filter out spam 
without having any false positives.  I just swapped the system over 
from training mode to automatic mode - so I don't even have to see the 
raunchy subject lines anymore.  It's a rather impressive feature.

Max is on the right track with "there's one born every minute".  In 
another thread which briefly touched on the stupidity of users it was 
said that there are still some people who give the computer any 
information it asks for.  Presumably this is because these people 
believe the computers to be more intelligent than they are.  "Why would 
it ask me my real first and last names unless it really needed to 
know?"  and "Well, of COURSE I need a Passport account if I want to use 
the Internet".

If you track back in the archives searching for spam I'm sure you'll 
find a previous thread where it was stated that spam will be around as 
long as there's a decent probability of making money off it.

-crw.

Also; recently, Lessig suggested a bounty on spammer's heads.

Turkey Says Seized Substance Not Uranium

"Scientists at Turkey's Nuclear Research and Training Center on the
outskirts of Istanbul said on Tuesday the substance was not uranium and was
not radioactive. 

"It is a powder of zinc, manganese, iron and zirconium," Guler Koksal,
director of the research facility told Reuters. "It is not radioactive, it
is not chemical and it is not explosive." "

As Rafal pointed out, nutrition often plays an important role.

> I propose immediately dropping this thread.

The cat's pretty much out of the bag already, and I'm sure there
will be plenty of commentary on the episode elsewhere.  I missed it
too, though I'm a big ER fan, because I was in a poker tournament
at the time; of course I lasted long enough to miss the show and
then busted out before reaching the money.

The teasers for the show made it sound like they were going to kill
someone off, but it appears they just mutilated Romano a bit.
Knowing that certainly won't affect my enjoyment of the episode
when I get around to catching the rerun, so I don't see /that/ as
any reason to kill this thread (although the fact that it is pretty
far off-topic might be better reason).

So, to direct this thread to something a little more topical, I do
think ER is at times a very Extropian show, and a positive influence
on culture, and Dr. Romano in particular strikes me as a great
example of the value of brutal honesty.  If they keep him true to
character, I'm sure they'll have him in fighting form, looking for
every technology and therapy he can find to help him do what he wants
to do, shouting down idiots that try to tell him to accept his
limitations, and telling other disabled patients to stop whining.

(sorry about the manual reply, my usual mua is dead)
Like you guessed, this kind of match happens continuously on computers 
around the world, usually involving a couple of other programs as 
well.  Machine-machine matches are more than plentiful, the scarcity is 
for public good human players vs machine matches since humans tend to 
be either shy about losing, busy, or they tend to want money for them.
Btw, in one of the most quoted (and i would say respected, because of 
the number of games they play) machine vs machine tournaments, the SSDF 
rating list, Deep Fritz is ranked 6th, and Junior 7 (Deep Junior is not 
an official name) is ranked 7th.  The tournament claims to have played 
87000 games (only a few hundred involving each of the above though).

We can learn a great deal about human motivation from the field of
addiction science. This is a field with which I am well acquainted for
professional reasons. This message is supported by several research
abstracts, contained below.

An addiction is essentially a "hijacking" of the brain's reward system.
The addicted individual loses motivation to seek reward and pleasure
from normal healthy experiences and instead seeks the more intense
rewards available from his addiction. This "substitution" of normal
rewards for drug-rewards is very strong empirical evidence that normal
rewards are mediated by the same neural processes as drug-rewards. Other
evidence for the same is found in the lab through epidemiological
research involving genetic testing, brain scans, and via microdialysis
and reverse microdialysis techniques in live subjects (the latter only
in lab animals, since humans are not inclined to undergo such invasive
procedures).

In an earlier message here I quoted from an article by Desmond Morris.
In that article Morris states that every animal species can be
categorized into one of two groups: the "specialists" and the
"opportunists." The human animal is an opportunist, meaning that
nature/evolution has provided us with no specialized survival skills.
We've survived largely by staying busy as hunters and novelty seekers
(this is in contrast to, for example, venomous snakes which have a very
specialized skill: the snake can lie quietly in wait for its prey and
thereby survive with relatively little physical activity relative to
humans and other opportunistic animals, e.g., wolves).

In neurological terms, the motivation to experience novelty is closely
related to the motivations to eat, to use addictive drugs, to find
comfort and shelter, to take risks, to seek sexual experiences, and yes
even to engage in the socially constructive acts that we call
"altruistic". Essentially all human motivations are, at least in my
view, manifestations of the basic biological incentive to experience
reward and satisfaction.

The biological underpinnings of the human motivation to seek novelty
seems to be located (like other forms of reward, including drug reward)
in the mesolimbic dopaminergic system. Studies show increased activity
especially in the nucleus accumbens when the organism is confronted by
novelty. Neurons in the ventral tegmental area release dopamine into the
nucleus accumbens (NAC), which seems to be the source of the pleasurable
and reinforcing effects of rewarding experiences.

As Rafal likes to say, the cortex is also implicated in the reward
experience, specifically the pre-frontal cortex. I certainly agree that
the cortex is involved in the conscious recognition of pleasure and
reward, and that in some sense this recognition cannot be removed from
the experience of reward itself. Also the conscious or preconscious
*recognition* of reward is no doubt very important in establishing
learned behaviors and habits and conscious preferences. But as this
first abstract below suggests, the actual "pleasure" property of the
reward experience seems to be mediated by activity in the nucleus
accumbens rather than the cortex. (Injections of the cocaine-like drug
nomifensine into the frontal cortex did not result in reinforcement of
the behavior, while injections into the NAC did. This suggests the
primacy of the NAC in the pleasurable reward experience itself, at least
with respect to rewards that are mediated by the neurotransmitter
dopamine [and I know of none that are not].) 

The mechanisms underlying the reward from novelty is described in the
second abstract.

The human motivation to seek novelty is investigated in more detail in
the third abstract below. Researchers have learned that in humans,
certain polymorphisms of the dopamine receptor are associated with
greater motivation to seek novelty. Some people get a bigger "kick" out
of new experiences than do others, and it is possible to predict these
personality differences between individuals through genetic testing.
People with these alleles of the dopamine receptor genes are more
motivated than average to "boldly go where no one has gone before" :). 

This third abstract also underscores the importance of the information
contained in our genes with respect to the preservation of our
personalities. We may someday be able to dispense with the *form* of our
genes (currently in the form of protein molecules) but I see no way to
dispense with the *information* they contain. We may not need their form
but we do need their substance if we hope to keep our personalities
intact in some transhuman existence.

Habit-forming actions of nomifensine in nucleus accumbens.

Carlezon WA; Devine DP; Wise RA

Canada. 
Rats learned to lever-press when reinforced with response-contingent
microinfusions of the dopamine uptake inhibitor nomifensine (1.7 nmol
per injection) into the ventro-medial (shell) region of nucleus
accumbens septi (NAS). The drug was not effective when similar
injections were given either in random relation to lever-pressing, into
the more dorso-lateral (core) region of NAS, or into the frontal cortex.
Cocaine was also effective in NAS, but considerably less so. These data
suggest that response-contingent dopamine uptake blockade within the NAS
is sufficient to establish and maintain instrumental response habits.

In vivo microdialysis in freely moving rats was used to monitor
novelty-evoked elevations in extracellular dopamine in the nucleus
accumbens septi (NAS) and to examine the role of the ventral subiculum
of the hippocampus and glutamatergic transmission in the ventral
tegmental area (VTA) on these elevations. Exposure to novel stimuli
evoked investigatory activity and increased nucleus accumbens dopamine.
Unilateral injections of the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (0.16
ng/0.5 microL) into the ventral subiculum ipsilateral to the dialysed
NAS abolished novelty-evoked elevations in dopamine. Injections of
tetrodotoxin into the contralateral VS did not prevent novelty-evoked
elevations in nucleus accumbens dopamine. Unilateral perfusion (via
microdialysis) of the ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists
kynurenic acid (1 mM) into the ipsilateral but not the contralateral VTA
blocked novelty-evoked elevations in nucleus accumbens dopamine. Neither
unilateral injections of tetrodotoxin nor unilateral perfusion of
kynurenic acid disrupted investigatory behaviour. These data indicate
that phasic elevations in nucleus accumbens dopamine evoked by exposure
to unconditioned novel stimuli are dependent on impulse flow from the
hippocampus and glutamatergic transmission in the VTA. 

ABSTRACT 3 
D2 and D4 dopamine receptor polymorphisms and personality.

Noble EP; Ozkaragoz TZ; Ritchie TL; Zhang X; Belin TR; Sparkes RS 
Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences, University of
California, Los Angeles 90024-1759, USA. epnoble@ucla.edu. 
The relationship of various dimensions of temperament, measured by the
Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ), to polymorphisms of the
D2 dopamine receptor (DRD2) and D4 dopamine receptor (DRD4) genes was
determined in 119 healthy Caucasian boys who had not yet begun to
consume alcohol and other drugs of abuse. Total Novelty Seeking score of
the TPQ was significantly higher in boys having, in common, all three
minor (A1, B1, and Intron 6 1) alleles of the DRD2 compared to boys
without any of these alleles. Boys with the DRD4 7 repeat (7R) allele
also had a significantly higher Novelty Seeking score than those without
this allele. However, the greatest difference in Novelty Seeking score
was found when boys having all three minor DRD2 alleles and the DRD4 7R
allele were contrasted to those without any of these alleles. Neither
the DRD2 nor the DRD4 polymorphisms differentiated total Harm Avoidance
score. Whereas subjects having all three minor DRD2 alleles had a
significantly higher Reward Dependence 2 (Persistence) score than
subjects without any of these alleles, no significant difference in this
personality score was found between subjects with and without the DRD4
7R allele. In conclusion, DRD2 and DRD4 polymorphisms individually
associate with Novelty Seeking behavior. However, the combined DRD2 and
DRD4 polymorphisms contribute more markedly to this behavior than when
these two gene polymorphisms are individually considered.

What is the complete chain of events that leads to some of Ron H.'s 
message replies being propagated before the message?

If it was a random quirk of the mailing list software, then we could 
expect that to occur in other examples.

Is Ron H. a list moderator of the extropians list?  In a moderated list 
a moderator would have the opportunity to post his replies to earlier 
e-mails before they were passed.  I believe the chartered role, if that 
is the correct term, of the moderator of extropians is to send queued 
e-mails sent to the list from addresses of non-members, and otherwise 
maintenance list operations, but otherwise posts from members are 
automatically posted, and that it's somebody else.

The mechanism of the list software is, for each e-mail received, to open 
a connection to the recipient's host, through a network of 
interconnected computers, often on port 25, and to transfer to the 
recipient's mail host a copy of the message, addressed to the 
recipient.  With hundreds or more list members, the host of the first 
person on the recipient list would receive the e-mail before the host of 
the last person.  If the e-mails are sent in sequential manner, then 
each recipient host should have the post before the next post reaches 
the first host.

It isn't only a clock difference, which could result from varying system 
clocks, there is sometimes a difference in the order received.  Ron 
posts through an aol account, or so the e-mail headers say,

Have you ever noticed any spelling errors that weren't in your posts?  
How about spurious spelling errors in news articles?  Are you reading 
this?  (Heh.)

Ron, what do you mean when you say that?

It's a question of drive. You can get out of anything anywhere, if you're 
sufficiently motivated. Of course most people don't realize that (or 
realize it too late), or just naturally lack motivation.

Why are hillbillies so dumb? Is it because of intercousin marriages? Is it
because of Joe-Bob had too much gumbo as a kid? Puh-leeze.

I think we can safely discount the nutritional hypothesis at this day and
age. The only place this could happen is hardcore vegan kids. The
brain-drain/inbreeding combo is imo merely a footnote (though I'm quite
ready to buy the hypothesis, if presented with compelling evidence).

What I think it mostly is: being raised in an insufficiently
rich/competitive environment.

What's the transhumanist way of fixing the world? (Preferably, without 
standing up from the couch, and making one's hands dirty).

Please do so. The amount of disinformation out there is immense, the
best of which builds on real facts, events, etc to attempt to convince
the world that the US is an evil, heinous, rapacious, self aggrandizing
bunch of martial looters. All you need to do to discern the truth is
look at the real actions of the US in the past (and not just the CIA
dirty tricks that the opposition loves to feed on), but things like the
Marshall Plan, the Peace Corps, etc. It is pretty clear that the
alleged schemes being touted as the 'cause' of all of our actions, and
for which all the blame for 9/11 is heaped on the US government, is
nothing but smoke and mirrors.

We know because of the many cellphone calls by passengers to loved ones
and 911, by flight attendants to FAA flight controllers, etc. who
described them as carrying knives and box cutters, and possibly even
one firearm, given one report of a flight attendant notifying the FAA
that a passenger had been shot by a hijacker.

This is a damned if you do/don't scenario. Bush was lauded after his
inauguration for all of the highly competent people he drew from
private industry to run the government. For example, Rumsfeld for his
experience in the defence industry. Now that the opposition has its
wind up, it claims this previously lauded expertise, intended to
improve the operation of the government, is now a conflict of interest.
The left can't have it both ways.

High arsenic levels in the water, among other substances as well, could
play a role, as well as lots of lead paint in homes, etc.

Mike,
       Am I mixed up and confused about Rumsfeld or what?  I live in an area 
that is only a few miles from his home (raised and still here) in addition he 
ran a company that isn't a mile from my house.  Heck, I have ran into him, 
been introduced and talked to him briefly -- the occasions were strictly 
incidental.
       I thought he was running one of the smaller drug companies.  He moved 
on from there but where to?  I do know that he was pulled in from time to 
time to work on various problems.  As an example I believe he was called in 
in the early 90s to advise when the Soviet melted down -- but I can't 
remember which administration was using him.  Perhaps both did so.
       I don't really run in those circles but I gather the government is 
forever pulling in individuals to make up mini blue ribbon groups to advice 
the government on this or that.  I had really thought his relationship to the 
government was an on going occasional thing.
       Can someone help me here??

### I can't help myself, have to quote this statement from the above
article:

"people who have been .... oppressed by the lack of government"

It's so surreal. Dan, are you reading this? It's not the government that
oppresses people, as those dumb anarchos claim, no, it's the absence of
government that's oppressive.

Well, when the government, which empowers the corporations, doesn't 
enforce it's own rules limiting the corporations oppressing the people, 
then the people are being oppressed by the lack of government.  True, 
the government caused the problem in the first place, but that doesn't 
affect the point.  Competing gangs of hoodlums are also worse than most 
governments.  And consider Cambodia during the Pot Pol era.  I don't 
know just how you want to classify that, but the people were certainly 
being oppressed by "no government".  One of the reasons for preferring 
min-archy.

The world is more diverse than you are imagining.  And it isn't all to 
the good.  Many children don't leave home either with, or having had, 
any food.  And not through choice.  Frequently their parents get home 
from work well after dark, and leave for work long before light.  And 
they still barely earn enough to pay the rent on the apartment that they 
share with two or three other families.  Denial of physical reality is 
not a useful approach.  (Many are worse off than that, but I don't 
personally know any of those people, so I can't speak of their situation.)

Just to be clear, the whole quote is "people...who have been beat down 
and oppressed by the lack of government services or supportive services 
to meet their needs here. But they've also been oppressed by their own 
minds and their own attitudes."

He didn't say "lack of government", he said "lack of government services 
or supportive services". Supportive services don't have to come from the 
big mean oppressive government.

What I'd find interesting with this game is to see if it's possible to
internalize the tactics well enough so that I can look at all the
cards first (without computing anything), and have the moves
unconsciously computed in my mind. It sorts of works, but not quite.

When I was in highschool translating Latin, for example, I would do
the same: read the whole sentence with attention (not understanding
anything, and not even trying), and then its meaning would come all
parsed in my conscious mind without much conscious effort. (And much
faster than if I tried to solve it only through conscious analysis.)

I wonder how the limits of what you can "delegate" to your unconscious
mind could be made more precise. Sort of growing "sensory
modalities"-like abilities for higher-level problems.

It'd be interesting to compare the performance you get at freecell if
you try to solve it the normal way, and if you do that but after
having had a (passive) look first at all the cards. How much does it
help? How can you train so that it helps more? (Of course as a game it
may be more fun to just stick with conscious calculation.)

 Why do you think your disagreement with Robin rests on something other
than values?
 The hypothesis that disagreements are caused by things like the desire
to show that one's prior beliefs were wise seems to explain a much wider
variety of phenomena than your hypothesis appears to. It predicts disagreements
such as the one between you and Robin (where as you seem to avoid analyzing
why such a debate didn't get resolved). It also explains results such as more
than 50% of people believing they are above average.
 Whereas it isn't clear to me that your hypothesis makes any prediction
about whether people will be objective.

I'm a moderate.

The most recent efficiency gains in government came under Clinton's 
watch in the efforts for efficiency in government, although the gains 
were unfortunately funneled into much pork.

Rumsfeld and Cheney were components of Bush' father's administration, or 
the administration of the eighties/early nineties, what-have you.  
However he gained office, in lacking the popular vote and the final 
popular vote tallies and most specific estimates from Florida in 2000, 
Bush' handlers are remarkably familiar.  Some people may have 
appreciated the renewed cabinet, some people didn't.

Many people plainly do not approve of the government trying to withhold 
information.

If you're talking about running the government like the private sector, 
let's call it a business and look at its balance sheet.  Let's say we 
look at its revenues and expenditures.  Revenues are down, and 
expenditures are up.  There is a lot of red ink.

In calling the late nineties stock market boom an epic paper hustle, 
it's possible to consider that the economy wasn't that great, but by all 
rights it should be better now than it was six or seven years ago.  It 
is, in many ways, growth continued at some realistic rate, but 
unfortunately the large-scale reallocations have lead to many 
hard-working, middle-class families whose primary retirement savings are 
in equities losing much of their stake.

In the late nineties and 2000 huge amounts of money was invested in the 
stock market, and now two year later the market is around 2/3 of what is 
was.  Some people, somewhere, sold stocks to those people who bought 
stocks, or whose primary personal savings non-risk-free investment 
vehicles held those stocks.  The money didn't evaporate, it changed 
hands.

Interesting. How would you account for so few black males in the 140+
cohort compared with black females (which is what I was talking about)?
Note that this point has little to do with B/W differences, and is all
about Bm/Bf scores--although the *causes* of Bm resistance to testing might
have a great deal to do with B/W issues and history etc.

Money.

1. Spam works.
2. People think it works.

Strictly speaking, UBE (unsolicited bulk e-mail, "spam") doesn't
actually have to work.  It suffices if you can find gullible customers
who pay you for sending the crap.  However, I'm inclined to believe
that some spam actually works.  It is very inexpensive per message,
and if you hit one sucker out of a 1000 targets, you'll make lots
of money.

I don't examine the spam I get too closely--and even if I wanted
to and figured out how to display it I still couldn't read a lot
of it because it is in languages I don't know--but my impression
is that a lot of it falls into one of these categories:

1. Ads for spam itself: address lists, spam sending programs.
   Clearly the fact that you just received this piece of spam proves
   that it works!  This probably impresses a few sales people who'll
   spend money to jump on this new and exciting marketing method--only
   to learn later on that it is also an excellent way to lose your
   Internet connectivity and destroy any good reputation you may
   have had.  I suspect that most of the more bizarre cases (such
   as a spam advertising industrial quantitites of sodium hydrosulfite)
   that don't fit any of the categories here originate that way.

2. Paid pornography.
   There always is a huge demand for porn.  I recently talked to a
   guy who earns some of his money doing the underlying tech work
   for porn pay sites, and he said the demand is enormous and the
   business is real good despite there being no shortage of free
   porn on the net.

3. Seedy products that claim to address various self-esteem and
   sexual dysfunction issues: baldness cures, shoes that make you
   look taller, potions against impotence, libido enhancers, growing
   your penis or breasts, weight loss pills, age reversal, you name
   it.  These have been around in the ad sections of pulp publications
   for decades which suggests that yes, there *is* a market for the
   "terminally lonely or stupid".

4. Outright fraud.
   Advertising any of the above, in particular porn, together with
   a simple dummy site is reputed to be an excellent way to collect
   credit card numbers from would-be customers.  I would expect the
   offenders not to abuse that information personally but to sell
   it at a commission, making it hard to prove a connection.  Then
   there is that Nigerian money scam, pyramid schemes, etc, all of
   which we have seen in the offline world for decades.

In summary, the spam flood is largely due to the combination of its
extreme cheapness for reaching large numbers of people and a multitude
of tried-and-true ways of preying on the gullible.

Suppose the genetic component of IQ is a vector of the 10-15,000 genes and
their alleles that apparently govern the brain's architecture and its
operations. There will be disorders and deficits due to mutations that
badly damage some of those genes, but most of those seem also to lead to
sterility. Now it's clear that families like the Huxleys and the Darwins
produce a much larger proportion of high IQ offspringen than JoeBob Gulch's
kids; modulo enriched vs. impoverished intellectual/cultural/nutritional
environment, I'd guess that these hypersmart families are indeed passing
along some closely linked genes that conduce to high IQ performance. But
regression to the mean arguments imply that such massively polygenic traits
as IQ keep getting remixed almost stochastically. IQ range between sibs in
a largish family seems to vary by 30 points or more. 

Consider: if there is a small number of `smartness genes', by now moieties
of humans would have separated into IQ `breeds' as distinctive as Lee
Corbin's puppydog breeds. I don't know how the mixing process works, but
Hans Eysenck, not known for his far-left views, was where I learned about
`regression to the mean' in IQ. As far as I can see, the correlation of
child and parent doesn't work to make ever brainer and ever stupider kids
in each generation via assortative mating; if that had happened, you
wouldn't just see the Flynn effect, you'd be living in a culture where the
top IQ had risen by a point a generation (or whatever) for the last 10,000
years at least. But maybe the effect saturates.

I'm guessing that it's the latter more than the former. Where spam differs
from biological viral or memetic or computer viral infection is that it
*doesn't* autoreplicate via its hosts. Someone--lots of someones--has to
pay to send this crap out in an endlessly renewed flood. I was hoping for
some more precise sense of how much it *does* cost a spammeister to blast
the world with **GROW YOUR DICK REALLY ENORMOUS AND MAKE BIG $$$$ AT

the in-box for BIG $$$$ from dupes, paying for the machine the @list is on,
for the connectivity, etc. Maybe it's so laughably cheap that 1000 people
or fewer around the world think, `Hey, why the hell not give this spamming
caper a go? Well, now that's done for the day I can go out back and bite
the head off another chicken.'

Ron how do we know that stress is the factor causing
the lifespan difference?  It is said that native
Hawaiian Islanders are cursed with an anomalously
short lifespan.  This appears consistent almost
without regard to the lifestyle: go-go American haoli

I dont know if this played a role in the particular
community I observed, but I was struck by the fact
that about half the population was blonde and blue
eyed.

Now that I think about that, why is it that
blondes have that reputation that we have?  Why is
it that there are no dumb redhead jokes?  Is it
because there were blondes on Iceland that
inbred for centuries?  Can someone explain why
blondes in particular, get the dumb rap?  Why
do we corner the market for ditzy?

Rafal, I definitely witnessed that.  There was
damn little in that isolated town to provide
intellectual stimulation.  But if one were to
drive about 70 miles to Springfield Missouri,
one could dine at the home of "throwed rolls."

Throwed rolls are served in this particular famous
restaurant called Lambert's.  My wife and I
were with my parents there, calmly talking when
FLUMP a goddamn bun landed right in the middle
of our table, having been hurled by one of the
waiters.  Having been thus startled by this
unexpected development, he then of course had our
full and undivided.  He pitched three more, which
we caught in our hands, a modicum more dignified
I suppose than being startled by the flying
bread.

In all fairness, the food at Lamberts was
excellent.

It was a trick.  A decoy.  The smugglers sent a
decoy uranium ingot to see if it would be intercepted.
It was, while the real one got thru and is currently
in the hands of terrorists.  Friends, we are hosed.  spike

New on Transhumanity (www.transhumanism.com): 
Letter - The Battle for Human Dignity, by James Hughes, October 2, 
2002. At some point in the 20th century progressives and civil 
libertarians lost the battle for the family... Now conservatives 
would like to claim "human dignity" and I object. Yes, "human 
dignity" may have little intrinsic meaning. Like "love" and "God," 
human dignity is usually verbal hand-waving deployed when people 
don't really know what they are trying to protect or assert. So why 
am I bothered by the conservative grab for "human dignity? "...

Hi,

I think a question might be "why is there so little spam".

There are a variety of good-faith "opt-in" mailing lists, which are 
often singular and will remove you on request.

I've gotten"as seen on..." HGH spam, Nigerian spams, some porn spams, 
username and Hello username spams, mortgage spams, pharmacy spams, and 
even spams of spam mailing lists.  I've received many more penis than 
breast enhancement spams.  I receive the Korean spams from one post.

Spam arrives from many fake and undeliverable e-mail addresses, yet it's 
remarkably homogenous.

Spam:  monopoly?

Mail server administrators throughout the Internet have been pressured 
heavily to close open e-mail relays.  When open relays are outlawed, 
only outlaws spam open relays, or plainly they use their own relays to 
get their own postmaster and abuse e-mail.  In a similar way that 
Prohibition led to organized criminal drug smuggling, the raising the 
bar of entry of e-mailing everybody leads to organized ____ spam 
consolidation.

Also, Napster was the front of music companies to establish ridiculous 
precedent.

Anyways, how do I send an e-mail to every e-mail address?  Do the 
platform-provided e-mail programs (Outlook, Communicator, Mail.app) each 
have default e-mail activated security holes?

Anyways, speaking of precedent, each one of those spams is good for five 
hundred dollars from the spammer if you can collect.

Peter asks

As I am not at all sure what you are asking about, I have

Okay, so I will (1) attempt to determine on what (if not
values) any disagreement I had with Robin rested, and (2)
why our debate allegedly never got resolved.

I originally wrote in
http://www.extropy.org/exi-lists/extropians.3Q01/3670.html

the following:

[Robin wrote]
>[Lee wrote]

[Lee responded]
That would only work if you had some confidence or faith in those 
who liked the other candidate. As an example, suppose that you 
do not believe in God, but wish to be as truth-seeking as possible. 
It does not follow that you should "move your beliefs in the direction 
of beliefs favored" by those who are religious. You may have concluded 
that they are simply out to lunch for some reason (explanation). 
However, I am interested in any other brief tricks that you may know of 
to assist one in being really truth-seeking. 
[end Lee's quote]

Robin replied

> If you realize your position on recounts may be biased because you favor Gore, 
> you can correct for that by moving your position on recounts in the other 
> direction, even if you don't change your position on Gore at all. 

Okay, Peter, so far I don't know exactly how you are thinking
that Robin and I disagree.  I could entertain hypotheses, but
if it's anything in the above so far, please help me focus on
what it is.

Now Robin's next paragraph was

> Of course I also want to argue that you should be very cautious in assuming 
> that people are out to lunch, and therefore hold uninformative opinions, 
> simply on the basis that they disagree with you on a particular point. Such 
> judgements, if made at all, should be based on a much wider consideration of

> you would look under such an analysis. 

and perhaps it's *this* that you think I disagree with.  You
are incorrect because I agree that one should be *very cautious*
in assuming that people are "out to lunch" simply on the basis
that they disagree with me about some key item.

However, you are *correct* in that I continue to hold that 
one should have *confidence* in the people that disagree
with one if one is to properly utilize Robin's trick of
simply moving your judgment towards theirs.  Such *anchoring*,
incidently, is a well-studied psychological phenomena as you
know.  (It's possible that Robin and I would continue to
disagree about this to this very day.)

So if I'm already in possession of some explanation as to why
certain people hold certain opinions (e.g., they were red-diaper
babies and believe that Chomsky is infallible, or that they
have a deep commitment to a personal relationship with their
alleged Creator), then I consider Robin's trick inapplicable,
even if it's pretty good to keep it in mind for other times.

However, you continue

> The hypothesis that disagreements are caused by things like the
> desire to show that one's prior beliefs were wise seems to explain
> a much wider variety of phenomena than your hypothesis appears to.

That sounds like a plausible explanation; our explanations
need not be mutually exclusive.  Some disagreements arise
out of people's loyalty to their past convictions (not an
irrational thing at all, incidentally).  Some disagreements,
especially ideological ones, I contend, rest on differing
values.  Some disagreements even rest on blatant errors by
one party or the other.

> It predicts disagreements such as the one between you and Robin.

Would you spell this out please?  In some sentence like, "Lee
and Robin disagreed because they were being loyal to their
past beliefs".  Or am I at the wrong level here, and you were
referring to why people disagreed (and disagree) about balloting
in Florida?

> It also explains results such as more than 50% of people
> believing they are above average.  Whereas it isn't clear
> to me that your hypothesis makes any prediction about

Sorry, I don't understand the context or referents of 
those remarks at all.

Well, this is the best I have time for right now
under the uncertain hypotheses of just what it is
that you are looking for.

Alejandro, you may have hit on something.  There are
so few humans that can currently beat the top software,
I can see a real market developing for the game scores
from those few cases where a human does manage to slay
the silicon beast.  I could see where ads might start
popping up:  "I slew Fritz7 with black under 2hr/40
time controls on a 3.7 GHz Pentium 5.  PayPal me 15 cents
and Ill post you the moves."

A new cottage industry is born.

Actually I suspect fewer and fewer top grandmasters
will post their scores against software in the public
domain, for they will realize the inherent value of these
scores and would want to sell them, or at least not
swamp the market with freebies.

spike

ps: the match starts tomorrow.  I suspect Kramnik will
win every game.  But I hope Fritz makes a good showing.

Okay, my first theory goes like this, and is
based on innumerable Untouchables, Tightrope,
and other gangster pictures from when I was 
eleven.  "Hey, toots, bring me a beer, will
ya?", says the hoodlum.  And in waltzes, with
hips swinging, naturally, a blonde.

So perhaps hoods preferred dumb blondes, and
they got more TV and movie exposure?  And of
course, we must never forget Marilyn.

Note that "dumb blond" jokes are about women,
exclusively, whereas jokes about Pollacks or
other people supposed to be dumb don't single
out the women.

Now I do admit that once while watching some
senior masters play speed chess it occurred
to me that there *might* be an correlation
between male hormone and dark complexion.  But
I am woefully ignorant here.  Moreover, just to
be throwing out more ideas, isn't it true that
the more people age the less light-complexioned
they become?  If so, then youth and ignorance
(dumbness) and blondness could all be correlated.

It could be Zipf's law: the major spammers spam so much that you tend to
get many copies of their mail, while the number of spams falls as
1/r^k as a function of rank. 

I think one way of dealing with spam is to salt their databases. See
http://orjan.nada.kth.se/members/byebye.html for an example of a script,
which generates a page that looks nice to a webcrawler, contains mailto:
links and links to more interesting pages filled with more addresses.
Having a database with a lot of useless addresses might not deter a
spammer, but if honeypots like this become common and diverse the number
of real addresses in the databases might become too small to be worth it,
and the small but finite costs of mega-spamming would make the practice
less lucrative.


In my planned third installment of my sf roleplaying trilogy, the Big
Disaster/singularity that occurs in the late 2060's will be known as the
"Spamocalypse". The combination of wild AI, oceans of nanotechnology and
unsolicited mail is a frightening combination.

I don't put much stock in descriptions like "absolute gentleman" (I'm not
even certain what that means).  Ted Bundy was often described as a
"gentleman" - his polite demeanor even helped him gain the trust of his
unsuspecting victims.  Don't get me wrong, for I'm all for being polite and
thoughtful - but that's just one part of the whole package (e.g., there are
many wolves in sheep's clothing, or else decked out in Grandma's nightgown
and spectacles).  I can think of many people whom I consider to be a "credit
to [their] country" - but what has Clarence Thomas done (besides add two new
phrases to our vocabulary - one which you note above, and the other being:
"Long John Silver")?  Can we at least agree that he's no Thurgood Marshall?

> As I listened to those hearings over a period of several days it
became apparent what Clarence Thomas' sin was and is -- he got off the
plantation and built his own life without being beholden to any of those
that thought they owned him.


You really don't think Thomas feels beholden to the Republicans?  Observe:
"The question never has been who Thomas is, but what he has done and how he
got into a position to do it. Those are matters Thomas declines to explore,
for a very good reason: he may not consider himself an intellectual slave,
but he has been lavishly rewarded for serving a particular political master.
He has never made a serious attempt to engage his black opponents in a
serious debate about his ideas. He owes his meteoric rise exclusively to the
patronage of conservative white Republicans with little interest in racial
equality." [-- Time National Correspondent Jack E. White in a piece
subtitled "Clarence Thomas has a master: the right wing," August 10, 1998.]

> I will always admire that man for being able to face that mob day after
day, never giving an inch, answering every charge no matter how transparent,
and never acting any less than a complete gentleman.


Thomas may have been a "complete gentleman," but I would have thought a lot
more of him had he not been so loutish as to deny others the benefits of
affirmative action, even while being a benefactor of affirmative action
himself (which received benefits, of course, he opportunistically played
down).  BTW I'm all for affirmative action for *poor* and disadvantaged
people of all "races," and for both sexes.

> I cannot sit silently and hear the good name of a person such as Clarence
Thomas trashed.


On the other hand, sitting silently is something Clarence Thomas does very
well indeed!  ;-)

> BTW, now that I have answered the comments about Clarence Thomas what does
that have to do with Dr. Sowell's column on IQ?


I veered off from Sowell's article to talk about "black" conservatives -
Sowell made me think of Thomas made me think of Watts (and Watts' father's
great quote).

Okay, so *you* may be an ethnic, and see the world 
through ethnic-colored lenses.  I have known Armenians,
and Jews, and Irish who identify with their ethnic
group to the same extent that proud old southerners
would sometimes identify with their families, or
the way a Hatfield would identify with the Hatfields,
and a McCoy with the McCoys.

But why on Earth would anyone *identify* with a
racial group?  Maybe it's the same thing, but I
just can't quite get my mind around it.  I can
no more identify with being white than I can with
being from Silicon Valley---both these things seem to 
have just happened to me.  Now if I had played any
role whatsoever in the electronics industry of 
this area, then I might indeed be *proud* of what
I'd done, and *proud* of what this area has 
accomplished.

But I *seriously* suggest that identification with
one's race is a very unfortunate tendency and one
should combat it.

I agree up to the last couple of sentences.  I have some 
reason to believe that my lack of religiosity is in part
genetic.  It wouldn't surprise me if some people are born
egalitarians:  the parts of their brains that get a warm
fuzzy by feeling that everyone is equal may have had a
genetic tendency to do so.  On the other hand, perhaps
some people with inborn authoritarian personalities
would naturally be attracted to racism, as a way of 
giving vent to their egotistic feelings of superiority.

Yes, as has been pointed out several times, our human
civilization has been lucky in that the dividing line
between human and non-human has been so clean (probably
only because we are such a young species).

Hmm.  On the other hand, philosophy might be more
developed than it is if we had had to contend with
the vastly more difficult issues that would have 
stemmed from there being a continuum!

People spam because spam is cheap, $ and timewise.

The best way to make it go away would be to make it expensive.

I propose a campaign to get rid of spam:

- Campaigners must simply reply to the spam as an interested customer. Ring
on the phone, send a letter, do anything that you can (short of paying cash)
to interact with a spammer that costs them time. Be persistent, find
whatever method you can. Play the nice gullible customer, and lead them on.
- After the maximum possible lead on time, drop the ruse and tell them to go
*##%$#% themselves, if you wish.

The idea is, en-masse, faked up genuine looking replies should really cost
spammers a huge amount. Simply fill their lives with crap. If spam become
expensive, they'll stop using it.

That sounds like a nice job for a Lisa-like bot.

Wouldn't it just be hillarious if spammers had to spend all their time 
doing the turing test.

Hmmm ... I could shurely need another button in my Mozilla email 
programme. Instead of "Reply" or "Trash" it should be called "Let Liza 
Reply".

We were talking hillbillies. Typical hillbillies are obese, not 
malnourished. Certainly suboptimal food composition, but getting enough 
joules.

Sure, there might be several million people in the cities who're 
malnourished.

### Competing gangs of hoodlums are governments, except in name, at least
until one of them beats down the others (as in Cambodia). Then you have a
gang of hoodlums without competition, and these usually call themselves
"government".

But quibbling aside, I am minarchist, too.

### Yes, there is. Women are about 3 to 4 % lighter-skinned than men of the
same ethnic group. It is hypothesized that this difference is due to women's
higher need for vitamin D during pregnancy.

Olga,
       "Absolute Gentleman" refers to Clarence Thomas' ability to not only be 
polite and have the polished manners of a gentleman but that he could also 
exhibit strength, intelligence, and all the virtues that a human should 
possess through good times and bad.  In comparing him to Ted Bundy you only 
proved you truly do not know what the phrase means.  That is too bad, I only 
wish there had been more absolute gentlemen in your life that you might have 
learned to recognize them.
       "Can we at least agree that he's no Thurgood Marshall?"  As far as I 
ever heard publicly Thurgood Marshall stayed strictly within the confines of 
the civil rights movement in conduct and advocacy.  Had Clarence Thomas done 
so also he would probably had a distinguished career according to the views 
of that segment of the political spectrum.  Instead Justice Thomas found his 
own path.  He owes no one, But more importantly no one can demand that he 
stick to the party line.   And, for that he is hated.

       You said, "You really don't think Thomas feels beholden to the 
Republicans?  Observe: "The question never has been who Thomas is, but what 
he has done and how he got into a position to do it."
       No, I don't think he feels beholden to the Republicans and more that 
Thurgood Marshall did to the Dems -- even less perhaps, how am I to search 
the soul of Thurgood Marshall?
       But the real problem here is that "The question never has been who 
Thomas is, but what he has done and how he got into a position to do it." has 
never been the question.  Had there been an honest inquiry into his view of 
the law that would have been great.  I think he would have passed the test 
but as it never happened there is no way to be sure.  I think his detractors 
missed a great chance to show they were people of stature but instead they 
set out Bork Justice Thomas.  I sat there day after day watching his 
detractors slip out of the room when they were not questioning, when they 
returned and began questioning their questions betrayed their ignorance of 
what had just been going on in the committee room.  In fact they sounded like 
they were all sticking strictly to the same sheet of talking points without 
responding to the testimony of anyone.  That is too bad but I retain a sense 
of a great opportunity having been missed.
       You said, "But I would have thought a lot more of him had he not been 
so loutish as to deny others the benefits of affirmative action, even while 
being a benefactor of affirmative action himself"
       I think Justice Thomas is a man that would have made it in almost any 
context.  Other than the moral fiber to be a "complete gentleman," his 
appearance suggests superior physical strength but above all he has an 
overwhelming intelligence.  Part of his success in that committee room was 
that his intellectual & moral stature reduced his detractors to appearing as 
pygmies.
       There is an attitude among lawyers that I have heard lawyers express 
more than once.  They say that when an opposing witness really seems to know 
what they are saying the proper response is to get them off the stand as soon 
as possible.  That opposing witness, if you continue to question them, will 
continue to hurt you more and more the longer they are on the stand.  I think 
that is the mistake his detractors made about Justice Thomas.  If I were out 
to detract from him I would immediately shut up and get him out of the public 
eye insofar as I could.  The more he is on the public stage the more he is 
going to impress people.

It does. You're using other resources on the network to occupy your 
message. You're paying to have the spam delivered to you, and you pay for 
the hardware to make it reach your eyeballs, and you have to invest into 
immune systems to block spam.

It is very much like a virus. You could, of course, create a true
worm/virus the message is the medium spam that sends on itself to the
addressbook via the usual Microsoft Outlook vulnerabilities, but this
hasn't been done yet.

The low end software is cheap. I don't know how effective it is, but you,

There are broad ranges of phenotypes into which individuals fall.  For 
typing that I search the Internet for the word "phenotype" to check my 
usage.  Merriam-Webster says phenotype is "the visible properties of an 
organism that are produced by the interaction of the genotype and the 
environment."

I'm black, yo.  Sorry, that was a little joke.  Anyways, now I was 
rambling sentences about how to some people there's "blacks" and 
"whites" and variously "Asians", "Indians", "Indians", and sometimes 
"Jews", "Italians", and "Greeks", et alia, "Turks", "Arabs", "Persians", 
"Swedes", "Commies", "Mongols", "Germans", "Francs", "Egyptians", 
"Anglos", "Hispanics", then I was going to use the term "veritable 
panoply."

I'm a medium body brown hair/ medium dark brown eyes basically 
Anglo-American, male.  Sometimes I get blond whiskers and hair that 
changes from brown to silver grey and back, when I was a child my hair 
had lighter color.

Most people ever exposed to many races have a racial identification, 
and/or racial identifications.

Also, many people hold racial identifications of others, the more 
different the more directly.  Oftentimes when an Anglo walks into a room 
of blacks, Asians, or Hispanics, he's the white guy, when he goes home, 
he's not.

Isolated cultures often generally referred to themselves as "people" or 
with geographic identification.  The last isolated cultures may have 
been in the Phliippines and the Amazon rain forest.

There are blacks, but there are also many kinds of blacks, with black 
people being negroids originating from Africa, with activated melanin 
and frizzy hair, and mostly brown eyes.  The skin under a black person's 
fingernails is white, to check a black person's skin tone in medical 
diagnostics.  Within that broad phenotype, representing all the tribes 
of Africa, there are some quite varying differences among peoples of 
differing origin, from tall to short and big to small and slow to fast.

There are whites, of intermediate north, west, and south and east 
European origin, with skin color varying from basically light brown to 
pink to white, hair varying in texture and color from blonde to black 
and with red, and eye color being brown, green, blue, gray, or the 
changing color.  Again, wide variations exist.

Asians, East Asians, Chinese, Koreans, Mongols, and Japanese have an 
epicanthic fold, straight brown hair, and mostly brown eyes.  As well, 
wide variations exist.

Asian Indians and Persians often are dark-skinned with dark wavy hair, 
with brown eyes and more green eyes than East Asians.

Those are three broad classes and are not meant to give short shrift to 
people overall not of those classifications.

I borrowed the book from the library today, here I will take a look at 
it:  "The Bell Curve:  Intelligence and Class Structure in American 
Life", by Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray, The Free Press, a 
division of Simon sand Schuster Inc., New York, NY, 1994.  It opens 
after the dedication with a quote, whatever the quote before the 
contents is, by Edmund Burke, er, about a "Discussion of popular 
Prejudices", from "A Vindication of Natural Society"  The contents list 
four parts of four, eight, four, and six chapters, and then seven 
appendices, "The Emergence of a Cognitive Elite", "Cognitive Class and 
Social Behavior", "The National Context", and "Living Together".  Four 
chapter titles reflect topicality of ethnic and implicitly racial 
differences, chapters 13 and 14 in part three about ethnic differences 
and chapters 19 and 20 in part four referencing affirmative action, 
implying those as central topics.  Following the contents is the list of 
illustrations denoting diagrams in terms of white, black, Latino and one 
note of Asian individuals vis-a-vis income, employment, education, IQ, 
marital, and family status.  The following list of tables has table 
titles reflecting further data of the differences between and within the 
ethnic groups.  Following that is "A Note to the Reader", it declares 
the book to be simple to read, closing a note with a basically theistic 
reference about using the masculine pronoun.  The preface then reflects 
the quote in saying that the book would be about racial differences, "so 
sensitive that hardly anyone writes or talks about them in public."  The 
acknowledgments claim the author's affiliations as Harvard and the 
"American Enterprise Institute", forty or fifty individuals and their 
wives.  The introduction thus follows and starts:

That the word "intelligence" describes something real and that it varies 
from person to person is as universal and ancient as any understanding 
about the state of being human.  (Herrnstein and Murray, page 1)

Damn Masons.  Heh.  It goes on to talk about measurement of intelligence 
and says that a cousin of Darwin, a Francis Galton, discussed 
differences in intelligence in a paper "Hereditary Genius" that the 
authors claim began the consideration of the difference among families 
in intelligence.  That seems ridiculous for Galton to have originated 
the concept when the authors were just saying that differences in 
inteliigence were noted by ancient cultures, like the English guy who 
discovered blood flowed through veins in the eighteenth or nineteenth 
century, when it was well-known.  Quoth:

Galton realized that he need a precise, quantitative measure of the 
mental qualities he was trying to analyze, and thus he was led to put 
into formal terms what most people had always taken for granted:  People 
vary in their intellectual abilities and the differences matter, to them 
personally and to society. ^2 (Herrnstein and Murray, page 2)

The notation refers to a note in the notes following the appendices 
referring to an item in the following bibliography comprised of 
approximately 750 bibliography entries.

Galton recognized the uniqueness of intellectual ability among people, 
and so set about to derive a test to determine quantifications and 
qualifications, measure.  Galton measured dexterity in reflexes, Rich 
and Chuck note  "His tests failed, but others followed where Galton had 
led." (Page 2).  Galton's successor Alfred Binet brought forward 
questions of a person's ablity to reason, draw analogies, and identify 
patterns.  Parallelizing analogies is a form of identifying patterns 
with as well subject knowledge.  One type of IQ test inuse today is the 
"Stanford-Binet".

Anyway the first part of the book is about quantifying and qualifying 
intelligence and then it goes on, it rapidly bores yet is readable and 
not overly dry.

There's a continuum between any two distinct points, a continuum of 
points, in space-time.

Yes.
But don't forget that any clever spammer will not waste their own
connectivity and time delivering messages.  Instead, they'll pipe
them to open relays which will bear the brunt and thus the expense
of actually delivering the spam to the collected addresses.  Note
that a good many spammers don't bother to do even the most rudimentary
targeting.  I mean, it shouldn't take a genius to figure out that
sending spam in, say, Korean to my German address (.de) is pointless,
but apparently just dumping it to random addresses is cheaper than
doing even the most basic pre-selection.

Drying out the open relays has proved to be difficult.  The very
reason machines serve as open relays in the first place is that
their maintainers are either incompetent or don't care, and obviously
you will run into that when you tell them about the problem.  Yes,
abusing an open relay is probably some form of theft in many
jurisdictions, but that doesn't help if the victims don't initiate
legal action, and besides it's a petty crime that nobody will bother
to prosecute across national borders.

A computer and internet access.  How much does that cost?  Not much.
And you don't necessarily need a commercial E1 pipe.  If you exploit
relays, simple dial-up access is probably sufficient.  At least it
makes a good start.

### I searched the PsycINFO database for information on this phenomenon but
I failed to find any articles specifically describing it, except for a brief
mention here: Homogenously grouped urban gifted African-American and
Caucasian secondary students: A longitudinal study.Dissertation Abstracts
International: Section B: the Sciences & Engineering. Vol 62(3-B), Sep 2001,
1621, US: Univ Microfilms International. (see full abstract below).
Unfortunately the study is not available online. I perused about 30
abstracts pertinent to gender differences, Blacks, and gifted students. All
of them used gender-balanced samples, none mentioned any significant gender
difference. I would be inclined to treat Sowell's report with caution -
after all, in the article we read he describes an observation he made but
not a full scientific study, with the needed statistical significance
analysis.

Should the gifted male/female difference be real, this would be indeed quite
difficult to explain. According to the following article:

Steele, C. M. (1997). A threat in the air: How stereotypes shape
intellectual identity and performance. American Psychologist, 52, 613-629

, there is a significant framing effect on IQ test performance in both
Blacks and females (any race), which lowers their test scores. This is taken
to be evidence of the influence of stereotypes on IQ performance, and
possibly actual IQ. If you are both female and Black, you are exposed to a
double whammy of stereotype, so one might expect there would be *fewer*
gifted Black females.

This seems to be an even more convoluted and under-researched subject than
straight group comparisons.

By the way, here is a section from the APA report on the Bell Curve,
regarding test bias against Blacks:

3. Neisser, Ulric; Boodoo, Gwyneth; Bouchard, Thomas J. Jr; Boykin, A. Wade;
Brody, Nathan; Ceci, Stephen J; Halpern, Diane F; Loehlin, John C; Perloff,
Robert; Sternberg, Robert J; Urbina, Susana. Intelligence: Knowns and
unknowns. [Journal Article] American Psychologist. Vol 51(2) Feb 1996,
77-101. American Psychological Assn, US,

Test bias.
It is often argued that the lower mean scores of African Americans reflect a
bias in the intelligence tests themselves. This argument is right in one
sense of "bias" but wrong in another. To see the first of these, consider
how the term is used in probability theory. When a coin comes up heads
consistently for any reason it is said to be "biased," regardless of any
consequences that the outcome may or may not have. In this sense the
Black/White score differential is ipso facto evidence of what may be called
"outcome bias." African Americans are subject to outcome bias not only with
respect to tests but along many dimensions of American life. They have the
short end of nearly every stick: average income, representation in
high-level occupations, health and health care, death rate, confrontations
with the legal system, and so on. With this situation in mind, some critics
regard the test score differential as just another example of a pervasive
outcome bias that characterizes our society as a whole (Jackson, 1975;
Mercer, 1984). Although there is a sense in which they are right, this
critique ignores the particular social purpose that tests are designed to
serve.

>From an educational point of view, the chief function of mental tests is as
predictors (Section 2). Intelligence tests predict school performance fairly
well, at least in American schools as they are now constituted. Similarly,
achievement tests are fairly good predictors of performance in college and
postgraduate settings. Considered in this light, the relevant question is
whether the tests have a "predictive bias" against Blacks. Such a bias would
exist if African American performance on the criterion variables (school
achievement, college GPA, etc.) were systematically higher than the same
subjects' test scores would predict. This is not the case. The actual
regression lines (which show the mean criterion performance for individuals
who got various scores on the predictor) for Blacks do not lie above those
for Whites; there is even a slight tendency in the other direction (Jensen,
1980; Reynolds & Brown, 1984). Considered as predictors of future
performance, the tests do not seem to be biased against African Americans.



Here is the abstract I mentioned above:
Rose, Elizabeth Ann, Homogenously grouped urban gifted African-American and
Caucasian secondary students: A longitudinal study. Dissertation Abstracts
International: Section B: the Sciences & Engineering. Vol 62(3-B), Sep 2001,
1621, US: Univ Microfilms International.

Abstract
The breadth of this longitudinal study provides rich information about the
risks and unique experience of being a gifted urban and minority student. It
addresses the gap in research concerning the characteristics and programming
needs of this often under-identified and underserved group. The issue of
appropriate and effective academic program format is examined for a group of
185 identified urban and minority-gifted students (110 of whom were
African-American) placed in self-contained elementary and secondary gifted
programs and followed throughout their school career. An 102 student
general-education student comparison group included 62 African-Americans.
The qualitative component includes 13 students chosen to be interviewed
according to whether they remained or left the program, their gender, race,
and household income. The relationship of graduation outcomes to length of
stay, poverty status, and placement in twelfth grade was analyzed, as well
as the relationship of selected demographic, home, social and school
variables, and pertinent stress factors, to the outcomes of remaining in the
gifted program and graduating. The school district implemented a very
comprehensive identification procedure, which is described herein,
successfully identifying gifted children in early elementary. The majority
of students were identified for the gifted program before third grade,
making the question of longitudinal effects of length of stay in a
self-contained gifted program an appropriate inquiry about this group. One
of the most important results was the high graduation rate for the
identified gifted students who remained in the gifted program. Their
graduation rate of 98.6% makes them far more likely to graduate than both
their gifted counterparts who left the program and their general-education
peers. The graduation rate was 77% for gifted students who left the program
to enroll in general education, a lower rate than the 79% graduation rate
for general-education students. Therefore, remaining in the gifted program
did increase a gifted student's chances of graduating from high school. This
suggests that urban and minority gifted students are more at risk for
academic failure within a general-education setting than within a gifted
setting. There was a focus on outcomes for those who lived in poor
neighborhoods in early elementary, compared to those who lived in middle
class neighborhoods. The gifted program did have greater holding power for
African-American students compared to Caucasians, also differences between
outcomes for African-American females and males were found. Reasons for
these results such as social and peer-group pressures were explored within
the quantitative and the qualitative components of the study. (PsycINFO

Last year, I was walking my dad's dog, Jet, we were walking the dogs 
around the park's jogging track, in about 25 degrees Fahrenheit, snow on 
the ground.  I let the dog and it started to run, I ran with it, I got a 
Jet assist.  It was running, the leash was slack.  I ran the fastest 
sprint I've ever seen live, the hard part is putting your foot back on 
the ground.  I was wearing a pair of Adidas Response adiPRENE Torsion 
Traxion, they're heavy shoes.  The Response TR is a lighter shoe.  I 
also wear Nike and New Balance running shoes, Allen Edmonds.  I've 
driven a rental tour bicycle across a hundred yards of slick knobby 
ice.  Small feats, good memories.

I know some people who wear nice shoes.  It helps to have good shoes to 
run, but I started distance running in leather sandals with a minute and 
a half quarter mile.  Later I got some nice shoes.

I'm not a good fisherman, cleaning all the fish caught used to gross me 
out.

### Regression to the mean is a natural by-product of recombination of
recessive traits - the super-smart are so smart because they have the luck
of being homozygous for some IQ-enhancing recessive genes, but for any
single person the exact combination of such genes is likely to be different
than in their super-smart mate. As a result, the offspring will be
heterozygous for many of the traits that made their parents super smart, and
the IQ will be on average lower than the parent IQ.

E.g.
Pat AAbBCCdd x mat aaBBcCDD will produce offspring aAbBcCdD, aABBcCdD,
aAbBCCdD, aABBCCdD. Capitals denote the alleles which if homozygous will
increase IQ. Only one of the filial genotypes will have a combination of two
homozygous high IQ alleles (=same as parents). You do not need a large
number of loci for this effect to be apparent.

The argument for the dysgenic effect of high-IQ emigration on the remaining
population is however independent of the above - if you kill the smartest
25% of the population (or remove them from the group by emigration), the
frequency of high-IQ alleles will be lower. In the example above, try to see
the frequency of F2 (second-generation filial) and subsequent generation
phenotypes from the matings between the first three genotypes (the fourth
moved to Palo Alto). A phenotype will depend on the total number of
homozygous capitals - you will get some phenotypes smarter than the paternal
generation but the overall frequency of high-IQ will be lower with each
generation where you remove the top achiever.

OK.  But since blonde is a recessive characteristic, I expect those 
manifesting the characteristic to become increasingly rare (unless you can 
demonstrate some positive selection pressure?  Perhaps "Gentlemen prefer 
blonds?")

A population to test this hypothesis would be younger generation Cambodians.
I wonder if there exists anything remotely like reliable pre-Khmer Rouge
data on IQ? I googled for any studies like this but came up empty.

Does this scream out "negative feedback loop" to anyone else? If kids have
any idea of their test scores, that's not going to help the low scorers do
well. Also, a school system which thinks it has a predictor of someone's
performance is going to act, purposely or accidentally, to support that
prediction; eg, by putting people in graded classes, or directing resources
to those who can best use them (in the school's opinion). So there is the
possibility that inaccurate, biased tests could shape the behaviour of
institutions which in turn produce kids to the specifications of the
testing. A self fulfilling prophecy?

For those following the 15kg or 100g or no uranium
seized, I offer the following scenario:

A top crime boss suspects a mole in the organization;
calls in, one at a time, the top three most trusted
henchhumans.  She tells Alice the uranium is to be
delivered by airplane.  She tells Bob the uranium
is to be delivered by bus.  She tells Charlie the
uranium is to be delivered by cab.  She makes up
three leaden decoys, sends each.

The decoy in the cab is intercepted after the
authorities are tipped off. the other two are
delivered.  She calls in a hithuman, Charlie
disappears, the next day the real uranium is
delivered by air or by bus.

I would say the capture of the decoy is newsworthy.

Thanks much for that explanation.  I had always supposed
that it was entirely an environmental effect.  Say one had,
hypothetically, a collection of giraffes and decided to
perform some eugenic experiments to maximize neck length.
We can readily suppose that although (perhaps) predominantly
determined by genes, environment still can play a significant
role.  Some giraffes, for example, will by luck have a superior
intra-uterine environment in which to develop, and by chance
receive extra nutrition or exercise at the most fortuitous moments.

To clinch that argument, suppose that all the giraffes of my 
example were identical twins or clones, and that *all* the
variation in height was due to environment.  One would certainly
expect, then, that regression towards the mean via my mechanism
would ensue.

Therefore, much as I appreciate your argument, (and as much as it
is very provocative mathematically), I still contend that regression
to the mean also obtains from environmental effects.

This is so obvious that I want to engage in speculations as
to *why* people so resist the notion that one could in 
principle breed for intelligence in laboratory mice, in
dogs, or in humans.  And just as certainly, one could 
breed for stupidity, which could also occur naturally as
in Spike's example of small towns which, hypothetically,
lose their most intelligent people in each generation but
don't lose any of their least intelligent people.

So your F2 will obtain from every combination of mating
between

      aAbBcCdD
	aABBcCdD
	aAbBCCdD
	aABBCCdD

which you obtained easily from your original AAbBCCdd x aaBBcCDD.
So your F2 will obtain from every combination of mating between
them.  Here is what I think the F2 look like.

   aAbBcCdD  x  aAbBcCdD   =   aabbccdd   aAbBcCdD   aAbBcCdD  AABBCCDD
                aABBcCdD   =   aabBccdd   aAbBcCdD   aABBcCdD  AABBCCDD
                aAbBCCdD   =   aabbcCdd   aAbBcCdD   aAbBCCdD  AABBCCDD
                aABBCCdD   =   aabBcCdd   aAbBcCdD   aABBCCdD  AABBCCDD

   aABBcCdD  x  aAbBcCdD   =   aaBbccdd   aABBcCdD   aAbBcCdD  AABBCCDD
                aABBcCdD   =   aaBBccdd   aABBcCdD   aABBcCdD  AABBCCDD
                aAbBCCdD   =   aaBbcCdd   aABBcCdD   aAbBCCdD  AABBCCDD
                aABBCCdD   =   aaBBcCdd   aAbBBCdD   aABBCCdD  AABBCCDD

   aAbBCCdD  x  aAbBcCdD   =   aabbCcdd   aAbBCCdD   aAbBCCdD  AABBCCDD
                aABBcCdD   =   aabBCcdd   aAbBCCdD   aABBCCdD  AABBCCDD
                aAbBCCdD   =   aabbCCdd   aAbBCCdD   aAbBCCdD  AABBCCDD
                aABBCCdD   =   aabBCCdd   aAbBCCdD   aABBCCdD  AABBCCDD

   aABBCCdD  x  aAbBcCdD   =   aaBbCcdd   aABBCCdD   aAbBCCdD  AABBCCDD
                aABBcCdD   =   aaBBCcdd   aABBCCdD   aABBCCdD  AABBCCDD
                aAbBCCdD   =   aaBbCCdd   aABBCCdD   aAbBCCdD  AABBCCDD
                aABBCCdD   =   aaBBCCdd   aABBCCdD   aABBCCdD  AABBCCDD

Is it really so simple as this, or have I made a conceptual error
here?  It's rather astonishing that 1/4 of the entire F2 is
radically "smarter" than their grandparents, but, perhaps not,
given the original distribution of capital letters.  One also
easily sees that if the right-most three columns left town,
a lot of good genes would go with them.

Yes and no. As isolated populations of homozygotes for the blond allele
interbreed with mixed populations, the number of blonds will initially
fall as the allele is masked by dominant alleles. But eventually a steady
state will be reached, where the allele occurs in a proportion p of the
population, and p^2 will be blonde. I don't have seen any good estimate
of p, but a quick look at random people images on Google gave me the
impression that around 1/8 or less are blonde today. That would imply a
prevalence of the gene of 0.35 in the (mostly American) population.

According to my copy of Cavalli-Sforza's book about human population
genetics there is also a slight tendency for people to mate with people
of similar hair color, but the correlation is just 0.24. 


But honestly, who cares? We can always fix it.

I believe I can see some problems with this (which should
smartness-conducive genes all be *recessive*, for example, which you seem
to imply?).

More generally, if the IQ population mean is 100, sigma 15, and correlation
of parent and child is about 0.5, then I suppose the argument is that in
our world stupid parents of 70 IQ will tend to have kids with IQ 100 - 30/2
= 85, and their kids will have kids with IQ 92.5, all the way back up to mu
= 100... But if the IQ pool of the braindrained town is going down due to
leaching, I guess you're saying the breeding pool mean is no longer 100. Or
is it? All those alleles lurking in all those people... I'm out of my
depth, as you see, but interested.

Rafel,
       It turns out that the column I referred the list to, by Dr. Sowell, 
was the first column in a series of three.  
       His third column is just out and he deals with this phenonmenon of 
differences in IQ amongst different ethnic groups.  In my opinion he does so 
very effectively.
       In fact, now that he has jogged my memory, I believe the same sort of 
material is in TBC but that it isn't as pointed in its conclusions as Dr. 
Sowell.  Or perhaps my reaction is due to my having seen that same position 
for the second time now.

### This might be pretty difficult to standardize - I would expect there to
be significant differences in nutritional status histories between various
age cohorts in Cambodia, which could confound the analysis. The pre-Polpot
cohort is likely to have had good nutrition (Cambodia was at that time the
richest country in Southeast Asia, I was told), the Killing Fields
generation was starving during childhood, and the youngest groups again are
eating well (and have video games for stimulation, too).

### Regression to the mean would occur also in a system with exclusively
dominant traits but the illustration is a bit more difficult - you would
need to postulate a larger number of loci, too difficult to put in an
example, sorry I didn't mention it. Yes, you  are right, the smartness genes
do not need to be recessive.

### You got it just right - the regression is to the mean of the
*remaining*, not the initial population. E.g. if you remove persons above IQ
100, the IQ of the breeding population will drop to 89.88 (see
http://www.psychstat.smsu.edu/introbook/normal.htm for the calculation
applet), and the regression will be towards 89.88, for both the remaining
parents with IQ 100 and the ones below 89.88.

It is, however, a complex trait rather than a simple trait.  There is no 
reason to believe that all "smartness enhancing" genes are mutually 
reinforcing, and considerable reason to disbelieve that.  There are 
occasional individuals who have exceptionally fortuitous combinations 
and can, for example, have both an eidetic memory and the ability to use 
it properly, but those are rare enough that eidetic memory is more 
commonly associated with stupidity than with intelligence, though no one 
denies that an exceptionally good memory facilitates intelligence. 
 Further, most musicians would be hampered by absolute pitch.  (My wife, 
a music teacher, insists both that it is possible to develop in anyone 
with a reasonably good ear, and that it is generally more of a 
hinderance than an asset.)  But some musicians make notable use of this 
facility.  Excellent is a marvellous facilitator of intelligence, but 
hearing verbal sounds can be a real hinderance when one is working on 
any formal problem.  Etc.

These are just a selection from the characteristics that I am 
consciously aware of.  I'm reasonably sure that the equivalents exist at 
all levels down to chemical interactions.  And that the effects from one 
level are compounded onto the effects from the others.  (I.e., that no 
one level is dominant.)  But this needs proof, if anyone can think of how.

Remember that biologic systems are the result of eons of evolution, and 
even simple evolutionary processes (as exemplified by genetic computer 
programs or electronic circuits) frequently exhibit interactions that we 
can't explain.  (In one circuit a hypothesis is that certain isolated 
pieces enable the remainder of the circuit to work either by capacitive 
interaction, or possibly via radio interferrence [no radio waves were 
detected .. this was an explanation from desperation].)

Genes are a simplified model that we use to understand living systems. 
 Don't confuse them with reality.  They are an abstraction from reality. 
  Useful, but not true.  (Just start considering all of the ways that we 
now know that the "Central Dogma" is violated.  And each one of them is 
a violation of the way that genes are popularly/were originally defined.)

### Oops, here we are in difficult terrain. In the most general formulation,
regression to the mean is a feature of all quantitative traits determined by
a large number of independent influences, whether genetic (recessive,
dominant and codominant) or environmental. It will occur in a population of
genetically identical clones reproducing asexually, in genetically
heterogeneous populations in the most stringently controlled standardized
environment, and in traits whose variance is 100% stochastic. The only case
where it will fail to keep the population homogenous is when there is
assortative mating and/or reproductive isolation of some kind, in other
words, when the requirements for speciation are met. I mentioned recessive
traits because they are easier to illustrate (by the way, thanks for working
out the genotypes), and because from other sources we know that in the
specific case of IQ most of the variance in most modern populations is due
to genetic factors. But see below.

### You are partially right but the case with IQ is more complicated. If
indeed regression to the mean in IQ was caused by environmental factors,
then you would have to conclude that the environment provided by poor
parents increases intelligence (since poor parents are frequently low IQ,
the regression would be upwards), while the environment provided by rich
(and frequently smart) parents results in a loss of IQ. This is not
impossible, but unlikely.

This is why regression to the mean is by itself neither an argument for nor
against any IQ hypotheses - it fits in all models.

### Yes, you are right, I did some simplifying in my previous post. I like
the fact that you and Damien caught all that, and called me on it.

I think this is a good essay by James Hughes, but IMO it overlooks an
important point:

It seems to me that it wasn't so much that conservatives took over the
word, but that liberals abandoned it.  Liberals did not defend family
values.  They did not use the rhetoric of protecting the family.

Part of the reason, I think, is that an important element of the
conservative program was to give more power to families to make decisions
about child rearing and similar issues, and less power to the state (of
course with abortion being a major exception).  But liberals have never
been comfortable defending the rights of individuals over the rights
of the collective.  Fighting for families often means fighting against
the attempts by the rest of society to control what families can do.
Liberals abandoned the rhetoric of defending the family because it
amounted to opposing socialistic government control, in opposition to
their ideology.

So I disagree to some extent with James' diagnosis of this old problem,
and so I have a different spin on the new problem of who gets to use
the rhetoric of defending human dignity.

I agree in principle that people on all sides of the ideological
barricades can and should support human dignity.  The problem is that
in many cases this is going to amount to the same battle, that of the
individual versus the state.  Human dignity should mean giving humans
the rights to conduct their lives with dignity *by their own lights*.
It should mean that people are not slaves, are not forced to act in
accordance with some other person's decrees about what is dignified and
what is not.

What I see happening is that this time, it is conservatives who are
starting out on the wrong side of this issue.  It is they who are
supporting the state and society, in opposition to supporting the
rights and empowerment of the individual.  Conservatives want to set
up commisions to decide what is allowed and disallowed; they want to
look to social conventions and traditions to control what people can
do with their lives.  They want to restrict research and to disallow
experimentation with new technologies.  They want to use government to
control individuals.

This is the opposite of the situation with the family-values debate,
where conservatives generally supported letting people send their kids
to private school, or to have home schooling, and to choose whether to
vaccinate their children or not.

So liberals have an opportunity here, but to take advantage of it they too
will have to make some reversals in their rhetoric.  They can't continue
to speak in collectivist terms if they want to defend human dignity in
opposition to the conservatives.  The conservatives have already co-opted
the most widespread collectivist memes, like the bible and traditional
values.  If liberals simply stick to their own collectivist ideas of
equality and absence of discrimination, distrust of technology and support
of environmentalism, they're not going to gain any traction on this issue.

Liberals must turn to the older ideas of defending human dignity as a
value in itself.  Not to create more equality, not to protect Mother
Earth, but because man is the measure of himself and each man should be
free to develop his potentials to the fullest.  It may not be comfortable
rhetoric for liberals, but conservatives have abandoned this memetic
position, and it represent a vacuum which liberals can fill.

I think James is right on the money when he says, "The concept of the
dignity of every person must then mean that we want every individual
to have the freedoms of nobles, rather than the constraints of serfs."
That's exactly the sentiment which can be successful in overcome the
collectivist urges of the conservatives.  The question is whether
liberals and "progressives" are willing to adopt this position which
goes back to their classical roots, in opposition to much of modern-day
socialist-flavored liberalism.

Hal, 
       It seems to me that we need to clarify the terms Liberal, Progressive, 
& Conservative among others.
       When you say Liberal I assume you mean the term taken on as a self 
description by the socialist movement late in the nineteenth century as 
described by Von Hayek in his book The Road to Serfdom.
       I have never heard Progressive defined but it seems to carry roughly 
the same meaning as Liberal that is to say some kind of a member of the broad 
socialist moverment.
       I don't have but the roughest of ideas as to what a Conservative is.  
If there is such a thing as a Conservative I suspect if really should be 
written as conservative meaning a broadly defined group of ideas the same as 
I wrote socialist.
       I quoted you above making some charges against conservatives.  I need 
for you to more sharply define those before I could ever tell you whether I 
agreed, disagreed or required more discussion.
       Sorry to be so negative but I am trying without success to understand 
you.

### This is indeed possible, however, we shouldn't forget that it is
relatively difficult to improve or depress IQ significantly, except by very
drastic environmental manipulation. There are many groups which succeeded
excellently despite being discriminated against in schools - e.g. the
Chinese, Ashkenazi, Poles, Irish. It appears that discrimination alone is
not sufficient to depress IQ for long. In fact, being confronted with a
stereotype spurs many persons to work hard on proving it wrong.

### Indeed you are right. The 89.88 figure was obtained under the assumption
that the traits are inherited independently, their influences are simply
additive, and any systematic biases cancel out. The exact average IQ of such
divided population cannot be calculated - you would need to actually do the
experiment to get the correct number. Still, from general principles we can
get estimates which will in most cases be close to the truth - because with
the large number of unlinked genes, systematic biases *do* cancel out.

A corollary of the (quantum) no-cloning theorem, in the D'Ariano &
Yuen version, says that the 'knowledge' of the prior state of a single
quantum system violates the 'unitarity' of evolution

In other words we can also say (and there is also a theorem here)
that a quantum measurement is reversible iff no information
about the initial quantum state is obtained.

Now in the standard QM there are 'discrete' transformations which are
'unitary' (i.e. space reflections) and there are 'discrete' transformations
which are not 'unitary' (i.e. time reversal, which is 'anti-unitary'; that's
also why in QM time is not an operator, an observable, a dynamical 
variable).

Unfortunately I do not know what happens at the Planck scale.
I mean I do not know whether, at the Planck scale, there are more 
'unitary' than 'anti-unitary' discrete transformations, or whether there 
are just 'unitary' or just 'anti-unitary' discrete transformations.

Hal's recent post on this topic, which is obviously political,
deserves consideration as "Post of the Month".

It speaks in a very detailed way as to how to bring the
noise of most political discussions into the realm of
transhumanistic progress.

Extropes,

I found this article some days ago, lost it, and then
found it again today.  It seems to suggest a path to
intelligence enhancement.  

Brain Size Is Linked to a Gene

http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/24/health/genetics/24BRAI.html?ei=1&en=cc06d9f1cda69b10&ex=1033873175&pagewanted=print&position=top

>From the article:

"The gene's protein consists largely of units called
IQ domains, a name that has nothing to do with
intelligence but refers to two chemical units of
proteins that are known by those letters. But as it
happens, the number of IQ units seems to correlate
with an animal's brain size  "a proof of God's
existence since only someone with a sense of humor
could have arranged for the correlation," Dr. Woods
said.

The roundworm's version of the protein has 2 IQ
domains, the fruit fly's has 24, the mouse's 61 and
the human's  not so great a leap above the mouse's 
just 74 domains."

           -------------------------

Since DNA sequences--and, as I recall, entire
genes--can now be 'manufactured', the opportunity for
germline modification in the direction of larger
brains seems clear.  Whether this would result in
increased intelligence is anybody's guess.

Also, I wondered about the statement that the human
genome contains 74 of the 'IQ' domains.  Whose genome,
or what sample of genomes--how many and from what
population--was used to arrive at this number? 
Specifically, I wondered about variations in this
number across populations.  Is there a spread with a
corresponding statistical distribution: a certain
proportion of 72's, 73's, 74's, 75's, and 76's?

Best, Jeff Davis

It makes one wonder about a strain of chimps who had been modified to 
have 76, 78, 80... domains...
Actually, it made me wonder about people, but that would be illegal. 
(Still, I have this sneaky suspicion that this might be a fatal 
modification. Subtle interactions, etc.)

Hal argues that liberals (by which I take it he includes me, although
I've always had disdain for American 'liberalism') are collectivists,
and that we need to give up collectivism for individualism. A familiar
theme. 
 
He cites the family debate as an example. The reason liberals and the
left were critical of "the family" was precisely because it was a form
of patriarchal authoritarianism which did not respect the rights of
women and children. Outside of libertopias, the only way to protect
individual rights is by creating strong democratic governments, prepared
to intervene when rights are threatened. So yes, liberals and left
argued for sex education because we felt that individual empowerment
with sexual knowledge was more important than the prerogatives of
parents to keep kids ignorant. And we fought (and continue to fight) for
the legalization of divorce because we think individuals should have the
right to escape from bad marriages. So in the case of the family,
conservatives were on the side of authoritarianism, and liberals and the
left were on the side of collectively-guaranteed individualism. But
there was in fact a move in the 1980s by prominent members of the
American left and labor movement to redefine the family debate in terms
of a progressive pro-famly agenda: health care, family leave and shorter
work weeks, rights of gay parents, etc. (When I was webmaster for the
Democratic Socialists of America I put up a "Radical Parenting" page as
a part of the effort). But we lost that fight. 
 
In the letter I argue that human dignity requires control of ones own
body, and the same principle applies - control of our bodies requires
strong, democratic governments prepared to defend those rights. We need
defense from violence and crime, for instance. And I would argue that we
need a social democratic state, providing education, health care and
other social goods, in order to fully empower people to control their
own bodies and lives. 
 
So the simple-minded dichotomy that leftists and liberals are
collectivists (except when they accidentally end up defending individual
rights) and conservatives are individualists (except when they
accidentally support authoritarianism) doesn't really work for me. At
least argue that libertarianism is beyond the traditional left and
right.

The NY Times has an interesting article about a possible case
of gene therapies using retroviruses causing a leukemia like
condition.

Trials Halted on a Gene Therapy
Sheryl Gay Stolberg
http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/04/health/04GENE.html?pagewanted=print

Of course as the article points out retroviruses are a really blunt
edged tool to do this kind of work with.  Much better will be Epstein-Barr
based vectors that do not need to integrate into chromosomes or vectors
that can integrate at precise locations.

Yes, but we may have let that trend go just a little bit too far

### But isn't it starkly collectivist to insist on the state provision of
education, health care, protection from petty crime, and other goods that
are easy to buy privately (and much cheaper, too)?

>From the article:

<quote>
The suspended trials sought to cure severe combined immune deficiency, a
disorder that leaves infants without working immune systems. Abbreviated as
SCID, but commonly called "bubble boy disease," it is extremely rare and is
fatal in the first year of life if left untreated.

In the most severe form, the disease affects boys who have faulty
X-chromosomes. The only treatment is bone marrow transplant. But the
transplants fail in as many as 40 percent of all children who lack a perfect
donor match, so scientists looked to gene therapy as an alternative.

In April 2000, Dr. Alain Fischer and his colleagues at the Necker children's
hospital in Paris announced that they had used gene therapy to successfully
insert corrective genes into the bone marrow stem cells of three babies with
X-linked SCID. Coming on the heels of Mr. Gelsinger's death, Dr. Fischer's
study was hailed as long-sought proof that gene therapy could work.

Dr. Fischer went on to treat six more babies and a teenager, who survived
because he had a partial immune deficiency. "Up until now, all these
patients, more than three and a half years after treatment, are doing well,"
he said. All had "close to normal immune functions," he said.

But last spring, Dr. Fischer said, one of the boys showed elevated levels of
a particular type of white blood cell, known as a T-lymphocyte, though he
had no symptoms. Subsequently, though, the boy developed chickenpox. By
August, Dr. Fischer said, he had a "significant increase" in the white cell
counts, as well as an enlarged spleen, anemia and a drop in platelets.
</quote>

So this treatment has (maybe) caused problems (not death or disablement) in
one of nine patients, for a disease that otherwise would have cut through
them like a knife through hot butter?? Hmm, that's a failure in my books.

The NY Times has an interesting article on the similarities
and differences between the U.S. economy now and the Japanese
economy of a decade ago:

Japan and U.S.: Bubble, Bubble, Toil and Trouble
by David Leonhardt
http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/02/business/02JAPA.html?pagewanted=print

The interesting thing about this vis-a-vis the extropian/transhumanist
perspective is the lack-of-vision as to where we might go, what we might
do, and what we can be.

Borrowing from Max's book -- we need more "*onward*".

Screw libertarianism -- lets have more onwardism.

(I'll note as an aside [which will probably bring down the wrath of
the libertarians upon my head] that "strict" libertarianism in the
sense of "I want my gun, my beer and my freedom to watch Monday
night football 48 hours a day" *isn't* a particularly extropic
or even transhumanist vector.)

Being extropic or transhumanistic actually requires hard work.
Where in the libertarian agenda is there a requirement to do
such work (other than work which eliminates antiquated bipolar
political parties)?

People seem smart enough that most adults lie on the
positive side of an interesting watershed:  I think
it likely that most adults and some children have
reached the threshold of universal intelligence.

I will call an entity universally intelligent if it
is possible for that entity to understand *anything*
if provided enough time.

We are aware that a million-fold increase in the
thinking rate of a human would produce an entity
significantly more intelligent than any people
alive today.  So consider some theoretical result
that aliens comprehend because of their vast super-
human intelligence, and the question, possibly
debated among said intelligences, of whether any
human beings are smart enough to *eventually*
understand the result.

I believe that most people, perhaps around age 14
or 16, acquire the intelligence necessary.  At that
point they learn to abstract the consequences of
previous rumination, and to condense that thinking
into verbal shorthand---sentences that capture to
a significant degree the output of their thinking
to that point.

This conjecture reminds me of the Church-Turing
thesis that anything computable in any sort of 
general sense is effectively computable (i.e.,
by a Turing Machine or general purpose computer).
In that case also one looks in vain for systems
or procedures that can compute something which
cannot be computed by Turing machines.

I disagree, of course. Will a dog running for a billion years invent
quantum physics? Absolutely not. Will a monkey? Nope. The current state of
human agents isn't at all special, the hardware has barely changed on a 50
kYear scale. It is being driven harder, way out of specs, but most of the
changes occur at a higher level, and nowadays outside of people's heads
and the reach of primate paws.

Things *would* change if we all would have become immortal overnight, but
merely because the deep time perspective would gradually change your
outlook. People would start interacting more constructively, and realize
that the current level of development will eventually allow them to ascend
to loftier places by incremental patches and redesign of their substrate.

Life is neat, and all, but hanging around verbatim for a billion years?  
Seem to get awfully stale after a few kYears, if everything else stays as
is.

Lee Corbin - Lee writes of "knowing". It is quite probably possible to know 
the laws of physics or systems of operation of similar structures. As an 
ethical I cannot "know" the entire social world because I only access 
personal thoughts and private areas after receiving consent. Since some 
people will always deny access and I may well not wish to know all such 
things the social world will always contain areas of mystery. Don't forget 
that on the other side of the Singularity (at least as regards overtuality - 
virtuality may be more interesting) lies "stasis shock" at least as far as 
physical "laws" go. For example, I am unlikely to learn anything hugely new 
about the structure of the Earth as a planetary body over the next billion 
years. It is likely I am going to receive endless surpises in the social 
world over the same period of time.

In the Turing sense, a simple CPU with infinite memory and running time is 
"universally intelligent" because it can simulate a mind that understands 
something.  But - and this is the confusion on which Searle's Chinese Room 
fallacy rests - the CPU does not possess those cognitive patterns that we 
associate with high-level understanding.  A human in a Chinese Room 
simulating a Chinese-speaking upload might not ever have the vaguest 
comprehension of the high-level intelligence that lies above the 1s and 0s 
being simulated.  The human might never even catch a glimpse of the neural 
level.

Are there limits to what a human can *understand*, as opposed to what a 
human can Turing-tarpit?  It seems to me that the answer is obviously yes. 
  There's a limit to the complexity and class of patterns that human 
neurons will learn to recognize, and a limit to the number of abstract 
elements that can be simultaneously held in short-term memory.  If you go 
over that limit, the human might be able to simulate the pattern by 
simulating the low-level patterns one element at a time, but would never 
be able to abstractly understand the higher-level regularities.

ObShotAtProof:  For any pattern, there exists the shortest Turing machine 
that describes that pattern.  If that shortest Turing machine is larger 
than the human brain, then while the human might be able to simulate the 
Turing machine by swapping low-level elements in and out of consciousness 
using an infinite paper tape as auxiliary memory, the human will never be 
able to understand the system as a whole.

I'm still on the run, Robert, so I only have time for a small, quick

Not knowing whether you're being serious or not, I can't make a real

This is an interesting issue. 

With understanding X I usually mean that a being can represent X
in such a way that it can predict X and how it would interact
with other things at some suitable level of resolution;
understanding is nearly always relative to a level of resolution
and domain. A rabbit understands carrots to the extent that it
can dig them up and eat them. A human might understand how the
carrot plant grows and can be farmed, as well as how carrots can
be prepared as food and behaves as physical objects. A biologist
might have an understanding on a deeper level of what is going
on ecologically, evolutionarily, chemically and genetically. 

Universal understanding would mean that a being could gain an
understanding at any given level of resolution or domain of an
arbitrary thing, given enough information. It seems equivalent
to the creation of an internal simulation that is an emulation
within a certain level of resolution (one could talk about
probabilistic understanding: conclusions are right with a finite
probability, useful understanding occurs when this probability
is high).

As Eliezer neatly showed, finite beings cannot of course achieve
this since there are always non-compressible objects that cannot
fit into their mental hardware. There are also limits in the
form of Gdel/Turing/Chaitin uncomputability or
anti-predictability where there is actually no structure to
understand or no way of understanding it. There are also systems
where certain levels of resolution requires infinite or
impractical amounts of information, like "understanding" the
output of a chaotic system or the detailled behavior of a human.

That still leaves a lot to understand. But we have to remember
that "anything" will be inside a certain domain. 

"The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics" seems to suggest
that there exists a domain encompassing much of physics amenable
to understanding of mathematical type, and this understanding
seems to fit human brains well (possibly augmented with pen and
paper to extend working memory). This domain runs into problems
when dealing with complex systems (i.e. everything interesting),
some of which may be principal problems like uncomputability and
chaos. The real question is whether there are some qualitative
barriers here that are not principal but actually reflect
limitations of cognitive systems. 

As I see it there is likely no universal understanding because
the boundary between domains where understanding is possible is
a kind of fractal mess of undecidable, information limited and
mental resource limited systems that cannot be understood or
mapped in general. It is not just that we cannot understand
every object, we cannot easily predict if certain objects are
amenable to understanding.

It should be noted that separation in this space of objects *
domains of action * levels of precision is extremely
non-trivial: understanding often acts by demonstrating
isomorphies between different regions, essentially connecting
them with cognitive "wormholes" into fewer isolated regions.
Mathematics proved to be a region that could map itself nicely
onto a lot of other regions, uniting them into a simpler region. 

The better understanding, the more the entire space has been
reduced into a minimal set of "primitive" regions. So maybe a
better question than whether there exists universal
understanding is the structure of the set of primitive regions,
and if it is unique. If there are non-unique sets of primitive
regions there would exist different *kinds* of understanding
(which may be differently useful in different environments).

### Yes, I agree here. However, looking at the problem from another
perspective, Lee's suggestion might be true, too.  Contrary to what Eugen
was suggesting, there is qualitative difference between the dog and the
human in cognition - humans can improve their intelligence in a recursive,
controlled manner. And I am not talking merely about pieces of paper as
external memory aids, I mean the technological enhancements to our physical
brains and computers, which will be soon possible, up to and beyond
uploading. In effect, humans, given enough time can rebuild themselves, to
indeed understand anything that can be understood using the resources that
ever would become available to a universally self-enhancing entity.

Of course, one might protest that this would not constitute human
understanding, just as our thoughts are not really the expression of a will
for understanding that a Homo habilis might have had. I would however claim
that our posthuman inheritors will be the direct continuation of the human
*will* to understand, which is much different from the relation between us
and our ape ancestors. It was the blind evolution that transformed the
non-self enhancing ape into the directionally developing human, but from
that point on it our passion, not mere chance alone, that will co-direct the
course of our change.

Consequently, humans could take credit for understanding, even if it occurs
in entities which can out-think us like we out-think a lemur. Also, with
luck, some of those powers will be direct continuations of actual humans
living today. Those could really claim to be humans who can figure out
anything, given enough time.

 It sure does. Your observations sound wildly inconsistent with what I

objectively observing how people behave during debates.

 Those sure sound like good goals to me, as long as the "be more rational"
part implies we should achieve them by being more objective rather than more
conformist. I sure wish I could do something effective towards achieving
those goals. Alas, the promising approaches appear to require skills I lack,
such as the ability to persuade the appropriate regulators to approve
real-money idea futures markets that would reward objectivity.

 Yes, given the opinions you've been expressing about people's motivations,
it's not surprising that it's a mystery to you.

I forgot to mention the *absolutely* key role of language.
Without the ability to linguistically chunk previous results
(and to write them down, of course, as someone charitably
noted), yes, this would be impossible.

Of course, one should not distinguish "human" from "biologist"
here since I contend that any normal adult from the former
set can emulate one of the latter.

I think that *emulation* is too strong.  For a model of
what I have in mind, consider an extremely complicated
mathematics proof that one has "understood".  This hardly
means either that one has memorized it, nor that one could
readily reproduce it, nor that one even now could answer
any question about.  All that was achieved is that the
mathematician *at some point* while he was studying the
proof *could have* attended to that question---all the
mathematician has left are notes to the effect that he
or she has verified the calculations.  For that matter,
extremely few children *know* in the sense that you and
Eliezer have talked about that 56144*983 = 55189552.
All they know is that they verified by algorithm each
step leading to that result.  And that's all that matters.

As someone also charitably pointed out, however, the
assumption was that we have unlimited pencils and paper.

Yes, a qualification that I meant to add was that the
results lying within human reach are only those lying
within the reach of any finite intelligence, no matter
how more "advanced" (i.e. quick) than humans.

Eliezer's comparison with the Chinese room is very apt
here, and I will deal with it when I have more time.
At the end of a trillion-year calculation that the
human finally succeeded in performing, the end result
would be like talking to a librarian who knew, or could
figure out, where any intermediate result is stored.

The key point however, is that the human, unlike the
busy little guy in the Chinese room, knows the meanings
of the final result and a huge number of intermediate
results.  The word "knows" perhaps should even be in
quotes because asking him about the results determined
during the 701st of the billion years comprising the
trillion, may send him off on another two million year
quest.

Yes, that's the key question, to which I answer No.

This sounds as though you are referring to systems unanalyzable
by any intelligence of any organization whatsoever.  I mean to
exclude such projects.  My claim, to put it in the most graphic
terms, is that no alien race, nor any SI, is *smarter* than
humans except for time and speed, when the potentially immortal
human is not handicapped by health, poverty, or death.

Could you possibly provide examples of what you are talking
about here?  I can think of several nice interpretation, but
they might be mine and not yours!  ;-)

I read "The better [the] understanding, the more the entire
space has been reduced into a minimal set of "primitive"
regions" as referring to *chunking*:  in my examples, the
human at the end of his trillion year computation or mastery
of some proof, has possibly before him one final sentence:
A is true because of B, C, D, and E, even though E implies
some very other interesting things.

Sorry, I'm baffled by your last sentence, but will have more
time later to study it.

Thanks,
Lee

A human can truly understand huge amounts of things.

It helps a lot if they can rely upon the collected efforts of all the 
other humans.  That's why we have books, academia, teachers, and 
communal stores of knowledge, etcetera.

Humanity is alone among the species of the world in archiving 
knowledge.  We've archived so much chess knowledge that we can write 
programs to play a decent game on the silicon computers we've invented 
and mass-manufactured.

A human might be a finite state machine, or not, the electric patterns 
in the brain go through a continuum of states.  Thinking about most 
things is a Turing pattern.  Humans are distributed, we communicate.

In terms of universal intelligence, that being the capacity to 
understand anything, I think that's about the micro/medio/macro view.  
Consider an ocean.  An ocean is a large body of salt, brackish, water.  
It's part of the hydrological system of the planet, all H2O and systems 
that produce and consume H20, not a drop of one is fit to drink, it's 
the high sea and the highway.  More than four or five miles underwater 
is called as alien as deep space.

We're people, our bodies are each made of about 2/3 water.

I think the humans can understand almost anything another human can 
understand and express.

It has to be able to be expressed, someone must have originally or 
concurrently discovered, invented, or learned it, and have enough 
knowledge to communicate it, or it must be relearned.

It's like getting something "right on target", or how sometimes a 
numerical approximation loses accuracy compared to a symbolic 
interpretation, using the more accurate symbolic interpretation gets the 
accurate result of an infinite numerical approximation.  This is how for 
example irrational Pi and e and Apery's Zeta(3) are represented by 
summations of infinite series.

I think we could work out the math part, but that doesn't imply 
universal understanding because the definition overlaps with omniscience.

We simply won't know the state of everything at any one time, it would 
take a storage bigger than the universe.The universe itself is its own 
storage, the sum extent of space and time.  It's possible to consider 
picking any thing in the universe and knowing its state.

This one might be better dead.  The long-term solar powered glider is 
probably a better choice for implementation, and doesn't offer quite as 
many opportunities for large-scale abuse.  Also, a closer relay means a 
more responsive system and lower transmission power.  Balloons and 
blimps, another choice, can't maintain station without a ground line, 
which limits their height (and can cause hazards to low flying air traffic).

Some large scale satellite system is needed, but this may not be the right one.  I still like solar power space satellites, but not, please, with lasers as the power download mechanism.  Some short microwave band that doesn't get absorbed by water seems preferable, with large scale antenna farms.

Writing about the far-out prospects for our intellectual descendants started
me on a more immediate problem, also related to our recent IQ/race debate
here.

It does appear that all of us are cognitively impaired to various degree.
Racists of course want to believe that most of our differences, both the
ones between individuals and the ones between groups, are genetic in origin,
with the assumed smug (if mostly unfounded) feeling of superiority that they
derive from it. Dr Sowell, whose recent three articles I read (the reference
to the Britons being regarded by the ancient Romans as too stupid to make
good slaves amused me immensely), says that the environment is the cause
responsible for group differences. Murray and Herrnstein were strictly
agnostic as to whether inter-group differences are environmental or genetic
in origin, although they clearly agree with the majority of psychologists
that inter-individual variation is caused predominantly by genes.

I detest racists, like Dr Sowell, and agree with M&H, yet, personally, I
think the crux of the issue is not the apportionment of blame between genes
and environment. What matters is, what can we do about it?

That a problem is "environmental" doesn't automatically mean it's easy to
remedy, or else the drug war would have been won a long time ago.
Conversely, a "genetic" problem doesn't leave fatalistic acceptance as the
only option. Indeed, a properly understood genetic problem can become a
minor environmental trifle. An example of that is phenylketonuria, an inborn
error of metabolism which invariably caused severe mental retardation, until
a special diet limiting phenylalanine was found to prevent all damage.
Today, should a child with PKU become retarded, we would see that no longer
as a genetic problem but rather as a case of parental neglect, a failure to
provide the mind-saving diet.

A few years ago I worked in the lab of Pat Levitt, searching for genes
involved in the early patterning events in mammalian cerebral cortex. I
failed to find them but others were more successful. In the five years since
I left the lab more has been found about the biochemistry of cortical
development than in all the thousands of years until 1996. The FGF-family,
Emx, Dmx, FOX 2 and other genes were found, and a general picture of
patterning started to emerge.

On another front, advances in cognitive neuroscience and brain imaging
pinpointed the cortical areas most important for general intelligence. The
anterior cingulate and dorsolateral cortices were found to activate roughly
proportionately to the g-loading of test items, and testable hypotheses
about their exact roles were made.

These advances fill me with optimism. In as little as 20 years we might have
the technology to allow persons with IQ 70 to solve the Schroedinger's
equation. Perhaps we'll use implantable osmotic pumps to deliver growth
factors to the ACC and DLPFC, to stimulate neuron growth there. Maybe we'll
use neural stem cells engineered to home in on specific combinations of
morphogens in selected Broadman's areas, settle there, and connect with the
right classes of existing neurons to give them a boost. Maybe we'll go for a
"simple" cortical tap, arrays of electrodes listening in on neural traffic,
and delivering computational assist from remote computers. I don't know
which approach will turn out to be the best, but something will work, and
erase a lot of suffering.

And another good thing will be, I'll finally understand quantum mechanics,
too.

It's not collectivist, but it's not libertarian either.  Perhaps there are more than two possibilities here?  A kibbutz was collectivist.  A commune is likely to be collectivist (i.e., if the people in it don't adhere to some kind of collectivist ethics, it's likely to fall apart).  But note that there's nothing in principle that prevents communes from being anarchist (some have been).

Perhaps what's really going on is that people tend to have certain agendas for what they want to get done, and they try to find and justify ways to do it.  Some people are most interested in, e.g., protecting weak people from domination by stronger people.  So they try to find some way to do this.  Others are more interested in keeping the government from being too intrusive into their life.  So they try to find some way to do this.  Most people would agree that both of these goals are desireable.  The problem comes when attempting to solve one of the problems acerbates the other.  As often happens.  Then we find labels for the people who are most interested in the various problems, and think of them as if they were all the same.  But this isn't actually what's going on, this is just an easy way to think about it.  An oversimplified way, that works well enough if you know all the people, but doesn't work so well if you are trying to reach an accomodation with strangers.

I think the flexible chunking part is important, but language as
communication is not necessary for understanding (but it helps
immensely). One could imagine a clever AI with a randomly
generated "language" nobody understands or a person with total
aphasia, and both would be able to understand things and act
intelligently.

Yes. I think all normal humans are able to understand the same
things (with the exception of some borderline objects or people).
But interindividual differences in how easy understanding is are
large - just because we can in principle understand everything
else another person understands doesn't mean it is even practical.

I think this is a too weak form of understanding. It is more like
knowing where something is written down than actually knowing what
is written. When I think I understand something I can usually do
some mental inferences from the concept, *use* it in some way. 

Of course, there is no reason to search for a laser-sharp
definition here, the boundary between understood and not
understood is blurry (one can also understand things more or
less). It is a bit like the issue of when an attractor neural
network has learned a pattern - does it have to retrieve it
perfectly from a noisy cue, with a finite precision from the cue
or just have a fixed point corresponding to the pattern? All three
definitions produce different memory measures, but they all
usually give the same qualitative answers.

And my claim is that unanalyzable systems are so common that many
interesting domains will be riddled with them, making even
understanding many understandable questions hard and not subject
to general rules. With the right mappings even a very messy domain
might have a simple structure that can be understood, but most
such mappings will be unanalyzable or hard to come by in the first
place. The result is that entities can be equally "smart" but
unable to understand things other entities understand due to quirks
of their mental architectures that are non-trivial to re-implement
in another mental architecture. 

A human with an arbitrarily extended memory can emulate a
Turing-machine and apparently a quantum computer, with an
exponential slowdown. So if physics is computable he could in
principle emulate the underlying physics of any other thinking
system, and hence "understand" in some sense anything anything
else undestands (It could of course be that there exists
uncomputable elements of physics that cannot be emulated by other
subsets of physics or systems built from them. In that case there
might exist different kinds of intelligences that have some kind
of partial ordering of understanding).

But this is not very useful: matter and time constraints are real
for every intelligence, and when emulation becomes too large it is
no longer possible even in principle. It is possible to construct
an awfully complex concept that requires more memory storage than
can be encoded in the universe or takes more time to compute than
is available - that concept cannot be understood by any system.

Even worse, in some domains understanding involves short time
limits. Understanding football in the domain of actual playing or
cocktail party wit in the domain of witty retorts cannot be said
to occur if the responses take too long. Here speed of computation
might not be enough if the time complexity of the understanding
algorithm emulated by hand is too bad.

One of the best examples is analytic geometry, where Descartes
showed how to create a one-to-one correspondence between the
arithmetic of number pairs and geometrical objects. Every point
corresponds to an x-y coordinate pair, every line to a linear
equation, every circle to a quadratic equation of the form
(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2=c^2 and so on. By switching between the two domains
(geometry and equations) a large number of problems becomes easier
to solve, and in fact become the same problem.

Chunking means combining several concepts into one composite
concept; it is in many ways arbitrary (you can chunk anything with
anything). Abstraction combines several concepts into a general
class, which is a special kind of chunking. What I was talking
about was more like abstraction - you see that objects in domain X
can be mapped to objects in domain Y, and relations in X and/or Y
can be mapped to relations in the other domain. If the domains are
isomorphic every object and relation can be mapped to a
counterpart. One can then then say that these two domains really
are the same abstract domain.

Imagine that being A manages to understand all that is
understandable by mapping it (sometimes in very complex ways) into
domains A, B, C, ... and being B achieves the same thing with
domains X, Y, Z, ... It could happen that there is no way of
mapping between ABC and XYZ in ways that would be comprehensible
(or even decideable?) for the entities. In that case they would
have different kinds of understandings.

I would like to share with all of you my excitement over the Creekside Preserve lodge, where I am presently the management trainee.  David Pizer has lovingly built this place with the goal that in time it would also be home to a cryonicist community known as Ventureville!  Please lend your support by coming on down.  This place is sooo beautiful!  : )   

We will be hosting a cryonics gathering on the 26th, with the distinguished Dr. Jerry Lemler as our guest speaker.  Between getting to listen to him, using our observatory, 25% room discounts, cozy chats at the firepit and free food, you just can't go wrong! lol

Read David's announcement at Cryonet...

http://www.cryonet.org/cgi-bin/dsp.cgi?msg=20246

I recently wrote an article about my experiences in the latest issue of The Venturist.  Just scroll down to page ten, and you will find my enthusiastic article there!  

But I would recommend you read the entire issue.  The article on the cryosummit is especially good.  

These are exciting times for many reasons!! 

http://uk.geocities.com/venturist2001/tv023.pdf

I look forward to eventually seeing many of you down here!

The present website which is going to be getting a major upgrade down the road(and yes, we missed the original opening date, lol)...

www.creeksidepreserve.com

very best wishes,

John Grigg

P.S.  The wooden tables and chairs were delivered the other day, and the craftsmanship & western authenticity were incredible.  David and I were so impressed.

They make me want to get into western dress, drink whiskey, play poker, and then accuse someone of cheating, so I can draw my sidearm and plug them really good with hot lead! ; )

Sounds like the human knows nothing and is simply behaving as an 
unnecessarily complex CPU.  I don't see how a human could possibly know 
the meaning of the final result, nor any of the interim results, if those 
results were incompressible to the size of the human brain (which is 
certainly mathematically possible).  There is a difference between 
simulating something and understanding it, and contrary to Searle, the 
difference is not mysterious biological properties of neurons; the 
difference is the explicit presence of cognitive mind-state that expresses 
the high-level regularity being understood.  Can humans simulate anything 
given infinite time and paper?  Sure.  We can stand in for CPUs if we have 
to.  Can humans explicitly understand arbitrary high-level regularities in 
complex processes?  No.  Some regularities will be neurally incompressible 
by human cognitive processes, will exceed the limits of cognitive 
workspace, or both.  A human being can simulate a Turing machine that is 
capable of explicitly representing and understanding those high-level 
regularities, but the explicit cognitive representation will still be 
stored in the gazillions of bits of paper, and will be nowhere mirrored 
inside the human's actual mind.

If the cognitive representation stored in the gazillion bits of paper - 
the real understanding - interacts in no interesting way with the human's 
neural data structures, then the human is simply standing in for an 
ordinary CPU.

Nothing new here.  There are some other differences that might make a
bigger
difference here too.  The current issue of _The Review of Austrian
Economics_ [15(2/3)] is devoted to Austrian economics and public choice.
In
it, there's an essay by Shigeto Naka, "The Postwar Japanese Political
Economy in an Exchange Perspective."  (Funny thing is the article itself
seems tangential to the whole issue of Austrian economics, but it's a
good
read anyhow.:)  Naka's view here might explain why the Japanese economy
is
taking so long to recover.

His believes that the particular pattern of democracy in postwar Japan
created an implicit stable social contract that helped to maintain
growth
while wealth transfer went on.  Specifically, he claims the system of
equal
multi-member electoral districts made some districts that had lower
population, less politically diversity, and more united interests more
powerful than others.  Specifically, he argues that rural and semi-rural
districts because they elected more people to the Diet per capita, has a
stronger influence on the Japanese political economy.  (He shows how,
e.g.,
local governments in rural and semi-rural districts get more money from
transfers than from taxing the local and also have higher levels of
public
spending.)

This meant that the LDP only had to cater to those districts and win a
modest showing in urban districts to get in power and stay there --
resulting in wealth transfers to the non-urban districts, yet keeping
them
not so severe that the economy could still grow.  However, in the long
run,
the rural and semi-rural districts not only came to demand more, they
grew
in population and in wealth, becoming more politically diversified as a
result.  To Naka, this led to a failure of the contract as now the kinds
of
stable coalitions that dominated Japan up until the late 1970s are not
possible and short run transfers that are not sustainable have become
the
rule.

Naka's a pretty interesting theory and needs more empirical research,
but it
seems much more productive at explaining the Japanese economic "miracle"
and
its decline from the 1970s on.  (Yes, the Japanese economy really start
to
peak in the 1970s -- not in the late 1980s.)

The US and most other industrial democracies don't have this same sort
of
setup -- note Naka is only talking about an electoral system here and
not
some peculiar aspect of Japanese culture, thus his model is applicable
to
any society having a similar system.  That might be good because this
particular social contract can't come about, though more dynamic rent
seeking behavior is the rule, which leads to unstable and short-lived
coalitions as we see in the US and Europe.  (Note what would happen if
the
US had a system like Japan's.  Each district -- let's say State -- would
have the same number of Representatives in Congress.  Assuming a
disparity
in wealth between districts, wealth would be slowly but surely
redistributed
from richer districts to the poorer ones, since any party that ran on a
ticket of doing such -- not openly, but buried in its policy choices --
would tend to get elected and re-elected.  Now, in the US, we actually
have
the opposite.  Wealth tends to be transferred to more populous
districts,
since they tend to have more representatives than less populous ones.
Some
horse trading does go on, so the system is not such that Nevada
completely
funds New York's budget, but any ruling party that decided to transfer
wealth the other way consistently would not be in power in Washington
for
long.)

I don't know how you got that from the article.  The US economy seems to
be
suffering not from less "onwardism" per se, but from a huge amount of
government intervention that only increased during the 1990s and
increases
now -- miniscule tax cuts not withstanding.  I've been over this before
on
the list.  Such interventions have distorted growth in many areas and
stifled it in others.  Specifically, the low interest rates of the late
1990s coupled with government bailouts during various crises during the
last
decade (the Mexican bailout, the Asian bailout, the Russian bailout, the
LTCM bailout (actually private but arranged by the NY FRB to keep Buffet
from coming in)) created a climate where risk-taking increased with the
expectation of a bailout always looming on the horizon.  The inflated
the
money supply, making for higher levels of calculational errors.

These conditions made for a bubble and a bust, all the while making for
less
accountability overall.  I'm not saying the government created the
accounting scandals, but it made an environment where such things were
more
prone to happen and less likely to be found out early.  E.g., because
credit
was easy, people weren't too worried about being cautious when
evaluating
investments.

It's also an environment that lowers individual initiative and overall
system responsiveness to changes.  By distorting the money supply (one
information system of society), forbidding or controlling certain
responses
(prohibitions and regulations), and increasing the level of takings
(taking
becomes more important than making), government has curtailed social
coordination.  It continues to do so and there appears to be no end in
sight.

(Yes, globalism might lead to some more market activities elsewhere,
changing some of the highly controlled Third World economies to less
highly
controlled ones, but the long run prospects are that we're moving toward
a
global managerial state.  Once it eats up all the other states, then
there'll be no more returns to be had from external expansion and it
will
expand faster internally with the planet being internal at that point.
This
kind of marks the growth of statism in Europe.  Early on the
centralization
of states in Europe did lead to free markets in wider areas.  Rather
than
being taxed by little fiefdoms, now people only had to pay the King.
However, once it was no longer possible to grow by absorbing other small
states, governments soon switched to more intensive internal taxation.
This
is how we have modern Europeans paying taxes much higher than Medieval
serfs
paid -- as a percentage of income.  (Well, that and there's no longer a
competition with other states for productive population.  A system of a
few
large states can be more reckless with its economic policies than one
with
many small ones, since people are less able to move out and the cushion
of a
larger tax base makes individual policies failures easier to absorb,
though
that makes more policy failures like and the policy failure load
eventually
exceeds that of the latter system.))

I know you are not a libertarian, but I don't like the image you're
using
here of a libertarian as a gun touting, beer guzzling, sports nut.
That's
pure ad hominem.  If you've read any of the economics articles I've sent
to
the list over the last several years, you would, I hope, see a different
view here.  You've seemed to ignore that.

But let's take apart your image.  What does Extropianism or
transhumanism
entail here for personal freedom?  Do you mean in a Extropian or
transhumanist society people (or sentients in general) would not be
allowed
to defend themselves, use recreational drugs, or partake of such
entertainments as they find pleasurable?  Let me reverse your ad
hominem,
under your reign, will we all have to be good little posthumans and work
only on your pet projects?

> Being extropic or transhumanistic actually requires hard work.
> Where in the libertarian agenda is there a requirement to do

> political parties)?

That's also ad hominem.  Many libertarians are anarchists, so they do
not
work inside the political system.  Many are working against the
political
system as such.  Also, I don't see libertarianism as opposed to
Extropianianism or transhumanism.  I do think statism in any form is
anti-Extropic.  Socially, government creates more social chaos -- social
entropy, if you will -- and co-opts voluntary spontaneous orders.  (It
does
not completely destroy spontaneous orders and that's one reason why
statism
never works in the long run.)

That aside, what particular policy recommendations do you have here that
would re-ignite the economy?  How do these recommendations differ from
"libertarian" ones.

Cheers!

In history, law, economics, politics etc the
asymmetry--the clear assessment of correct or
incorrect(or--more judgementally--right or wrong)--may
be clouded by different 'interpretations' of 'the
facts'.  

By use of the 'mathematical' I hoped to show examples
of 'symmetry' and 'asymmetry' while avoiding any
spillover of 'muddiness' from the underlying facts. I
was trying to keep the issue of
'symmetry'--wrong/wrong vs right/wrong--clear.  

Only politeness and timidity keeps us from taking the
crucial step past correctness and incorrectness, to
the issue of right and wrong.  

A person who is misinformed can discuss an issue, be
wrong, yet not be guilty of bad faith.  Happens all
the time, so abundant is misinformation.  But after a
while it becomes difficult not to conclude that there
is more going on in these disputes over facts than
naivete and lack of sophistication.  Because the vast
majority of those involved are well beyond innocence,
ignorance, and lack of sophistication.  That something
more is self-interest.  Thus is born the
self-justifying mythology--Divine right of kings;
social Darwinism, etc)-- of "conservatism": "I've
stolen as much as I can, now it's time destroy the
truth/evidence about how I got it, so I can hold onto
it (as long as possible)."

Sure:  Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot.  Why so clearly wrong?
 Because they were both the enemy and the losers.  But
the clarity of these crimes combined with the
exclusively 'enemy' nature of the perpetrators is
suggestive.  Suggestive that there are crimes of equal
clarity committed by 'our' side and 'our' allies. 
Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Iran, Taiwan*, all of Central
America.  The Russkies shoot down Flt 007 and it's
"Monsters!"  The US shoots down the Iranian airbus,
and it's "Whoops! Sorry. Accident."  Osama kills three
thousand Americans and it's barbaric savagery. The US
inflicts a thousand 911's on SE Asia, and it's "a
noble cause".  Only a child or a corrupted intellect
could accept this dichotomy.

I accept the accusation and wear it as a badge of
honor.  My side IS right, both factually and morally. 


I see from below that we may be talking about
different things.  My "right and wrong" applies to
global executive homicide, not economic systems or
ideological attitudes regarding social welfare, wealth
redistribution, and property rights.  About these
latter there is not only room for discussion, but room
as well for diversity.  Let each person freely choose
what system they support, and live where that system
is in place.  (In a huge place like the US this is a
tad difficult, though States, counties, and
neighborhoods can provide some opportunity for
customized diversity.)

As I said, these sorts of matters are not crucial to
me.  They seem less about right and wrong, than about
preferences, opinions, and degrees of efficiency.  I'm
perfectly happy to have them dealt with by discussion
and compromise and vote.  If the outcome is really
horrendous--and I've not seen such an outcome in our
system--then I can always go to Canada or Belize. 
Funny thing about compromise.  A good one makes no one
happy.  That's how you know that it's a good one.

Let me boldly speak the name of he who you--out of
politeness, or else as a wry reference to a prior
characterization of mine--have left unnamed:  Chomsky.
 Regarding 'the light' however, I must object.  When
indisputable documentation of historical fact is
presented, then 'the light' goes on in one's head if
and only if one opens one's eyes.  The refusal is the
blindness--and the discredit--of he who WILL NOT see.

But this is *not* like that.  Jeff, do you suddenly

conservatives or the progressives were *right*,
and all on the losing side who are honest will
suddenly confess their errors?

[Jeff]  Regarding world homicide and the theft which
motivates it, the truth is already revealed.  The
'losing' side (as regards the facts, 'winning' side as
regards the power struggle) the conservatives, never
confess.

Well, throw all those, the blind, or stupid, or less
educated, or immoral out of the equation for a minute.
Are any remaining on that side of the political
spectrum you oppose?

[J]  Care must be taken at this juncture to
distinguish the two issues which I separate above:
global homicide & theft, vs political/economic
systems.  Regarding the first, none remain.  Regarding
the latter, all remain, and welcome.

Yes, but my point is that one *can't* know that.
You can *try* to watch yourself, of course, but
the best that you can ever do is face inconsistencies
in your own belief system and rectify them.  And
that can always be done, else all the liberals
(conservatives) would long ago have gone extinct,
just as the Ptolemaicists have.

[J] I agree Lee, that one cannot, due to the
inherently subjective nature of experience, step
beyond the subjective view.  But there are things
outside oneself that are not subjective.  Documents,
biographies, corpses.

But all you can mean by that, if we are speaking
objectively, is that the *you* of then disagrees
with the *you* of now.  You *can't* know that 
given another fifty years you won't change sides
again!

[J] There were documents and corpses I wasn't told
about at the time.  These informational disadvantages,
augmented by appropriately configured lies
(appropriate to the interests of the ruling class)
substituted for facts, misled me.  But I want to be
agreeable, so let me add that I'm still plenty
ignorant, without any outside help.  So, fifty years  
hence I may indeed have to revise my views, and devote
a major portion of my time to cranking out a 
fifty-year backlog of retractions and apologies. ;-)

Well, good for you.  I also feel myself adrift
politically, though moving very slowly.  Unlike
you, however, I don't find little *bits* constantly
that need to be purged.  An interesting difference.

Well, yes, I did expect that you would agree that
we are closer to showing (at least on some occasions)
a more sincere desire to find the truth than some
on this list.

[J] I would like to think that EVERYONE desires to
find the truth, but that but that we all face
obstacles.  Some are fortunate enough to overcome
them, and others face obstacles too great for them to
overcome.  I'm fond of thinking that people don't
really disagree, they misunderstand.

I think that you are dodging the question.

[J] You're right.  At that moment I didn't want to
say, "Conservatives bad, progressives ("liberals" sans
the celebratory venom of the endearment "nigger")
good.  But I chickened out. 

Yes, we know how entrenched administrations in power
in
Washington (or in the Kremlin) can do amazing
ideological gymnastics when it suits them.  I meant
by "side" left or right.  Do you think that one
side is *far* more resistant to truth?

> So, yes, one side is far more resistant to the
truth.

You do mean one of (left, right) I take it?

[J] Yes.  I mean the right.  But, when I think of how
many leftists seem totally flaky to me, I have to
admit--and readily, too--that the left/right
difference is miniscule.  It's a human thing.  Humans
have brains, with which one can achieve stupidity. 
Ahh, ambition.

"Yes, I agree here. However, looking at the problem from

recursive, controlled manner. And I am not talking merely about pieces of 
paper as external memory aids, I mean the technological enhancements to our 
physical brains and computers, which will be soon possible, up to and beyond 
uploading. In effect, humans, given enough time can rebuild themselves, to 
indeed understand anything that can be understood using the resources that 
ever would become available to a universally self-enhancing entity.

Of course, one might protest that this would not constitute
human understanding, just as our thoughts are not really the
expression of a will for understanding that a Homo habilis might have had. I 
would however claim that our posthuman inheritors will be the direct 
continuation of the human *will* to understand, which is much different from 
the relation between us and our ape ancestors. It was the blind evolution 
that transformed the non-self enhancing ape into the directionally 
developing human, but from that point on it our passion, not mere chance 
alone, that will co-direct the course of our change.

Consequently, humans could take credit for understanding, even
if it occurs in entities which can out-think us like we out-think a lemur. 
Also, with luck, some of those powers will be direct ontinuations of actual 
humans living today. Those could really claim to be humans who can figure 
out anything, given enough time.

A dog is equivalent to a two or three year old human child. This appears to 
be a big barrier. Any dog or cat or whale injected with Drexlerian nanotech 
supercomputers/cell repair-alteration machines would have to have an alien 
architecture superimposed upon it. It is arguable that human archictecture 
contains some more universal elements. In any event, either human or 
constructed architecture would have to be superimposed, although some degree 
of native architecture might be artistically weaned out into fuller form.

The abilitiy to change the environment is present in many species at a low 
level. Whatever happened with humans - out of the various theories, all 
probably partially correct - I tend to hold with the language theory and its 
combination with social behaviour. Tool making started first, then fire and 
huts (1.5 million years ago). However I have just realized that our current 
major ice age (2 million years into it - 58 million to go if it weren't for 
the Singularity - ice age due to current lack of equatorial oceans) 
coincides with much of human development. [The ice age I am referring to is 
the major not the minor lacial/inter-glacials.]

I doubt human beings collectively and individually could be "out-thought" 
like a human out-thinks a lemur. I don't hold with this definition of 
"thought" at all the more I think about it!

I don't hold with the notion of uploading as some sacred cow. Better brains, 
yes, computronium or otherwise. I'm not saying it's a bad thing, it's fine 
in itself. It's probably more likely to be a mix of "people" that are bush 
robots with computronium brains in part at least and a broadcast 
computronium substrate with continous neurlogical linkage to it enabling 
entry into VR levels. But whether you're experiencing virtuality or 
overtuality, and whether your in a physically separated brain or in a brain 
adjacent to another brain in a computronium substrate you are in the same 
situation (whether your neurons are electronic or biological or whatever) - 
you interacted with other beings through senses and environments and 
language, whether say actual lightning or electrons expressing software 
coding of actual lightning. You can make your internal thoughts sharp enough 
to be very cool and realistic but if you start interacting with others then 
the same mechanisms that drive our existence as non-uploads come into 
effect. This is especially relevant when you consider that an atomic-level 
duplicate of yourself produced by software coding from memory storage is not 
you just a duplicate. You are still dead because a meteor hit your uploading 
computronium node. Where uploading makes sense is having a backup analogue 
of your brain in constant broadcast linkage with your main brain, i.e. you 
have three brains in continuous linkage. One might be in your bush 
robot/nano/bio body and the other two are computronium fragments nearby. The 
three brains have similar patterns and mimic each other via the broadcast 
linkage (which acts as a non-visible extension between neurons). There are 
vatiations of this idea you could think of.

And I still believe that there are different types of knowledge and 
different limits to knowledge. Even if you can "know" the ocean quanta by 
quanta for one moment it is not the same as knowing it as a fractal or 
knowing it as algorithyms or knowing it as a cool place to enjoy swimming. 
And the limits to it may not be how many bits you can fit on a computational 
atom but whether there is a nude bather and they don't want your eyes to get 
to close to the water around them, if you see what I mean.

Yes it would. I think you're right. I think we become 'very long-lived' very

and then VERY long lived in about 20 years via intra-inter cellular nanotch

upgrade to computronium add-ons and cell change and patch into other 
networks ("pure" AI) and so on. ...... so I think we become "immortal" 
effectively very quickly and then less bodylocked and finally self-directed 
up to the neurological level, soon after which the Singularity takes off and 
we can reach certain maximal potentials. But it may be that the world of 
2020 and Cyberia is little different to the world of 2030 and the 
Singularity except for understanding including of quantum physics plus 1 
(the TOE).

"Life is neat, and all, but hanging around verbatim for a billion

You've got VR at indescribable levels, including neuro-to-neuro levels 
directly.

You've got resetting and reformation if you're conservative, including of 
memory systems. Remember Dr Who changing every few years.

Forget a few kYears. Think a few bYears. Drexler does.

Backed up with the certainty of bYears, maybe one should start to think about generous
"temporary jobs" like learning all the languages of the Islamic cultures and translating
the most important thinkers of the enlightenment (let's say two dozens of books), so
regular Muhammad in Bhagdad can make up for letting some more reason and sunshine in his
fundamentalist mind. I`m sure you would find a sponsor like the UN for this gigantic
enterprise.

After approximately 100 years of learning languages and translating enlightenment books
you might be fed up with paper and might want to dig up all the human bones in all the
African deserts, extract DNA samples and try to find out who the hell your
greatgranddaddy *really* was - 3000 years of wasting sponsor money? And still no end of
eternity in sight. Sigh...I guess, we should start to honestly think about jobs like
these so people won`t be scared of a billion years of living.

In this study referenced below, depressed men aged 65 to 69 were more than
twice as likely to die when compared to those who were not depressed. This
result is especially remarkable in that the researchers controlled for
obvious health risk factors, thus making depression an independent variable.

I think it's safe to say that depression is characterized by a reduced
motivation to live and be well, which makes this study compelling evidence
that our internal biological processes are "motivated" by our minds.

Unfortunately the body eventually breaks down regardless of one's motivation
to live. This is likely the reason that the depression effect disappears at
about age 70.

Death, Depression Link Stronger in Men
Fri Oct 4, 4:55 PM ET
By Dana Frisch
NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Researchers have long known that elderly people
who are depressed are at greater risk of dying in a certain time period than
their more hopeful peers. Now new study findings suggest that men may be
more susceptible to this effect than women--although the link may not be as
strong as previously suspected.

"Doctors need to be more aware of the effect of depression on physical
health," said Dr. Melanie Abas, lead author and a consultant psychiatrist on
the Research and Audit in Mental Health Services Team at South Auckland
Health in New Zealand. She said doctors may not treat depression if a
patient is depressed due to an "understandable" cause, such as heart
disease, arthritis or loss of a spouse.
In the study, published in a recent issue of the British Journal of
Psychiatry, Abas and colleagues examined data collected from over 2,600
participants aged 65 to 75, all part of a high blood pressure trial in the
UK begun in the mid-1980s. Participants completed a psychiatric test when
they enrolled, which included questions about depression.
Abas and her team collected mortality data on the subjects from the original
trial for analysis. They found that almost 5% of participants were depressed
and of these, over one-third died in the intervening years.
When researchers considered risk factors, such as cardiovascular and
cognitive health into their analysis, they found men, and people between 65
and 69 with depression were more than twice as likely to die during the
study as those who were not depressed. There was no link between depression
and mortality in those 70 or older, according to the report.
Abas said that as people age, other factors like cardiovascular health are
more important causes for death and "swamp the effect of the ones related to
depression." This research confirms other work that indicated that males
with depression are more likely to die than females.
Severe depression normally affects about 3% of seniors and Abas said it
continues to be under-treated and under-recognized. It is not known yet
whether treatment of major depression would reduce mortality, Abas said.

Precisely (and I haven't been following this thread).

Though I doubt it has made it to Europe, there is a long running
sit-com in the U.S. called the Drew Carrey Show about a mid-level
executive in a chain of department stores.  The locale for this
series is Cleveland Ohio -- a medium sized city meandering forward
in a post-industrial era.  One of the more interesting parts of the
show is the intro where they show the cast and lots of other people
streaming out into the street singing "Cleveland Rocks" (lots of
irony here because middle-Americana boosterism would like to
promote the idea that their home town is "cool" while the
rest of America [particularly on the two coasts] has one or
even both eyebrows raised thinking -- "Like Cleveland could
*ever* 'rock'").

Background side-bar finished.

"Anders Rocks!"
(if you have heard the D.C.S. intro it will resonate more...)

(No irony intended).

One could imagine an intelligence that relied upon
something like object-based programming versus command
syntax.  (I only use this as a very rough analogy;
please feel free to suggest other possibilities.) 
Sure, translations of specific problems and solution
sets between the two types of systems would be
possible, but often cumbersome.  Those stuck in the
command syntax mode might find it hard to comprehend
the mindset of the other side and vice versa.

In RW, I find this very kind of frustrating interface
occurring rather frequently, as I often deal with SF
FANs as well as Mensans (with a high cross-over
between the groups).  As I have discussed before here,
both groups exhibit a high prevalence of symptoms of
Asperger's Syndrome, with its similarities to autism. 
Try to present ANY viewpoint to a group of FANs and at
least one of them will triumphantly find some syntax
error or ambiguity and parade it as a fatal flaw in
the whole idea.

Since it is almost impossible to present any idea
without some ambiguity, depending upon both the
listener's and the presenter's understanding of the
terms, this means that effectively, communication with
such people is nearly impossible, except in terms of
word games, trivia contests and the like, in which
they tend to take great delight, as this IS their
world.  They live in the map, not the territory.

Opposed to that mindset, I have always found it
interesting to assume the presenter is correct and
then extropolate what kind of RW that would imply, as
well as what kind of spinoffs might result.  When this
leads to absurdities, I do not immediately assume that
the presenter is an idiot, which is clearly the
starting mindset for many of the people mentioned
above, but rather that I have made a misinterpretation
of what he or she has said.  I do not assume that the
words uttered are the totality of the idea being
presented, which is rarely - if ever - the case.

Internally, the flow of words in my mind, some subset
of which ends up represented on this media, comes from
a complex of visualizations and internal models,
orientated toward the purpose of the communication and
limited and focused by my understanding of the likely
or desired recipient.  In part, my purpose is often to
clarify or objectify my own thinking.  Being forced to
reduce thought to symbols is extraordinarily useful in
that respect.  But, the words are not the thought, but
rather an abstract formulation of it.

So, imagine an SI that casually creates worlds of
creatures internally, modeling entire constellations
of earths, with all their cultures, etc., as a dream
in the mind of God, perhaps a trivial afterthought. 
As one of those transient dream creatures, can we
really capture that perspective and model it
internally ourselves?

Looks neat.  I have some questions/suggestions:

- I won't flame you for using XP.  :)  Have you tried Windows XP Media 
Center Edition?  (or whatever marketing name they cooked up for it?)

- 802.11b/g/whatever?  GPS for the navigation stuff, sure - but you 
want to be able to take advantage of local hotspots.

- Are you at all worried about the security risks involved with 
wireless keyboards/mouses - or in this particular case do the benefits 
outweigh the risks?

Is the little black box a custom-build or was this a manufactured part 
you found?  Is the display a touch-screen?

IN http://www.extropy.org/exi-lists/extropians/1925.html

gts writes a convincing summary of his findings and suggestions
about the role of motivation within human beings.  But it may be
best to first review his basic contentions that some of us
found problematic.  The following can be found in his message
in the  "Psych/Philo Brains want to cooperate" thread sent Mon
9/2/2002 11:05 PM:

> ...the axiom I proffered was this: 
> "Every human behavior has a motivation."

> No. I never claimed that all motives *had* to be conscious.

First, I must suggest that you try out your axiom

		"Every human behavior has a motivation."

on friends or other people whose judgment you respect, and empirically
determine the extent to which it's found acceptable.  I'll wager that
a lot of people besides Rafal and me find it problematic, and you should
be interested (if I'm right) in why.


Next, in the above nicely written statement from the archives,
you say

We must keep in mind a possible reason for your inclusion in your
statement of this apparent digression:  I presume that you utilize
theoretical findings about reward from "opportunistic behavior"
in your general conclusions.

And of course, everything revolves around what is meant
by "all human motivations".

Now I would most pressingly like to know if such increased
activity is seen when an organism merely avoids unpleasant
stimuli.  For example, a pigeon is conditioned to walk back
and forth between two compartments to obtain enough to eat,
and this behavior settles into a long term routine.  We
monitor the activity in the nucleus accumbens and the levels
of drugs in its brain.  Presumably when first discovering that
he can obtain more food by checking out both rooms at the
end of the corridor, the novelty of the discovery raises
levels.  So I am speaking of months later when a "normal"
level of all this has been reached.

We now cause the right 25% of the corridor to be electrically
charged so that when the pigeon wanders towards the right side
on his path, he receives a painful shock.  The pigeon leans to
keep towards the left.  Does this motivation to avoid the pain
result in increased activity in the nucleus accumbens, or in
increased drug levels?  If it does, then your theory is
bolstered (though not, perhaps, disproved if that's not the
case).

These issues and how we should speak about them appear
to be carefully treated in Joseph LeDoux's book "The
Emotional Brain", which my book group is reading right now.

Yes, the information is key, but you do not appear to
appreciate a common view here that the *information*
is also registered in the remainder of the body outside
the DNA at any *specific* point in time.  For example,
I dare say that if all my DNA ceased being transcribed
into RNA at this very moment, I would have at least a
few minutes before anything untoward occurred.  My body's
protein production and nerve firings would continue
unabated.  Therefore, what is truly *me* can be captured
by a complete analysis of my body excluding my DNA.

More particularly, merely the information recorded in
my *brain* in terms of its memories and potential 
behaviors suffices to re-create me in principle.
Now it's true that I am not being threatened by a 
tiger at this moment, but had one appeared thirty
seconds ago I would have reacted in a way *determined*
entirely, so I claim, by my present brain state.  By
this time, the DNA is no longer *directly* participating
in rendering me.  An analogy:  after the building is
constructed, the blueprints are to some degree no longer
important.

I agree.  What is important about language in this context
is its ability to help us chunk, summarize, create mental

Yes, let us hope that by judicious use of the term or

can be avoided.

I think *your* claim uncontroversial.  I have a great example.
Computer chess programs were the first to completely solve
many extremely complicated chess endings.  One in particular
that fell to programming methods is K+R+B vs. K+N+N.  It turned
out to require in the most difficult position 332 moves for the
side possessing the rook and bishop to checkmate the side 
possessing the two knights.  Now the most peculiar feature of
the process was the way that the King and two knights are 
driven here and there around the board in no apparent pattern.
That is, to a grandmaster (unless he or she has *extensively*
studied the process), no apparent progress has been made
during the first two hundred moves or so.  The position looks
just as difficult and random as the original position did.

This example shows that, just as you are saying I believe,
a wonderful lot of processes defy "chunking".  They exist
as merely random points in a complex solution space, and don't 
appear as points in any simpler space.  Another great example
from science fiction is Vernor Vinge's Skrode Riders.  When
a human examined the circuitry connecting a living Skrode to
its Rider-machine, the human found only a maze of wires not
yielding to chunking analysis---it was implied that no such
higher order explanation even existed for the unbelievably
complex maze of wires.  This was the technology of the Beyond,
where certain kinds of SI's could (perhaps with GAs) come up
with this kind of solution to a problem.  It's a subtle point,
but I do not believe that this contradicts my claim that given
enough time a human being can understand anything that is
understandable.

I think so.  I hope that I have understood you correctly here.

One must be cautious here about the Chinese room.  The whole

of paper around.

This is a different meaning of "in principle" that the one
to which I am accustomed.  One says that in principle any
program could be emulated by a Turing Machine composed of
squares separated by a trillion lightyears on which the
little machine crawls at an infinitesimal speed.  But okay,
I will be wary of using "in principle" without redundancy.

Very well, but with your permission I will continue to 
use "chunking" in this more restricted sense for the 
time being.  ;-)  Thanks for the warning, however.

To fix terms, then, I suppose that the solutions to the chess
problem and "how to connect a Skrode to its rider" can't be
abstracted?  A good phrase eludes me.  Can you improve on
"can't be chunked"?

I have doubt that this situation could exist.  For by 
"understandable" I mean to refer to a real structure
lying within the phenomenon, but perhaps not explicitly.
An *understanding* ferrets out this simpler structure.

For example, Kepler (forgetting for the moment that he
had predecessors such as Ptolemy and Copernicus) saw
through the mass of planetary data to simpler motions,
and described these simple motions in terms of the 
familiar concept of "ellipse".  

*Any* rival abstracting of that data would result in
an isomorphic understanding, and the isomorphism would
be *easily* discerned, far more easily than either of
the abstractions (or chunkings) had been to arrive at
in the first place.

Alert:  Presentation by Ayn Rand Institute defending
the corporation

Phil Osborn 10/05/02

Those of you who have followed the research,
publications and presentations by Anthony Hargis will
be familiar with this from his perspective.  I believe
that my understanding is substantially similar;
however, I do not speak for Anthony but only for
myself:

In brief, there are many people who think of
themselves as defenders of the free market who are
also defenders of the corporation.  They believe that
the corporation is a market phenomenon, and that all
the problems that we have been seeing exemplified on
the morning news, such as WorldCom, ENRON, etc., etc.,
etc., are the result of evil government bureaucrats
and politicians interfering with natural market
processes.  They see the corporate leaders as heros. 
The Ayn Rand Institute is clearly one of this mindset.

In fact, the corporation is a child of the state.  It
is distinguished from free market businesses by the
limited liability, granted by state fiat, which also
provides that corporation with an identity as a
fictitious legal person.  It is the limited liability,
as well as the other state privileges (privi lege 
"private law") which make incorporation so attractive
to businesses.  Where else can one act with virtual
impunity and disregard of long-term consequences?

Yet businesses see themselves without other good
options.  When you can be hit with arbitrarily high
legal judgments, based on some ignorant or biased
jury, or simply be bankrupted by legal costs
themselves, can you or your investors afford to assume
full liability when your competitors take full
advantage of the corporate option?

Among the market alternatives to the corporation is
the "trust."  Trusts were the dominant form of
large-scale business organization through most of the
19th Century. Trusts limited liability to the
Trustees, who had sole responsibility for the actions
of the trust, thus enabling people to invest in shares
of the trust without taking the risk of being wiped
out by lawsuits.

Then a conspiracy of left-wing "Progressives" launched
what was known as "Trust Busting."  Their alleged goal
was to eliminate corruption and the excesses resulting
from the huge resources of the big trusts.  Their real
goal was to create a seamless integration of big
business and the super state. In fact, they were
financed by many of the super rich who owned or
controlled some of the largest trusts or banking
houses.

(Trust busting was but one piece of their great
scheme, which included also compulsory universal state
indoctrination ("Progressive Education"), Prohibition
(the "War on Drugs" now) and an institutionalized
class system, as well as other disasterous plans, all
aimed at eliminating the individual.)

Under the good and ancient common law, everything is a
tort.  People allege damages resulting from the
actions of other people.  The job of the court is to
determine how to set things right, as near as
possible.  It is not the job of the court to promote
or pursue social, religious or political agendas. 
However, the common law cannot survive conquest.  When
the Norman conquered Britain, could they afford to
allow the Anglo Saxons to sue their soldiers?

Yet they had to have a legal system and they needed
public acquiesence, if not support.  So, we got the
bastardized version of the common law that
incorporated elements of "positive law," such as
criminal penalties and punitive damages.  This
perversion of the common law is accepted and
exemplified in the doctrine presented to every
potential juror, that the duty of the jury is to judge
only the facts, not the law of a case.

Under the common law, a trust could be sued like
anyone else, but the damages were limited to the
actual restitution plus costs of the lawsuit.  This is
also consistent with the view of government as limited
to that of a servant assigned the job of protecting
the rights of citizens.  

The Progressives, however, had a grand vision of the
state as a super-organism with its own mysterious
motives and goals.  We individuals were merely the
expendable individual cells of this new creature. 
Positive law was to shape and mold individual behavior
to fit those goals.  People were to be treated like
laboratory rats, shocked (imprisoned) for bad
behavior.

Under the new Progressive deal, the threats of massive
lawsuits and criminal penalties forced businesses into
the corporate fold, where, in return for limited
liability, they gave up sovereignty and accepted
bureaucratic control.  The super-rich supporters of
the "Trust Busting" and corporatization knew that they
would be the puppeteers behind the bureaucrats.  The
supposed new responsibility of the corporations would
boil down to those rules and regulations that gave
them a free hand to despoil and plunder, while keeping
their market competition from ever posing a serious
threat.

Now, if you tried to sue a corporation for polluting
the drinking water, you found yourself blocked by the
courts who often ruled that the corporations were
already covered by statutory positive law.  Instead
of paying the actual damages to all the actual
victims, the corporation would be hit with a slap on
the wrist fine which went to the state.

Neither the state nor anyone else can make pi equal to
3.  Liability does not simply disappear.  If one party
does not take responsibility, then others will be
forced to pay the costs when things go wrong.  While
the corporate model does not mandate that a
businessman act irresponsibly, it encourages that
behavior by reducing the costs.  Those corporations
that take more risks and think more short-term tend to
profit more as well.  Fly-by-night con artists have
the advantage when there is no accountability.

Thus, the $trillion calamity we are now facing from
the corporate criminals was inevitable, inextricably
bound up in the subtle theft implicit in the corporate
model.

I suggest that those of you who have an understanding
of this issue and its importance may want to attend
the lecture whose announcement I have posted.  The Ayn
Rand Institute represents a body of good philosophical
analysis and has a high credibility with millions of
influential people, based on the works of the late Ayn
Rand herself.  I see this position of theirs now as a
mistake on their part, and a perversion of Ayn Rand's
own message, which glorified the individual.  This is
a potential opportunity to correct that mistake, or at
least force them to take notice.

and function of the corporation, check out <www.johntaylorgatto.com>.

Here is an imaginary discussion with the (by now great) mathematician
who has "understood" the result of his trillion year inquiry.

Us:   What do you know?  What was it about?

Him:  I now know when X implies Y under a huge variety
      of possible conditions.

Us:   Can you tell us anything about X and Y?

Him:  Of course, practically my whole brain is packed with
      chunking information about X and Y.  X is that under
      conditions A, B, C, D, E, and quite a few more that
      I'd have to look at my notes about, X is the case.
      Y little more complicated.  And if you ask me about
      A, or B, etc., you will find that my understanding
      recurses to a degree unimaginable to one of Earth's
      finest historians or mathematicians of your era.

Us:   Well, just out of curiosity, how long did it take the
      the SIs to get the result, historically?  And how do
      you answer the charge that your trillion-year project
      was not challenging enough?  Aren't there *other*
      things that they know but that you don't have the
      capacity to even state, let alone *ever* know the
      proofs of?

Him:  An SI in 2061 determined the result that X implies Y.
      As for more difficult projects, I'm eager to begin,
      of course, but in principle there are no projects
      *beyond* me, and for this reason:  Those things that
      the SIs know that I cannot understand are not, in
      essence, understandable by them either.  Those are
      things that just "work", like that old chess puzzle
      of K+R+B vs. K+N+N, or the weather.  Now, one of my
      SI friends can tell you the weather almost instantly
      on an Earth-like planet given some initial conditions
      ---he basically just simulates it---and often in my
      discussions with them, it *does* feel like they
      "understand" things that I cannot.

      But hell, they don't *understand* the chess solution
      or exactly how my brain tells my arm to move any
      better than I do.

Yes.

Of course.  But this is not what we are discussing.

Here is where I hope that my dialog above addressed your point.
I say that so long as the ideas are chunkable, all the human
needs is a lot of paper, patience, time, energy, and motivation.

Yes.  But I am of course submitting that the human has
for a trillion years engaged in more than acting like
at Turing machine.

Yes, and I am hoping (in order to avoid being wrong) that
anything worthy of being deemed *understandable* by anything
falls to the perseverance of my extremely idealized human
being.

Apparently the human has chunked two high-level regularities in the 
process being simulated, with these regularities known as "X" and "Y". 
Suppose that the regularities are chunkable but not humanly chunkable? 
For example, suppose that X and Y both exceed the simultaneous 
representation capacity of the human brain, while nonetheless being highly 
compressible relative to the system being simulated?  Suppose that an SI 
manipulated the concepts describing X and Y with easy facility, tinkering 
with them, recombining them, seeing them as a part of a whole and a whole 
made of parts, where to a human X and Y are not even conceivable as 
concepts, even though the human can (given infinite time and paper) stand 
in as a CPU in a system simulating a mind which understands those concepts?

That is my reply to your discussion: you are giving a case where the human 
*does* understand high-level regularities of the result, and I am replying 
with a case where the human does not and cannot understand high-level 
regularities of the result that are readily comprehensible to an SI.

Again, you are giving an example of a situation where the entire project, 
no matter how huge, happens to have a holistic structure consisting of 
human-sized concepts broken down into a humanly comprehensible number of 
humanly comprehensible concepts, and so on, turtles all the way down. 
Yes, this *specific* type of inordinately huge simulation is 
comprehensible to a human with infinite swap space.  But this seems to me 
to characterize an infinitesimal proportion of the space of possibilities.

And here, again, we see a very carefully selected scenario.  Let's suppose 
that there are no regularities in KRB vs. KNN.  I'd bet you're wrong, 
actually, and that an SI going over the solution, or, heck, an ordinary 
seed AI, would readily perceive regularities in the solution.  Whether a 
human would be able to understand these regularities, if the AI explained 
them, is an interesting question; I'd bet on some, but not all.

But let's suppose the solution were incompressible.  Let's also suppose 
that this solution pattern is, itself, a regularity in another problem. 
Let's suppose that it's one of an ecology of, say, 1,000,000 similar 
regularities in that problem set which the SI has found convenient to 
chunk, out of an explosive combinatorial space of, say, 300! possible 
regularities.  I submit to you that a human being simulating an SI 
exploring that problem set will:

1)  Never independently chunk all the regularities that the SI perceives;
2)  Never independently chunk even a single one of those regularities;
3)  Be similarly unable to chunk the SI's *perception* of the regularity 
by examining the SI's low-level bit state, even given infinite time.

Why?  Because the individual elements of the SI's cognitive process are 
simply too large for a human to understand, not just as a single concept, 
but even using the full power of human abstract understanding.  Stack 
overflow.

I reply that the class of systems humanly chunkable into human-sized 
sub-regularities arranged in a holonic structure of humanly understandable 
combinatorial complexity, is a tiny subset of the set of possible systems 
with chunkable regularity, holonic structure, and compressible 
combinatorial complexity.

This thing is the size of a hardback book / external cd drive and very

around, but since then I've found a 7", although much more expensive.

What if intelligence is really a matter of debits and credits rather than
a single bi-polar scale? Thus there would be an Intelligence Quotient as
well as a Stupidity Quotient and the NET is what would count. Maybe Alien
machine-intelligences are afraid that Human Stupidity will run amok over
the cosmos.

Ack, ack!

There are a number of assertions in this article I have problems with,
but I'll quickly offer two.  The author seems to suggest that the legal
institution of the limited liability corporation arose as a result of
the late 19th century "trust busters" and their attack on the legal tool
of the trust.  But the corporation in more or less its modern form
predates that by some time (although there continues to be fine-tuning
through the present day). In fact the institution of limited liability
legal vehicles for sheltering investment reaches back very, very far,
indeed.  In one instance, the legal personification of the ship and the
phenomenon of "general average" in admiralty law, those roots reach back
to the 16th century at least, and probably earlier.

Second, I would say that the primitivist notion of the common law, and
the implied picture of the pristine (i.e. pre-Norman) jury as judge of
both law and fact is simplistic at best.  Anglo-Saxon juries surely had
elders who were looked to on matters of customary law with greater
deference than others, and I'd say that presages the role of the judge
in the more mature form of the common law we know today.  As someone who
often has to deal with educating people whose cultural background does
not include the Anglo-American common law system, I can tell you that
the distinctive features of the common law are still quite alive and
well within broad spheres of our legal system.

In my little essay I made five *claims*, see

I'm not even sure what "it" refers to in your first

most of my five claims are preposterous?  Would you
mind saying what is it about each claim you disagree
with?

I thought that I made it clear that while desirable,
those two "goals"  ("just get along", "learn to be
more rational..."), are effectively nothing more than
platitudes.

One might as well spread the meme, "Be nice to others".
Won't do no fucking good, IMHO.  Indeed I wrote

It would be nice if you could offer a helpful 
explanation.  I guess that the mystery you are
referring to is my lack of understanding as to
why people repeat inane homilies (or so they 
seem to me).

Also, I *sincerely* would appreciate criticism of my
opinions concerning people's motivations in general.
Apparently you've noticed some opinions I hold in this
regard that don't seem correct.  I am quite serious in
needing to unearth so far as is possible the reasons
that I may misunderstand people's motivations, especially
as concerns "What is Accomplished by Debate".

Thanks,

Jeff and Lee are debating exactly how
*wrong* one side or the other will
turn out to be in the 18th-21st ideo-
logical struggle between left and right.

Basically, Lee says that neither
side is factually incorrect about
anything; that the base of the
disagreement is quite deep on
all issues.

Jeff agrees that on *some* issues
this is the case, such as, for
example, the degree to which economic
inequality is unacceptable.  On other
issues, however, Jeff insists that
the issue of values doesn't *not*
play a significant role, and the
right are derelict in their
responsibility to face the facts.
One such issue is "global executive
homicide".

Such, anyway, is Lee's (my) summary
of the debate so far, and Jeff is
invited to edit and correct the
above remarks.

Naturally, I totally agree, but for

Well, Jeff, that's a credible accusation
against those who are said to hold power
in Western society:  corporation exe-
cutives, politicians, heads of government
bureaus, and so on.  But it seriously
fails to address the millions and millions
of people---perhaps 5-30 percent of the
population, who adopt conservative views
despite the personal payoff.  I once myself
voted *against* a proposal that would have
benefited me as a college student, because
of principle.  The measure passed anyway,
IIRC, and I accepted the government assistance.

Your examples are good, and I stand 
corrected.

This is incredible.  Now you, Jeff, 
appear to be taking my position, and
I yours!  I claim that within our
debating community (say the Anglo-
sphere) only misinformation-information prevented
liberals from sooner recognizing Stalin
as wrong.  Had they been convinced 
early on of his decimation of the
Russian people, and the complete
phoniness of the show trials of 1936,
they would never have defended him.

Likewise, some American conservatives
defended Hitler because he was an
ardent anti-communist, but quickly
changed their minds in 1940 and 1941.
Later, when the extent of Hitler's
crimes became more widely known,
I'm sure there was embarrassment.

;-) it's a little confusing when you
say 'our'.  One might think that you
mean "the left"!

We have debated (a little) who was
right about Vietnam.  Naturally my
side submits comparisons such as

  My Lai:    300 people killed
  Khe Sahn:  6000 people killed

and determines that America and its
allies are less blameworthy than
their opponents in general.  Listen,
I'm sure that this is immensely
frustrating, but do you seriously
question that conservatives actually
believe this?  Or do you think that
they have succumbed merely to "my
country right or wrong" or to the
profit motive?  What about Australian
right-wingers, or what about Polish
conservative thinkers who ideologically
line up with the West?  What are their
motives?

> The Russkies shoot down Flt 007

I totally agree with you here:  the
Russians, it turns out, made a nasty
mistake, and so did the Americans.
Now, as to whether the Russian *mistake*
was in part due to a coldness of a pilot
and his commanding officer, I can only
surmise.  And as for the American error,
I have no information at all.  Not that
it matters, because I'm agreeing with
you here.

> Osama kills three thousand Americans

Well, to some.  But phrases used in
the newspapers should not be attributed
to your ideological adversaries like me.

Since I'm not a child, ;-) you imply 
that my intellect is corrupted.  I, on
the other hand, suggest that we have
each merely keep ingesting facts in
accordance with our prior views for
such a long time that our positions
seem eminently reasonable to each of
us.

Of course, conservatives claim that
Communist totalitarianism did the
job in Cambodia, and that what happened
to the South Vietnamese was so bad that
actions taken to prevent it were in
principle justified.  Yes, I know you
disagree; but that's merely because 
you've ingested and incorporated certain
facts and have judged certain other facts
to be of less salience, just as I have.
That's all, isn't it?  Or do you seriously
believe that my intellect is damaged (and
it's *perfectly* all right to be honest
here, as I will not be offended).

You also have to account for the strange
fact that the followers of Chomsky
constitute an amazingly small percent.
They are probably outnumbered even by
those who agree with Buchanan on almost
everything.

How does it happen that the writings
of Chomsky appeal to *you* so *very*
much, but only perhaps, say, to one
in ten people on this list?

Now, Jeff, to answer my own question
concerning libertarianism, I will
say this:  the reasons that only 5%
of the people display much in the
way of libertarian sympathies are
basically that (1) free-market
economics are not widely understood
by people at large, and (2) the
libertarians share the value of
self-reliance to an unusual
extent in the general population.

We are at loggerheads here, then, 
because your explanations reduce
to iterations of the wrong-doing
of the other side.  (Not that that
is necessarily objectionable by
you.)

;-)  We shall have to discuss the
existence of the "ruling class".
I don't happen to believe there
is such a thing.  I actually would
enjoy you starting a separate
thread about it.

Yes; though we must not forget those
on this list who are so inured to
the "absurdities" of the other side,
so despairing of reconciliation, that
they merely exchange cheap shots with
each other.  I could name names... ;-)
but your name and mine would not be
among them.

That's okay!  But we must get to the
truth of our views here.  I won't
hold it against you ONE BIT if you
think that all conservatives, including
me, are brain damaged.  You are entitled
to your opinion!  ;-)

I would like very much to hear
more.  Now I think that Patrick
J. Buchanan is out of his skull
on most issues, but I don't think
him flaky.  Hmm.  Examples?

Nope, you got me there.  In our bi-
polar world of the 1960's that 
wouldn't have made it into the
American history books---he was
an ally.  However, I'm not at all
surprised to hear it, given what
I know about Chaing's ruthlessness.

All of these discussions are difficult for me to follow. Doesn't problem 
solving depend on problem depth? The problem depth for us is simple, (1) 
universal extropy and cosmological continuation and (2) individual life 
extension and bodily control. Also, I don't know why there is such continued 
discussion about human abilities. Totally indidvidually, we might take 100 
billion years to solve some problems (if we lived that long). But we haven't 
evolved individually. Very shortly we'll have human boosting to an extent, 
and this will precede the FASI, so now what you are talking about is the 
maximum computing power a human-appearing (roughly) person of human origin 
with add-ons and add-ins can have. That's probably of the order of billions 
more in theory but this is only likely to be implemented after the FASI 
which is fairly soon, so it's applicable. Anyhow, I'd argue some problems 
are easy. For example, monitoring every organism in the biosphere without 
blanket molecular nanosupercomputers may be a hard problem (if you want to 
solve it) but monitoring the average daily temperature variation of the 
Earth may be an easy problem. Or monitoring the total estimated biomass of 
the 3 big sectors (land/sea/underground) may be easy too. Etc. Finally I'd 
also argue that some problem-solving is impossible if you're ethical, and 
nor would you want to solve it if you're ethical. For example, I would never 
want to "solve" the "problem" of how to torture my "enemies" or "evil" 
people for all eternity against their will.

 If you had carefully read the web page that Chris pointed us to, you
would have seen clear signs that you are attacking a straw man. That page
qualifies the claim that racial classifications are nonsense by saying:
   Please understand that I do not claim that the concept of ``race'' is
   totally meaningless.
and endorses the classification of some people as members of minority
and majority races for the purposes of detecting discrimination.
 I suspect that the word "nonsense" is being used in some sophisticated
sense that you and I have not yet grasped.  Until we can understand how
this claim of nonsense manages to invalidate some uses of classification
but leaves others unaffected, we shouldn't claim to understand Chris'
claim well enough to determine what is wrong with it.

Boeing (actually Rocketdyne) gets tapped to work on reactor
propulsion schemes:

http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n0210/06boeingpower/

And there is a new book out titled "StarDrive Engineering".
Makes my eyes roll as soon as the review mentions "faster-than-light"
speeds -- but some of you engineering types might want to take a
more serious look:

Only from a short term state analysis perspective.  I would
say "Robert Bradbury" is a collection of memories and a vector
into the future.  If your DNA is currently required to
retain those memories and drive you into the future I
would suggest that you not discard it so easily.

Yes, at least I and many others on the list would agree
(I hope) that your neural interconnect map will reproduce
Lee Corbin.  (Now, why we would ever want to do that
given the grief he has caused over the last couple of
months is beyond my imagination...  but I digress... :-))

Hmmm.... Can we set this up on a loop -- Lee Corbin's

Ah Ha, but as the WTC investigations have shown having the blueprints
are essential to understanding why something comes apart (or how
it was put together).  Don't we need the Lee Corbin blueprints to
explain how the construct produced by those blueprints can create
such a disruption in the force?

Jesus H. fuckin Christ!  (Pardon my language here).  I read this over
three times before I think I groked it.  And while I generally agree
the question I have to ask is "are there more than a dozen people
on the planet who can understand this statement?"

We complain about how the extropian list is a focus of narrow
minded debates -- and then we compliment this with discussions
whose roots are so deep that we would all be digging for days
to uncover them.

Now I lay me down to sleep.  Pray the lord my soul to keep.

I'm thrown by the word "holonic".  For many possible meanings, the assertion 
is true.   I want to say obviously true, but what I mean it true due to 
analysis at the level of propositional calculus (mostly) ... it wasn't 
obvious at first or second reading, because it was complex.  And without 
knowing the meaning of holonic, I can't decide whether it's a small subset or 
(possibly) an identity.  I.e., it's unchunkable.

Sorry.  "Holonic" refers to the way in which a thing can be simultaneously 
a whole composed of parts, and a part in a larger whole.  Due to 
Koestler's "The Ghost in the Machine".

A recurring theme arises:

The skewed distribution of intelligence and interests on this list tends
often to create ultra-narrowminded displays of technical virtuosity, at
least in the mind of the presenter, and often for some of the audience as
well, and this can be great fun.  I personally feel a thrill seeing a
concept expressed concisely and elegantly (unabashedly exposing my
geekness.)

On the other hand, such presentations ***often fail to connect*** with their
intended audience.  I'm guessing many of us on the Extropian list have
experienced this, when we've presented a conceptual jewel with clarity and
laser-like focus, and have in return received a blank look or sensed that
the audience feels we are being arrogant, showing off, or -- perhaps
distressingly -- that *we* don't get it.

At that point, how we proceed depends on our broader goals.

-- Sometimes it's for entertainment.  We enjoy sharing and bouncing ideas
off each other in an arena of common interests.

-- Sometimes it's for self improvement.  We want to test and sharpen our
understanding.

-- Sometimes we believe we are acting to build a better future.

Practically speaking, it's often a combination of these goals, and others.
Part of the "signal to noise" problem often expressed on this list is that
people come to the discussion with different goals, but don't recognize the
other person's goals.

Too often we have a tendency to focus our lasers on what we see as the
faults in another person's arguments or their world view, thinking that just
a bit more precision and accuracy will provide the needed illumination.  The
fallacy is that usually this effort is being applied to attacking and
defending the wrong target.

Is the goal of a discussion to present something like a mathematical proof,
or is it to share understanding with another person? Generally, the
intersection of these two sets is very sparse.

My suggestion is that people consider this, and when they feel that a
discussion is unproductive, or that they're just not connecting, change
tactics. Try first to establish some commonality of understanding, perhaps
offlist so as to reduce distractions, and then come back to the original
goal of the discussion.

Obviously, this doesn't always work.  Sometimes people don't have the
necessary background to effectively discuss an issue but are unaware of it.
Sometimes people are coming from such different world views, or have such
non-compatible motivations that discussion is unproductive.  In those cases,
discussion and debate can still be useful, but consider whether some portion
might be more appropriate offlist.

For effective communication, it's important to know your audience, and build
from a basis of common understanding.

Well, this probably comes across like preaching, which would certainly be
inappropiate, and not intended.  I hope it's not taken that way.  My hope is
that these thoughts may resonate with others, and lead to some small
improvement in the quality of communication and understanding.

There are a few more than there were before I made the statement.  My work

At this point Robert has, for completely inexplicable
reasons wandered into potentially libelous areas.

As for the grief caused, it has been entirely in the
minds of certain other posters, where, um, it belongs.
Hmm.  I guess that's always true of grief.

Further inflammatory and exceedingly uncharitable
provocations will only increase my already overwrought
indignation, and not only will they go into the 
personal dossier I have on you, but will be forwarded
to my lawyer as well for appropriate legal action.

Beyond *uncharitable*, these suggestions now clearly
border on the criminally psychotic and sadistic, and
(especially if Mike Lorrey is right about characters
in fiction actually *really* suffering when bad things
happen to them), the prospect that I may indeed one
day suffer (or am already suffering!) at the hands of
those who may take your suggestion at face value  has
begun to engender in me an urge to revenge.

Yes (waxing serious for a moment), as DNA is a "recipe" for
the construction of a human, it probably indeed does contain
a valuable condensation about one.  This strengthens the
analogy to blueprints, in just the way you've explained
via the WTC.

I was afraid that someone would make that
interpretation.  However, the post was actually a copy
of a single page designed to be posted on a physical
bulletin board at Anthony L. Hargis & Co. next to a
printout of the Ayn Rand Institute announcement.  I
couldn't fit everything I could have said on that page
by a long shot.

On the other hand, it did potentially start a
discussion; whereas, if I HAD somehow managed to
include every possible qualification, then probably I
would be left wondering if anyone actually read the
post.  

Which suggests another possibility: I wonder if there
is an easy way for readers to check off which posts
they have actually read, to be stored at the Extropy
site?  This would provide a record of sorts as to
which subjects and posters are of most interest to the
most readers.  Eventually, such information could be
collated into a predictive algorythm such as that used
by Amazon.  Such an algorythm, standardized or
filtered, could become a universal search system.  (I
designed a much more sophisticated version of this
system back in the early '80's BTW, in case anyone is
interested.)

Anyway, in response to Greg's post, I am well aware
that corporations as such have existed for hundreds of
years prior to the "Trust Busting."  My understanding
is that they were relatively rare in the U.S. - as
opposed to other forms of business organization -
prior to the organized Progressive jihad on the
trusts.

<Sat Oct 05 2002 - 17:35:35 MDT, Greg Burch
(gregburch@gregburch.net) responded to my post:
<... The author seems to suggest that the legal 
institution of the limited liability corporation arose
as a result of the late 19th century "trust busters"
and their attack on the legal tool 
of the trust. But the corporation in more or less its
modern form predates that by some time (although there
continues to be fine-tuning through the present day).

In fact the institution of limited liability 
legal vehicles for sheltering investment reaches back
very, very far, indeed. In one instance, the legal
personification of the ship and the phenomenon of
"general average" in admiralty law, those roots reach
back to the 16th century at least, and probably
earlier.
...>

I'm not an expert in this area, altho I do know people
who are.  My understanding of the position that many
of them have taken is that somehow "Admiralty Law" has
superceded the common law in most of the courts in the
U.S.  In some cases whose details I have long
forgotten, I have heard them tell of specifically and
successfully challenging jurisdiction on this basis. I
suspect that this is all related to the issue of the
legitimacy of the corporation as such.

The argument against the corpoation as such, however,
does not rely upon historical data for its validity. 
I like to be able to trace every major concept I
introduce to a concrete example or at least a pointer
in that direction, but the abstract argument is
inherently capable of standing on its own.  

Liability is a fact, just like the law of gravity. 
People can agree to share liability via various
contractual mechanisms such as insurance, etc., but
that doesn't make it go away.  People make decisions
based on risk factors.  Reducing liability alters the
payoff stats and will result in different decisions on
a statistical basis.

Artificially reducing liability at the point of a gun
means inevitably that people will take chances that
would not be economically justified if they had to
face full liability.  Statistically, this means that
losses will occur that would not have in a free
market, and that those responsible for those losses
will be shielded from the effects, while other people
whose choices were curtailed by the market distortions
will end up footing the bill.

That analysis alone should be sufficient to damn the
corporate model.  Of course, it gets much worse than
that when you tie in the banking complex, with its
enormous concentrated interest power to influence
state policy, and the military/industrial complex, and
the military/industrial/academic complex.  This whole
empire of pull, to borrow a term from Rand, protects
itself from its errors by control over the money
supply, military force and a lock via patents and
copyrights on intellectual property usually financed
at least in part by taxpayer funding of academia.

Given the enormous productive overcapacity that we
humans have in general, multiplied by all the new
technologies, it takes a whole LOT of errors to sink
even so inherently corrupt a system as described
above.  It appears that we may have reached that
point, however.  

The risks are paying off negatively in terms of things
like destruction of the bio-capacity of the planet, or
the extremely wasteful use of inherently scarce
resources such as oil.  The top-down Progressive model
of compulsory state education has steadily declined
over the past century+ in terms of producing educated
people, despite all kinds of advances in
education-related technology.  The rewarding of risky
behavior in high finance has reached the point of a
possible general financial implosion.  The U.S.
military is incapable of forcing the Chinese and a
host of eager competitors from stealing every piece of
the ill-gotten corporate intellectual property,
hamstringing only responsible U.S. companies.  I could
go on, but you get the picture, I hope.

****

Regarding the common law, I know that for most of its
history in Northern Europe, especially Anglo-Saxon
England, it consisted mostly of the application of
local precedent.  Originally it literally meant "the
law of the commons," as distinguished from the
contractual relations that people enjoyed relative to
their own private property.  Of course, people can
disagree about the interpretation of contracts or
refuse to honor them, at which point their behavior
may invoke the commons law, as such involves everyone
by implication.  From local precedent defining what
behavior was permissable on public land to general
legal/ethical principles of property and contract was
doubtless a long and ongoing evolution, but the
general principle was that the jury was soveriegn and
that restitution was the goal.

This is and was incompatible with any system of
conquest or general institutionalized theft as with
the corporate state.

Outside of the Penrose camp I don't believe there are any
that would seriously suggest it (and even they don't suggest
DNA per se).  *But* if you look at Guarante's work on the
topic of histone acetylation/deactylation there may be some
relation between the "state" of the DNA and its ability to
perform its normal "function" in both thought and memory
storage (in constructing neural interconnects).  I would
suspect the effects might be felt over days or weeks so
they would be rather subtle.  [Note -- Guarante's work
doesn't directly relate to intelligence in any way --
I'm speculating based on the general mechanisms of gene
regulation.]

Until we have a completely right-wing set of principles

I'm not absolutely certain, but I think my lawyers are

Revenge away.  Its only useful if you have determined the
recipient either (a) not inflicted greater pain on themselves
already and (b) has the capacity to feel pain.  [I assume you
have noticed the various Zen derived statements I drop into
my posts from time to time...]

A sword must become one with the wind before it can strike at its heart.

Agreed.  What isn't clear at this point is how much state
information there might be outside of the long term blueprint
level of DNA and the physical neural network.   If Calvin's
brain architecture speculations are correct, then consciousness
may be a very chaotic process of sets of neurons gaining control
of the "operating system" -- that in turn could involve some
very subtle gene expression/protein translation effects.  (e.g.
What if a set of neurons in one part of your brain, programmed
to think one particular meme set became particularly efficient
at sucking up glucose and producing ATP?)  [This is pure speculation
mind you.]

Talking about the "holonic structure" of a process is a faster way of 
referring to "the way in which the process has bottom-up structure in 
which elements come together to form systems and top-down structure in 
which systems can be decomposed into elements, depending on which 
direction you're looking at it from".  That this is true of a great many 
processes does not make it an unimportant truth.

Actually, since most ISPs are no longer accepting email from
open relays spammers have started moving on to other tricks.

The most common trick is to use an open socks or http proxy
to connect to the mail server running on that same machine
and deliver the message that way.  Too many ISPs aren't
blocking mail from open proxies yet...

> Drying out the open relays has proved to be difficult.

But blocking email from them is easy and usually without
negative sideeffects.  If the administrator of the server
cares he'll secure the setup and the spam will stop.


All the "but blocking mail from open relays interferes
with my freedom of speech" people should pack up and go
home, too.  I have no obligation to accept anybody's
email, so I am free to accept or refuse email from anybody
or anywhere for any reason, even without a reason.

My server, my rules.

Of course, the same goes for ISPs, except that they make
their clients angry if (1) too much spam gets through or
(2) too much legitimate email doesn't get through.  This
business detail balances how agressive the blocking is,
but legally it's still only about property right. Their
server, their property, their rules.

kind regards,

The closest we have to that is that BBS interface to the list messages records 
how many times a thread has been viewed through the BBS (if someone wants there 
to be a record that they viewed messages in that thread, they'd have to also 
open it at the BBS, instead of just in their email inbox).

While looking at stuff relating to the stardrive system mentioned I found 
the following article which was interesting which deals with the fluctuating 
quantum vacuum as a power source for interstellar flight and also notes:

"With regard to the extraction of energy from the vacuum fluctuation energy 
reservoir, there are no energetic or thermodynamic constraints preventing 
such release under certain conditions. And, in fact, there are analyses in 
the literature that suggest that such mechanisms are already operative in 
Nature in the "powering up" of cosmic rays, or as the source of energy 
releases from supernovas and gamma-ray bursts. For our purposes, the 
question is whether ZPE can be "mined" at a level practical for use in space 
propulsion. Given that ZPE energy density is conservatively estimated to be 
on the order of nuclear energy densities or greater, it would constitute a 
seemingly ubiquitous energy supply, a veritable "Holy Grail" energy source."

re StarDrive Engineering:

Mark Tomion, President of Archer Enterprises and inventor of the 
recently-patented Electrodynamic Field Generator, is very pleased to 
announce that he has signed a Joint Venture Agreement with Affirm Technology 
Partners of California to build a working prototype of his over-unity 
'StarDrive' device's electric power output variant. The co-developers plan 
to commence construction of an air-cooled StarDrive Generator unit with a 
projected output rating of 24kW and a housing diameter of only 30 inches, at 
a total weight of well under 50 lbs., before the end of November 2002

Nice. This the heart of modularity + the argument for maximum possible
complexity; we can understand a thnig only so large, and we can combine such
maximal pieces into a system only so complex (although I'd say we could
continue combining larger level groupings out to about the same order). I
agree that the set of understandable things contains many elements which are
either composed of irreducable pieces that are too hard for humans, or
pieces that are combined in too complex a fashion, or both. But then, I've
done a lot of work (unfortunately) as a maintenance programmer, so I *know*.

This is one of the interesting facets of the calculation intensive
approaches to problem solving (eg: genetic algorithms, neural nets, etc);
they may be able to solve problems that we never will solve by hand, because
of the argument above, but we'll never understand how they do it below the
meta-level (barring intelligence augmentation). In fact, even including
augmentation, I propose that the set of things that an intelligence can
understand will always be less the set of all theoretically understandable
things, if that intelligence is based in the framework that it is trying to
understand. Now I'm just godelling around, I fear.

On the programming side, for those who read "A Deepness in the Sky", the
ziphead coders were examples of entities who produced non (unaltered) human
understandable code. For some reason the ziphead lifestyle is bizzarely
attractive to me.

A holon is a bounded chunk with an identifiable systemic function. It is
usually made of smaller holons, and forms part of a larger holon: it is a
holistic atom. I attribute this very useful coinage to Arthur Koestler; it
is deployed vigorously in his great book THE ACT OF CREATION.

Come on Spike, Doug, John -- where's the QC on this list?  I post something
that could be completely off the wall -- we have list members digging into
it in depth and no voices of doubt or even outrage?

Now I lay me down to sleep -- pray the lord my soul to keep
(because the miscreants left on the planet don't deserve to
get a chance to play with it).

Robert, this does look interesting, with the caveat
that we see stuff like this all the time; seldom
does it prove out to be feasible.

I just got back from a weekend boating on Lake Tahoe
with friends, then went this evening and bought an
antique motorcycle, which is in hurting need of some
basic TLC.  Ive been having a ball, but it is a busy
time.  {8-]  spike

And do they give any references to this literature, any arguments and
especially any evidence for this? Breaking the laws of thermodynamics is
a far bigger thing than any stardrive.

What are the reasons, or obstacles, that keep 
Saddam Hussein from taking his case directly
to the people of Europe and North America?

It would seem to me that he would have a lot
to gain from clever presentations that tell
his (or Iraq's) side of the story.

In response I can only ironically say my post was in response to another one 
as I said at the start of my post?!. I did not originate this discussion!!! 
Someone else mentioned this book and all I did was mention the guy is 
supposedly building a prototype. I am no expert on physics and cannot 
comment on the supposed craft or its design, although I am sceptical since I 
could find little other mention of it.

However, on a RELATED issue Anders Sandberg mentions in response to my quote 
from a symposium article/stuff held at the University of Sussex (on quantum 
fluctuation as a power source) that they are talking about breaking the laws 
of thermodynamics. I don't think the article or synopsis claims this. I 
think they fully believe in it (the laws of thermodynamics). They do include 
references. These are not amateur anti=gravity people, these are from the 
IASA.

As an extropians I am interested in alternative power sources.

Being a crazy Texan, I was attracted to *this* subject!  Interestingly,
while I can see why they picked this area to launch rockets (it can pass
for some of the harsher and more arid parts of Mars), you could actually
launch from farther south in Texas and go out over the Gulf and only
pass over Florida on your way up.  I think there was actually a group
trying to establish a "spaceport" on this basis down by Corpus Christi
back in the hey-day of private launch initiatives in the 90s, but I
haven't heard of it since.

As for hitting New Orleans -- it would probably be an improvement ...

His musical is actually doing well, and reviews of his books have
been glowing: http://www.reason.com/0207/co.cf.rant.shtml

Seriously, I don't think he really sees the great use of television as a
tool in international politics; he gives me the impression of a
traditional arab-socialist tactician rather than a modern media
manipulator. External threats doesn't really worry him, since they
provide the necessary threat to hold together his own regime. It is a
bit like Mugabe: it doesn't matter if your people starve and the economy
goes down the drain, as long as you can stuff your pockets and keep
everybody in line. :-(

I know!  I know!

I grew up in the N.O. area, and what would happen is that they would throw
a party!

When I was growing up, oil refinaries with some regularity would blow up
in Luling (just up river).  Huge flames would rise hundreds of feet into
the air for hours or days.  And what would we do?  Thousands of people
would gather on the levee on the opposite side of the river and set up the
bar-b-ques, play games, or just sit back in lawn chairs drinking beer and
enjoy the spectacle.  Street vendors would start hawking souvenirs and
food, and street performers would come from the Quarter and do their acts.

They don't call it the Big Easy for nothing...

Puthoff is likely no crackpot, but he is doing fringe science - it could
be right, but is largely being done outside the normal academic
channels, published to a great extent in special journals devoted to this
particular brand of field theory and so on. The important thing is: does
the proposed hypothesis produce any testable outcomes, and does these
outcomes occur? The paper mentioned just one experiment, which so far has
failed. 

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. Or at least that they
follow from well-tested theories.

As for thermodynamics, if you can use ZPE to do useful work then it
would have to be adjusted. You could start with an isothermal box,
activate a small ZPE-powered spaceship to fly around at the end of a
string, and in the end get a warmer box. This could be used to build a
lot of thermodynamics-breaking devices, like super-Carnot heat engines
etc. Of course, one might argue that some kind of resource is used up
and the real boundary of the system has to include the vaccum fields
too. But if thermodynamics is extended to vacuum field fluctuations one
has to explain why they haven't reached thermal equilibrium with the
rest of the universe by now - it seems very unlikely that there would
remain a convenient heat reservoir if any interaction with matter
existed.

 I guess it's going to be harder than I expected to pin down whether or
not you disagree with Robin. Possibly some agents within your mind disagree
and others agree.
 Your apparent claim that value differences are the explanation for left-right
debates implied to me that you were rejecting Robin's explanation, but now
you have rephrased it to avoid implying that.
 This statement: 
>So if I'm already in possession of some explanation as to why

 looks to me like a partial rejection of Robin's theory. Certainty that
someone else is wrong appears to indicate that the allegedly wrong person
is actually wrong less frequently than it indicates that the person who
claims to be certain is overestimating his abilities, so I ought to
assume that I normally can't justify the conclusion that someone else
is certainly wrong. And I don't understand why Robin's trick would be
inapplicable if I can't justify the conclusion that the other person is
certainly wrong.
 Your apparently inability to come up with an explanation for the persistent
exhortations that people should "just get along" is another small piece of
evidence that you are biased against nonaltruistic/unflattering explanations
of people's behavior. (My guess is that the biggest single cause of such
exhortations is a desire to show membership in a group that holds allegedly
altruistic beliefs such as "seeking agreement causes valuable cooperation".
I also suspect you underestimate the effectiveness of such exhortations at
producing conformity. Presumably some people benefit from conformity.)

>Would you spell this out please?  In some sentence like, "Lee

 Yes. Robin's belief in the importance of idea futures and of economists
causes him to be more biased than most people towards the theory that people
act more selfishly than they realize. The effort you have put into debates
biases you into overestimating the degree to which people listen to each
other's logic. There are probably other biases of this nature which also
contribute to the disagreement.

 Robin seems to have a clear argument that value differences fail to
explain the lack of objectivity (i.e. unbiased weighing of the evidence
pertaining to factual questions) in ideological debates. I thought you
started this (or a related thread) in an attempt to explain that lack,
and it looked like you were implying that value differences explain the
question you asked about objectivity.
 Upon rereading your earlier messages, I see that you are emphasizing
different things when referring to objectivity than Robin would, which
might indicate that I misunderstood what you are referring to. But if
that's the case, I suspect I will want to argue that you are confused
about something.

Why not a TV soap opera, ala The Sopranos, called "The Husseins"?
We can glamorize the life of a leader of people and air it weekly ...

Anyone who tries to use the issuance of a patent or the acquisition
of venture capital as evidence of credibility is immediately suspect.
Any idiot can get a patent on anything, and even in these post-dotcom
days, venture capital is still controlled by people who are susceptible
to a good sales pitch and don't understand much physics.  They may well
have something here, but the fact that they try to use such tactics in
the press releases should raise red flags.

Hello everyone,

I just realized the url I provided is not working, so I decided to simply post the text here.  Anyone who wants to can look up The Society for Venturism on a search engine and quickly find the actual pdf document on our website.  In fact, I would recommend doing that because of the other excellent articles there.

We recently got our sign!  I don't think anyone driving by is going to miss spotting it. lol!  Getting it up was quite a job.  

Sixteen trees of various types now grace the front of the resort.  I look forward to seeing them grow to their full-size over the next decade or two. : )

David Pizer has good reason to think of Creekside as his pride and joy.  And we are just in the first phase of things!    

Again, I wish to invite everyone to our cryonics bash which will be Sunday, October 26th.  Dr. Jerry Lemler will be the honored speaker and he can be fun.  If we loosen him up enough he may even sing for us!  At one time he considered a career as a professional musician, but medicine won out.   

I hope my article below helps convince some of you to come by.  For Ventureville to become a reality, we will need the support of the Extropian community.  

very best wishes,

John Grigg

My adventure in Arizona so far!

Roughly a month ago I ventured forth from the cooling down climes 
of Anchorage, Alaska to start off on my Arizona adventure!  When 
an extremely warm, dry breeze first hit me, I sensed I was in another 
world.  And when I saw the first cactus which was taller than me, I had no doubt! lol

At the Phoenix airport I awaited David Pizer.  I was looking for 
the David with the old Testament prophet beard, and was amazed to 
find it much shortened up!  It was very cool to finally be meeting 
the man I had only known online and by phone.  And very soon after 
I got to meet his wonderful life's companion, Trudy.  Albert, their 
much loved great dane, must not be forgotten either.  He is like 
having a small horse underfoot!

David immediately took me over to the Alcor facility, which was 
a gigantic thrill for me.  I had so often poured over their website, 
and looked closely at the pictures they provided.  And now, I was 
actually there!  Mike Perry was very kind in giving me the grand 
tour.  Things were in a state of mild disarray, but only with the 
purpose of evolving to the next level.  I was allowed to peek at 
the suspension room, and even enter the inner sanctum of Alcor, 
the patient storage room!  Sort of like Picard in "First Contact" 
when he touched humanity's first starship, it was a thrill for me 
to actually touch something I revered as an amazing piece of technology which will transform lives.  

Later, Mike told me how he had been born in Alaska at a remote island 
there!  I caught him up on the latest about his birthplace.  Dr. Perry is a real gentleman.  

Dr. Lemler showed up and he welcomed to me to Arizona.  I could 
tell he has been a very busy man since the Ted Williams case has 
happened! lol!  This was my second time speaking with him, the first 
being at Extro-5.  I feel Alcor could not be in better hands.     

>From the start I was very taken with David's vision(current and 
future) for the Creekside Preserve resort, and Ventureville, which 
will come to be as time goes by.  To put it succinctly, the place 
has beautiful buildings set in a very beautiful place.  

The resort has a neo-western theme, with an impressive main building 
which is somewhat away from the highway.  Within it is a fireplace 
at the end of the atrium, and an extremely eyecatching woodlog railing 
which follows the stairs upward.  We will have a restuarant with 
traditional western fare(and probably some vegetarian too!, lol). 
 Guests will even get to eat out on a roofed terrace which encircles 
the building!  Eating dinner while taking in such a fine view will 
be a real treat, I guarantee.  Dave found such a great spot of earth to build on!

On the lower level will be a gymnasium for those wanting to stay 
fit and trim.  But hey, I will be working out there, so that is 
proof anyone should show up to work out there and not be self-conscious! lol

On the same level will be the conference room!!  The future site 
of extropian/cryonicist/transhumanist/life extensionist meetings(and 
probably Shriner's too, lol)!  It will be able to fit about eighty 
people.  So if you are planning a conference, please come on down! : )

Behind the main building are fifteen fantastic cabins.  Half of 
them are Santa Fe style, and the other half old west.  These cabins 
are NICE.  You get a big, comfortable king sized bed, a gas fireplace, 
dimmer lights, and in most cabins a bright red, heart-shaped jacuzzi 
hot tub!  To top it off, each one has a spacious porch to kick back 
on and take in the beauty of the land.  So, you may want to bring 
that special person along with you for a romantic evening! : )  

There is a creekbed which runs right in front of the cabins!  When 
it rains more around here, you will be getting a creek with water 
in it!  The place is still very, very nice.                

This resort will be a haven for astronomy buffs.  We have our very 
own observatory atop a hill right behind us!  Within it is a powerful 
Meade telescope with a user friendly computer interface which will 
take you to the subject you wish to scrutinize.  I have a feeling 
Venturists will be spending some time there!

This is the American west, and so we have a barn-shaped building 
not too far from the main area which has stables for the horses 
of our guests!  So if you own a horse, you will be able to take 
your trusty steed along.  We will not currently be renting horses due to liability issues.

Even without a horse, there are still trails crisscrossing around 
the Creekside Preserve property and beyond.  Behind us are public 
lands, so you could explore for miles if you wanted to.  There are 
still the remains of mines and buildings back there which date to 
the last century.  Looking over these relics made me feel very grateful 
to be living in our time period.  Before things like air conditioning, 
modern medicine, cars and planes, Arizona was a harsh place to live 
in, or especially travel through.  Technology has truly opened it up to humanity.  

I suppose working here will prepare me to manage at the future Venturist 
community on Mars! lol  Actually, my Alaskan constitution has adapted 
rather quickly to conditions here, which really surprised me.  My 
two years a decade ago in Louisiana seems to have toughened me up 
more then I realized.  The dry heat here is so pleasant compared 
to the dreaded humid heat there.        

At night the Creekside Resort takes on a magical feeling with it's 
combination of beautiful architecture, hills, trees, rocks, animal 
life, and carefully laid lighting.  And to go along with this, we 
have a big firepit!!  We will be having many nights of guests gathered 
around it and enjoying conversation as the flames illuminate the 
darkness.  I think cryonicists may be having more thought-provoking 
conversations there than even the conference room.  Humanity has 
a long history of gathering around fires, and we will continue in that time honored tradition.

The Creekside Preserve is wonderful, but this is only the first 
part of David's vision for the place.  As time goes on and it proves 
profitable, many more cabins will be built.  And perhaps other forms of housing, too.  

It is within the city limits of Mayer, a charming little town which 
has been around for over a century now.  Though it only has a 1,500 
population, all the basic necessities of life are here. lol!  They 
have a post office, a judge, a Circle K, a locally owned small grocery 
store with gas pumps, a sheriff's station, an auto repair place, 
a library, a Community First bank, and even several antique shops! 
 Smitty's Antiques is gargantuan, and well worth the walk down memory 
lane.  And an upscale gated community is currently being built.   

I want to make clear this is even a place for people who don't like 
extremely hot weather.  The reason I state this is because on average 
Mayer is a whole TWENTY degrees cooler than Phoenix!  We are at 
a much higher elevation, and that really makes a difference.  And 
also winter temperatures will be very pleasant for those people from the cooler climes.  

I learned to really appreciate the difference between the two locations 
after a day toiling with Dave out in the hot Phoenix sun.  Dave 
was impressed enough by my fortitude that he told me I had earned 
the right to be called a true Arizonian! : )  

Ultimately, the goal of this venture is to have cryonicists come here to relax and 
stay a few days, while becoming very familiar with the place, and 
learning to really enjoy it.  They will have fond memories of it, 
and think of it hopefully as a home away from home.  When retirement 
time comes, we hope to have them either choose to rent a property 
we will have built, or even purchase/build their own place out here.

Ventureville will take form in this way.  But long before that, 
informal cryonicist gatherings and formal conferences will have 
paved the way.  David wants Ventureville to be a cryonicist haven 
where among other tasks we will get the word out about cryonics! 
 It will be the first major cryonics community, and the world will 
certainly be curious over time.  With the Creekside Preserve resort 
clients steadily coming and going, we will get plenty of opportunities 
to do "missionary work" with non-cryonicist guests.  

A museum of Arizona past, present and future is a brainstorm of 
David's.  A person will first learn about the history of Arizona, 
with a focus on technology and how it has made life so much better. 
 At a certain point they will enter the second section of the museum 
which is about the FUTURE of Arizona.  With a foundation in place 
of how technology has already transformed life, the person will 
be shown what the next fifty years or more will bring!  Dave's idea 
is a terrific way to get people seeing the big picture.  Of course, 
there will be pamphlets, books, tapes, etc. for them to take home 
with them(for just a nominal fee).  It will take a lot of work, 
but will pay some huge dividends.  And I bet we will be on the Discovery Channel in no time! lol

I am extremely excited about being a part of all this.  As David's 
management trainee, I hope to master what he intends to teach me, 
so I can deliver the best service I can to those who come here. 
 If you enjoy your stay so much you want to come back, I have succeeded! 
 As the Creekside Preserve proves itself financially viable, the 
groundwork for Ventureville will be laid.  

I want to take this time to thank David and Trudy for this opportunity, 
and the great kindness they have shown me since arriving.  I could 
not have asked for more nice employers!  So many in cryonics and 
transhumanism seem to be just talkers, but Dave is a man of action. 
 The exodus of Alcor from California to Arizona, and now the upcoming 
creation of Ventureville are proof of this.  I look forward to working 
much more with David when the resort opens in probably mid October.    

I will be in a sense the first person saved by Ventureville.  Though 
I am a cryonicist in spirit, I have not actually signed up yet with 
Alcor.  And as a I realize, a real cryonicist is someone who IS 
signed up.  Financial concerns to a limited extent impeded me, but 
external social/religious pressures were really the challenge as I look back.  

I am convinced I would have signed up eventually, but still am very 
grateful to be in a place where my cryonicist views will be supported, 
and even more so as Ventureville takes form.  I have already had 
the chance to explain about cryonics to several people who knew 
about Dave's involvement and were curious.             
       
As seen by Dave, Ventureville will be a haven where a cryonicist 
can be among others like him and be protected should his/her health 
take a turn for the worse.  Should the "vultures" descend to change 
the cryonicist's mind about suspension when he is in a very vulnerable 
state of mind, we will be there to protect him.  And if they push 
it too much, Dave just may say in his own special way, "get the 
!!#@%!!! out of here, right now!!" : )

This is going to be a great adventure for me.  I sure have a lot 
to learn!  The next decade and beyond are going to hopefully show 
a great deal of growth both in John Grigg and the Creekside Resort/Ventureville community.  

I look forward to getting to know you all!

very best wishes,

John

Others that probably have similar information/approaches would
include Celera and perhaps Sequenom (according to the article).

Keep your eyes peeled for the Wired article discussing David Duncan's
encounter with his personal blueprint.

Perhaps I am both my code *and* my data.  Ah, but grasshopper,

bad days I am but merely my code?

My yard needs a brook so that I may ponder this question.

(end)

Since it would be an HBO production most likely, we can be grittily realistic.  In episode one we can show Hussein entertaining himself by having his bodyguards seize a newlywed away from her husband at gunpoint.  

Saddam becomes very angry when the woman actually dares to not welcome his sexual advances!  And so after the rape he perpetrates, Hussein has his men wrap her up in a rug and drive vehicles over it until she has been crushed to death.  
 
Later on in the show we see Saddam yelling at his son Odai for killing a distinguished party guest(a general) who was not suitably excited about the festivities.  Odai cowers in fear since he realizes he may have gone to far this time.  Fortunately, dad chooses to forgive him.  Where did the poor boy pick up these bad habits??

Saddam and his goons need to go.  I am ashamed the U.S. government ever supported such a murderous thug.  But he is simply one in a fairly long list.

Actually, Saddam Hussein already has a t.v. show!  He is a very special guest on Southpark. ; )  An arab middle-eastern tyrant could not be more denigrated before a worldwide audience. lol!

Just for all the Iraqi women Hussein has horribly violated and sometimes killed(it's a sickening habit of his), I hope we occupy his country, and turn him over to a mob of Iraqi's who have all been deeply hurt by him.  Ripped to shreds by an angry mob of his countryman just might be a fitting end for him.

That might be interesting experiment but I don't really see this an
exercise in democracy. Surely a significant percentage of people would
agree that every human behavior has a motivation, which is enough for me
to consider the proposition one worthy of defending.

I think a lot of people would consider it simple common sense. People do
not do things for no reason, which is to say that every behavior has a
motivation. 

Also the negation of the axiom flies in the face of evolutionary theory,
which as you know I hold dear. Behaviors require precious energy,
measurable in calories. It makes no sense that any organism should
expend energy for no reason.

Yes. I mentioned Desmond Morris because his views mesh nicely with mine,
particularly with my pet theory that I have only barely touched upon,
which seeks to explain all addictions in terms of the innate desire for
novelty. 

Despite their apparently maladaptive nature, addictions to behaviors and
substances are very prevalent in human society. Use of mind-altering
substances has been a part of the human experience since the dawn of
civilization, and there is no reason to think humans were immune to
addictive behaviors prior to the discovery of mind-altering substances.
Given the evidence that addictive personality traits can be transmitted
genetically, and given their potential for destruction and misery, one
must wonder why nature has not de-selected them. In answer to that
question I think one must look at other similar traits that are
prevalent yet apparently maladaptive. The trait for sickle cell anemia
is a classic case. Sickle cell anemia is a genetically transmitted
life-threatening disease, yet it is also adaptive in some circumstances:
the sickle cell trait provides resistance to malaria. This adaptive
value of the sickle trait blocked its deselection from the human genome.


What, if any, is the adaptive value to addictive traits? My answer is
that addictive behavior is a manifestation of the same genetic traits
that motivate humans to seek the reward that comes from novelty. This
idea is supported by the observation that addictive behaviors and the
experience of novelty both activate the same neural reward circuitry. It
is supported also by the reason most people give for trying potentially
dangerous and addictive drugs. They will tell you they were
"experimenting" because there were "curious." In other words, they were
motivated to experience novelty because they find novelty rewarding. In
some people this propensity for seeking novelty is more pronounced than
in others. As I demonstrated in my last message, research shows this
difference in personality to predictable via genetic testing for
specific polymorphisms of dopamine receptor genes.

We humans have succeeded in large part because we are novelty seekers.
We are curious and inquisitive creatures. We thrive under conditions of
sensory and intellectual stimulation. We seek new experiences because we
find them intrinsically rewarding. This is a major reason for our
success as a species, but it did not come without a price. Those of us
who are most motivated to seek sensational and novel experiences are
also at potentially greater risk of falling victim to addictive
substances and behaviors.

Assuming we can extend my ideas to pigeons, (something I have not
considered, and which I am reluctant to consider now in light of past
disagreements about alligators), the pigeon will after some time no
longer experience novelty in the circumstance you describe above.
However the neurological reward from obtaining food will not have
dissipated. It is ultimately for this reason that the pigeon eats. He
does not eat because he is hungry, even if it is convenient to speak in
those abbreviated terms. He eats because he has a desire to experience
the reward that results from satisfying his appetite. In the same way,
all human behaviors are in my view motivated ultimately by a desire to
experience reward.

Any behavior that serves to avoid expected pain can also be seen as a
behavior that serves to increase expected pleasure. The expectation of
increased pleasure is certainly an expectation of reward, and thus
should activate the same circuitry.

We could always bring him over to the United States and replace Dick
Cheney with Saddam Hussein ... and torture him with having to listen to
Dubya for the length of his term.

Ouch.

It might also make make the United States slightly less wussy as a
global superpower, too.

Lee,

I almost missed this new thread, which I see branches from the
motivation thread. I just a moment ago posted a reply to you in that
thread and unfortunately I don't have a lot of time right now to respond
to you here (as is evidenced by my many typos in my other message :-). 

But let me just say this for now:

I disagree. You cannot capture what is truly you at any given moment
without also capturing the information encoded in your genes. 

You are not so much your genes as you are the expressions of them. The
manner in which your genes are expressed changes through time in
response to changes in your internal and external environments. Because
only your genes contain the instructions for their future expressions in
response to environments yet to be experienced, the information
contained in them must be taken with you into the transhuman future,
else you will not be the same person in that future.

There is, however, another level (referring to the title of the thread). 
 Some of the information which we are is not and was not ever encoded in 
our genes.  There may be some RNA which is self-reproducing, and handed 
down from mother to daughter/son.  There *is* protein folding 
information which is handed down in that way.  Further, some of our DNA 
doesn't seem to be necessary for "who we are".  I don't set too much 
stock with conscious awareness.  I feel that this is vastly overblown. 
 But the underpinnings are deep.  Some of them are dependant on DNA. 
 Some have other inherited roots.  And a lot is development experiences. 
 There's probably a lot that could be trimmed out without loosing 
anything important, but which parts?  If the mind is being transplanted 
to a computer, I feel that the (is it ?Morovic?) operation for cell 
level emulation is a vast amount of overkill.  It's like the Turing 
Test.  It's a way to prove to those who don't want to consider a 
possibility that it needs to be considered, but it's not a reasonable 
approach.  And as we get closer, the correct approach will become more 
evident.  We don't need to emulate our DNA, or even our cells to 
reproduce ourselfs.  That's not "who we are" when we aren't living in a 
protein body.  We are structures of thought, patterns of reaction, 
memories of hopes and fears, triumphs and disappointments.  We are goals 
for the future.  We are what we love, and what we hate.  But we aren't 
molecules of ribose, or of desoxyribose.  That's an implementation.

The only thing is... right now we can't say just what parts of the 
implementation are essential to emulate.  And it really is uncertain, 
argument won't solve this one, only experimentation *and* theory *and* 
technical advancement.

All an individual needs to defend and control their own bodies and
lives from tyrannies of any sort (including majoritarian democratic
tyrannies which James seems so enamored of), is shooting iron in one
hand and encrypted packet network devices in the other. To suggest the
individual needs tyrants to defend them from other tyrants is a pure
abdication of individual empowerment, and is the crux of the fallacy to
Hughes' entire philosophy.

Nobody has claimed it wasn't, at least as seen by the mainstream
political landscape. There is still a Georgist or Proudhonian tilt to
many libertarians coming in from the left side of things, while Hayek
and Rand seem to be the influences of those coming in from the right.

Because libertarians of all stripes take personal responsibility for
themselves and the future of society seriously, they tend to be more
militant and shrill about their own particular microdot in the landscape.

Do It Yourself is a central requirement of libertarianism, and is
highly extropic. Do It Yourself with Basement Nanotech, Cloning,
Cryonics, and Beowulf Clustering, along with perimeter defense systems
(both physical and network level) and Personal Space Travel. What could
be more extropic (and at the same time libertarian) than that?

The World Trade Center towers probably had bombs in them.  Didn't you 
see the explosions before they fell, in a controlled manner?  I actually 
recall thinking to myself that very morning, hey, that looked like an 
explosion in one of the towers, on live television.  Seismographs report 
explosions, as well as the plane crashes and the buldings "pancaking".

I don't believe everything I read or am told.  I believe most things I 
see.  I believe most things that I'm told or read, unless they are 
contradictory with my preexisting or later knowledge.

Anyways, some "conspiracy whistle-blower" pages, using news reports, 
claim the seismographs report a nuclear explosion.  I find that hard to 
believe, although the pile was hot.  Other things claim that for the 
towers to fall as they did, just like almost as if they were planned 
demolitions, would require bombs set off at various specific locations.  
The huge water tanks at the top of the towers, which among other things 
are to keep them stable, were empty.

The F.P. Murrah building in Oklahoma city was almost destroyed.  At the 
time I believed the story that some army guy filled a truck full of 
explosves by himself and that that caused the destruction.  I had 
suspicions he was under orders.  Later, when I saw the guy, I was like, 
that's messed up.  Recently I heard that unexploded munitions within the 
building, demolition munitions, were discovered.

I was working in a federal building at a time when they had some 
security increase, and what happened there was visibly that a guard was 
at one of the fewer doors and you had to show him the ID badge to 
enter.  The Reagan building had much more security, they had those guys 
with mirrors on sticks peeping under car autobodies.  I'm downright 
offended at the lack of security in our nuclear weapons programs, China 
didn't get nuke tech from supercomputers, one case to consider is "Peter 
Lee", not "Wen Ho Lee".

What did and does a Geiger counter say about "Ground Zero"?  A "Ground 
Zero" is in Hiroshima, where more than a hundred thousand civilians, 
that are, people, were killed at one time by an atomic bomb to prevent 
an invasion of Japan to end World War II in the Pacific.

Folks,
       Larry Kudlow has a column out explaining our recession in terms of 
Milton Freedman's monetary theory.  Briefly within recent months the Fed has 
allowed M2 to collapse from 12% of the total supply to 4% leading to our 
present situation in his opinion.  The column can be found at:

I think blueprints are a very weak analogy. 

Genetic instructions are more analogous to algorithms. They respond to
inputs and operate in time as well as space.

Some idiots will believe anything, apparently. No, I've looked at the
video, and nothing in it is at all in conflict with the scenario of
fire damaged structures failing under 10,000 tons of load (the floors
above). Have you ever seen reinforced concrete and structural steel
fail catastrophically? I have. It does look like a bomb went off,
specifically because those are the sorts of forces that are bound up in
prestressed concrete: the cables within the concrete are tensioned at
high loads, so when the concrete fails, the cables propel the failed
concrete outward in explosive levels of force. 

Those living in the Bay area during the 1989 quake may remember seeing
the concrete pylons supporting highways after the quake. THey looked
like someone had set a bomb off inside, causing the rebar remaining to
be swelled outward.

I sure hope we are not now going to be the victim of one more Ian
Goddardesque months long rant from Mr. Finlayson.

The water tanks in the tops of buildings are not to keep them stable.
Shows how much you know about architecture. Water tanks in the tops of
buildings are to keep water pressures stable throughout the building,
as well as to supply a source of emergency water for building sprinkler
systems. They certainly don't contribute to keeping buildings stable,
since they increase the momentum the building develops when swaying in
the wind.

I'd encourage Spike to run up a spreadsheet calculating the forces
involved in the collapse. Each collapse triggered a 2.7 richter
earthquake. Each tower was about 40,000 tons of material (not pounds).
Thats 80 million pounds of material, striking the earth at 250 mph (367
fps). Kinetic energy equals mass times velocity squared, or
10,775,120,000,000 ft-lbs/sec for each tower collapse. How many tons of
TNT is that equal to?

Yes, but, sometimes Do It Yourself (akin to Be Yourself) is the worst advice

they need to behave more scrupulously so as not to give the Big Bad Press a

No.  I figure he can speak for himself.

There are sources claiming that the airplanes didn't demolish the towers.

It looked like a bomb went off about thirty or forty stories above the 
second plane entry about ten or fifteen minutes before it fell.  Boom, 
it went.

The seismographs I saw have the spikes in the graphs before the 
recording of the towers' passage.  Seismograph experts claim them 
consistent with very large underground explosions exclusive of the 
recording of the towers falling floor-by-floor into the parking garages.

Sometimes water tanks are used to keep a building stable.  Maybe you 
haven't seen the show where the U-shaped water tanks reduce the sway in 
a building.

Often they're used for water pressure.  I heard the tanks were empty.

It was hot.  The fires were pretty much out.  Fuel oil doesn't burn at 
1700 degrees.

What's the "Big Lie"?

Why would people not accept the official line?  Is it, it being the 
concept that the WTC attacks were internally guided,  a form of urban 
myth?  Is it the conception that the mass media and government would and 
could lie to further their various aims or that they have in the past 
and would again?  Why has pretty much everyone heard of it?

Why do people find this evidence?

Some people will believe anything apparently.

You mention rebar in concrete.  Steel-reinforced concrete is made by 
welding together a steel cage of rebar and pouring concrete in forms 
around it.  Concrete is a good insulator.

Perhaps we could make scale models and see how they react.  Take a stack 
of a hundred bricks cemented together, and drive a truck into them.  The 
bricks fly in all directions.  If the structural support went out a 
third of the way down the building, I guess I could see how the top 
third of the building would collapse under gravity through the lower 
floors.  It's other people that tell me that that would not be possible.

I appreciate your candor.

For all of those extropians interested in how the axe will
fall in terms of the legal environment, I'd suggest you read:

Music Industry in Global Fight on Web Copies
http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/07/technology/07SWAP.html

Why is this important?  Because it may be one of many
developments where the world moves faster than you do.

This *is* a "sign" of the singularity -- can you state
for certain that you are protected from its developments?
If you are protected from these events *are* you protected
from the next set of events?

While I dislike the role of a dooms-day sayer, I realize
that there may be hints a valid role here.  (Once the
asteroid is clearly targeted at the Earth nobody is going
to have an argument with this assertion).  [Of course
"asteroids" may be of external or internal manufacture.]

So, my friends, do you have a "Plan B"?

R.

Cryonics bash, cute, he he he.  (You are invited to a ... a ... a ...
CRYONICS bash!") I don't know why (and I'm *used* to the term "cryonics"),
but I had to suppress a mordant giggle when I read that.   (Let's do the
monster mash at the cryonics bash ... we'll have a ghoul ole' time!)

A while back Damien B. suggested the word "recovery" for cryonic suspension,
and asked other people on this list (if I remember correctly) to submit
their ideas for something more ... catchy; or maybe it was for something
less ... descriptive?  I don't think there were any other suggestions (were
there?).  Inviting people to a "recovery bash" would make one think of a
DBAB (don't bring any booze) party for the AA (Alcoholics Anonymous), RR
(Rational Recovery) and SS (Secular Sobriety) crowd.  Oh, well.

To me, it looks like KaZaA is a tar baby for the music industry; it just may
not be possible to bring it down using legal action, and in fact may
inadvertantly show copycats how to successfully set up an imune enterprise.
This will be a fun one to keep tabs on.

It is already Tuesday morning in Bahrain.
The third game between Fritz and Kramnik
starts in less than 8 hours.

My previous description of Kramnik's treatment
of Fritz in game 2 was not accurate (squashed
him like a bug).  I reviewed that game and
realized that altho Fritz7 made a horrifying
12th move, he fought like hell afterwards
and *almost* evened it back up.  Even with
the opening boner against the *world champion*
carbon unit, the program came *damn* close to
drawing with the black pieces.

I now change my match prediction to a 5-3
win for carbon:

game 3: draw
game 4: Kramnik wins
game 5: draw
game 6: draw
game 7: draw
game 8: draw

I guess I should get a bigger hard drive to get what I want before they shut 
KaZaA down too!

I doubt Hollywood is going to go on a witch hunt to try to find ALL 60 
million KaZaA users around the world! I hate what is happening to the USA... 
becoming more and more imperialistic (the "We're right, you're wrong, deal 
with it" mentality!). It sounds to me like if this ruling goes through, they 
are going to try to impose US copyright laws upon the rest of the world, 
which is an unbelieveably ballsy move IMHO. 

Robert mentioned :
"This *is* a "sign" of the singularity -- can you state
for certain that you are protected from its developments?
If you are protected from these events *are* you protected
from the next set of events?"

What do you guys see as the "next set of events", and how should we protect 
ourselves?

I know it's a double-edged sword, the arguements for and against the free 
flow of information... I think I fall into the 'for' category (Remember that 
hokey movie "Hackers"? ), but with some obvious limitations such as matters 
of national security.

My 2 cents,

Artillo

Our protein bodies are very much a part of who we are. Hormones, for
example, are important proteins that influence thought and behavior.
Consider testosterone in men as an obvious example. Testosterone is
produced in the testes, far from the brain and central nervous system,
yet it influences our personalities in very profound ways. Testosterone
travels through the blood to reach testosterone receptors located on the
cell membranes of neurons in the brain, the activation of which changes
our thoughts and behavior, thus modifying "who we are."

Many other hormones also affect our personalities, in women as well as
men.

So then if we hope to keep our personalities intact while leaving our
organic bodies behind, we will need to find a way to codify the rules
that control the endocrine system. That information exists in our genes.

You are, it seems to me, confusing a current implementation with the 
logical essentials.  Yes, there would need to be something that 
performed an equivalent function to that performed by the hormones.  But 
it would probably not involve emulating the structure of the molecules. 
 That's the wrong leve of abstraction at which to tackle this job. 
 Defining the correct level will be one of the major steps towards 
actually doing this and making it work properly.  It will probably bear 
as much of a relationship to SIGHUP as it does to testosterone, however.

Information overload is one of the true signs of the singularity.  I don't believe that there is a "good" way to deal with it.  The "least bad" way appears to be to pick an area that you can keep up with, and try to network with people who have picked other areas.

There are many socially destructive forces operating now, the RIAA is a major villian, but not the worst.  And some of the more destructive forces are well intentioned, but don't happen to see the particular effects that I see (or don't consider them as important).

Personally, I distrust all forces that try to coerce centralization and homogenization, from fast food joints (Drink Coke?  What happened to, e.g., Moxie?) to mega-corps to central governments to industry associations.  This is out of pure selfishness.  They are after their good, and I am after mine.  If a corp. decides that it will make more profit by slowly poisoning it's customers, it generally does just that, and hides the fact (evidence:  consider the tobacco companies, consider the use of hydrogenated coconut oil, etc.).  I'd prefer to avoid that.  And the government barely pretends to control the more blatent excesses.

So.  Yes, the RIAA is bad.  Yes, there's an information overload.  Yes, there are groups taking advantage of it.  To me the main problem is the imbalance of power.  But people will be shortsighted.  Sorry, you've got to expect that.  And there will be groups that take advantage of it.  And you've got to accept that.  What you do about it... is much less clear.  Despite my rant, I have been known to go out for a pizza at Round Table, and to eat Nabisco Hydrox cookies, and drink Moutain Dew.  All bad choices that I knew were bad choices.  Bad in several ways.  They were not only unhealthy, they strengthened the large corporations.  But this is relatively rare.  The kickers are:  water, electricity, gasoline, telephones, and order.  While those are centrally controlled, the centralizers have the upper hand.  And the RIAA is only one of the logical outcomes from that chain.

The main current problem is the loss of the frontier.  The frontier enhanced the growth of liberty*.  The loss has the opposite effect.  Cyberspace has been a poor substitute, but it may suffice for just long enough.  Or not quite long enough.  It's hard to tell from this year.  What's really needed are space-based communities.  Places where different communities can evolve their customs in different ways.  (Don't expect the individual people to be more independant... it is the communities that will be more independant.  The people, at least at first, will be more dependant on their communities.)

How to get from here to there isn't clear to me.  But it seems as important as it ever did in the 1960s.  I'm not sure that I'd still gladly die for the chance to forward the mission, but that's probably because I'm now older and, in a sense, more conservative.

* This was quite expensive in terms of lives, but if you compare, perhaps over all no more expensive than not pushing if forward.  It destroyed the cultures, and many of the lives, of the original inhabitants, but it *did* increase their average liberty.  (The life of a tribesman is nearly devoid of liberty.  It is rather an example of living within a soicety that generally matches the instinctive plan.  The constraints are seen as "the way things are", and not even noticed, as such.)  A question here is:  To what extent does the value of liberty justify imposing it on people against their will?

A sort of answer to this, from a social values point of view, is that the liberty of the individuals of a society is the technique that a society uses to adapt to changing circumstances.  So if a situation is rapidly changing, then a large amount of liberty is a survival need.  But when the situation stabilized, continued liberty imposes a continual increased organizational cost.  So it can be seen as less efficient.  In the short term.

### Be more specific, please. Do you mean the information inherent in the
subatomic structure of the DNA? Do you mean the quantum-mechanical
description of the shape of DNA molecules? What about the information
present in the patterns of phonons within DNA?

What do you mean by "genes"? The chemical substance? The knowledge of the
world implicit in the cell and the DNA transcription/translation machinery?

Are you saying that to read a book you need to analyze the chemical
properties of the paper?

It is a great benefit to be able to model the world in terms of a number of
levels, with no need to fully model a lower level to get useful data while
looking at a higher level. Try it.

I don't know where you get this idea that I am proposing a need to
"emulate the structure of molecules." 

I am saying we need to emulate the *rules* that are currently
implemented by organic molecules under the instructions of other organic
molecules that comprise our genetic material. Those rules are encoded in
our genes -- they are the very substance of them -- and so we cannot
dispense with that genetic information. I see no need for the structure
of the molecules... our genetic instructions might just as well be
encoded digitally into 1's and 0's. 

A digitally codified gene would still be a gene, as I define them,
because I define genes by function rather than form. I see them as
packets of instructions. If you happen to know something about
programming then consider that each gene is analogous to a class in C++.
It accepts inputs from its intercellular environment and responds by
generating outputs (proteins and enzymes that control synthesis of more
proteins). In the language of C++, the full person is analogous to a
complete program that contains many classes (genes).

Understand that I am not here arguing against the existence of
free-will, nor am I arguing against the existence of non-genetic
elements that must also be considered a part of who we are. I am arguing
only that we cannot dispense with all of our genetic information and
hope to keep our personalities intact. To some degree or another, our
personalities are very much a function of our genes.

Buying TV time would probably be too much pandering to the capitalist devils.  Capturing a broadcast network and in an act of terror forcing nothing but endless reruns of Archie Bunker with Saddam voiceovers on the other hand...

This has been happening for a few years already.  One of the
defendants in the California DeCSS law suit is a German resident
who has never been in the US.

What's even more interesting in that case is that it's a trade

By information I am referring to the sequences of chemical reactions
initiated and controlled by genetic material, that lead to the synthesis
of enzymes and other proteins that then have activity within the cell in
which they are synthesized. Those chemical reactions are "blind" but by
virtue of billions of years of evolution they are nevertheless
"meaningful information" to the survival of the organism, and in this
context meaningful to the survival of the personality.

I am not referring to anything at the subatomic level, though it does
bring up some good questions... quantum effects can affect macroscopic
chemical reactions, and so there may be some need to look more closely
at those effects and find a way to encode then into whatever inorganic
substrate we might hope to find ourselves.

I just a moment ago answered this in reply to Charles Hixson. I wrote to
him:

Okay, try thinking this way:

I mentioned testosterone as an important influence on our personalities.
Rather than considering this hormone as an organic chemical, think of it
instead in conceptual terms. Think of it as an "agent of aggression and
sexual desire." 

To keep our personalities intact we will need encode for this agent. The
agent can take any form because we are interested only its function. If
our personalities are going to be encoded into 1's and 0's then we can
assign this agent to a variable. The magnitude of the value assigned to
the variable at time t in our uploaded personalities would be
proportionate, let us say, to the level of testosterone in a ml of blood
at the same time t had we not uploaded. 

Now then, we will then need to create a class or subroutine to control
the value of that variable. That class or subroutine is analogous to the
genetic instructions that exist in our organic genes that control
testosterone production. Without that class or subroutine -- without
that gene -- our transhuman personalities will not be the same.

The genes enable specific activities (at cellular or intercellular
levels) that certainly have an impact on personalities.  However,
that is not to say that these effects cannot be emulated by
relatively unsophisticated systems.  (After all the visual-testosterone
feedback loops can't be *that* complicated.)

The really interesting part of transhumanism comes in with
control over those loops -- when you have a low level subroutine
providing an interrupt saying "I have the visual stimuli that should
cause a release of testosterone (or some other arousal state modifying
signal) -- should I release the signal?"

It is going to be quite interesting as I would guess there are
individuals who are very much their hormones while there may be
other individuals who are much less so.

It will be very interesting to watch such individuals dial up
or down the signal level and begin to realize the reality that
others may exist in.

Actually if you've ever studied the endocrine system then you know it is
extremely complicated. The feedback loops that control hormone levels
are very complex and still not completely understood. That information
is however contained in our genes.

Yes. And those differences account for much of the differences in human
personality. 

It's true that we might eventually learn to change our personalities in
new ways, either via gene therapy or via some far more advanced method.
But we need to start by first codifying our existing personalities.

The example of testosterone leads to another interesting question: as an
agent of aggression and assertiveness its effects surely must be encoded
to preserve our personalities. But what of its function as an agent of
sexual desire? Testosterone is integral to the sex drive in both men and
women. Sexual desire affects our day-to-day thoughts and behaviors and
personal interactions in subtle ways even when we are not focusing on
it... we are very sexual beings. If we eliminate the sexual effects of
sex hormones then our personalities will change quite dramatically (and
life will be much less fun. :) Is this what we want? I think not.

Hmmm...  Reaching up above my desk I pull down "The Neuroendocrine
Theory of Aging and Degenerative Disease" by V. M. Dilman and Ward Dean.
So I think I'm aware to some degree of its complexity.

I would say that "some" of that information is contained in our genes.

It may be entirely possible that a significant fraction of our endocrine
system may be regulated at the protein level (without any genetic
interaction).  [I'll willingly admit that fraction might vary from
1% to 99% -- so I believe it would be more accurate to state that
the information is "contained in our genes or the products thereof".]

The point being that if one had an alternate protein manufacturing
system (or a manufacturing system producing protein "equivalents")
then the genes would be irrelevant.

Into the swamp we go.  If we can't really understand each others
experiences how can we begin to codify our personalities?

I think Eliezer would step in here -- if one wires the pleasure that
sex generally confers into the circuit for creating symphonies then
one gets very productive composers (based on some of his ideas regarding
generalized "fun" if I'm not misinterpreting them).

We would all have friends inclined to compose better-than-Mozart operettas
on napkins at restaurants where we might dine.

This doesn't seem to have much to do with the subject line, but ok. "The

ejecting from the sides of the towers, yes they had definitely died down by
the time the towers fell. But I don't think very much can be said about the

If there is a big lie, and I guess it's only natural that *some* people will
just need there to be one, it's perhaps the fact that Condoleezza Rice was
very probably fully briefed by Sandy Berger on the increasing volatility of
the Al Qaeda situation well beforehand and clearly failed to react (partisan
disdain) . Then she unconvincingly denied that the briefing ever took place.
Not a whopper, but somewhat troubling from a credibility angle as we move
into uncharted waters with respect to Iraq.

Then perhaps you'll appreciate mine too. I usually find your posts

DNA may be necessary information for rebuilding that system, but it
certainly isn't sufficient information, or even close to it.  DNA only
does its thing within the whole biological context that includes the
structure of the cell it's in, the environment in which the organism
developed, the DNA of all of the symbiotic and parasitic organisms that
interact with the organism in question, the environment in which it
lives, and many other things.

The tiny amount of information in DNA will be about as useful in
reconstructing an uploaded "us" as the recipe for concrete would be
in reconstructing the World Trade Center.

I've read that paper and it's a good one, but it is far from a full
treatment of the subject. The text I use for reference is _Endocrine
Physiology_ by  Balint Kacsoh, a textbook for med students. Trust me,
Robert, the endocrine system is *extremely* complex. :)

> I would say that "some" of that information is contained in our genes.

Okay, then where is the rest of it? 

Every neuron in our brains contain our DNA. Every action of a given
neuron is under the control of the genetic material in the nucleus of
that neuron, such that every thought is under the control of our genes. 

To continue with the testosterone example, testosterone binds to its
receptors on those neurons in our brains that are equipped to handle
testosterone. The biding of testosterone to its receptor on the surface
of the neuron initiates a sequence of chemical events by which the
presence of testosterone is communicated to the genetic material in the
nucleus. The genes that code for neural responses to testosterone
respond by initiating sequences of intercellular events that modify the
electro-chemical activities of that neuron, thus changing its
communications with neighboring neurons. A complex cascade of neural
events ensues, culminating in the appearance of conscious or unconscious
thoughts and feelings that pertain to such things as sex and aggression.
The entire process is under genetic control.

### The local tyrant wouldn't even notice you had shooting iron, because he

You need much more to protect yourself. Cooperation with a lot of people,

Generally speaking when freedom attempts to mask it's own attributes
to cater to the preferences of socialists (like yourself) it can only
lose.  It is among the foremost tools of statists to attempt to
subtly (and not so subtly) influence and control  any political
discourse according to their own framing of the issues, often
appealing to mob psychology and "don't be a crazy" tactics.
I suspect the libertarians on the list might take you as being less
of a statist-socialist sort not truly interested in meaningful debate if
you didn't constantly chime in with comments whose primary
commonality is envy disguised as principle.
  This may be unfair but that is the perception.

Now that's just complete nonsense. The only thing that neuron does
that's under the "control" of DNA is mitosis.  All the /important/
things that the neuron does, like connecting and disconnecting from
other neurons, is controlled by the /environment/ of the neuron; some
of that environment (like the protein soup it finds itself in) may
also trace back to DNA in part, but a lot of it (like the signals from
the nervous system) don't.  My DNA had nothing to do with fact that
the book I just read caused photoreceptors in my retina to send
signals to my language processing center which sent signals to my
hippocampus causing me to learn and remember concepts.  My DNA
/enabled/ that behavior, but once it built the machinery, it had
nothing at all to do with how it got used.

Actually *that* is complete nonsense. 

Most hormones for example bind to their corresponding receptors (the
receptor is a molecule embedded in the surface of the cell membrane).
This initiates a chemical signaling process inside the cell that
communicates the presence of the hormone to the DNA in the nucleus.
Depending the function of the cell, the relevant genes then initiate the
transcription processes by which proteins and enzymes are synthesized.
Those proteins directly and immediately affect the activity of the cell.


This process is true for all hormones that act via receptors, (as most
do), and it is true for all cells that respond to those hormones. In
other words I am not referring here only to neurons and testosterone. 

DNA controls the activity of cells via non-hormonal mechanisms as well. 

If you honestly believe DNA sits silent except during mitosis then I
would urge you to pick up any high-school physiology text and check
again.

Ah ha!  Perhaps this is the problem.  So far as I know,
Robin *was not* supplying any explanation for the
persistent disagreements in left-right debates.  On
the contrary, he was merely suggesting a prophylactic
or corrective remedy for the case when one *perceives*
that one has a particular bias.

His medicine, when taken as directed above, causes one
to re-estimate one's take on a *minor* or more *specific*
issue (say the mundane recounting of ballots) by shifting
one's opinion in the contrary direction.  I don't remember
if I thought that this was a good idea in this particular
case or not, but I did shoot back the notion that it 
*wouldn't* be of any use, at least not to me, in those
cases where I already held iron-clad opinions.  (For
example, I have an iron-clad opinion about the shape
of the Earth, and tell the Flat Earthers so, whereas
when I'm arguing with leftists, it may turn out that
there is some matter of fact that I need to learn from
them.)

Sorry, you're right:  I am being inconsistent.  I'm not sure
what I was thinking when I wrote that paragraph, and withdraw
it.

I think you are saying (or meant to say) that if A claims B
is wrong a particular fraction of the time, then B is actually
wrong a smaller fraction of time than that, in the case that
A is *certain*; and it's more likely that A is overestimating
his abilities.

If I have paraphrased you correctly, then I agree.

> so I ought to assume that I normally can't justify the
> conclusion that someone else is certainly wrong.

Well, we all know cases where you are not only warranted,
but required, to say that B is certainly wrong.  For example,
if B were to claim that the Peter M. who wrote the above
lines is a small girl, then I'm sure that you would agree
that B is *certainly* wrong, wrong beyond any doubt whatsoever.

> And I don't understand why Robin's trick would be inapplicable
> if I can't justify the conclusion that the other person is
> certainly wrong.

I think that I agree with you (if I didn't before):  Robin's
trick seems applicable in all cases to the degree that the
other party does not seem certainly wrong.  In the case of
the Florida ballots, however, one runs into the old problem
of one's heart leading one's mind.  Suppose a certain person
(Lee) has never considered under what circumstances ballots
should be *recounted*.  Now, a significant issue (like who
is going to be President of the United States) has come up
and demands his opinion on the matter of ballots.  As Lee
tries to think clearly about the issue, the *very* notions
and ideas he employs are *already* tainted by the desired
outcome, and so tainted at an unconscious level.  Finally,
after the appropriate ratiocination, Lee pronounces his
verdict on ballots:  "The stupid ballots are impossible to
get exactly correct, and further recounts will probably be
as suspect as earlier ones:  to hell with it, just count
them once and be done with it, unless we want to *always*
allow losers to obtain a recount!".

So how can I possibly apply Robin's trick?  Here is how I
think I can, but this is the only way I know of:  Let us
suppose that someone asks, "Lee, how sure are you that
ballots should not be recounted?", and I reply "95%". 
Then Robin's trick is to lower that percentage and say
(and believe!) "80%".

Hardly!  I *enjoy* unflattering explanations of (other) people's
behavior.  I readily confess that injunctions like "follow the
money trail!", and "who benefits?" are wise indeed.  No; my 
"explanation" for why people continue useless exhortations are
(1) some people are quite young and haven't seen the futility
of such exhortations  (2) some people are simply naive and
idealistic, and truly believe that *misunderstanding* lies at
the roots of all controversy, and that there are no nasty and
cantankerous souls  (3) many people don't understand how deep,
how substantial, and how almost irreconcilable are people's
disagreements in philosophical, political, and ideological
arenas.

> (My guess is that the biggest single cause of such exhortations

Ugh.  Yes, I forgot that.  By saying "can't we all just
get along", one advertises oneself as a *good* person,
a person who rises above mere conflict and negative
emotions.  "I'm a better person than she."

> I also suspect you underestimate the effectiveness of

Could be.  Sometimes "just say no" really works.  But
in most cases, such exhortations are a waste of time,
and lead young people to thinking that people's minds
are such that this sort of thing is effective.

I agree with your first statement here, and I sense that
you and Robin may have a clearer view than I.  But the
second sentence is completely wrong.  It's obvious that
few minds are really changed during debates;  perhaps
you are referring to my claim that people often *are*
affected weeks or months *after* a debate.  (This was
one of my five claims in "What is Accomplished in Debates"

I'm sorry.  Where does he claim that differences in values
fail to explain lack of objectivity?  Let's see:  yes, I do
acknowledge that "loyalty to a former position", as you were
saying, is a big factor, but it rather begs the question as
to how the former position was obtained in the first place.
Also, I concede that people hate to be seen as *wrong*, and
that also diminishes their objectivity.  But are you thinking
of something more precise when you imply criticism of the
(IMO) crucial role played by differences in values?

Yes, I exaggerated in the opposite direction; but I stand by my
rejection of your original statement that DNA "controls" the operation
of neurons.  The mechanisms of protein synthesis and signaling may
well involve DNA, but the extent to which they do so is essentially
identical in all humans; I suspect most mutations in this area would
prove fatal or cause severe neurological disorders.  Everything that
a neuron does that makes it interesting as part of who I am (and
remember, that's the context of this discussion--let's not lose it
in details) is under the control of the environment external to the
neuron, and is merely /enabled/ by the DNA machinery.

But, alas, we have argued at length about what such
a statement *means*.  People often have no idea why
they do something.  Also, even *if* one concedes that
every behavior has a motivation [sic], then there is
still the sticky problem of *whose* motivation it is.
We've been all through that.

Your notions/speculations about addiction are very 
well taken.

But my guess is that the pigeon would just gradually keep
to the left part of the corridor.  We cannot say simply
"in order to avoid pain" (in this discussion) because of
the possible implications of consciousness (which you wisely
point out became problematical when discussing alligators),
nor can we simply say anything else without being *very*
careful.

My guess is that as the pigeon gradually began to avoid the
electrical shocks one would *not* see any particular rise
in nucleus accumbens activity, *nor* any enhanced dopamine
levels.  One would simply see less neurological activity
that was linked to pain or painful stimuli.

Oh, I believe you.  When Chris Heward and I get to chat he explains

Its "state" information. All of the cells, not just the neurons contain
some history of where they've been, what they've encountered, etc.
I'd consider most of it to be primarily locked up in the proteins,
but if you think about membrane fluidity (which impacts hormone
signal times) then you could include the lipids as well.  [Membrane
fluidity is going to depend in part on your diet over weeks or
months.]

I don't think this is an accurate picture -- the DNA is a blueprint for
most or all of the structures in the neuron.  But the primary "actions"
of the neuron (whether or not to fire) is "controlled" by the surrounding
neurons.

[snip discussion of how testosterone works]

> The entire process is under genetic control.

I understand how the nuclear hormone receptor systems work and agree that
they regulate gene expression which in turn has downstream effects.  *But*
there are many other systems that don't need to go anywhere near the nucleus
to have an effect.  See for example the transpath database:

http://193.175.244.148/

While most things eventually get to the nucleus some of them do so by
quite indirect routes.  The induction of apoptosis for example acts
primarily on the mitochondria -- nuclear effects are probably entirely
secondary (needing to digest the chromatin so it can be easily mopped
up by surrounding cells).

But I think we've gotten into a long debate that gets away from some
of the initial points.  I believe those were that we have chemical
agents acting at very subtle levels to influence our behavior (such
that one might begin to question how much "free will" one really
does indeed have).  Those agents are our selfish genes at work and
one of the tasks facing transhumanists will be to slowly develop
controls over those agents without messing up the entire system.

Originally it was claimed:

       Everything that aliens or SI's can understand
       could be understood by a human, given enough
       time, persistence, motivation, and paper.
       (The presence of pencils and trees is assumed.)

Current progress:

       The meaning of "understand" may not be clear
       or agreed upon by all parties.

Oh, I can just hear the calls now:  "There goes that
wascally Wee Corbin with his symantics and semitics.
Why don't he know  what even Humpty Dumpty know:
'When I use a word, it means exactly what I want
it to mean, nothing more, nothing less.'"  Why 
don't he go for what is *meant*?

In a certain trivial sense, of course, it requires but
a few dozen bytes to store pointers to vast, vast
amounts of information, and, in my example, that's
what the mathematician must do.  When you interrogate
and interrogate and interrogate at finer and finer
levels, he is forced finally to say, "well, I must
consult my notebooks.  I think that maybe I answered
that question to myself somewhere around six-hundred
billion A.D."

So let us inquire into the nature of the X that you
specify here.  I concede that I understand only two
possible cases:  either X has a surface sub-structure
(i.e., the surface part of an enormous sub-structure)
that itself forms a high level explanation despite its
usage of a huge number of unfamiliar concepts, or else
it does not.  If it does not, then it *must* be analogous
to my example of the chess ending KRB vs. KNN.

Now, a few words about that analogy.  I don't really
know (having never studied it) whether it's likely that
this chess ending *can* be broken down into fewer than
332 concepts.  So let us therefore agree that it cannot,
or that there exists a suitable analogy (perhaps the
Skrodes and their Riders).  Gregory Chaitin claims that
most mathematical "theorems" (i.e., platonic theorems)
have the characteristic that they are, in a sense, 
random.  There isn't any particularly good explanation
of why they're true.  I certainly would be willing to
bet that there exist many sets of numbers, each one of
which has some interesting property, but for which no
proof exists.

I wonder here if we are talking about a *feeling* one
often has when dealing with familiar material.  If someone
asks me, "do you understand the relationship between 
democracy and voting?", I would say yes.  But so would
many ten year olds, and we would be critical of the
depth of their understanding.  Vice-versa, I had a
friend who got an A in calculus, but didn't believe
that he understood it.  We both thought that he at 20
understood it better than I had at 15, but what he
lacked was what we decided to call a "conviction demon",
or, the feeling that one understands.

Now since the cardinality of the set {X, Y} is only two,
then the human will have no trouble in "manipulating
the concepts describing X and Y with easy facility".
He may even see them as part of a whole and on the
contrary each made of up parts.  One part may contain
ten or twelve or who knows how many parts.  But if it
contains 233 parts or more, and there *are* no
intervening concepts, then what he really does with
the 233 pieces---namely, consults his notebooks where
he wrote them down in the right order---will be essentially
no different from what the SI does.  (But see below where
I allow for the possibility of lists of relationships.)
Surely we don't want to say that the SI has a conviction
demon and the human does not, because surely this feeling
can be appended easily.

Yes, I have tried to focus on such a case, but
wonder---especially if it's a list that the SI
has in ROM but the human only has in a notebook
---why one would say that the SI *understands*
but the human does not.  What do we mean by
understanding?

BTW, my instinct assures me that this would be
a most excellent time at which to apply Corbin's
Semantic Rule 1:  "When a term begins to cause
confusion, simply replace it with a variety of
phrases or words that also convey what you mean."

If I understand the sentence where 10^6 first crept in,
then perhaps you are saying that the 233-gauge chess chunk
(which I *refer* to as KRB vs. KNN) is one of 10^6 other
1K-gauge chunks, and at a higher level the set of 10^6
things is referred to as (to be concrete) M1.  Well, then,
if the 10^6 set M1 is no more analyzable than was one of
the 233-gauge items, then both the SI and the human are
going to have a list somewhere.  Yes, since the SI has
the list in lightning-fast ROM, it may *feel* much more
in control than does the poor human who must glance
apprehensively at a filing cabinet.  But recall, this
human *is* equipped with total confidence, and a grade AA
conviction demon, and though he knows it will be tedious
and will take some years, he can review the whole 1M items
in M1.

So I ask, what do you mean by "the individual elements of the
SI's cognitive process are simply too large..."?

In other words, you claim that there exist systems with 
chunkable regularities and holonic structure that *could*
be chunked by SI's, but not by humans.

I conclude by saying that in many cases chunking appears
to be nothing more than making a list of items.  In other
cases, the list must be augmented by a list of relationships
between the items.  In either case, I don't see why the
human doesn't finally *understand*.

Often, we mean by "understanding" for an entity to have
speedy access to subcomponents.  I refuse to say that I
understand a certain theorem when all I have is an
extremely good book that I know will explain it well.
Yet if years ago I mastered the proof of a deep topology
theorem, then I may or may not have the feeling that I
still understand it.

> 2)  Never independently chunk even a single one of those regularities;

It's curious that I have always had in mind for my 
claim the *understanding* of a theorem, *not* the
original creation of the proof.  Creativity is for
me a much less certain terrain.  So I wonder if by
"independently" you mean without help, or if you
mean *discover* regularities within structures.

Generally speaking when freedom attempts to mask its own attributes to cater
to the preferences of socialists (like yourself) it can only lose.  It is
among the foremost tools of statists to attempt to subtly (and not so
subtly) influence and control any political discourse according to their own
framing of the issues, often appealing to mob psychology and "don't be a
crazy" tactics.

I was expressing my curiosity about why libertarian candidates seem to get
such bad publicity.  Is it because the strange ones tend to get the bylines?

Oh, I know I'd never get mistaken for a libertarian.  For the record,
however, I've never voted for a bona-fide "socialist" candidate and am not a
card-carrying socialist (but have identified myself as such, because I favor
some socialist ideas).  My hot-button issues (short-list version) are:  YES
to socialized medicine, affirmative action, stipends for one parent to rear
a child or children (either that or government-sponsored daycare), taxing
churches like other entertainment businesses; and NO to corporate welfare,
capital punishment, and school vouchers.

> I suspect the libertarians on the list might take you as being less of a

Statist-socialist sort?  Is that something evil?  (and you lost me
completely on the "envy disguised as principle" remark ... pardon?)  [I]
constantly chime in with comments?  Now, Brian, you're being a meanie.

Okay, so let me ask you for your perception on a "big tent" approach to
transhumanism (for I suppose it would be too much to expect "extropianism"
to entertain a "come one, come all" invitation to, say, a "Cryonics Bash").
I've been on this list for a couple of years, and I still don't understand
why nanotechnology, longevity, cryonic preservation, singularity, and all
the other issues typically discussed on this list wouldn't (or couldn't)
appeal to all sorts of people besides libertarians.  All those subjects
interest me, and ... well, you know ...

I'd like to see some convincing empirical proof of this concept. I
associate "cellular memory" with new age hocus-pocus. Among other
things, cells are constantly dying and being replaced by new cells. How
can the replacement cell get wind of the memories contained in its
predecessor? 

However even if there is a part of the personality not under direct
influence of the genes, this fact alone would not make our genes
dispensable. You essentially agreed when you wrote in a previous message
that "The genes enable specific activities (at cellular or intercellular
levels) that certainly have an impact on personalities." 

As I wrote to Charles I am arguing only that our genes are indispensable
if we hope to preserve our personalities. I am not arguing against the
possibility of other indispensable non-genetic factors that might also
exist. I would include "cellular memory" as one of those other possible
non-genetic factors that make up our personalities. And let's not forget
astrological sign. :-)

I disagree with your wording here. Neurotransmitters work much like
endocrine hormones: after being released by the axon of a neuron they
then bind to their corresponding receptors on the dendrite or body of
the neighboring neuron. Genes influence the numbers and types of
receptors at the receiving neuron, as well as the quantity and types of
neurotransmitters released by the sending neuron. Genes encode the
instructions for the synthesis of both the neurotransmitters and their
receptors. Genes, (in response to hormones like Brain Derived Growth
Factor), also control the synthesis of the proteins necessary for
dendritic expansion, which we know occurs even in adult life.
Testosterone, by the way, inhibits neuronal apoptosis and could affect
personality in that way also.

You'll recall the research I posted in the motivation thread in which it
was discovered that a certain personality trait can be predicted
statistically by the polymorphisms of the dopamine receptor genes found
in the DNA of the test subject. That research alone is sufficient to
prove my case that the information contained in our genes is
indispensable to our personalities. I'll repost it here for others to
read:

ABSTRACT:
D2 and D4 dopamine receptor polymorphisms and personality. 

Am J Med Genet 1998 May 8;81(3):257-67    (ISSN: 0148-7299) 

Noble EP; Ozkaragoz TZ; Ritchie TL; Zhang X; Belin TR; Sparkes RS 
Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences, University of
California, Los Angeles 90024-1759, USA. epnoble@ucla.edu. 

The relationship of various dimensions of temperament, measured by the
Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ), to polymorphisms of the
D2 dopamine receptor (DRD2) and D4 dopamine receptor (DRD4) genes was
determined in 119 healthy Caucasian boys who had not yet begun to
consume alcohol and other drugs of abuse. Total Novelty Seeking score of
the TPQ was significantly higher in boys having, in common, all three
minor (A1, B1, and Intron 6 1) alleles of the DRD2 compared to boys
without any of these alleles. Boys with the DRD4 7 repeat (7R) allele
also had a significantly higher Novelty Seeking score than those without
this allele. However, the greatest difference in Novelty Seeking score
was found when boys having all three minor DRD2 alleles and the DRD4 7R
allele were contrasted to those without any of these alleles. Neither
the DRD2 nor the DRD4 polymorphisms differentiated total Harm Avoidance
score. Whereas subjects having all three minor DRD2 alleles had a
significantly higher Reward Dependence 2 (Persistence) score than
subjects without any of these alleles, no significant difference in this
personality score was found between subjects with and without the DRD4
7R allele. In conclusion, DRD2 and DRD4 polymorphisms individually
associate with Novelty Seeking behavior. However, the combined DRD2 and
DRD4 polymorphisms contribute more markedly to this behavior than when
these two gene polymorphisms are individually considered.

Is there any value to these 2 personal attacks,
regardless of whether anyone feels they are true or
not?  I'm not posting this solely as an attempt to
start an argument, for there could be a valid use
(perhaps as a warning to others who might be duped by
someone?) to it that I don't see.  But if not, then
perhaps such methods degrade the otherwise valid
opinions the poster wants to express.

Note:  The original post (or the part replied to) is
attached at the bottom, to which I don't particularly
see any offensive content in that might invoke such
responses.

Ok so Kramnik slew Fritz7 again today.

Congratufreakinglations Vladimir, and
does it not warm your heart to know that
computers will be twice as fast in a couple
years and ten times as fast in a decade,
whereas you and I will be slower?

There are some interesting notes here
however.  Firstly it is pretty clear
that Fritz7, commercial software running
on a 10k-ish workstation is stronger
than highly specialized software that
ran on DeepBlue just 5 years ago.

Here is more research supporting my view that the information contained
in our genes is indispensable in the preservation of our personalities. 

ABSTRACT
A multivariate analysis of 59 candidate genes in personality traits: the
temperament and character inventory 

DE Comingsa, R Gade-Andavolua, N Gonzaleza, S Wua, D Muhlemana, H
Blakea, MB Manna, G Dietza, G Saucierb and JP MacMurrayc 

Cloninger (Cloninger CR. Neurogenetic adaptive mechanisms in alcoholism.
Science 1987: 236: 410-416) proposed three basic personality dimensions
for temperament: novelty seeking, harm avoidance, and reward dependence.
He suggested that novelty seeking primarily utilized dopamine pathways,
harm avoidance utilized serotonin pathways, and reward dependence
utilized norepinephrine pathways. Subsequently, one additional
temperament dimension (persistence) and three character dimensions
(cooperativeness, self-directedness, and self-transcendence) were added
to form the temperament and character inventory (TCI). We have utilized
a previously described multivariate analysis technique (Comings DE,
Gade-Andavolu R, Gonzalez N et al. Comparison of the role of dopamine,
serotonin, and noradrenergic genes in ADHD, ODD and conduct disorder.
Multivariate regression analysis of 20 genes. Clin Genet 2000: 57:
178-196; Comings DD, Gade-Andavolu R, Gonzalez N et al. Multivariate
analysis of associations of 42 genes in ADHD, ODD and conduct disorder.
Clin Genet 2000: in press) to examine the relative role of 59 candidate
genes in the seven TCI traits and test the hypothesis that specific
personality traits were associated with specific genes. While there was
some tendency for this to be true, a more important trend was the
involvement of different ratios of functionally related groups of genes,
and of different genotypes of the same genes, for different traits.

Have to admit I'm not up on kinetic bottlenecks and quadratic equations, but
I do consider myself a rational person.  I am more of a lurker than a
participant on this list, and do appreciate all the time people have spent
posting their thoughts and ideas (and wish I had more time to read them).

One thing that's always puzzled me is ... why are there so few women on this
list (who routinely - "chime in" - as it were)?   Ladies, come on in! ...

Me too. Libertarians seem to be noisy and can be wearisome to argue with -
simple answers to complex questions make for a nice debating platform (but
you wouldn't want to live there), and I think they attract people who like
to argue for the sake of argument.

It is my opinion that transhumanism requires individualism (it's based on
it), without requiring libertarianism. You can sensibly talk about social
welfare and individualism in the same sentence, and so by extension you can
talk about transhumanism in that context too. 

One concession I'd make to libertarians is that, if there is going to be a
social welfare framework, there should be an opt-out mechanism for those who
want to eschew the costs and benefits. This doesn't exist for most people
today (opting out of any particular regime's influence is not possible for
many people), which is a bad thing. I don't have any good details on how
you'd implement such a proposal, off the top of my head, sorry.

Altho the carbon unit appears to be beating
Fritz, it is clear from the moves that the
machine is playing world class chess.  This
suggests the first clear application of a
microprocessor embedded under the user's
skin.  Assuming a suitable interface could
be worked out, an ordinary pentium class
processor running open-source software could
make one a terrific chess player.

I can think of a number of ways in which a
microprocessor could communicate with the
person in whom it is embedded, assuming only
present-day technology.  An example is audio
output from a device that is hard mounted to
a molar or on the jaw.  Input (for chess)
could be by the equivalent of a mouse click
operated by clacking the teeth.

For instance, if opponent's first move is e2-e4,
the computer could count off A-B-C-D-E {clack}
1-2 {clack}, then the computer would know
that the third character must be an E and
the only two choices are 3 and 4 {clack}.
Then the computer would respond with an
audible (only to the player, since the device
is mounted in his jaw} e7-e5, for instance.

Question: if someone had an implanted microprocessor
that is used for chess matches, how would this
be classified?  Would it not be legal?  They
become an enhanced human, but it isnt clear
to me that sporting matches disallow computer
enhanced humans.  spike

New tracking devices-----------------

Radio frequency identification (RFIDs).

RFID systems consist of smart tags and reader devices. The tags send out 
radio frequency signals, which can be picked up in a short range by readers. 
Unlike bar codes which can carry very limited information, smart tags can 
store and broadcast object-specific information, giving each item its own 
unique identify and history. This aspect of RFID systems is creating 
applications which may today seem like science fiction, but will quickly 
become reality.

Glover Ferguson, writing in Harvard Business Review (June 2002), provides 
some examples:

* Star City Casino has sewn RFID chips into all of its 80,000 garments to 
eliminate losses and laundry bill discrepancies.
* Seagate, which produces tens of thousands of media discs each day, uses 
RFID to track each disc through the manufacturing process, with each 
read-write tag including a production checklist customised to the disc type.
* Ford uses RFID tagging to track inventory and better manage the assembly 
process at its Ontario plant. The key is the smart tag?s ability to capture 
new data on the fly ? something a bar code cannot do.
* IBM ships smart-tagged motherboards on its laptop and desktop computers, 
enabling customers to track the computers within their facilities and 
automatically disable any that are illegally taken offsite.
* At the Yokohama Stroke and Brain Center in Japan, Alzheimers? sufferers 
and patients impaired by head injuries carry RFID-encoded identity cards to 
keep them from wandering into dangerous areas.
* Movie Gallery, a video and DVD rental chain, has used smart tags to cut 
inventory-taking time from eight hours a day or two.

lets them move quickly through toll stations as electronic readers

The article says that RFID?s convenience is now opening it up to new uses in 
mobile commerce: ?RFID systems are much faster than other types of payment. 
There is no fumbling through a wallet, no punching in personal

For the sake of my clarity in discussing this I'm going to shuffle
the order of some of the response -- I hope people will not object.

Actually, I hadn't read this previously but I'm happy to see it
posted and referenced here -- I've been making similar arguments
for years (mostly from a "logical" framework) and its nice to see
some hard data coming along to back it up.

(If it isn't clear, my position would be that we non-trans-humans
*are* currently "largely" our DNA -- at least more than most people
would like to admit.)

While I don't think we disagree in an abstract sense --
we may however disagree at a semantic level or in the "devil
is in the details" of how things are actually implemented.

> That research alone is sufficient to

As humans are currently instantiated, yes -- genetic sequences
clearly play an important role in who we are.  *But* based
on nutritional aspects alone -- I could deprive you of a few
essential vitamins or amino acids and I would have a significant
impact on your personality.  (I'm fairly convinced that this
was the case with myself personally recently -- so arguing
it is entirely "in the genes" is going to be a hard sell --
I didn't change any of my DNA -- I simply fixed my nutritional
levels.)

So while I would agree that "genes contribute to personalies"
I'm rather reluctant to use the term "indispensable".

The reason (at least to me) is obvious -- I can run an atomic
level molecular dynamics simulation of the atoms in your body
and still get out the same "personality" (with no actual
"real" testosterone involved).

So long as a transhuman includes the functionality that
testosterone is supposed to perform (either as similar
or better "hardware" or completely artificial "software")
then I'm uncertain where there is a problem unless there
is some assertion that its hormonal "function" *cannot*
be performed by alternative systems.  This is a systems
engineering problem.

Let me be clear that I'm not invoking anything "new age" (while
I may lean that way at times with respect to discussions of
spirituality -- I don't lean that way with my science.)

The "empirical proof" is easy to produce.  Just go do a PubMed
search on the topics of membrane fluidity and lipid free radical
reactions.  For many hormone-secondary messanger reactions to take
place the receptors have to diffuse and make contact with their
"partners" in the membrane.  Stiffer membranes (depending on fatty
acid nutrients in the diet or cross-linking due to free radical
reactions and/or aging) *will* slow down the rate of protein
diffusion within the membrane.  That will in turn slow down reaction
times, thought processes, recall ability, etc.

At least some of the changes in "personality" that occur with age
*don't* occur because our DNA is changing -- the occur because
the rest of the hardware isn't working as well as it once did.
There is "memory" in the cells entirely outside of the DNA.
One only has to look at tests of collagen crosslinking (a commonly
used measure of effective "age") to realize that not all proteins
are replaced so effectively that we have the machinery of a 10 year old.

Wait a minute here -- there *are* cells in your body that are dividing
and constantly being replaced -- but they are surface cells.  (View
the human body as a somewhat deformed doughnut -- all of the external
and internal "exposed" cells are replacing themselves.)  All of the
rest of the cells (heart, other muscles, liver, kidney, pancreas,
brain) have *very* low turnover rates.  Perhaps Anders who may be
more familiar with the literature could offer an opinion as to
the turnover rate for neurons.  One probably has ~40 billion neurons,
the loss rate definitely exceeds the replacement rate, but the
replacements are probably only coming in at the rate of dozens
or hundreds per day (???).  Neurons are designed to *not* die
and replace themselves -- otherwise you would lose your existing
knowledge base.

I would be more comfortable with the claim that "the functions that our
genes perform are indispensable for our personalities".

> And let's not forget astrological sign. :-)

Now now now.  I'm trying to uplift the general tone of the discussion
and using morter shells when cannon balls are sufficient isn't very
nice.  :-;

I would agree with the analogy that hormones are to a large degree
like neurotransmitters acting over a much larger distance.

I'd go a little but further -- I think the neurotransmitter quantity
and quality may be heavily influenced by the area of the brain it is
in which probably depends quite heavily on the developmental DNA blueprint.

*But* the genome cannot encode the organizing of 40 billion neurons or
much less the neurotransmitter types and strengths at specific synapses.
The brain *has* to be somewhat self-organizing which means there is some
fraction of personality encoded in the structure and *not* in the genes.

So the glove on the table has a tag attached that says "Why cannot one
self-organizing collective be replaced with another self-organizing
(or even a predesigned) collective?

I cite -- "looks like a duck, walks like a duck, quacks like a duck".
Where is the proof that it isn't for all intents and purposes really
and truly a "duck"?

Robert

P.S. (Damien, I know if you read this you are squirming in your seat
with that voice in the back of your head screaming "But its not me!".

As I've written, my axiom contains no requirement that the person be
consciously aware of his motivation for acting.

That reminds me of something I had meant to write to you in an earlier
message:

I had written words to the effect that my idea that "Each person has as
part of his person a motivation to breathe" is an obvious truth of human
nature, and one that intelligent people should not waste time debating.

Because you continued to deny ownership of your motivation to breathe, I
asked if you thought it was "of God." You replied that it was "of
evolution," or words to that effect. 

To say that the will to breathe is "of evolution" is to say that it is
"of nature." Specifically it is to say that it is "of human nature." And
that, Lee, is what I stated at the outset. It is an obvious truth of
human nature and one not worthy of debate.

Thank you. That subject is one I find truly interesting and worth
discussing.

Maybe. Perhaps someone should round up some pigeons and find out. 

But consider it in human terms. Don't you feel a rewarding feeling when
you act in ways that avoid serious pain? I sure do. If the avoided pain
was really serious then I breathe a sigh of relief, thank my lucky
charms, and maybe pat myself on the back for being clever enough to
avoid the pain. And I know that rewarding feeling doesn't come from the
stars. It comes from activity in the reward centers in my brain.
Evolution equipped me with this reward circuitry so that I would avoid
pain and have more baby gts's. :)

This is such a simple issue, it takes no squirming or screaming to get it
right.

For other people who are not me (including my exact-as-of-xoxing-moment
emulation), my copied or constructed emulation is operationally my
equivalent. You can't tell, he can't tell. The world delights in the
presence of that duck.

For *me*, that damned duck might as well be somebody's mother. Sure isn't
*me*, I'm over here on the scanning stage, so take your disintegrator
raygun away from my head, it gives *me* no comfort that my emulation is out
there.

What's hard to understand about this distinction?

newspaper) downloadable from the Internet or CD.

1. How does SmartPaper? work?

The Gyricon technology uses an array of tiny (100 micron diameter or 
smaller) solid beads with one hemisphere of each bead one color (e.g. white) 
and the other a different color (e.g. black). These beads are embedded in a 
flexible plastic sheet in small cavities surrounded by a liquid. Each bead 
carries an electrical charge. When an external electric field is applied the 
bead rotates or "gyrates" (hence the name Gyricon). Adhesive forces between 
each bead and cavity wall require an electrical threshold be exceeded before 
it will rotate. This makes an image electrically "printed" onto the material 
stable and unchanging until "erased" by another transmission. Electrical 
signals can be applied to the SmartPaper? sheets through fixed surface 
electrodes or a moving stylus.

2. What are the power requirements (drive voltage) for displays using 
SmartPaper??

A networked programmable sign will run for up to 2 years on 3 AA batteries, 
with the power almost completely used by the communications and processing 
systems. SmartPaper? itself requires just a capacitance or voltage (about 
100 volts), not a power current. Display battery power levels can be 
monitored by MaestroWare? software and does not limit remote control 
addressability and functionality.

3. What is the maximum viewing angle for SmartPaper??

Unlike other types of electronic displays, SmartPaper? has a wide viewing 
angle identical to traditional printed signs. This allows SmartPaper? to be 
viewed like paper, from all angles and without added backlighting.

4. What is the maximum resolution of SmartPaper? (dpi)?

Images can currently be displayed on SmartPaper? with resolution over 100 
dpi.

5. What will the resolution of SmartPaper? be a year from now?

We are currently producing signs that offer resolution at 100 dpi, but 
expect to improve the resolution over time to at least 300 dpi. However, 
even at 100 dpi our SmartPaper? offers substantially smooth-edged resolution 
to text and graphics: Hundreds of bichromal beads make up single "pixel" 
segments and electric fields have a smoothing effect.

6. What type of lighting does a display made with SmartPaper? use?

The image material used in SmartPaper? is reflective like paper or poster 
board, and is clearly readable in ambient light. Unlike some other displays, 
SmartPaper? does not require backlighting and images do not "wash-out" in 
fluorescent or bright lighting.

7. Do SmartPaper? images fade over time?

No, because they are based on pigments rather than dyes.

8. What is the lifetime of a SmartPaper? display?

Displays made with SmartPaper? generally do not degrade over time and will 
last for years. While rigorous product testing is ongoing, signs made with 
SmartPaper? have performed more than 5 million image changes without 
malfunction or fading.

9. What is the maximum time a SmartPaper? display can hold an image?

Images displayed on SmartPaper? are "held" indefinitely until a new 
electrical signal is applied.

10. What font sizes and styles are available for use with SmartPaper??

When a sign using SmartPaper? is designed using pre-set images or messages, 
fonts of any type and size may be used. There are no restrictions on message 
character sizes or font styles for Multiple Fixed Image (MFI) messaging 
applications. Any text point size from 20 pt. up to the size of the full 
display surface can be used.

When a sign using SmartPaper? is networked and designed to display a field 
of programmable text that can be changed using MaestroWare? software, 
several proprietary font options are available or may be custom-developed.

11. Are there any environmental application limits to SmartPaper? 
(indoor/outdoor, operating & storage temps., humidity, etc.)?

SmartPaper? is fundamentally suitable to both indoor and outdoor display 
uses. However, initial SmartPaper? displays will offer optimal performance 
in indoor applications with ambient temperatures from 0-50 C.

12. What are the dimensions and weights of available MaestroSign? System 
signs made with SmartPaper??

Our current models of MaestroSigns made with SmartPaper? are 3/4" thick 
including the housing. Unhoused sheets of SmartPaper? can be made to less 
than 1/10" thickness. SmartPaper? display surfaces may also be easily 
mounted to other display areas or promotional media.

13. How do you erase SmartPaper? displays or change messages?

Applying electrical fields to the display surface changes the image on 
SmartPaper?. A range of techniques (with different flexibility and cost 
factors) will achieve this result. In the least expensive option, the back 
plane contains several possible images or pre-programmed text and digit 
messages (this is called a Multiple Fixed Image or MFI sign). Alternatively, 
the back plane can contain circuitry addressed to an array of pixels that 
can be written individually. Which image or message is displayed can be 
controlled by either programming the sign to display a fixed sequence when 
it is manufactured or a dynamically changeable sequence using MaestroWare? 
software and a wireless network attached to a local PC or the Internet.

14. Are there any size limitations to SmartPaper? displays?

SmartPaper? displays can be flexibly sized to fit the needs of retailers, 
and potentially range from as small as 3"x5" to as large as 48"x48". 
Standard sizes for signs we are currently offering range from 3"x5" to 
11"x14", and are approximately 3/4" thick with their housing. Additional 
sign sizes from 10"x11" up to 18"x28" have been developed and are available 
as a custom order.

15. How does SmartPaper? compare to E-Ink?

Gyricon technology uses an array of tiny (100 micron diameter or smaller) 
solid beads with one hemisphere of each bead one color e.g. white and the 
other a different color e.g. black. These beads are embedded in a flexible 
plastic sheet in small cavities surrounded by a liquid. Each bead carries an 
electrical charge. When an external electric field is applied the bead 
rotates or "gyrates" (hence the name Gyricon). Adhesive forces between the 
bead and the cavity wall require an electrical threshold to be exceeded 
before it will rotate.

The E-Ink process is based on electrophoresis and uses similar size beads 
also embedded in a flexible plastic sheet that encapsulate liquid containing 
dyes and pigmented particles. The particles acquire an electrical charge 
from interaction with the liquid. When an electric field is applied, the dye 
and pigmented particles are attracted to opposite ends of the inside of the 
bead.

16. How many beads are in a 10.5"x11" sheet of SmartPaper??

A display surface, such as a sign sized 10.5x11, contains 30 million Gyricon 
beads.

17. Can SmartPaper? be tampered with electronically?

No. Due to the way signs are constructed, they can not be tampered with by 
magnets, static electricity, PDAs, cell phones, or other electronic devices.

18. What types of sign housings are available for SmartPaper??

Standard plastic housings that offer maximum protection and visibility for 
SmartPaper? are available in black matte and chrome finishes. Additional 
finishes and mounting options are available on a custom basis.

19. What are the possible future uses of SmartPaper??

Gyricon Media, Inc. is currently focused on retail applications. However, 
the SmartPaper? technology is obviously well suited to a wide variety of 
other market applications, including PDA displays and electronic 
books/newspapers. GYRICON MEDIA, Inc. will focus on a single market at a 
time in order to establish enduring strategic partnerships and a solid 
business base. In the future, the company will move into other markets by 
expanding the organization and obtaining additional strategic partners that 
understand those markets.

20. What maintenance is required for SmartPaper??

Apart from ensuring that batteries have sufficient charge, signs made with 
SmartPaper? can be easily cleaned by wiping with a damp cloth or normal 
non-abrasive window cleaners.

21. When will signs made with SmartPaper? be available?

Black and white signs using SmartPaper? technology will be available in 
limited quantities for initial customers this year. Larger volumes for 
general distribution will be available early in 2002. Additional color 
combinations will also be available next year.

22. Does SmartPaper? use or contain any hazardous materials?

SmartPaper? does not use or contain any toxic chemicals or other hazardous 
materials. SmartPaper? also does not require any special handling or 
disposal.

23. Who invented SmartPaper??

Dr. Nick Sheridon invented SmartPaper? while at Xerox PARC (Palo Alto 
Research Center).

No.  I don't think that you are missing anything.
But on the other hand, I too have been provoked
into saying less than kind things to Olga (which
I always regretted later).

There is no doubt that she has considerable talent
in this area.

But she still has yet to have an entire thread
devoted to her comeuppance, and so I do believe
that she still has a few things to learn from me.

Having been of the same stance as Damien on this one, I've recently changed
my view. I now think all of the vaguely consistent viewpoints are correct.

Basically, I think that whatever you believe is probably how it is for you.
After all, we are talking about subjective phenomena here.

For instance, when those in the xox-is-me camp are replicated, how are they
going to feel about it? The "original" will think "I am me, and so is the
other guy". The copy is going to think "I am me, and so is the other guy".
If one of them is to be disintegrated (say the "original"), then he's going
to be ok about it, because "that guy over there is also 'me'", unless he has
a sudden change of heart. He wont expect to *feel* like "that guy over there
is 'me'" because he "knows" it doesn't work that way.

On the other hand, if you believe that the copy is not you, then, on xoxing,
the original is going to say "See, I'm still here, don't point that thing at
me." The Xox will say "Wow, that feels like I just teleported from that
table to this one, but then it would, wouldn't it? Don't zap that guy, he's
the original. Don't zap me either, I'm valid even if I'm a copy."

I guess I'm saying that identity is constructed by the identified. On the
subject of identity and duplicates, believe what you will and it is so.

Preposterous and totally uncalled for. (I realize that to Lee Daniel
Crocker I would fall into the same category.) One more notch of the dial
toward my unsubbing from this increasingly dismal list, at any rate.

But it does, Robert. This gets to the heart of the controversy here. I
think it deserves this separate message. 

It truly puzzles me that my fellow extropes seem to have so little
appreciation for the marvelous products of biological evolution. It is
as though some here almost resent their biological natures... like Paul
of the New Testament lamenting about sins of the flesh. 

The so-called "self-organizing" property of neurons cannot exist unless
the genes that code for the construction of neurons are such that they
allow for self-organization. It can be said that this so-called
self-organization property is gene expression of the second order. By
trial and error over billions of years, nature has finally produced
genes capable of these second-order expressions. Smile and be happy.

But isn't this influence (by the genes) far in the past,
as, for example, Plato influences my thoughts, but we

Yes, but suppose that you were at a podium giving a
speech.  Suddenly, semi-Divine technology makes your
DNA inert, and the messenger RNA can't work on it,
although protein synthesis continues (for a while).
How long, would you guess, would it be before a word
of your speech was not delivered?

One more question:  suppose that protein synthesis
had been stopped instead.  How long before there is
a noticeable effect on your delivery?

There's NO technical reason for this. And the press release is more or

No -- there's no real value to these personal attacks and I think Lee's
out of line.  For my brief comments, see below, beyond the asterisks.

Speaking as someone who is not a capital "L"
Libertarian, the
perception of
Libertarians from my home planet is that there is a
great "nut" factor
there.  This may indeed be unfair, but that is the
perception.

 * * *

I'll work backwards -- starting from Olga's comments.  She was simply
stating a fact about "her home planet", which I take to be a poetic way
of saying the social and cultural milieu in which she lives.  She also
said that the perception she described might be unfair -- a significant
caveat and one that should have insulated her from any attack, and
certainly the kind of words Lee aimed at her.

Beyond this, the substance of what Olga wrote is *important*.  The fact
is that libertarians (whether "big 'L'" or "little 'l'") *are* perceived
as "nutty" by the vast majority of people in America, much less in
Europe, where they are perceived as utterly beyond the pale -- if they
get any attention at all.  The only way anyone could not be aware of
this would be by being cut off from mainstream culture.  If you find
yourself living in a world in which you don't encounter people who find
libertarians at least an odd curiosity, you need to get out more.

Now, I realize that there is a vastly disproportionate measure of
libertarianism among the culture that's grown up around the origins of
cyberspace -- but this culture is practically unique in its lack of
connection to the mainstream world, with its deep grounding in the
cultural and political history of the last two hundred years.  Outside
of it, most people assume as a given that a powerful state is a
necessity, that public goods can only be provided by or must be
regulated by that state and that the absence of a such a state would
result in injustice at best and violent chaos at worst.  Libertarians
may believe all this is wrong, but heaping scorn on people who express
these ideas does absolutely *nothing* to further the cause of liberty,
since it only acts to further marginalize libertarian ideas.

No! These genetic influences change dynamically in time, according to
the manner in which one's genes are programmed to respond to different
internal and external stimuli. 

The genes themselves are of course fixed, but the manner in which they
are expressed changes. This is why I wrote that your blueprint analogy
is weak. Genes are not like blueprints. They are more like algorithms or
machines. They operate in time as well as space. It's for this reason
that a biological "snapshot" of yourself at a given time is insufficient
for preserving your personality, unless that snapshot includes the
genetic instructions for their expressions in response to future
environments not present in the snapshot.

Depression, for example, can be endogenous or exogenous. In the
exogenous form, the person's brain is affected by external events (e.g.,
death of a family member) rather than by some internal biological or
genetic defect. The response to that exogenous event seems to be
determined largely by the genes. Some people are emotionally resilient
to unfortunate circumstances while others are devastated by them.

I would guess a very short time. But you make the question vague by
allowing protein synthesis to continue for a while. If we could keep the
transcription process alive and accurate without DNA then we would not
need DNA.

I'd guess maybe a second or two, at most, but that's only a hunch. It
might be only a couple of nanoseconds. I don't know.

This research should be especially interesting to you, Robert. In this
study it was found that people with a certain gene polymorphism were
7.54 times more likely to suffer from seasonal mood disorders. The
relevant gene codes for the synthesis of the 5-HT2A receptor (one of
several serotonin receptors). 

ABSTRACT:
Variability in the 5-HT(2A) receptor gene is associated with seasonal
pattern in major depression. 

Mol Psychiatry 2001 Mar;6(2):239-42    (ISSN: 1359-4184) 
Arias B; Gutierrez B; Pintor L; Gasto C; Fananas L 
Unitat d'Antropologia, Departament de Biologia Animal, Facultat de
Biologia, Universitat de Barcelona, Diagonal 645, 08028 Barcelona,
Spain. 

The 102-T/C polymorphism of the 5-HT(2A) receptor gene was analysed in
159 patients with major depression and 164 unrelated and healthy
controls using a case-control design. Allele and genotype frequencies
did not differ between cases and controls. No differences according to
sex, age of onset, melancholia, suicidal behaviour or family history of
psychiatric illness were found. However, genotype distributions
significantly differed between patients with seasonal pattern in their
episodes (MDS) and patients with no seasonal pattern (N-MDS) (chi(2) =
10.63; P = 0.004). A seasonal pattern was 7.57 times more frequent in
102C-allele carriers than in 102T homozygous (95.1% of patients MDS
carried 102C-allele vs 72% of patients N-MDS (chi(2) = 9.45, df=1, P =
0.002; OR = 7.57 (95% CI: 1.65--48.08)). These results suggest that
variation in the 5-HT2A receptor gene may play a role in the development
of major depression with seasonal pattern and support the existence of a
genetic and etiological heterogeneity underlying the diagnosis of major
depression.

The problem is that the emulations are no longer identical in fact they are
no longer even very close. One is undergoing a traumatic experience knowing
his head is about to be blown off and the other is not. As long as the
emulations are identical there is no way anybody could tell the difference
and there is no way you could tell if it had already happened to you. You
might have been "killed" and replaced with a duplicate last night, but who
cares? I figure if nobody, not even you, can tell the difference then there
is no difference.

### Why do you think so?

You might want to peruse some data on the speed of mRNA synthesis and
processing, transport to the cytoplasm, protein translation, protein
processing, and protein trafficking. From cell tissue experiments, the early
effects of blocking of protein synthesis in neural cells take many hours to
show up, and a few days before the cells die. Blocking information
transmission at an earlier stage, in transcription, much more removed from
the day-to-day rendering of consciousness, would take even longer to
manifest.

Genes provide an infinitesimally small amount of the information needed to
specify a person. I really do not understand your fixation on them.

I said it was a hunch, Rafal. I don't know the answer to Lee's question.
And I don't believe you do either.

There is nothing more germaine to specifying a person than his genes,
but I am not saying a person is nothing more than his genes.

In my view the development of the personality involves a constant
feedback loop with the genes that influence personality. We perceive our
envioronment and respond to it according to things we've learned from
past experiences, modified by the influences of our genes. Those
perceptions and responses are referenced again in response to similar
stimuli, and again modified by those genes that affect personality. It
is not an either/or proposition. Our personalities are the sum of our
genetic influences and our learned responses.

Prompted by discussion on this list, I picked up a copy of Pinker's 
"How the Mind Works" and have just reached the half-way point.

I find it rather sad that I feel I need to insert a disclaimer at this 
point - especially with this bright bunch - but recent list squabbles 
make me feel it's necessary.  This email is intended to provoke 
thoughtful discussion, not to raise anyone's ire.  If you've nothing 
positive to contribute, the delete key is an inch away. :)

That being said - the part of the book that's fascinated me the most so 
far is explanation of the visual system.  Especially the part about 
motion- and space-sickness.  And it got me thinking about how long it 
would take to re-train our minds and bodies use our individual eyes 
independent of one another.

Pinker went to great lengths to explain "cyclopian" vision - or the 
image our brain receives from the combined input of both eyes... and 
how it all works.  He presented stereograms (which I *still* can't 
see), illusions and diagrams to show how our side-by-side eyes 
construct this image.  But it left me wondering about other animals - 
owls, fish, whales, squid(?) whose eyes are in a much different 
configuration.  What do their cyclopian images look like and how has it 
affected their evolutionary behavior?

But stepping back to space-sickness.  Pinker explained that this was 
caused by a combination of what the eyes see and the way the inner ear 
is set up to account for gravity.  From what I understand of the way 
the inner ear works, it's all based on vibration - which leads me to 
wonder whether a specialized set of earmuffs might be able to cancel 
out the vibrations and reduce motion- or space-sickness.  I suppose it 
would require some sort of gyroscope and a way to create vibrations 
that gave the inner ear an artificial sense of gravity.  How off-base 
am I on this?

And back to changing our physiology - I want to pose this question - 
what would the human body look like and behave like after a thousand or 
so generations in a zero-gravity environment?  What evolutionary 
obstacles would have to be overcome?  What I would consider non-answers 
such as "we'll have reached the Singularity by that point so our bodies 
won't matter" are to be expected - but let's say that nothing that 
grand happens and humans are just left to live in space for awhile.  
What's the outcome?

Oh yeah. :)

It was quite an awful movie, but I just had to tell the group about a 
few scenes of interest.

Quick synopsis:
Jason Vorhees, invincible homicidal maniac, is cryogenically frozen in 
2000-something and thawed out again on a space station in 
2400-something.  He starts killing people again and eventually 
encounters a bunch of nano-bots that give him an upgrade.

It's particularly interesting to see how (comparatively) low-budget, 
b-rated flicks like this portray the freezing/unfreezing and 
nano-medicine processes.  There wasn't anything quite like a "utility 
fog", but it did a better job of portraying limb-reconstruction than 
the Fifth Element (in which an entire body was replaced).  Oh, also 
worth mentioning, there were a few scenes involving 25th century video 
games - which as you might guess have a strong holo-deck/VR feel to 
them.

Anyway, if you have a strong stomach and/or a penchant for morbid 
humor, head on down to your locally-owned rental outlet and pick this 
one up.

My intention was to assure Brian that he's not the only
person who may have chosen to ignore Olga, and that he's
probably quite rational to do so.  If it is considered
a "personal attack" to point out that discussion with
certain people is unlikely to be fruitful because of the
evasive style of rhetoric they choose, then such faux
politeness will interfere with useful discussion here.

I don't object in the slightest to Olga or anyone else
posting a note that some members of the LP are kooks.
Everyone knows that, and we know that we are perceived
that way.  The problem is that she posted the note /as if
it were a response/ to a discussion of libertarianism,
when it's quite clear that it was totally irrelevant.
It's not the rudeness of the remark that I objected to,
but the deliberate evasiveness--going out of her way to
avoid the issue she was supposedly discussing to bring
up something to make the other side look bad.  She does
this constantly, which is why I no longer read her.
You are mistaken to claim that she was "expressing an
opinion"--she was not.

There are certainly other people here of a more liberal
bent; I still listen to Samantha, for example, because
even though I think she has lots of silly ideas, she
does at least have ideas, and apparently cares about
finding the truth about things.  I can't say that about
Olga, so I simply ignore her, and recommend others do
as well.

Why would you assume I think that of you?  Quite the contrary, I
consider you one of the most valuable contributors here.  Indeed, I
am baffled why you would think otherwise.  You are not the slightest
bit evasive and deceptive like Olga; you have meaningful ideas, you
express them clearly, and you respond to others.  What more could a
rational person want?

"Olga Bourlin" wrtites

<<I was expressing my curiosity about why libertarian candidates seem to get
such bad publicity.  Is it because the strange ones tend to get the bylines?

Oh, I know I'd never get mistaken for a libertarian.  For the record,
however, I've never voted for a bona-fide "socialist" candidate and am not a
card-carrying socialist (but have identified myself as such, because I favor
some socialist ideas). >>

 I happen to be a card carrying libertarian, but a club card is hardly
neccessary
to be in a certain political camp.
< My hot-button issues (short-list version) are:  YES
to socialized medicine, affirmative action, stipends for one parent to rear
a child or children (either that or government-sponsored daycare), taxing
churches like other entertainment businesses; and NO to corporate welfare,
capital punishment, and school vouchers.>>

 Yeah like I said.. a statist-socialist sort in spades.
 You support govermentalization of my trade (medicine), and the rest of the
list
is even more odious. On the NO list we agree but for completely different
reasons.
(I support dueling as an alternative to capital punishment, complete
elimination of
the need for vouchers by dismantling all public schools, and don't believe
in
the taxes neccessary to sustain welfare, corporate or otherwise).


<<Statist-socialist sort?  Is that something evil?  >>

If you have to ask....

<(and you lost me
completely on the "envy disguised as principle" remark ... pardon?)>>

 It's the old line that communism has transmuted in the modern
age into democratic socialism which is largely group envy masquerading
as virtue and high principle.
<  [I] constantly chime in with comments?  Now, Brian, you're being a
meanie.>>
Sorry, said "constantly" when I should have said "invariably".


<Okay, so let me ask you for your perception on a "big tent" approach to
transhumanism (for I suppose it would be too much to expect "extropianism"
to entertain a "come one, come all" invitation to, say, a "Cryonics Bash").
I've been on this list for a couple of years, and I still don't understand
why nanotechnology, longevity, cryonic preservation, singularity, and all
the other issues typically discussed on this list wouldn't (or couldn't)
appeal to all sorts of people besides libertarians.  All those subjects
interest me, and ... well, you know ...

Olga>>

Big tent? I believe in freedom first. Technology is a tool
(albeit a pervasive one).  If someone has not yet gotten
a good grip on sensible economic theory (TANSTAAFL)
and the idea of self-ownership (even if they do not neccessarily agree
with it) then they have work to do before I get involved. Socialism is
a plague meme IMHO, and a "socialist transhumanist" is virtually a
contradiction in terms. It could be made to work I suppose, but the
core of the transhuman ethos is, and hopefully will continue to be, one
rooted in liberty and the idea of freedom. Things you believe are
negotiable in exchange for some things. I don't believe they are
negotiable, one can steal them from me, take them by threat or force,
but one can't buy them, nor will I sell someone else's.
  You would in a hot second for the greater good.  Certain situations
I would work with you, preservation of life and limb of course. But
it's strictly a matter of neccessity, you don't believe in respect for
property as I conceive of it.
  The reason why transhumanist ideas don't appeal to more people
of other political stripes is that often other political philosophies appeal
to moral principle or authority rather than reason, and instinctive
rejection of the truly novel (as a threat to one's brainwashing) is
usually part and parcel of the political ethos in question.
  Put very simply,
  I don't care to be in your tent. The airlock is *that* way. Have a nice
day.

If it were to insure Brian only, then might I suggest
doing so off-list?  If, as I assume you mean, it was
meant to warn others as well, then your choice of
phrasing was really poor.  I believe the quote started
as "Nobody mistakes Olga for being interested in
rational discussion...".  Perhaps something more like
"It has been my experience that Olga does not partake
in rational debate..." (this is not an expression of
views but an attempt to reword) would display the same
sentiment but not sound so spiteful.

I did not get that impression on reading it, in fact
having little recollection of Olga's prior posts,
interpreted what she said as supporting libertarianism
by encouraging members to try and get a better public
reputation instead of the crazy image she, and
apparently you, agree they have.  I could have
misinterpreted her original post, but either way, your
post came accross as a cheap shot...I wasn't sure if I
alone perceived in that way, but later posts reflect
that others agree...so whether justified or not, you
are portraying an image to others that you may/may not
want associated with yourself.

Again, I thought nothing less of libertarians from her
post.  In fact, I read the news clips, one about a
candidate turning blue from silver (oxide?), and
didn't even necessarily think of him as a kook, but
just that he received a bad press revue for
experimenting in health issues.  I agree that people
who read that article probably saw him as some wacko,
and associated it with libertarian ideals, whereas it
would help anyone who believes in libertarian ideals
to get some more positive press to be associated with.

### I doubt that such details could be invented. After all, the recipients
of welfare (the non-working class, the parents who don't have to pay for
their children, the government teachers who don't have to compete for
vouchers, the smokers who don't have to pay for the medical care they
receive, and the affirmatively helped ones) are not the same as the payers
(the working class, parents who do pay for their children, honest teachers
who want to work for the students rather than the government, people willing
to pay for their own medical care, and the Asian-Americans who are
discriminated against because of their race). If the payers could opt out,
you'd be left with payees only, which is not likely to satisfy any of their
perceived "needs".

Points well taken.  Diplomacy is not my strong suit,
as many here already know.  I personally find such
strained, evasive, dancing-around-the-issue talk to
be /more/ offensive than simple direct statements of
opinion, even harsh ones, but I suppose that's just me.
 
> Again, I thought nothing less of libertarians from

Nor did I; many LP members are indeed kooks, and the
party organization is corrupt.  I make no attempt to
dodge those issues, and they are important ones.  My
only objection was that this had nothing whatsoever to
do with the post to which it was offered as a reply.

Damien replied:
Preposterous and totally uncalled for. (I realize that to Lee Daniel
Crocker I would fall into the same category.) One more notch of the dial
toward my unsubbing from this increasingly dismal list, at any rate.
(end)

Just for the record, Olga is one of my favorite people around here for her insightful observations.

Damien, we both really enjoy(sometimes) the extrolist, but perhaps you should unsub yourself for other much more important reasons!  

If you were to concentrate all the time you devote here to other perhaps more fruitful pursuits, you would probably publish at least one more book a year than you presently do! lol  So you would have more needed fame and fortune.

You would also have more time for your real world relationships, and so your life would be enriched in that area!

The following people just might be transformed by unsubbing from the extrolist... 

Eliezer Yudkowsky- Without the extrolist he finally makes all the theoretical breakthroughs to fully go forward with his seed A.I. project.  Eliezer also finally has time to do the schmoozing necessary to get the funding he sorely desires!  The Singularity soon follows. : )

Robert Bradbury- Becomes the Bill Gates of biotech, and has time to meet and marry the woman of his dreams.  They have a zillion kids, who make concentrating on email postings impossible!

If there had been an extrolist when Bill Gates was just getting started, there might have never been a mighty Microsoft! ; )

best wishes,

John

Incorrect. Randy Weaver beat the government at its own game with
nothing but some high powered rifles and a good lawyer.

The tyrant can only afford to waste $x on tyrannizing each individual.
If tyrant Y spends more than x, his economy goes down the shitter and
his government collapses (i.e. USSR, 1990). X includes the life
insurance payoff, the cost of training, equipping, and supporting the
thugs that an oppressed individual winds up killing.

After WWII, an American general asked members of the former Tojo
government why they did not just invade the west coast of the US
instead of wasting so many men on complex maneuvers on so many pacific
islands. The Japanese said that they thought the idea of facing so many
armed civilians in the US made it entirely impossible and the worst
possible strategy. They had enough trouble dealing with the Hukbulahap
insurgents in the Phillipines.

One man with a gun can neutralize an entire government. Just look at
one lone nutjob running around the greater DC area is doing right now.
He has the population paralyzed and the police perplexed, paralyzed,
ineffectual and irrelevant. Imagine if there were a few thousand (out
of a population of several million) such individuals doing what he is
doing at the same time, each acting as individuals. Organized armies
used by tyrants are entirely ineffectual against such insurgencies when
the insurgents are made up of the native population.

It's not just you, Lee, but then again, all libertarians are considered
rude and offensive merely for existing and having the opinions they do
(at least by the socialist-statist inclined). Since it's been
objectively proven by history that socialism is a kooky economic
system, ergo socialists are kooks for continuing to believe in a kooky
philosophy, being called a kook by a kook results in a null, and merely
makes you normal.

Another 'kooky' characteristic of libertarians (at least according to
the bleeding hearts) is that we 'refuse' to empathize with those that
we are accused of oppressing with our ideas. We don't "feel their
pain", we don't "Do it for the children"... etc etc.

LP members who are kooks tend to be kooks for entirely different
reasons than their belief in libertarian ideas. You will find kooks
everywhere in life. The primary form of kookiness I've found in
libertarian circles is a stubborn insistence upon being logical and
rational at all times. We should have more such kookiness.

To those who are constitutionally incapable of rational and logical
reasoning, libertarians are indeed quite kooky, but then, consider the source...

rooted in liberty and the idea of freedom. Things you believe are negotiable
in exchange for some things. I don't believe they are negotiable, one can
steal them from me, take them by threat or force, but one can't buy them,
nor will I sell someone else's.

Not that it entitles me to my beliefs more any more than it entitles you to
yours, but (because I have detected how you have a kind of abiding respect
for men who've fought and sacrificed their lives for "freedom"), my father's
youngest brother died in World War II to help preserve your right to believe
what you want ... and for me to believe what I want.  Say "thank you" to him
next time you're in the Bay Area (he's listed under my last name, Bourlin):

You'd work with me in certain situations?  I'll take that as a teensy step

Hmm, maybe Olga is still a gorgon, after all.  :-<

All right, Lee Daniel, you are probably not reading this, but just in case,
and for the record:

I am assuming what you are saying is:  Even though certain people may have
liberal/left-leaning tendencies they just MAY be considered rational by you
if you personally find them valuable (for expressing their ideas
meaningfully and clearly, and for being responsive in a way that you approve
of).

As to those other people who may not meet your lofty standards and strict
criteria, it is not enough to simply put them on "ignore" - they must first
bear your scorn and your accusations about their character.

> What more could a rational person want?

At the risk of taking advantage (evasive and deceptive irrational creature
that I am) of a phrase that was not directed at me, and stepping into the
fray anyway (women can be so uppity sometimes), my answer to that question
would be that I would want SWEETNESS ... as well as clarity.

Actually Olga didn't write that, I did.

I think that the situation with redistribution of resources ala welfare is
quite a bit more complex than you make out. I made a mistake by calling it
welfare; I should have used some larger term like government services.
Including that old saw, roads.

It seems to me that the EU has a quasi-opt-out setup now, in that an EU
passport gives you very wide choice over where to go work and live. This
means much greater freedom of movement (within the EU). For those who are
actually in the EU, how's that working out? Any interesting stories to tell
about mass movements between countries due to legislative/economic
differences?

They will feel just as confident as the Heaven's Gate dupes who died in the
expectation of awakening in the cometary UFO.How you feel really *isn't* a
test of any fact except the fact of how you feel. Maybe that's all that
matters in this peculiar instance, as you suggest. I just hope that when
the 98% of you crazed Xoxes come after me with your disintegrator guns, you
really will agree to the live&let live principle and put them down (rather

We have an empirical test of this theory, up to a point. The world is
choked with people sharing variants of the delusion that their identity
persists beyond `death of the body': that they have, or are, a `soul' which
instantiates all that is worthy of their subjectivity or `life force', or
something nice. Do they call out `Bring on the disintegrator, homes, it's
all one to me. See you on the Other Side, bro!'? Some do, it's true. Most
seem to shiver and shake with dread, unless death for them is a blessed
relief from unendurable suffering. They cry out to god for an extra minute
of life. Is it just that they fear the unknown, or hell, or a billion years
manning a Pumping Station for Xenu? That's part of it. But I reckon that
they have grave (ahem) suspicions about identity continuity.

Some will answer that this is because they don't actually *know* there's an
`afterlife', whereas Xoxes will see the proof every day; moreover, the
Xoxen will return to the same world (unless they teleport to Alpha Grommett
and live among the robots), so they know what to expect. (More of the
bloody same, eh.)

And so it goes on...

I have no problem with that. I sometimes do the same. Also I hope people
don't take offense when I do not quote and respond to every paragraph.
When both parties do so it tends to result in long messy messages
involving multiple simultaneous disagreements, some of which should
logically be resolved before others.

Good! This is exactly my position also. Currently I am puzzling over the
last part... why do people seem so loathe to acknowledge the influence
of DNA on personality? The evidence is clear that genes influence
personality -- I've already posted three research abstracts to support
my case -- so why are people in such denial? I suspect also that I would
not see so much resistance from non-extropians. I posted a separate
message to point this out. I hope you will reply to it.

Of course, but think a bit why that is true... it is true largely
because those nutrients are substrates in the chemical reactions
initiated by and controlled by genes. The amino acids tyrosine and
phenylalanine, for example, are substrates in the synthesis of dopamine
and norepinephrine, two neurotransmitters that have very important
effects on personality. Similarly, the amino acid tryptophan is a
precurser in the synthesis of serotonin. Amino acid therapy can be very
effective in the treatment of personality disorders.

Did you see the research I posted last night in which seasonal affective
disorder was found to be associated with a specific polymorphism of a
gene that codes for a receptor of serotonin? This really shouldn't be
such a hard sell. :)

You're misunderstanding my position here if you think the words above
conflict with it. I don't propose any need for the physical molecule
called testosterone or for the physical molecules that comprise our
genetic material. I propose only a need for the codification of their
functions. I define genes (and hormones) by function rather than form.
I'm pretty sure you see it the same way based on your next paragraph:

Right, as above.

Okay, I see where you're going and that's fine. I don't object,
especially in light of the long-lived nature of neurons. However I think
you are missing a much more important argument along the same lines:
brain plasticity. The brain is very plastic in nature, meaning that the
connections between neurons change constantly. That I think is a far
better example of "cell memory" than are changes in membrane fluidity.
It seems intuitively obvious that our personalities would be affected by
these plastic changes in brain circuitry. However, once again, this
aspect of who we are cannot be separated from the genes that code for
the synthesis of the proteins neeeded to construct and modify the
dendrites involved in these cellular changes.

That's also true, but as I said I am not arguing against the existence
of non-genetic influences on our personality. I am arguing against the
absurd proposition that our personalities exist independent of our
genes.

> I would be more comfortable with the claim that "the

personalities".

That's my position exactly.

I sympathize with the poster who wrote words to the effect that any
so-called emulations of us are not truly identified as us if they are
not experiencing the same internal and external stimuli as us. 

If I'm sitting here drinking coffee and writing to the extropian list,
while my so-called emulation is watching Oprah, then that so-called
emulation of me is not actually a true emulation of  me. It's one thing
to look like a duck and quack like a duck; it's quite another thing to
cognize like one.

I don't manufacture it out of thin air.  Well, I guess in a way they are 
only ideas gleaned from others who post their evidence and concepts on 
the Internet.  It's not just ones and zeros, at some point it is ones 
and zeros on magnetic tape.  Thanks, I think that's a compliment.

So, I was suspicious and research reveals many other suspicious folks.

Many more people are cynical, and express their sentiment about the WTC 
attacks sarcastically.  I wonder if there's a new "Get Your War On".  
http://www.mnftiu.cc/mnftiu.cc/war15.html  I don't remember anybody yet 
apologizing for 9/11.  Cancel that backup call, we've lost her.

Anyways there are a bunch of people who believe this stuff.

Why was FEMA activated on New York on the tenth?  Why did Florida 
declare a state of terrorist emergency days prior to the attacks?

(Why did Noelle Bush cross the road?  To take the crack rock out of her 
shoe.)

What are other big lies?

Yeah, we're not our DNA.  Our bodies are largely the result of our DNA 
and our activities in our environment.  Our thoughts are somewhat the 
result of our brains and our activities in our environments.  The 
environment is full of other people.  Being around other people is very 
affective on our thinking and being.  For example, if a bunch of women 
live and work together, their menstrual cycles synchronize, based on 
pheromones, distributed hormones.  Using technology we affect each other 
from beyond shouting distance.

Google says sysopmind.com says Crocker's rules  "means that other people 
are allowed to optimize their messages for information, not for being 
nice", and "people don't need to worry about being tactful".  Ad 
hominem, personal, attacks, don't convey much information.  They convey 
the opinion of the name-caller of the name-callee.  That's only relevant 
when the discussion is about the name-callee.

If we had transparency, then, well, what if we do?

Anyways, about DNA, I hear there is a nascent science of gene therapy 
which can actually change what your momma gave you.  It would be a 
pretty heavy deal, to replace a person's gene sequence in every cell 
with a very slightly modified copy of their own gene to repair a genetic 
illness.

Lee, I didn't read much of the thread here a few weeks back that seemed
to have as its subject your online manners, so I'm probably re-hashing
old ground here, but what if "diplomacy" and "dancing-around-the-issue
talk" is like waiting your turn in line -- just something that is
sometimes annoying, but necessary as "social lubricant" to keep things
more efficient and livable on an over-all basis?  I myself am
notoriously impatient (just ask my wife), but most of the time I'm able
to contain my irritation with people ahead of me in line who fumble with
their check book, chat too long with the cashier or otherwise SLOW ME
DOWN!  Maybe I'd get out of the store more quickly on some occasions if
I muttered audibly, "move it along, blockhead!", but in the long run,
I'd probably get less of what I want, even if I didn't care that
everyone within earshot would think I was a jerk.

The Next Great Threat to Oppression and Inequality

Transhumanism doesn't threaten human dignity, as Wesley J. Smith argues in 
National Review Online, but is the logical next step for civil liberties

George Dvorsky
Betterhumans Staff

[Wednesday, October 09, 2002] "Misanthropic" was one accusation. Then there 
was "science uber alles mentality" and "advance the march toward Brave New 
World."

These are just a few of the ways Wesley J. Smith described the burgeoning 
Transhumanist movement in his September 20, 2002 National Review Online 
editorial "The Transhumanists: The Next Great Threat to Human Dignity."

And so continues the war against civil liberties, the firing shots coming 
this time from the ambiguous right (Smith has worked with and is a friend of 
Ralph Nader). In his editorial, Smith paints a picture of Transhumanism as a 
dystopic ideology that is attempting to convert humanity into a kind of 
grotesque chimera. While at the bottom of most Transhumanist to-do lists, 
transgenics remains an interesting possibility in the quest to improve the 
quality and potential of human life; but creating monsters is hardly on the 
agenda.

This, however, is the tact that Smith chooses to use in his failed attempt 
to discredit Transhumanism. He resorts to exaggeration, misrepresentation 
and wild speculations. He uses slippery slope arguments and a language 
intended to invoke squeamishness and Huxleyesque imagery. His editorial 
becomes murkier and murkier, culminating in his introduction of animal 
rights into the picture, at which point he declares the whole lot of 
Transhumanists, animal rights activists and bioethicists as anti-people.

Yet, it is exactly because of this tact that it becomes hard to take Smith 
seriously. Anyone who would take time to learn about Transhumanism would see 
it not as a great threat to human dignity but as a movement concerned with 
increasing human freedom and happiness. Smith, however, has taken a 
reactionary position. And in doing so he has allied himself with historical 
roadblocks to liberty and equality.

Next step in civil liberties

If Transhumanism is the "next great threat to human dignity," what have been 
the previous threats?

Considering that Transhumanism is essentially a progressive libertarian 
bioethic, one must consider the past one hundred years of 
biologically-oriented social reforms. Civil libertarians fought against the 
ownership of women and were successful in introducing women's suffrage. They 
fought for the acceptance of divorce laws. They helped to abolish racial 
segregation and worked to establish the acceptance of inter-racial 
marriages. They struggled for gay rights and are close to seeing the 
establishment of legal same-sex marriages. They advocated the use of birth 
control, and continue the movement that keeps abortion legal. They helped to 
eliminate alcohol prohibition, and are now working to see that soft drugs 
like marijuana are decriminalized.

Today, arguing for the right to control our own bodies, some civil 
libertarians have joined with the advocates of scientific freedom to combat 
irrational hysteria surrounding in vitro fertilization, and continue to 
support research into stem cells, therapeutic cloning and genomic and 
germ-line therapies. Others are working to extend the protection of rights 
to animals.

So, these have been the previous threats to human dignity? Enlightened and 
progressive approaches to civil rights and freedoms?

Achieving greater human equality

Smith had the effrontery to suggest that Transhumanism is a threat to the 
current state of "universal human equality." That such a thing as universal 
human equality exists today is news to me. Variations in physical and 
cognitive abilities permeate the human condition. But this is hardly the 
issue; what guarantees human equality are normative and democratic judicial 
and social systems.

Smith's declaration of human equality reveals a greater complacency to 
broader social and medical issues, and should frustrate anyone striving to 
see a reduction in poverty, disease, disabilities, malnutrition and 
suppressive governments around the globe. Transhumanists are actively and 
energetically assessing the potential for future technologies and innovative 
social systems to determine how they could be utilised to improve the 
quality of all life. According to James Hughes, Secretary of the World 
Transhumanist Association, "Transhumanism is (or at least can be) a way to 
make the material reality of the human condition fulfill the promise of 
legal and political equality, by eliminating congenital mental and physical 
barriers to equality."

Another argument posed by Smith is that Transhumanism is explicitly eugenic. 
Once again, Smith resorts to rhetorical scare mongering by using a socially 
taboo word, the intimation being that Transhumanists are promoting 
state-managed birth control. Eliezer Yudkowsky, a member of the Board of 
Directors of the World Transhumanist Association, stated recently that 
Transhumanists "advocate the right of individuals to define themselves 
physically and psychologically using new technologies." Additionally, says 
Yudkowsky, the WTA is "opposed to groups attempting to forcibly impose a 
single physical and psychological definition upon the rest of the world, 
including groups seeking to outlaw consensual self-transformation, and 
groups espousing exclusionary, racist and hate-based views such as 
eugenics."

One could alternatively read into Smith's argument an opposition to parental 
control over the genetic makeup of their offspring. If this is the case, 
Smith would seem to be advocating a kind of authoritarian Brave New World of 
his own. Most Transhumanists believe that parents have the right to not only 
have a child, but to determine its characteristics and not leave it to the 
genetic roll of the dice. As Hughes has stated, "Transhumanists are for 
genetic improvement of the population as the result of individual choices."

Extending human rights

Animal rights activists would be interested to know that they, along with 
Transhumanists and other progressive bioethicists, have been assessed by 
Smith as misanthropic. Smith's speciest and anthropocentric attitudes barely 
warrant refutation; that sentient animals are deserving of greater respect 
and rights is self-evident.

Moreover, the scientific evidence to back these claims is becoming stronger 
with each passing year. Non-human animals are more conscious and emotional 
than previously assumed. Smith's sense of morality would seem to apply to 
organisms with human DNA only, a stance that I find quite irresponsible, 
incompassionate and bigoted. And yet despite this, we are supposed to take 
his specific brand of ethics seriously.

In total, Smith's editorial seems like a manifesto in favour of the status 
quo and against increased freedom. It also demonstrates how the struggle to 
guarantee and expand the rights that individuals have over their bodies 
faces continued opposition.

The 21st century will be characterized by this dispute. Transhumanists have 
firmly established themselves as the promoters of progressive bioethical 
legislation in the tradition of civil libertarianism. If Smith's article is 
any indication, however, that position will not be represented, and 
refutations of Transhumanism will instead be characterized by 
misinformation, hysteria and ignorance. If I'll be permitted my own literary 
analogies, that's more of an Orwellian future than a Brave New World. And 
it's one I don't want to live in.

But the duplicated personality will be essentially the same as you, up 
to the last few minutes.  And guess what?  When you go under a general 
anesthetic you loose around the last 15-20 minutes from your memories 
anyway.  So the differences will all be in what has occurred during the 
period since the split.  This is about the same as a process forking 
(except that the forked process doesn't necessarily take all of the 
memories with it, which is assumed here, and a forked process doesn't 
necessarily execute the same code, which is assumed here).  To make a 
simple process fork, you take a snapshot of ram, copy it to a new area, 
and then start it running independant of the original process.  This can 
get messy, so most operating systems cause child processes to have 
parents, and when the parent terminates, then so do all of it's 
children, but this is a control issue, not an inherrent feature.

To the extent that you are a program running within wetware, that 
program would be identical if it were translated into a mode suitable 
for alternate hardware, and executed there... if the translation were 
good enough.  That's the real sticking point.  Even translating a 
program from Fortran to C is tricky.  Now try translating a program from 
Python to Ada95.  Tricky!  The basic assumptions of the languages are 
different.  Ada is a basically static language.  It's Object oriented, 
but it's idea of a Object is quite different from the idea that Python 
has.  Different things are easy.  Different things are hard.  And that's 
just with two languages running on the same hardware.  Wetware is a 
highly parallel system that appears to operate basically via a 
dynamically variable neural-net based pattern-recognition system. 
 (Logic is strictly an afterthought.)  Even clustered hardware, however, 
is basically a linear stream of computation (with thread switching, for 
various weights of thread), and logic is at the core of the system, with 
pattern recognition an afterthought, that still hasn't been very well 
thought out.  Translation is going to be quite difficult.  There are 
thought experiments that are "proof of principle" kinds of things, but 
we pretty surely won't be doing it in any way that has been widely 
discussed so far.

Right, he'll be essentially the same as me but only for a short time.
The longer the period since the time of the split, the greater the
difference between us will be. In my example above, my emulation's
personality will expand in new and exciting ways as a result of Oprah's
insight and wisdom, while mine will atrophy here in the swamp of
fantastic extropian considerations. Before long we will be entirely
different people, even if we will look like identical twins.

In fact the study of identical twins can give us some insight here.
Identical twins raised in different families have some personality
traits in common, due to genetic influences on personality, but they are
also very much different people as a result of the different
environments in which their personalities developed. And of course this
is true even for identical twins raised in the same family.

Hi everyone,

Here are some trends that I've been noticing that have
on the whole turned my head upside down from the
direction I perceived things to be going.  More and
more I've begun to suspect that I have led an isolated
idealistic life and somehow imagined that liberty and
freedom, on the whole, were increasing around the
world, but instead the opposite has been happening,
even before 9-11.

I think one of the primary reasons is that there is
not new frontiers to explore and live in.  As the free
space and wildness of the west got tamed in the last
30 years, peoples hopes looked skyward towards L5 and
beyond.  But now, here we sit after 2001, still
grounded.  Will nanotubes and sophisticated
sustainable space living technologies arrive in any
remotely timely manner?

In the meantime, all of us grounded to this planet are
continuing to get encroached by increasing regulation
of all aspects of our lives both in physical and
digital space.  I see no trends in the opposite
direction.  I think it can be safely concluded that
there has been a substantial reduction in overall
liberty in the last 30 years - from political
correctness on the left to conservative
&#34;family&#34; values on the right, and mostly from
a &#34;public safety&#34; standpoint.  More people,
less resource = more regulation.  A classic result of
a diminishing frontier.

And here is another surprise from Europe:  If present
demographic trends continue, Europe will become
muslim.  Recently at an Ecunumerical conference in
England, the head of the Anglican Church called for
assistance in assimilating Muslims into the
communities.  The leaders of the Muslim church said
that Muslim's *do not* assimilate, and they they will
in fact assimilate Europe, and that the majority of
Europe will be subject to conservative muslim law!

So unless we escape into the space frontier, the world
will continue to become more repressive, not to
mention the increases in one-way surveillance, digital
lock-downs (DRM), biometrics, massive dataveillance
and GPS tracking (i.e. chip implants), and Minority
Report style societies.

Unless New Frontiers are opened - the end result will
be the world becoming a giant hyper-controlled
microprocessor, with ever minutia of our lives being
regulated in the name of public safety and
conservative (muslim and Christian values).

Anyone care to counter any of this?

~Sam

Are we talking about Damien here?  Presumably one of his fundamental
objections is that even if the emulations start out in the same state
he is in, they rapidly diverge (so they are no longer Damien though
they might fool the extropian list for a couple of years).  There seems
to be an overemphasis on the dismantlement aspect of creating xoxes.
Presumably if you have to disassemble the original to create the xox
(we are talking atomic level scanning technology here) then it seems
likely that one also has the ability to reassemble the original atoms
back into their original structure (subject to some degree of error
which may or may not exceed that involved in normal biological processes
(which are quite error prone -- at least at the protein level).
So there seems to be a fundamental concern that xoxing is a destructive
readout process when that seems unlikely to be the case.  Unless Damien
wants to argue that if I take all of his atoms apart and put them back
together the same way I don't get back Damien.... :-?

I would tend to think you-xoxs that watch Oprah could be perfect
replicas of you if you have the perspective that you need to follow
multiple input streams to be "trans-human".  I'd love to have part
of me watching Oprah *if* it didn't detract from the work the rest
of me(s) wanted to get done.  The trick is to be able to extract
that experience in a productive way.  So xoxing is only useful if
it is coupled with experience vampirism.  Of course this bumps into
free will and conscious mind independence constraints -- so xoxes
must sign "blood" donation contracts.  (Obviously if you have "decided" this
is fine at the moment of xoxing, then this is an implicit assumption.)

I think a key point may be the phrase "so-called emulation".
Either you believe its a perfect replica or you don't.  You need
to show your hand.  If its not a "perfect" replica than the cognizing
question goes away.   If it is a "perfect" replica then it becomes
an interesting question as to what collection of experiences would
so "disturb" it from its central being that it could no longer be
considered to be *you*.  I can go on vacation to Pakistan or
go on vacation to Costa Rica (two very different places) but
I would argue that I *still* come back "Robert Bradbury".
So experiential differences do not always *fundamentally* change
the identity of the person.  So we can likely have half-a-dozen
Damiens or gts's which can effectively substitute for each
other when viewed from a non-subjective perspective.  (This
is taking a page from Emlyn's book in that if you think you
are yourself -- then you are yourself.)

So long as I can't cognize like a *specific* instantiation of
an individual duck then its pretty darn difficult to notice
that they are missing.

Would anyone be posting notes missing me, as we did with Sasha,
if a Robert-xox or even a Robert-[AI]-bot continued to post
notes to the list?  Moreover how would the list detect that
the Robert-function was being fulfilled by one or more
combinations of Robert-xoxs and/or Robert-[AI]-bots?

Actually, that thread was about Lee Corbin; my online manners haven't
risen to the level of their own thread until yesterday.  But anyway I do
understand the value of even those kinds of "politeness" that get in the
way of clear expression, but as I said I'm stil not very good at it.

I look at it this way: the human comminunication network is not very
different from an electronic communication network, and protocols serve
the same purposes.  The overriding principle in creating protocols is
this: be conservative in what you produce, and liberal in what you
accept.  That's the way to write software that keeps the network flowing
smoothly.  But notice that there is a distinct assymmetry there: the
more conservative the senders, the fewer kinds of messages can be sent
over the protocol; the more liberal the receivers, the /more/ kinds of
messages it can handle.  So while I may agree that politeness can be a
good thing, it is important to note that (1) it is not an end in itself,
only a /means/ to the end of better communication, and communication
should be favored when the two conflict; and (2) it is /more/ important
to emphasize the politeness and tolerance of /listeners/ than speakers.

Maybe the following broad strategy suggestions
could lead to worthwhile action:

1. Identify the major "entropic forces" on
Earth (candidates: coercive political systems,
religions, fiat money systems, coercive tax
systems, coercively controlled health systems,
etc.).

2. Identify "frontiers" in terms of which
extropic individuals, "escape from," transcend,
and withdraw support from "entropic forces"
(example: use free-market, gold-based digital
currencies such as e-gold
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/e-gold.htm> in
as many of your transactions as possible).

3. I believe that all kinds of non-geographic
extropic "frontiers" are available to extropians
right now. Maybe extropian pioneers can be found
to form a vanguard to lead other extropians away
from "entropic forces" toward "Extropy on Earth!"

There's a competitive product out that I played with (OSX version) last 
month called EarthBrowser.

http://www.earthbrowser.com

Weather, recent earthquakes, active volcanos... and my favorite feature 
is the City-view webcams from around the globe.

Not as high-end as EarthViewer, but there are less usage restrictions.

No, I was referring to a post by John Clark, who wrote "The problem is
that the emulations are no longer identical in fact they are no longer
even very close. One is undergoing a traumatic experience knowing his
head is about to be blown off and the other is not."

I believe that is the correct view. There can be no such thing as a
perfect emulation, because at the moment an emulation begins to occupy
its own space, it becomes subject to a different environment and thus
begins to develop a separate personality. It becomes a new identity
rather than a copy of my identity.

I believe I did show my hand, when I wrote that the so-called emulation
of me watching Oprah is not actually a true emulation of me.

I don't think so. Olga, since publishing my essay "Democratic transhumanism"
<http://www.changesurfer.com/Acad/DemocraticTranshumanism.htm>  I've found
quite few socialist transhumanists around the world. There are lots of kinds
of transhumanists that aren't well represented on the Extrop list. You may
enjoy the discussions on wta-talk http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wta-talk/
where we have been discussing these issues with a good deal of civility,

My life seems progressively freer.  I think if you look at the large trends
freedom increases.  If we define freedom as the ability to do more of the
things we want, then freedom increases in some areas and decreases
in others.  We gain freedom from the elements, from concern over getting
food, feedom from diseases, freedom to watch movies, etc.  We live longer
and better I think.  I expect this trend to continue but it is a bumpy road,
with uncertain turns and a need to pay attention.

I think the more people you get in an area the trend is towards more
controls
but there is also the ability to interact with more people, have access to
more
activities, etc.  Also, although I think the trend is towards greeter
freedom
overall there is enough variation that in a given time and place freedoms
may
be greatly curtailed.  As an individual it is good to be aware, move around
and
sometimes just lay low and wait it out.

Think about the competitive effect of limiting freedom in a population.
Consider
the pros and cons of religious beliefs on their own survival.  Most things
mellow
over time and those that do not tend to be self destructive.  So what I
worry about
is the wobble in the system, if civilization goes below zero it can't bounce
back.
I currently see that as unlikely.  I don't think any group or set of groups
could wipe out
civilization but someday maybe.  I would say you may (but probably will not)
go through
some sort of dark age but if you live through it, there will probably be an
even better age
on the other side.

I'm not to worried about severe limits on technology because I think it
would take
to much technology to do that.  A technological elite that regulates access
for
a while is possible but unstable (and better to be one of the elite if such
a group
must exist).  I could be a Muslim or a Christian or a Communist, etc. if I
had to be
and still live an okay life I think.  I doubt they would outlaw all my
pleasures.  There
is danger if you become part of an oppressed group but a "good nigger"
usually gets
by, etc.  Much better to see it coming and move elsewhere.

Anyway, what I worry about is aging.  I know it will be solved in time
(assuming
life is not wiped out on the planet) but that is small comfort to me at 40
and to my
 60 year old friends.  First things first.  I could be a Muslim and be happy
I can't
be happy if I die.

I don't have time to think this all through clearly right now but I hope it
gives you
some food for thought.  Your concerns are valid but I think a bit
exaggerated.  Real
problems but probably not the end of the world or the end of your freedoms
if you
play it smart.

Could it be that we don't think about thinking? That the mind's eye uses
some other method to deal with what we call thinking?

Even before the removal of the barriers, working in other EU nations was 
quite common.  It is of course more common now, but it was never a big deal 
really.  My Father worked in Holland when he was quite young, long before 
the single market, and many British men travelled to Europe in the 1980's 
to find work.  The vast majority of them returned home.

Someone moving from here to Germany would not say that they are 
"emigrating".  In fact, unless they're moving to the U.S., the word doesn't 
get used very much here these days.  What I think would be a more desirable 
development would be an expansion of the Schengen area, within which one 
doesn't need a passport to travel country to country.

The mass labour movements predicted from poor countries to rich didn't 
materialize.  The increased prosperity Europe-wide, and the general 
resistance of most people to up and leave, scuppered any exodus 
scenarios.  I believe large scale movement did occur from East to West 
Germany during the early years of reunification, but this was a unique 
situation given that East Germany didn't have to go through a period of 
meeting membership requirements.

Incidently, the current batch of 10 candidates for membership are in much 
better shape economically (and probably socially) than Ireland was when it 
joined in '72.  Some are even capable of becoming net contributors straight 
off.  Eastern Europeans coming to Ireland make up a much smaller percentage 
than those coming from African nations as refugees and asylum 
seekers.  Politics rather than Economics seems to be the bigger contributor 
to mass movement.

The key question is whether *you* would detect the difference.
I, like John Clark, claim that you might have been replaced
by an identical copy while you slept last night, and *no* one
---not you, not the you of yesterday, not the list members,
no one---is any the worse for it.

It has been said that there is no reality as to whether you
are the same person after xoxing or not.  But can we not
perceive some falseness to the claim of someone close to
you that he or she is not the same person as they were
yesterday?  Especially when they have not a shred of 
evidence beyond a suspicion that they were copied?

Moreover, I have a question for Damien and the other reluctant
teleporters.  Suppose that a disintegrator ray could be trained
upon you, and reduce you to an exact set of atoms in a plastic
bag, while recording the precise location and momenta of all
those atoms at the moment of disintegration.  Then when the
re-integrate button is pressed, all the atoms fly to their
exact previous locations.  (It is further stipulated that in
no case of millions of trials has any anomaly been detected,
and people and every other quantum object, to the limits of
our ability to measure, are completely unchanged by this
operation.)

Would you agree to go through this process if it meant
a *much* cheaper and safer trip to Texas?  The plastic
bag is placed into a steel box the whole trip, and goes
in the baggage compartment, and it will survive intact
any kind of normal airplane crash.  So you'll not only
be re-integrated in Dallas, but will have avoided 
the tedium and most of the cost of the trip, and
can even time it so that there's no jet lag!  What
a deal!

Absolutely.  I would prefer people even to omit the "<snip>",
whose logical justification is suspect.  It would make sense
*only* if, contrary to what you and I have just said, someone
were to reply to *everything* in a previous post.

I do not object to reordering what the original poster
said, if one is 84.134 percent or more certain that the
meaning is not changed.

Quite pleased with the manner in which most people quote
and reply, by the way, I am.  Only occasionally does 
someone quote an *entire* message for just a one-line
zing or something, or fail to say whose message it is
that's being responded to.

Tomorrow is the last time that the Michael Miller
Crusade will be playing their regular 2nd Friday gig
at the Costa Mesa Gypsy Den at the LAB/AntiMall on S.
Bristol just North of the 55 Fwy.  I will probably be
there around 10PM in case anyone feels like hanging
out.  A good place to bring a book to read or for
conversation.  Gypsy Den is ending their Friday music
events.

You are confusing two quite distinct phenomena.  There
is the common reluctance (in the SSSM (Standard Social
Sciences Model)) to acknowledge hereditarian or genetic
influence, see

http://www.goldmark.org/jeff/papers/ridley/html/node1.html

or, from what I've heard, Pinker's new book.

Sometimes in Bell Curve type discussions, people disagree
about the extent to which genes affect behavior.  But all
this is on the one hand.

What is pertinent to THIS THREAD is something completely
different!  Several of us deny your claim that the DNA
is the *only* repository within a human being of the
data important to making up him or her.  (If this is not
your claim, please correct me.)

Several of us persist in believing the blueprint/building
analogy, although a modified analogy wherein the workmen
merely find it easier to consult the blueprints for any
structural changes (rather than scope out the whole building).

to which you admit that you don't know the answer, may

The other day, one of our temps was punching in at the
time clock where I work.  The time clock is situated
on this very low little cabinet, so that most of us
really have to struggle to insert the card precisely. 
This lady simply crouched down, which had the perhaps
unforseen consequence of revealing quite a bit more of
her derrier than I suspect she anticipated, a hazard
of the new, "how-low-can-you-go" fashion in pants.

Later, at the Gypsy Den, I observed a couple more
females wearing these new one-legged pants - you know,
the ones that have one big pant leg that wraps around
both legs, right?  (It's hard to explain, but then
that's fashion...)  Anyway, they obviously were
afflicted with the same potential problem, doubly so
in that the one-legged pants are all open between the
thighs of course and these were just barely long enuf
at the bottom end as well.

I suddenly had this vision of a solution, however. 
Suddenly I saw these two young women with TAILs! 
Imagine now a nice bushy dark tail sprouting up and
concealing inadvertent topological inadequacies.  Or,
if you're blond for the day, then there's further
chances for the taile shoppes to cash in on satisfying
a clear fashion need.  I mean, if bustles could make
it, then surely a cute little tail is a shoe in.  So
to speak.

I then did a test survey involving a random sample of
available ladies, and both of them thought it was a
GREAT fashion idea.

So, how to get the message to the right fashion gurus?
Well, the obvious answer is a website - Tails.com? 
A_Piece_of.com?  tailersRUs?  

I was thinking that rather than try to promote this as
a new fashion, it might work better to pretend that it
was already a HUGE HIT!  Like, a gangbanger tail site,
where the 69th St. gangbanger fems dis the 67th St.
bitches about their ugly-a..ed, wrong color tails,
with pictures doctored to show tails in place, wrapped
invitingly around crossed, fishnetted thighs as the
fems lean against the corner lamppost, smokes dangling
from pendulous sneering lips.  Or, a news site
covering a fur protest in Times Square - only
synthetic tails allowed!  With the other side pushing
only "natural" tails.

Anyway, it sounds to me like a great project for
anyone who wants to test memetic marketing theories. 
Or cash in on tail fur options.  And certainly a huge
improvement over seeing those big blank areas of
unsightly puffy skin, surely the ugliest single patch
of a woman's anatomy.

Damn -- Lee, I apologize.  Someone mistook me for Greg Bear one time --

It would make no difference whatsoever if it were hours rather than
minutes or seconds. 

Your future personality as "you" is dependent on the expressions of your
genes in response to future environments. I mentioned the simple case of
exogenous depression as an example. How would Lee Corbin respond today
to the loss of something dear to him, like his partner, mother, father,
sibling or goldfish? We don't know the answer to that question, but we
do know your response to that event will be influenced by the manner in
which your genes are coded to handle such events. This means that if we
upload you today, without your genetic information, then your response
to the event after uploading will be different from the response to the
same event had we not uploaded, i.e., you will not be the same
personality if we upload you without your genetic information.

This reminds me of the reports by the victims of Capgras mental disorder
who say with a highly disturbed and terrified face that they came home from
work one day and noticed that their loved ones had been stolen and replaced
by exact replicas.

This reminds me of the joke by the comedian Steven Wright, who said with
a straight face that he came home from work one day and noticed that all
of his furniture had been stolen and replaced by exact replicas. 

It occurs to me that the problems and paradoxes in this thread would go
away if we discussed them in E-Prime. In E-Prime we find no need to
puzzle about the identities of our emulations. We can say only that they
look like us and act like us.

I'm glad to see we can agree about something. :) 

I'm certain however that some folks feel they are not being listened to

### No, it won't. All you need to upload is the pattern of neural
connections, synaptic strengths, and rules of modification of these elements
in response to stimuli. Unless you are talking about stimuli directly acting
on genes (e.g. genotoxic poisons), you don't need the gene sequence anywhere
in the system (I understand you mean the DNA sequence by "genetic
information"). Anything that doesn't directly chemically or physically
depend on interaction with the DNA (=everything that matters), can and will
be emulated by information structures replicating proteins, membranes, ion
channels, gradients of ion concentrations, electrical currents, etc. No
genes needed.

If by "rules of modification of these elements" you are including the
rules that are embodied in our genetic instructions that pertain to the
brain and personality, then we are in agreement. 

There may be other rules outside our genetic material that control these
and other neural elements, and if so then I don't object to any claim
that they too are critical to the preservation of the personality. Also
do not argue for the need for *all* genetic instructions. As I wrote
once in the past, we can certainly dispense with those that encode for
such things as wound healing.

> Unless you are talking about stimuli directly acting
> on genes (e.g. genotoxic poisons),

No, that's not what I mean. 

I mean that it's clear that the brain is affected physically by external
events in one's environment and that those effects are *in part* a
function of one's genes. Seasonal affective disorder is another
excellent example. Those with a specific polymorphism of a certain
serotonin receptor gene are likely to become depressed in the winter.
There is therefore *something* in the instructions coded in that gene
that has a direct bearing on personality. If we upload a person who has
this gene in the summer, then we must include a codification of the
instructions from that gene if we want him to react as he normally would
to the next winter.

Are we starting to get closer to agreement on this, Rafal? Your
recognition of the need for the "rules of modification of these [neural]
elements" leads me to believe that we are.

I should have addressed the above in my last message. In the example of
seasonal affective disorder from my last message, the structures in the
neurons will be different in the summer than in the winter. This is to
say that the types and amounts and qualities of the replicating
proteins, and/or membranes, and/or ion channels, and/or gradients, etc,
will be different in summer than in the winter. The most likely
differences, which you did not include above, will be differences in the
quantities or locations or sensitivities of the 5HT2A serotonin
receptor, as it is this receptor that is coded by the gene that was
found to be highly correlated with seasonal affective disorder. Also due
to feedback, differences in the activities of receptors correlate to
differences in the quantity of their associated neurotransmitters (in
this case serotonin) present and active in the synapses at any given
time. The quantities and activities of serotonin will thus also be
different in the summer than in the winter.

We cannot take a snapshot of the relevant neurons sans their DNA in the
summer and expect that snapshot to contain all the exact structures
mentioned above and expect neuron to act true to personality in the
winter. We must take a snapshot of the relevant genetic material also,
or in some way encode their instructions, because those genetic
instructions contain the rules for their expression in the winter, rules
which will change those neural structures in the winter.

 It's clear to me that Robin intended his deceive.pdf paper as an
explanation for a wide variety of persistent disagreements, including
many political ones. The paper starts with the claim that "Disagreement
is an obvious feature of intellectual and political life." Your response
seems to be strong evidence that you haven't given much thought to the
arguments in that paper, so I will feel fairly safe in attaching little
weight to your beliefs on this subject.

 I'm thinking of the arguments in Robin's paper that rational Bayesians

 Ok, I'll assume you were trying to explain something I consider uninteresting,
such as why people don't value meta-debates.

Rafal and Robert...

Here are some additional research abstracts that should be of interest
here and which support my case. 

The first abstract supports my point to Rafal that non-DNA neural
parameters change in response to the environment, implying that a record
of today's non-genetic neuronal structures is insufficient for
preserving the personality into the future.

The first abstract shows us that in seasonal affective disorder (SAD),
BMax for the serotonin receptor ligands paroxetine (Paxil) and LSD (Yes,
Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds) decreased in response to light therapy,
indicating a structural change in the serotonergic system in response to
increased light. The serotonergic system is comprised of serotonin and
its receptors and transporters, the synthesis of each of which is under
control of the DNA in the nucleus of serotonergic neurons. In SAD, the
genes that code for these structural elements express differently
according to the season. It is for this reason that a person with SAD
must encode and upload those genetic instructions if he wishes to
preserve the manner in which his personality responds to changes of the
seasons (of course may chose not to do so, but doing so would defeat our
purpose here of preserving the personality).

The second article also refers to evidence of seasonal changes in the
serotonergic system in SAD.

ABSTRACT:
Platelet [3H]paroxetine and [3H]lysergic acid diethylamide binding in
seasonal affective disorder and the effect of bright light therapy. 

Biol Psychiatry 1999 Feb 15;45(4):464-70    (ISSN: 0006-3223)

Department of Psychiatry, Umea Universitet, Sweden.  \/

BACKGROUND: Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) has been regarded as a
melatonin disorder, but the pathophysiological mechanisms of SAD are to
a large extent unclarified. Serotonergic mechanisms have also been
studied, but they have shown inconsistent results. METHODS: We have
compared [3H]paroxetine and [3H]lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) binding
in platelets from 23 SAD patients and 23 controls. Then SAD patients had
4 weeks of light therapy. On the last treatment day new blood samples
were drawn. Symptoms before and after light treatment were measured by
SIGH-SAD. RESULTS: Bmax for paroxetine binding before light treatment
was higher in SAD patients compared to controls and also higher in
responders than in nonresponders. Bmax decreased significantly during
light treatment. We also found a negative correlation between the two
Bmax values before but not after light treatment. There was a negative
correlation between Bmax for paroxetine binding before treatment and
clinical status after treatment. Patients with reduced Bmax for LSD
binding after treatment had a better clinical treatment response.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicates that serotonin receptor
parameters might be suitable in the prediction of clinical response to
light treatment. 

ABSTRACT:
Monoaminergic function in the pathogenesis of seasonal affective
disorder. 

Int J Neuropsychopharmacol 2001 Dec;4(4):409-20    (ISSN: 1461-1457)

Seasonal affective disorder/winter type (SAD) is characterized by
recurrent depressive episodes during autumn and winter alternating with
non-depressive episodes during spring and summer. Light therapy with
full-spectrum, bright white light has been shown to be effective for
this condition. Several hypotheses have been discussed in the literature
about the pathogenesis of SAD. The most prominent includes disturbances
in central monoaminergic transmission. Evidence can be inferred from
studies showing a seasonal rhythm of central and peripheral serotonergic
functioning which may be a predisposing factor for SAD. Some of the
symptoms of SAD are believed to represent an attempt to overcome a
putative deficit in brain serotonergic transmission. Moreover, 5-HT
receptor challenge studies suggest altered activity at or downstream to
central 5-HT receptors. Monoamine depletion studies support hypotheses
about serotonergic and catecholaminergic dysfunctions in SAD and suggest
that light therapy may well compensate for this underlying deficit.
Further, albeit indirect, support for the importance of monoaminergic
mechanisms in SAD and its involvement in the mechanism of the action of
light therapy comes from studies showing antidepressant efficacy of
serotonergic and noradrenergic antidepressants in the treatment of SAD.
Altogether, disturbances in brain monoaminergic transmission seem to
play a key role in the pathogenesis of SAD; monoaminergic systems may
also play an important role in the mechanisms of the action of light
therapy.

Right, and that is I think the key. There is no real emulation. There
only two very similar people with the same name, not unlike identical
twins with the same name.

Robert's experiential vampirism idea is interesting but in that case I
think we are discussing something entirely different. Two similar people
can engage in some kind of permanent Vulcan mind-meld-at-a-distance,
sharing all the same experiences and thoughts, but the result would be a
strange animal with multiple personalities... nothing like the original
person who sought to emulate himself.

Oops. In case anyone here is paying close attention to details, in the
case of paroxetine I meant "transporter" rather than "receptor."

Paroxetine (Paxil) is an SSRI similar to fluoxetine (Prozac). These
molecules occupy serotonin transporters, blocking re-uptake of serotonin
from the synapse.

However I believe LSD does act as an agonist at serotonin receptors.

So, given the brain linkage technology we can expect to be available

As I recall, the trip was Karachi -> Delhi & Agra -> Srinagar (in Kashmir) ->
Amritsar -> Lahore (I'm doing this from an Atlas, not from memory...).
The clever part was that for a couple of days of work I got the plane
fare over and back paid for and got more than a week of tourista time
in on the side.

So I've had the privilege of visiting several very interesting (i.e. ancient
and beautiful) parts of the world that most Extropians would probably
consider poor choices (due to currently high personal risk levels) for
exploration.  I'm hoping they eventually demine Cambodia sufficiently
that I can visit Ankgor Wat.  Manchu Picchu is on my list as well.

I haven't bothered to scan most of the pictures from the Pakistan side
of the trip (most are slides I think) but here's one of the India
side-trips:

SMALL: http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/images/India1-mdm.gif
LARGE: http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/images/India1.gif

There were lots of stories generated from that adventure.
Somebody will have to sit me down at an Extropian conference
and pry them out of me.

So -- If one Damien xox goes to Costa Rica and another Damien
xox goes to Pakistan, while the original is being put back together
in Australia (reassembling all of those atoms accurately takes
time you know) who do you prefer to take to diner at the next
Extro conference?

(Recall, the "original" Damien won't have stories to tell about
either Pakistan or Costa Rica unless he buys them off the xoxes).

Ok, snipping the abstracts and trying to be serious.

"non-DNA neural parameters change in response to the environment"

Granted.  They are required to to produce "memory" as we know it.

"a record of 'today's' non-genetic neuronal structures is insufficent
for preserving personality into the future"

This is a bit unclear to me.  You seem to be suggesting that
the personality (of people who have SAD) is regulated by DNA
and that must be preserved to reproduce the "personality".
But as an individual who may very well be affected by SAD,
I'm well aware of the fact that I may be able to move from
Seattle to Phoenix and trump the genetic program that may be
running my personality (or more accurately "moods").

So one vector of "personality preservation" seems to run
along the lines of "don't change any environmental conditions"
(which is certainly external to the DNA).  Another vector
seems to run along the lines of "don't let any individuals
self-modify".  And we *know* (I hope) that those vectors
should not be universally truncated in a transhumanistic vision.
If I know I'm affected by SAD, presumably dictated by my
genes, shouldn't my personality be able to say "screw that"?!?
And I've got a couple of choices -- either change the environment
dictating the amount of sunlight I'm exposed to or change the
genes that dictate the downstream effects of the lack of
sunlight.

With regard to uploading, outloading, upevolution, etc.:

I think the foundations of this discussion go back to the
question of whether or not the "functions" of DNA can or
cannot be "emulated".  I'd like to have gts agree that they
can be emulated (I think this is my position and Rafals)
or that they cannot be emulated (and if so explain why this
is the case).

Unlikely.  There'll be a nominal Islamic minority, but the entirety of 
Europe is unlikely to change.

You're overreacting.  You do know that the Anglican Church is all but dead, 
and is considered more of a hobby church these days?  Do you really believe 
some Muslim who says his religion will subsume all of Europe?  And how do 
you think we'd get from modern secular laws to Muslim law?  Civil war?  Do 
you really think Europeans would vote in systems like those of the Middle 
East, systems that have parallels with Nazi Germany?  Do you think we're 
fond of the kinds of practices that pass for "law" there?  That we'd tear 
up the European and U.N. Declarations on Human Rights?

It's likely the British will remove the special positions reserved for the 
Bishops in the House of Lords in the next few years.  Many members of the 
Anglican church (including many top ranking members)  publicly support 
Disestablishment, as does a majority of the British public.  30-45% of the 
British public have no professed religious beliefs, and church attendance 
is at its lowest ever and still heading downward.  Their never-used 
blasphemy law will probably be gone before 2010.

The power of the Church has been broken here in Ireland.  We have sex 
shops, escort agencies and topless dancing, things unimaginable 20 years 
ago.  There's barely a priest under 45 yrs old these days, and few new ones 
coming onboard.  Most people don't even listen to the public pronouncements 
of the clergy.  They're a joke (take a look at the TV programme "Father 
Ted"), and most people seem happy enough to be non-practising 
Catholics.  The proximity of the Northern Ireland conflict has ensured 
people here have little time for sectarianism.

Islam is not well liked here.  Do you really think the IRISH would choose a 
religion of alcoholic abstention?

One of the worlds most democratic "Muslim" states will likely become part 
of the EU within this decade.  In order to be considered for  membership, 
they've had to change THEIR laws, end Islamic-style punishments, empower 
women, provide free speech, etc.   If there's such a thing as assimilation, 
then who's assimilating who?  And they're still not done yet.  They'll have 
to accept EU wide human rights declarations and do some serious 
humanitarian cleanup.  If a new wave of Islam was ever to sweep across 
Europe, it'll be so moderate, so diluted as to be a "hobby" religion of 
it's own.  The most tolerant and moderate versions of Islam ever to exist 
occured in Europe.  We've done Islam, and we're unlikely to go back to 
it.  But Europe may in future be the location of an Islamic Renaissance 
that would make it compatible with modern secular society.  Islam will 
adapt to Europe, not vice versa.

Many other European nations are moving further and further from having 
strong religious movements.  In some, non-believers outnumber the believers.

We're not about to embrace religious conservatism anytime soon.

I would first of all consider them three distinct people. You are mistaken
in view  to consider the apparant copies as true xoxes of the original
Damien, because each of them will have now slightly different personalities
as a result of their different experiences.

Given that they are otherwise the same, I would choose to have dinner with
the Damien whose past experiences were of greatest interest to me. Given
current world events I would probably choose to make conversation with the
Damian from Pakistan.

lol. I added you to be sure you would read the abstracts, as I know you have
a personal interest in SAD.

I mean that at least some the non-genetic neuronal structures change *as a
result of changes in gene expression in response to stimuli*.

Because changes in gene expression change at least some non-genetic neuronal
structures in time in response to stimuli, we must include those genetic
instructions in our uploaded personalities so that our neurons can respond
true to our existing personalities to future stimuli that are not present at
the time of the uploading.

Does above thought that register with you? It is my position here in a
nutshell. If my words are not clear that tell me so that I can try
rephrasing them.

That has been my position all along, Robert. As I've stated several times in
this thread, I define genes by function rather than form. We must encode for
those instructions if we hope to upload ourselves and preserve our
personalities. By "encoding those instructions" I mean the same thing as
"emulating those instructions."

Tuck Everlasting--I saw it about 15-20  yrs ago; it was a magical 
fantasy movie about a group of Quakers/other archaic lifestyle family in 
New England that had discovered some magical elixir. As I recall, it 
treated the idea of immortality favorably.

The remake, however, seems to go the other way, at least according to 
this review:
http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/review/2002/10/11/tuck/index.html

Seems as if immortalism is just one of the few things left that the 
popular culture moguls feel safe in attacking.  After all, its not as if 
a boycott of commercial products by immortalists would hurt the United 
Corporations of America--there are just not enough of us.

Robert, you're still sidestepping what I consider the important issue:
namely, what is at stake for the original. 

I believe everyone here grants that *operationally*, for *other people*, an
exact-ish emulation is as good or bad as the original. In the case you
describe, the emulation also has more interesting tales to tell, which are
pretty much identical to the tales the original would have told had he
experienced the same travels. The burning issue is a deictic or indexical
thing: it never matters to *you* (defined as whoever is *outside* the
person, looking in), it only and absolutely matters to *me* (whoever is
inside, looking out). Unless everyone concerned has agreed to accept the
Emlyn Undecidability Principle, in which case the matter is forever moot.
Traditional evidence for the Emlyn Principle is that very few of us fear
extinction during sleep or medical unconsciousness; adducing the continuity
of the body is a rather clinical afterthought since *I*, having been
unconscious, can only know that continuity via the fallible testimony of
others. Luckily, we're social animals with a strong bias to
truth-telling... But I digress.

I question how much it matters to you or anyone reading
this, based upon the following thought experiment.

So long as we are discussing tropical places, let me 
suggest that for suitable monetary reward, any of us
would be willing to spend 60 days in solitary confinement
in Angola.  (It turns out that the Angolans have a
perfectly awful dark dungeon, but not so bad that for
a few hundred million in cash and freedom after the
sixty days, it won't be worth it!)

Let's also suppose that most everyone on this
list would consider that a perfect xox made 60
days ago---currently residing in that jail cell in
Angola---is *not* a suitable replacement for one.
That is, one would consider it tantamount to death
to be disintegrated, with the sole comfort that
one's duplicate in Angola continues to thrive (so
to speak).

However, I would consider it nothing like death, 
but merely an unfortunate decrease in the extent
of my run time, and here is why.

Would you not, for suitable monetary reward, agree
to have your last 60 days memory lifted?  That is,
suppose that you had ingested an imaginary drug
60 days ago, and unless you take the antidote today,
the last 60 days' memories will never (it turns out)
make it to long term memory, and you'll lose them.

I think it reasonable to suppose that most people
would *not* consider it to be "like death" to lose
those memories.  Yes, it might be terribly inconvenient,
but few would consider this the same as death.

Yet what I propose resembles this latter case much more
than it resembles death.  For let us suppose that after
you lose your memories, you are to be taken to Angola
and placed in that cell, and held for 60 days.  (Then
you'll be placed in suspended animation for another
sixty days, just so that the total balance of time
from your point of view works out.)  I say that in this
case you do not consider these operations tantamount
to death.

Well, you see, if you agree to be disintegrated now so
that your perfect xox gets to continue to live in Angola,
you are agreeing to what is *physically* the same end
result.  In short, unless you believe in the existence
of some non-material component of *you*, the equivalence
of the two foregoing operations proves that the death
of one *xox*---even if he's the one reading this right
now---is not anything like actual death.  One continues
to live as one's duplicates, because duplicates are self.

I don't know about that.  Consider an experiment where there are only 
two personalities, one that answers yes and the other that answers no.  
This is so about a yes/no question.  Then, consider a richer personality 
that answers two yes.no questions, thus that there are four distinct 
personalities.  For any of six billion genetically unique people, 
barring identical twins, which represent a very small portion of the 
viable genetic combinations of people, they fit into one of four 
categories.  To represent that personality in the two-state environment 
only takes two bits.

It doesn't take the complete DNA to encode those decisions.  As the 
number of decisions approaches the complexity of the DNA, then the DNA 
becomes a more significant factor than the sum result of the binary 
decisions.  The DNA isn't the complete precursor of the decisions, your 
clone or emulate may have made different life decisions than you.

(What time is love?  3AM eternal.)

When you talk about emulation then the point is that the emulate-ee, or, 
I guess emulate, can't know that it's emulated.

That leads into the question, are we emulations, or rather, may we 
confront a higher power?

It's turtles all the way down.  That's a sentence about infinity.  
Infinity is a great thing, it exists between any two points in the 
continuum between those two points.  Here's a funny fact, the constant 
function f(x)=1 integrated over the naturals evaluates to equal to two.  
You might expect it to equal to one, like a one by one square, I did and 
was surprised.  I figure that the single digits have something like 
those rising and falling edges where the continuous points have either a 
rising or falling edge.

That leads into indefiniteness, like, what is the smallest real number, 
(iota), whatnot.

How d'ya get that?  I think it's zero.

There isn't a smallest real number.  Or there is.

I get zero too.  In fact, measure theory leads to the zero result for
anything smaller than integrating over the reals.

I don't know what Ross is talking about here.  There isn't a smallest
real number in standard analysis.  The reals are dense (as are the
rationals), meaning as Ross seems to get, between any two of them,
there's another.

In nonstandard analysis, there is an infinitesimal, but these are
superadded onto the reals.  I'm not familiar enough with nonstandard
analysis (hyperreals) to know if the idea is more than a parlor trick.:)

That's great.  We can now have the EUP cast in bronze for the archives.

Which is rather interesting -- since "others" would not be able
to tell Damien 0.0 from the Damien 1.0 xox.

This leads to the question of whether some (or most) people would
object if they were painlessly excised from reality in their sleep
tonight and were replaced by an indistinguishable xox tomorrow.

Agreed.  But given the time it takes proteins to be transported
to the synapses, one might argue that personality (at least the
genetic component of it) is relatively "fixed" -- probably for
at least hours.  I would suspect that more significant aspects
(such as those involved with SAD) might require days to weeks
to change.  The only component I can think of that responds
on a faster scale is the fight-or-flight response.

Yes, this makes sense.  Though it seems likely that we will have
much more control over the built-in aspects of personality long
before we have uploading.  Now that the genome is done I'd expect
the research community to quickly isolate all of the neuroendocrine
signals and receptors and develop drugs to tweek them.  We might have
a large fraction of that done within this decade.

I may have missed this point.  I don't think I read the earliest
messages in the thread.

But it may also be true that uploads may wish to leave behind some
aspects of these signaling systems.  There are certainly people
who might be better "citizens" with diminished testosterone levels.
I myself would be happy to have my clock genes independent of sunlight
levels.  Etc.

Lee,

Then in this case if I kill all but one last remaining Lee Corbin xox I should
not be tried for murder because so long as one remains I have not caused the
death of the Lee Corbin entity. With this possibility we could have all sorts of
distasteful things occur. How about actors xox's that really get killed so the
special effects in films reach true realism? Xox's could fight wars and nobody
really dies!

You are ignoring the subjective experience of real people. The supjective
rocesses involved in reaching the answer to a yes/no question can be quite
complex, involving many subjective considerations related to personal
temperament, particularly if the question is one that involves value
judgments. We are not concerned here with making blind mechanical robots of
ourselves, in which case your line of reasoning might be useful. We are
concerned with transporting our actual personalities into the transhuman
future.

The rest of your letter is also a bit too obtuse for me.

My position can be summarized as follows:

Premise 1:
Some genes influence personality.

Premise 2:
Gene expression (the products of protein synthesis controlled by genes)
changes through time in response to internal and external stimuli.

Premise 3:
The genes that influence personality are not exempt from this variability of
expression. Their varied expressions through time affect brain structures
which in turn affect personality.

I believe I have produced published peer-reviewed research here to establish
the veracity of all three premises.

Conclusion:
The state of an individual's neuronal structures today will not be
sufficient to preserve the personality through time.
To preserve personality, such that our responses to future stimuli will be
true-to-personality, we must encode for (i.e., emulate) the genetic
instructions that decide their various expressions to stimuli not currently
being experienced.

Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) makes for an excellent and very convenient
example. If we are in the midst of a dark gloomy winter and if those of us
with SAD want to upload ourselves now into some inorganic substrate, then
we'll need to include in our upload an emulation or code for the genetic
instructions that influence the manner in which our personalities respond to
changes in the seasons. Otherwise we will fail to be "who we are" in the
coming summer.

Does it? How could it matter to you if you can't even tell if it happened to
you last night? In my humble opinion if something remembers being Damien
Broderick then Damien Broderick is not dead. It's like those "horror"
stories where at the end you discover the hero is really dead, perhaps I'm
missing a few vital neurons but even as kid watching them on the old
Twilight Zone I could never figure out where the horror was in that. I'd be
astounded and delighted to discover I was dead because the very fact that I
could discover anything would mean death was not all it was cracked up to
be; but maybe I'm crazy because almost nobody seems to understand what I'm
talking about.

The scenario you describe -- basically a world-wide descent into
conservative, totalitarian theocracy seems remotely possible, but highly
unlikely.  (In fact, it was part of the background of the last science
fiction novel I tried to write -- ten years ago or so ... But that's
another story.)  I confess that I sometimes shudder with the thought
that I see signs of such a thing -- the seemingly intractable
religiosity of the United States, the violent energy that seems to be
growing in the Islamic world, etc.  But then I realize that there are
many, many factors weighing against these things: Steadily increasing
secularism in Europe and the UK, and the generally non-religious nature
of the vast majority of Chinese people, to name just two important ones.
Sure, these things are themselves subject to being undermined.  I think
the general post-modernist culture of most European societies erodes
their ability to resist "Islamicization", but eventually, as J. Corbally
points out, Europeans will realize they are facing the possibility of
cultural aggression and will react.  Yes, the huge mass of the Chinese
population has proved itself susceptible to inroads by religious memes,
but the humanistic (if deeply conservative) tradition of Confucianism
seems to be strongly immune to fundamental disruption.

Beyond this, one could focus on very near-term trends in the First World
and become discouraged.  The vibrant optimism of the mid- to late-90s in
the "economy of innovation" in the U.S. has certainly been eclipsed by a
mood of nervous anxiety.  But this could be and very likely is a
relatively brief interlude.  Consider that the decrease in one indicator
-- the Dow -- is in absolute terms far, far larger than in the 1929
stock market crash.  Yet we haven't seen the kind of social dislocation
after 18 months of recession that occurred in a similar period after the
1929 crash.  The economies of the developed world are far more complex
-- and I would say robust -- than they were then.  Thesis: The greater
complexity presents far more options for "local" adjustment than were
available in 1929, and the relative absence of trade barriers compared
to 1929 has allowed those adjustments to flow across national boundaries
much more fluidly.  Looking at the "max" time range chart for the Dow
just now, I see that the market's level has returned to the trend line
that one can extend out from the data from 1985 to 1995.  I wouldn't
develop any deeper, systemic concerns about the global economy until and
unless I saw a dip below that level for any length of time.  See:
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=^DJI&d=c&k=c1&a=v&p=s&t=my&l=off&z=m&q=l

Beyond this, although the headline-grabbing business development of
"transhumanistic" technology doesn't seem as vigorous as it was in the
late 1990s, the steady, important scientific and technological work
continues apace.  The fact is that the tele-computing advances inherent
in the roll-out of "Internet Phase One" are just about over and the
business community is at a loss to figure out what "the next big thing"
is.  Big impacts from AI, robotics and molecular medicine lie ahead, and
the unavoidably close horizon of venture capital hasn't yet encompassed
those developments.  But I can think of no reason to believe that these
developments won't happen, and more or less on the schedule I've been
expecting for many years.  See:
http://www.gregburch.net/writing/NearTerm.htm

Again, there are relatively short-term causes for concern.
"Anti-transhumanism" has found a first full voice in the work of Rifkin
and, sadly, Fukuyama, and the Bush Administration's short-sighted ban on
stem cell research certainly bears watching.  But countervailing factors
are already mobilizing.  Nancy Reagan recently came out publicly against
the Bush stem cell policy.  Other voices will be added to this response.
As impatient as we naturally are, some of these things are *so big* that
they're going to take time to work their way from imagination to
reality.

I'd rather think of the current brief period as one in which we're
catching our breath, not really ending our progress at all.

I may have misunderstood your comment, but I get
zero from that integration.

The really cool thing is that the integral you

That is correct, but of course you are entering into the
domain of what works for societies, and that's so complicated
that only evolution has come up with answers (all of our
puny human designs having proved to be grotesque failures).

But yes, in a future where perhaps 10^12 of me reside 
electronically in the Solar System, should some fiend
delete all but one, and somehow also delete their
backed-up memories, this entity should be charged with
the grossest violation of my rights.  Wanton data
destruction itself probably would result in mandatory
penalties alone!

> With this possibility we could have all sorts of

Beware of that which is merely "distasteful".  Anesthetic
was considered distasteful to 19th century physicians,
and today cloning is considered "distasteful" as well
as the nearly compulsory "disturbing".

If it's okay with the xox's, then it's okay with me.

But an important distinction has occurred in other 
discussions of life and simulation.  (You probably
know that we already may be living in a simulation.)
Your suggestion concerns the *appearance* of wars
and death, because you used the term "realism".  So
all that would be needed are *portrayals* of gore
and death.

If (i) 90 percent of your high-school memories were excised
while you slept last night and (ii) all recollection you
have about how much of high school you remember were replaced
by a false recollection, this *should* matter to you.

The reason that it should matter is that the threat exists
that the new *you* will undergo that or more radical transformation.
After a number of transformations, the person reading this will
no longer exist.

Does it not all depend on the veracity of those memories?
What I mean is, more than just altering his high school
memories, we could replace his entire childhood, any
connections with music that he has, and the SF writer
that we know would still awake the next day perfectly
content.  While I agree that in this case DB would still
live, it's getting marginal, and becomes false if many
more such occurances transpire as in my previous example.

;-)  Hardly.  I consider you the second most sensible
person on this list when it comes to questions of
identity.  What if you find out today that *all*
your memories were added last night, and the former
John Clark (who had completely different ones) is
gone?

As appalling as some consider it to be, I will essay
an answer to my own question!  (Please, any other 
gentle reader, do not let this inhibit you from 
also answering!)  *You* should be quite grateful,
of course, because finally *you* get genuine run time.
But you should be EXTREMELY apprehensive that the same
thing will happen to *you* tonight that happened to the
old John Clark.

Reminds me of the bumper sticker we used to see in Houston during the
energy depression of the 1980s: "God, please give me another oil
shortage -- and this time I promise I won't blow it!"  I hope next time
I have the sense to spot the top of the market . . .

As a devout mathematical platonist, I believe in the
infinitesimals, after the revelations of St. Robinson.

However, I believe that there cannot be a smallest
non-standard entity here either, and the reason is
the "game" that seems to have become the ultimate
arbiter for the last century or so.  Were someone
to announce a smallest real or hyperreal, we would
retort that we could find a yet smaller one, and
indeed prove the point by exhibiting one exactly
based upon his contender.

It is curious how mathematical truth appears often to
depend upon who has scored the most debating points,
or at least who gets in the last word!  ;-)

At 40 now, you are probably under the wire.  At 60, its very iffy.
At that age you should be investigating the cryonics options very seriously.

Why is that people can discuss this topic endlessly without progressing to
some common understanding?

As with other topics, it's because both sides are right -- within the
context that they are personally arguing/defending.  Wait, I'm not promoting
relativism here, I'm saying that both sides are talking about their
experience of different parts of the elephant. (
http://www.wordfocus.com/word-act-blindmen.html )

As with all apparent paradox, the solution is to "widen back" to a broader
viewpoint that encompasses more of the subject under discussion.

Some people see self-identity as essentially a label used to describe a
particular pattern rippling through time and space. To them, it doesn't
matter which atoms compose this pattern at any particular moment, and the
previous history of those atoms doesn't matter either.  This viewpoint might
be expressed as "a difference that makes no difference is not a difference
at all."

Others feel self-identity is intrinsic, and from their viewpoint this is
confirmed beyond a doubt by their experience.  Having no experience of
conciousness separate from container, they clearly sense wrongness in the
idea that self-identity might be as fluid as others suggest.  The instinct
for self preservation feeds the certain feeling that something would be
lost, and life experience supports this.

Rather than proceed to argue my point of view, which is certainly the more
enlightened, <grin>, I will leave my offering at this point, hopeful that it
may contribute to understanding, but also aware that it may add new points
of disagreement.

I'll take a different approach from Greg and Ron.  Lets look at
scientific progress.  The human genome sequence is complete,
people are starting to talk about being able to genotype everyone.
People are pinning down diseases to specific genes left and right.
Gene therapies are starting to show some progress (i.e.
possible cures for Parkinson's:
http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2002/10/021011071232.htm)

So we are going to see therapies that can extend lifespan
significantly -- and its going to happen in this generation
(nods to Damien for writing a book about this).  Don't classical
(western?) religions hit a wall at some point -- where reality starts
to bite really hard into the basic premises?  [I.e. longevity
therapies mean you are unlikely to die and/or nanotech allows
the average schmoe to perform "miracles"]

It would appear that if technological innovation continues
to accelerate (even pre "singularity") that most of the
western religious framework is going to hit a wall sometime
in the next couple of decades.

Now we already have a minority trying to "rewrite" reality to fit
their beliefs (the evolution-is-only-a-theory camp).  If religion
hits the wall really hard will this create a backlash that puts
the "middle-of-the-roaders" into the "rewrite" camp?  Or will
people be educated enough such that most religious beliefs
morph sufficiently that religions simply become social clubs?

So do we really need new frontiers or does religion run into
hands that it can't trump?

Maybe.  But the IPO market is pretty much dead for who knows how long.
That in turn is driving the VCs back into the closet.  The net result
is a definite slowdown in the potential rate of innovation if not the
rate of innovation itself.

So while we can point at the "conservatives" (I'm using this term loosely
as in the "collective" that several speakers cited at Extro 5) as a
group likely to have blood of millions on their hands -- it would seem
that we could cite the "average" investor, stock broker, VC partner,
banker, etc. as certainly standing close enough to the carnage so as
to be splattered in red.

As far as I know, infinitesimals are a useful concept for thinking and
modeling in a platonic sense, but have never been observed in nature.  In a
related sense, I think it was Buckminster Fuller who said something like he
doubted "that nature calculates pi every time it wants to make a soap
bubble."

I think this illustrates the crux of the matter.  Some people feel that
there is someone inside, looking out.  Others see this as an illusion which
doesn't matter in the bigger picture.

That depends on how you look at it.  The southern hemisphere
will dominate in numbers, but the wealth will still be in the
north.  As many churches of all brands have discovered, it
is the number of dollars that make things happen, not the
number of people.

Well, here's a chance to strike a blow for
intellectual freedom on several fronts:

Suppose you take one of those new phones that offer
direct web access with video to the Alcor Conference
and leave it on piped to a live webcam page, or just
accidentally leave it turned on after dialing a phone
recorder at home - or anywhere.

This opens you up to all kinds of legal mischief.  In
California, it is illegal to record someone without
their explicit permission.  (Unless of course you are
an employer, in which case you can record your
employees, although they cannot legally record you.) 
Is this a recording?  It had to be stored as packets
along the way, right, even if it is streamed only? 
Has this been tested in the courts?

Then there are the new copyright laws.  Are you guilty
of "hacking" the conference?  This could subject you
to a potential life sentence under the Digital
Millenium Copyright Laws, I believe.

Some years back, a bunch of local libertarians found
out about a narc conference and walked into it with
video cams running.  Of course, they were thrown out
and the tapes destroyed.  With easilly available RF
spy cams which could be piped to anywhere else, such
as an anonymous web page, how many of these criminals
- the narcs, that is - will be able to remain
anonymous?

Not that Alcor is criminal - far from it.  But the
logic of an expensive, closed conference is becoming
increasingly tenuous.  What is there at the conference
that could not be made available on-line?  Are they
going to be taking tissue samples for cryogenic
storage at the con?

I wish them well in their efforts to raise money as
well as publicity, and I certainly support their
rights to do crionic storage of human remains.  It
seems like there ought to be a better way, however.

In fact, I recall an Alcor Conference of 20 years ago
in which Eric Drexler told us about nano-tech and that
Chinese researcher talked about the line of research
that resulted in the discovery of telomeres.  As I
recall, it was held at the Disneyland Hotel and there
was quite a large attendence.  

I'll be curious to see the figures on these year's
con.  I note that the all-time best digital arts
conferences that I ever attended were the three
inexpensive CyberArts conferences of 1990-1992.  The
industry names, the gurus (Jaron Lanier, etc.) and the
garage experimenters were all there rubbing elbows and
talking shop about what actually worked in 3D audio or
VR.  When CyberArts died and Meckler took over from
them, even though Meckler did a good job, the cons
became more and more an industry marketing and
propaganda venue.  Almost nothing but suits.

I suspect it would be measured in seconds or nanoseconds, but maybe it is
hours or days. Regardless, that lag time between the end of transcription
activity and the beginning of observable effects on thought and behavior is
fixed.  It marks the end of our personalities as we know them.

Thank you Robert.

Rafal, are we also in agreement about my sentence above?

By the way, in case it's not obvious, the word "neurons" in the third line
in my sentence above is in reference to emulated or encoded
representations -- not to actual biological neurons.

Getting back to my software analogy, which assumes some kind of digital
emulation of ourselves in the transhuman future: the emulated neurons of our
transhuman selves will be something like classes or objects in object
oriented programming. The brain object is an object of the brain class. Each
transhuman has one brain object, though all transhuman brains are objects of
this class. Each brain object is comprised of brain-organ objects of the
brain-organ class which are in turn comprised of neuron objects of the
neuron class. Neuron objects must contain gene objects of the gene class to
work in a manner analogous to biological neurons.

The neuron objects contained in the brain objects of two transhumans can
contain gene objects in common in the same way that two biological humans
can have biological genes in common.

I am not a particular fan of Atheists United as an
organization.  They play politics, taking positions
such as opposition to School Vouchers and Home
Schooling, as a result of the "Progressive" humanist
dominance, even as libertarian members protest. 
Should libertarians someday dominate the organization
- which might happen - then perhaps links to John
Gatto's site may set the "Progressives" teeth on edge.

Nonetheless, the local meeting attracts enough
interesting people of various persuasions, many
willing to both argue and listen, to make it
worthwhile if you're in the mood.  Usually they get 12
to 35 people, with a scattering of libertarians,
Randians, and/or extropians or sympathizers.

As I touched upon in a previous message, I wonder if the futility of this
debate represents evidence in support of the philosophy underlying the
English language variant known as E-Prime, in which the verb "to be" does
not appear in any of its forms. In the past I never wrote or spoke in favor
of E-Prime but in light of this discussion it now appears to have some
possible value to me.

In an E-Prime world, questions about the possible equivalance of  the
identities of two emulations cannot appear. Such questions disappear as
meaningless and unspeakable. My emulation appears to me simply as a person
who looks like me, who uses the same name as me, and who often thinks and
acts like me. I can say nothing more about him, nor should I. His life and
mine appear to each of as actions rather than as things, such that verbs
represent us better than nouns.

I would challenge people here to try debating these questions in E-Prime to
see if they can present their arguments accurately. I wrote this message in
E-Prime.

religion run into hands that it can't trump?

Robert,
       There are certain things I take for granted.  I believe that The Bell 
Curve is entirely correct when it says that back about 1900 the economy 
became sufficiently high tech that it put a premium on hiring the GT to run 
the businesses.  As a result of this (and now the internet) the GT are 
forming their own community.
       I believe there is a developing problem with those at the left end of 
the bell curve getting exactly that -- left.
       As a result the movers and shakers will be the GT.  No doubt the left 
end of the curve will have opinions but they will not be making the decisions 
that direct the society.
       Of course you will, or at least can, object that with superior numbers 
the luddites can simply outlaw gene research, etc.  They can have the numbers 
and politically could carry the day.  However I recall in the early to mid 
70s when there was a move to outlaw genetic research -- the move can to a 
sudden screeching halt.  I paid attention until I found out what had 
happened.  At that time they believed that all was required to do serious 
genetic research was a space about the size of the average suburban home, an 
education about equal to a masters degree and wealth equal to that of the 
well to do American.  Given those conditions trying to outlaw research was 
just silly.  I don't know if that belief was true nor do I know if it is 
still true but I am sure it will often be true.  Heck, they say Apple or 
somebody started with the family garage.
       So my point is that no one can and will halt our advancing our 
interests.  I also believe that the left end of the bell curve will continue 
to indulge their own pursuits without our being able to interfere whether 
that interest is religion, Canasta or bowling with lopsided balls.
       As an Anglican I will also predict that those of us that continue to 
support that church and similar ones will continue to do so.  We will find 
sufficient converts to our cause among those that come to us looking for what 
we have to offer.
       Religion "ain't" hit the wall.
Ron h.
       Oh, and as far as new frontiers -- we will continue to push the 
scientific frontiers simply because they are profitable and will be 
encouraged either openly or secretly.  As to space has anyone notice that 
even as the government sponsored research has lagged the private sector has 
been quietly proceeding apace.

After I sent my earlier post on tomorrow's meeting, I
took a further look at the AU site and noticed an
article by George Smith on Pascal's Wager.  The
article was tagged as "new."
<http://www.atheistsunited.org/html/pamphlets/smith/smith.html>

Some of you may recall more recently my forwarding of
some material on memetics that I had posted to one of
the news groups focusing on the ongoing Pacifica
Network controversies.  One of the arguments I
included in that post had to do with the seductiveness
of Pascal's Wager from an analysis based on decision
theory.  As far as I knew, this particular explicit
line of argument was original with me, although
various other takes on the issue included it
implicitly, and of course there are many separate and
valid arguments against Pascal's Wager.

At the monthly breakfast meeting of Atheists United
shortly thereafter, I brought up my version of this
argument to several of the attendees to get their
feedback.  None of them had ever heard my particular
take, and one of them, the husband of some official at
AU, suggested that I submit it for consideration in
the newsletter.

I haven't seen the newsletter, as I'm not a member of
the organization due to my objections to their
"Progressive" political positions, so maybe they
actually published my article, but apparently they
must have contacted George Smith about my article, as,
instead of my new original contribution to the set of
arguments against the Wager, they published George's
article, which incorporates my line of argument, as
you will see if you read his article, without quite
ever quoting it.

If you've read Goerge's rather good "Atheism, the Case
Against God," then you may have noted that none of his
arguments are new there either.  He provides a
well-written, reasonably concise summary of a lot of
fairly sophisticated thought on the isssue, but when
he doesn't himself understand some complex line of
argument, he suddenly gets very verbose.  Sadly, I
don't know of any original work by George since his
original libertarian writings in "Invictus."

Some things never change.

Here is what I sent Atheists United:

Harvey Tippit and I had a brief converstaion at the OC
AU breakfast meeting a couple months back and he
suggested that I send this on for possible inclusion
in the newsletter.  Unfortunately I can't get to a
copy of the original piece which was submitted to one
of the Pacifica/KPFK news groups which does not
maintain an archive, as well as to the Extropy.org
email list, which does, but which hasn't yet gotten
around to compiling the 2nd or 3rd Qtr archives of the
list - so I'm stuck with re-creating it on the fly in
15 minutes here at the library...

Ok, the typical form of Pascal's Wager goes like this:

The upside of believing in the particular formulation
of God being proposed by some person at some
particular moment is that if it is in fact the case
that that particular God is for real, then you're home
free - if that particular God pays off that way.  The
downside - of believing - is allegedly negligable,
while the alleged downside of non-believing may be
very high indeed.  So, why not be safe and just
BELIEVE(!)?

Well, decision theory tells us to multiply the
probability of some outcome by its evaluative weight
in comparing it to other possible courses of action. 
Running across a lonely country road without looking
may have a low probability of automotive encounters
but a very high evaluative weight for having one.  So
we decide to look first.  

Getting struck by a meteor is probably about as bad on
average as getting hit by a car, but we only have one
such event on record for all of known human history
(not counting the people who died from the blast
effects of the Tunguska event) and that lady survived.
 So, we don't watch for meteors when we step outside -
at least not for safety reasons.

Now what about Pascal's Wager?  Here the problem is
that the Christians got really clever.  Pascal's
wager, as used by the typical Christian, attaches an
INFINITE weight to the outcome.  Infinity multiplied
by any positive quantity is still infinite.

We are told by the typical Christian that if we only
believe then we will be rewarded with paradise
FOREVER!  And, depending upon the particular doctrine
being sold, if we don't believe, then we risk
infinitely horrible torture - again FOREVER.  Wow! 
That's heavy, brother.

So, applying straitforward decision theory, the very
MOST important thing that we need to do RIGHT THIS
MOMENT is BELIEVE...  right?  I mean, what could
outweigh INFINITY?  What possible trivial finite
earthly reward could justify taking an infinite risk?

Hopefully none of you has collapsed onto his or her
knees at this point, desperately enjoining the cosmic
dictator to forgive you for your infinitely terrible
mistake.  Because...  there are also, on brief
inspection, an infinite number of possible Gods that
might conceivably exist:

Rational Gods who reward non-belief and punish
believers.  Silly Gods who made this whole thing up as
a joke.  Juvenile Gods who cooked up our whole
universe on their gaming machine and are getting bored
anyway.  Talk-show Gods who tweak our universe to
create interesting stories.  Sadistic Gods who ain't
goin to let you win nohow.  Inconsistent Gods who are
struggling to reconcile omniscience with free will. 
Neurotic Gods who need your reassurance that they're
"OK."  Please feel free to extend this list.

So, the two infinities cancel out - or, transposing a
couple of terms in the formula, the probability of any
particular unsupported fantasy being real goes to zero
as you multiply the number of terms under
consideration.  Belief, non-belief, animal sacrifice,
human sacrifice, self-sacrifice, prayer, holy rolling,
snake handling....  What possible criteria could be
used to determine which of the infinite number of
possible conflicting claims upon our lives should be
chosen?  Fantasies can be multiplied forever.  I don't
CARE that your "God" will torture me forever. 
Infinity times zero is ZERO!

It is only when someone, typically a child or anyone
who is philosophically ignorant, is posed with
Pascal's Wager in the form that poses only ONE
unsupported fantasy that we get anomalous result from
our normal decision process.  Unlike scientific
hypotheses, which have to satisfy criteria such as
internal consistency, consistency with known evidence,
explanation of known results, predictive capacity and
parsimony, fantasies such as "God" have no limits on
their variety and thus should be assigned no weight in
our decision-making process.

The caterpillar had a good point.
Who am I.
Who are you.
And how could anyone tell?
A body
Is an epiphenomenon.
Everybody knows
That they aren't the same as their body.
Just as they know
That the body
Is the only way
For other's to recognize them,
But
If you loose your hand
You stay the same person, 
And
If you have a face lift
You stay the same person.

There are those
Who take refuge in the idea
Of a soul,
But they can't define it
In any way
That's meaningful.
There are those
Who propose
DNA
For the same role.
Yet, if one looks within oneself
One doesn't see
DNA.
One sees memories,
One sees images,
One sees feelings,
One sees goals,
One sees desires.
One sees a complex interaction between these.
So,
Who are you?

Exactly.

Quite right.  That's perhaps the most important role a discussion partner
(or philosophical adversary) can play.  They ought to be able to help us
see what our assumptions appear to be, mainly because those people don't
*share* our assumptions, and so can detect what is "wrong".

I posed the question that forms the subject line of this old 
thread, and mainly due to varied contributions from a lot of
people, have learned a good deal.

First, the question is ambiguous in that "differences" might
be taken to mean basic political ideology (the sense I meant
the question to be taken), or it might be taken to pertain 
to a *particular* subject, e.g., can people discuss objectively
whether or not the U.S. should invade Iraq.  Several people
took this latter meaning, made insightful comments, and IIRC
proposed that indeed such difficult subjects *can* be discussed
objectively, and that we in fact do so from time to time.

Second, the question is wrong in the sense that its literal
statement assumes that indeed it is the case that people cannot
discuss differences objectively, whereas---whether meaning 1 or
meaning 2 is taken above---some people do manage to discuss
differences objectively.  I have admitted that I asked the
question rather provocatively out of a sense that the issue
(the first meaning) had been too often ducked.  Several people
are annoyed at the practice of assuming anything in an honest
question, and took me to task for it in various ways.  I'll
try to avoid that in the future.

As for the "meat", that is, the question that I wanted answered
---namely, why do people often seem so reluctant to address 
the roots of their own political ideology, and what makes
leftists differ at base from rightists?---some progress was
also made.  I'm very sorry that I have lost track of the 
person who very eloquently said that a lot of people tend to
feel threatened, annoyed, and perhaps even bored by efforts
to focus upon *their* deepest motivations, or background, or
fundamental assumptions.  TT did write however

   "It is often quite a shock to have ones unacknowledged
   assumptions exposed, let alone challenged.  I think
   that's where a lot of the emotional discord arises
   when discussing political topics."

and I think that he's right on the money.  So, in other words,
one major factor is people's squeamishness about self-examination.

Now I am here in this memo deliberately ignoring a host of
other dimensions to the furor that this subject line and
its descendants caused, but I intend to address them in 
another thread soon.

Suffice it here to say that some people can consider such
investigations (as referred to in the subject line of this
thread) to be poorly motivated, subversive, immaterial,
and unsuitable (improper) for discussion.

Energy should come out in ft-lbs, and one foot-pound apparently
is 1.356 joules (I looked it up---my failure to work this out
from first principles is humiliating).  So if you are correct,
then this translates to 1.07 x 10^13 joules, no?

A handy thing to remember whenever you're thinking of how
much megatonnage a volcano requires to throw some immense
mass a half-mile into the air, or thinking about how many
H-bombs it would take to literally blow up the world (i.e.,
give every atom of the Earth escape velocity) is

     1 megaton = 4x10^15 joules.

In fact, the source for this is my old copy of "Spacetime
Physics" by Taylor and Wheeler, p. 136.  Two of the factors
they use to derive this are "10^3 calories/gram of TNT-
equivalent" and "10^6 grams per ton", so we know that this
is a pretty rough calculation.

Anyway, your 1.07 x 10^13 joules works out to about .0027
megaton, or 2.7 thousand tons of TNT.  The little Hiroshima
bomb was 5,000 kilo-tons, I believe.

My comment was not with regard to which church is
winning out over which other one.  It was with regard
to how to make decisions in world church government.

Do let me get specific.  The Seventh Day Adventist
church has a house of representatives government that
sends reps as a function of the actual number of
believers.  This always worked fine, since most of
this American-made religion were in the U.S. and
Canada.

During the 80s, central African tribal leaders
learned that if the village converted to SDA,
the American church would send money, doctors,
build a school, and most importantly, teach
the children English, which was their ticket
to success in the city.  Within a very few
years, there were more SDAs in Rwanda and
Burundi than in the U.S. and Canada combined.
However, most of the church's budget was
being supplied by the home country.

What to do?  By the way the rules were set
up, Rwanda and Burundi were entitled to more
representatives than the U.S.  But of course
we know the golden rule.  To complicate matters
further, African notions of equality
of the sexes would be considered scandalous
in this country.  Then there was the problem
that the Africans had no problem with slaying
people because of their race, which they
demonstrated by the war between the Hutus
and Tutsis a few years ago.

Since then, that church and parhaps many
others have realized that a church must
be run as a business: he who pays the
piper calls the tune.

What *is* the Existance? I've always supposed it was something like an
AngloSaxon Attitude, but more expansive. Limbs twirling clockwise, fingers
and toes flung outward, perhaps? If so, to adopt the Exi-stance really
requires freefall, which concurs with the general interest here in space
travel.

It's been many years since I've sat bolt upright
hanging on every single word of an adventure
story, an adventure story, moreover, that is
completely true as chronicled by steadfast
Spanish priests and diarists.

I strongly commend the small book "Tales of the
Equator" by Gianni Guadalupi and Antony Shugaar.
Chapter 2, beginning on page 24, is the story of
"The Unfortunate Conquistador", and El Dorado.
Utterly and absolutely mesmerizing to anyone
with an interest in history or adventure, I
would think.

And now I have come to chapter eight entitled
"Joan of Arc of the Congo", leaving behind tales
of South America and beginning the tales of the
second largest continent.  It begins

"In 1483, *annus fatalis* (Latin for "fateful
year"), an immense canoe, unlike anything that
had ever been seen before, topped by vast white
wings that glittered in the strong African
sunlight, emerged from the crashing rollers of
the great western ocean and slowly began to sail
up the estuary of a broad and majestic river.
The onlookers lining the riverbanks stood rooted
to the spot in amazement."

And this promises to be as entertaining, informative,
exciting, and poignant as "The Unfortunate
Conquistador".

(The alert reader will however, find an astronomical
error in the first pages of the book where the 
authors don't understand the analemma at all.)

No one can be told what the Existance is.  You have to see it for
yourself.  ^_-

Damien,

Yes!  Just so!  Each soul comes from God with its
own serial number, and that indelible creation of
the Almighty cannot be duplicated or imitated!

So stuff that talk of atoms and molecules, bits
and bytes.  We're talking the real thing here,
my man, real imperishable immortal souls, at One
with the Divine and Sublime.

Was not the 18th century the most wonderful and
astounding in the history of humankind?  For the
first time, the argument between Ancients and
Moderns could definitely be established in favor
of the latter.  For the first time, barbarism,
ignorance, cruelty, and repression were themselves
repressed.  Even Jenner's 1796 initial inoculation 
against small pox sneaked in, while earlier Lady
Mary Wortly Montagu and the Turks were already
on target: http://www.keratin.com/am/am002.shtml

The previous century really ended in 1715, just as
the 18th century itself really ended in 1815, and
the 19th in 1914.  Because in 1715 one sun was
replaced by another.  The outgoing sun, Sun King
Louis XIV, Le Etat c'est Moi, absolute ruler of
25 million of the most advanced citizens of Earth's
richest country, died that year, and our good old
global-warmer itself, our real sun, came back from
its Maunder Minimum.

Imagine George Washington giving one of his humble
self-conscious speeches and try to find anything
in the previous century to match it.  Consider the
sophistication of the French and English writers of
the late century, nothing earlier in the world can
compare to their erudition and expertise.  Diderot
wrote an encyclopedia, and Johnson a dictionary.
The 1600s had been mostly still ignorance and super-
stition, but the eighteenth century---it was the age
of Euler and Catharine the Great, Frederick the
Great, and lots and lots of other greats on so
many continents and in so many countries.

It was *itself*, the wonderful and irreplaceably
marvelous 18th century.  Put on some Haydn!

That would be 5 megatons, which is way too much, I believe.
At this address

http://www.chandrella.org/documents/nuclear/Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki.shtml

I find a suprisingly low quote of 15 kilotons. The Nagasaki bomb was a bit
bigger, 21 kilotons.

One would wonder what a megaton-sized bomb would do to a modern city.

Yesterday I read an interesting critique of Islam at
http://answering-islam.org/TWOR/peacepromoting.html.  It is written
by an Evengelical Christian but I did check every quote he made from
the Koran since he cited them by chapter and verse numbers. (The
Koran is structurally organized exactly like the Bible.  Yes, I bought a
copy of the Koran.)  I have read scriptures from the other major religions
e.g. the Vedas of Hinduism and Tae-Te-Ching of Taoism and have never
found any lines that advocate war like the Koran does.  Mohammed
was a military general and grew very wealthy and powerful.  His biography
reminds me of Gengis Khan except that Mohammed was much better at
the rationalization of violence and thus recruiting of soldiers.

You're right about Hiroshima; my figure above is way wrong.

Thanks Alfio, for looking it up.

On page 15 of the November 2001 issue of Scientific American,
under "News Scan" there appears:

    "The attack on the World Trade Center unleashed nearly 1,700
     tons worth of TNT.  Average height of towers: 1,365  feet.
     Total weight: 1.25 million tons.  Collapse energy: 2x2^12 joules.
     Equivalence to TNT: 500 tons.  [Lee's note:  I do not yet 
     understand why this does not contradict the first sentence,
     but am rushing to correct my error.].  Energy in one gallon
     of jet fuel: 135,000 btu.  Maximum fuel capacity of a Boeing
     767: 23,980 gallons.  Approximate fuel detonated at impact:
     3,000 gallons.  Explosive energy, both planes:  9x10^11
     joules.  Equivalence to TNT: 990 tons.... Equivalent to TNT
     of U.S. tactical nuclear warhead: 300 to 200,000 tons."

I recall in the sixties we worried about a Russian 10 megaton hitting
an Air Force base 15 miles away, and we thought that our short-term
survival, at least, was impossible unless we happened to be hunkered
down when it hit.  There are figures on radii of the fireball.

Damien, I think Dossy was simply writing in the wrong tense --the present 
tense.  He meant to be writing in the Exi's tense, which is an accelerated 
future tense.  Forgive him his grammar.

My comment was not with regard to which church is
winning out over which other one.  It was with regard
to how to make decisions in world church government.

Do let me get specific.  The Seventh Day Adventist
church has a house of representatives government that
sends reps as a function of the actual number of
believers.  This always worked fine, since most of
this American-made religion were in the U.S. and
Canada.

During the 80s, central African tribal leaders
learned that if the village converted to SDA,
the American church would send money, doctors,
build a school, and most importantly, teach
the children English, which was their ticket
to success in the city.  Within a very few
years, there were more SDAs in Rwanda and
Burundi than in the U.S. and Canada combined.
However, most of the church's budget was
being supplied by the home country.

What to do?  By the way the rules were set
up, Rwanda and Burundi were entitled to more
representatives than the U.S.  But of course
we know the golden rule.  To complicate matters
further, African notions of equality
of the sexes would be considered scandalous
in this country.  Then there was the problem
that the Africans had no problem with slaying
people because of their race, which they
demonstrated by the war between the Hutus
and Tutsis a few years ago.

Since then, that church and parhaps many
others have realized that a church must
be run as a business: he who pays the
piper calls the tune.

Hmmmm, I wonder how dated this is given that the release date
was May 1979?

Now, of course this brings up a question that has to be asked.

There is a story -- I'm not sure if its in the archives or whether
it was related to me personally.  I'm reasonably certain that it
was a comment by one New England extropian about another New England
extropian (I'm being courteous here and not naming names).  The general
sense of the quote was something to the effect of -- "You should be very
careful in your dealings with this person -- he could be a *very* dangerous
individual."  (My general interpretation of the story was that you don't
want to cross someone who could make your life miserable for hundreds or
thousands of years.)

So Anders -- since you just *happen* to have *that* URL so handy
what should we assume about you?

R.

Also, do you happen to have a DVD player yet?

I'm surprised with all the goofy distributed computing
projects that nobody has created a distributed chess
playing engine ... see if it can shut human players out.

Imagine a distributed cluster of 10,000 desktop class
machines averaging 1 GHz each behind a chess computer.

For those ExI list readers who are of the opinion that wars

to read:

"Tourists trying to leave Bali"
http://canada.com/national/story.asp?id=%7BDD21783E-3E9F-4B01-82E6-1B5BCBC82BA3%7D

I'll note that this is a Canadian paper and so hopefully is
somewhat removed from U.S. centric rhetoric.  I would guess
that the majority of the victims involved are from asian countries,
perhaps including many from Australia.  The death toll here approaches
that of the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya.

I've been to Bali -- at the time (about a decade ago) it seemed
to me to  be one of the most "peaceful" places in the world.
I can no longer make that assertion.

The Foresight Institute made the front page of
this morning's San Jose Merc, but not in the
way we might hope.  There was a long whiny
article on how tough things are for tech
employees.  Some prole was going on and on
about being unemployed for two years.  She
finally landed a job at a local think tank
known as the Foresight Institute.  Made it
sound like the professional equivalent of
taking a job at the local burger joint.

You are correct, and may even understate your case.
Freeware on a palm pilot is now good enough to
entertain nearly all club-level players.  This
leads me to think we are ready to make an implantable
computer strong enough to prevail in A to B rated
chess tournaments, assuming a satisfactory interface
could be worked out.  This would be, as far as I
know, the first human enhancement to be used in a
sporting competition.  spike

It has been done.  Scott Kurowski's company,
Entropia.com did it a few years ago.  As I recall,
the conditions under which the human player
agreed to the game included secrecy as to
the outcome, so I question the value of the
exercise in demonstrating distributed computing
to play chess.  I dont know if such a stunt has
been done in the public domain.

We have been imagining this for years.

The more interesting question may be with regard
to Eliezer's notions of inherent latency of a network.
How much does it hurt the virtual supercomputer to need
to distribute packets of information?  Will a meganode
gigahz virtual supercomputer outperform a traditional
kilo-processor Deep Blue style supercomputer?  Would
it not be more entertaining to play supercomputer vs
virtual metasupercomputer?

I can, but not right away.  Im in a temporary
Burchian busy time in the career.

As it turns out, the Hutu-Tutsi civil war more
or less eliminated the dilemma.  After the dust settled,
there were stong accusations that the local SDA
conference presidente participated in orchestrating
the slaughter of Hutus.  It is said he offered a couple
hundred refugees santuary on SDA property, then turned
them over to the soldiers, resulting in their demise.

Whispered rumor has it that El Presidente fled to America
and was hiding somewhere in Texas.  Further rumor had it
that the churches built with American money using Western
building technologies were systematically dismantled and
stolen, so thoroughly that later inspectors were unable to
even locate the former sites of said church buildings.  In
America we steal cars.  In Africa, they steal buildings.

Burundian and Rwandan SDA membership plummeted to where
the church leaders had a hard time even locating *any*
members after the war.  This was in an area where before
the genocide, one in nine persons were supposedly SDA.
Interpretation of the events is left to the interested
reader.

Specific information on these shameful incidents are
hard to find.  True, balanced accounts may *never*
be written.

I created an informal distributed chess engine to help in the match
"Kasparov vs The World" in the Fall of '99. The match was hosted by
Microsoft. What remains of the Microsoft hosted website can be seen here:
http://www.zone.com/kasparov/movelist.html

In this match Kasparov took on several thousand members of the public, each
of whom voted on each move in a straight democratic process via the
internet. The game progressed at the rate of one half-move per day. In
preparation for the game I organized a subteam of about 40 members of the
public, called "The Computer Chess Team." We banded together to do
distributed computing with our home PC's. Among us we had access to a wide
range of commercial programs. I used Fritz 5.0, which was at that time most
advanced home version of Fritz.

I created a website for our Computer Chess Team at which I maintained a
public database of computer generated continuations. After each move by
Kasparov I would assign a different line of possible play to each of our
members. Each member would use his chess application to analyze the assigned
line all night long, and then report his computer generated results on the
next day by entering into our database the expected continuation along with
his particular application's assessment of the final position. From the
combined information from all members I was then able to calculate a best
move, which I would then post to the World's discussion board on which the
World collaborated. My daily reports to The World looked something like
this: "The Computer Chess Team recommends 6...Nf6, expecting 7. 0-0 g6 8.d4
cxd4... [etc]. +=

It was a lot of fun... an intense battle of several months duration. I was
quite obessed with the game during that period... even to the point where I
started dreaming at night about the various possible continuations. :-) But,
alas, Kasparov was victorious, as can be seen by the move-list posted at the
URL mentioned above.

This would be /way/ cool.  I'd love to see what the effects would
be.

I think the idea here is that emergent intelligent behavior will
come from a virtual supercomputer out of necessity because of having to
adapt to latency and propagation and other seemingly chaotic variables.

You don't get that "natural" behavior from a supercomputer.

When you're computationally bound problem solving, the supercomputer
ought to win.  But, if you're looking for a more organic solution, I
think the virtual supercomputer will have surprising (and perhaps
unanticipatable) behaviors.

Hi, I've been thinking about this and I'd like to come at the problem from a
different angle.

First, I'll begin by stating a couple of things that I think would be true.

1. A perfectly rendered copy of myself - an xox, would consider itself to be
"me" and its normative perspective would be to view myself (the original) as
someone "other".

2. From the moment of xox's creation, our personalities would begin to
diverge given that our sensory inputs would be slightly different, even if
we were standing shoulder to shoulder staring at the same blank wall.

Now it seems to me that the essence of this thread might be stated thusly:
Is the xox "me enough" to make me feel better if I'm faced with imminent
destruction knowing with absolute certainty that my xox will go on living?

At face value, I'd have to say no way, but this begs the question: Why
should this unfortunate scenario come about in the first place? To show what
I mean, lets first consider the wondrous nature of "me".

More precisely, what exactly is *me* and where am *I* situated?

I believe most modern "sighted" individuals would situate themselves at the
point of their "mind's eye" which, for me, feels about three to six
centimeters behind the bridge of my nose. Even though I understand that my
visual cortex is located at the back of my brain, I still feel that "I"
reside in my mind's eye closer to the front of my skull. But am I really
stuck there, or can I imagine a scenario where I might feel that I am
located somewhere else?

What if, by some miracle of modern medicine, my optic nerves might somehow
be extended to a length of roughly two meters. I might then design a small
wheeled trolley and place my eyeballs on top of it such that I am able to
walk about trailing this unsightly (or sightly) contraption and it
faithfully follows my body wherever I go, all the while keeping my eyes
pointed squarely at my backside.

Now I am not certain, of course, but I "feel" that after a few days or weeks
of watching my body and *brain* go about their business from this unusual
vantage, I might begin to think *I'm* watching *someone else* and not
myself. If this seems unconvincing then toss my nose and ears on the trolley
as well.

My point is that the concept *me* and, more specifically, my *location* may
be somewhat fluid. Dreams would seem to support this. If that is so, and
given that the technology to create a xox in the first place implies
nanotechnology, I should also be able to arrange the acceptance of direct
sensual (wireless, techno-telepathic) inputs coming from my xox's physical
senses. Should accepting inputs from two sets of senses feel freaky, I/we
might each be equipped with a kind of flip-flop switch, whereby I/we can
accept the inputs from either sensual set at will. This should effectively
place either of us in the other's location, or mind's eye in the blink of an
eye. If the sensual inputs could be faded in and out, instead of abruptly
switched on or off, then either of us might easily and contently face
imminent physical destruction by quickly extracting *ourself* to the safe
remote location of the other's mind's eye.

Waddya think?

Some parts haven't aged well - the discussion of Soviet infrastructure
most obviously, but I also think the EMP disruption side has become far
worse. But for a general impression of that nuclear war is very bad for
one's health and some rough figures it likely works. There has not been
that much of tech development in the field.

That I have a morbid taste in bedside reading? :-) (other books in my
current bedside shelf: Eckert & James, _The Interpretation of Criminal
Bloodstains_, Wojcik's _The End of the World as We Know It: Faith,
Fatalism and Apocalypse in America_ and Kuznetsov's _Elements of Applied
Bifurcation Theory_)

Actually, I dug it up for an alternate history / time travel roleplaying
scenario this spring where I needed a world 20 years after a nuclear war
(the relevant page is at http://akira.nada.kth.se/~asa/bigd.html for a
while; not that detailed really, but enough for my purposes). Compared
to what happened to the Republica Aquincorum in the timeline next door
the US got off lightly ;-)

> Also, do you happen to have a DVD player yet?

No, but I will likely have soon. I will get myself a new computer
soonish, and I don't think I will be able to avoid a DVD.

Yes. Possibly more tourists than Indonesians, actually, this target being

Massacre in Bali

October 14 2002 
By Matthew Moore, Bali 
Louise Dodson, Darren Gray, Canberra

 Scores of Australians are feared to be among the dead after a devastating
car-bomb attack on the resort island of Bali that has killed up to 200
people and caused international outrage.
 Late last night, the unofficial death toll from the attack on two crowded
nightclubs in the tourist hub of Kuta had climbed to 187, while local
authorities struggled with inadequate medical facilities to care for more
than 300 injured.
 An emotional Prime Minister John Howard warned the nation to be prepared
for a high Australian death toll from the world's biggest terrorist outrage
since the September 11 attacks.
 It appears likely the attack will result in the greatest single loss of
Australian lives overseas during peacetime.

==================

I do not counsel, however, that Australian forces immediately begin bombing
Jakarta or Mecca, despite Spudboy's prediction (I paraphrase) some months
ago that this would be my outraged reaction a la 911.

Oh boy.  We should *wish* in our hearts that the Extropian list
could rise to this level of discussion.

First we have David H. Lynch Jr. writing to Steve Gillmor at

"We the people ..."
Steve Gillmor

thoughts of the oral arguments before the Supreme Court.

The reasons for this are two-fold -- (a) it reduces the length of time
during which advanced technology is only available to the "elite" and
not the "masses" and (b) it forces industry to become ever more
innovative [which seems compatible with the singularity]).

Faster, Cheaper, Better (or at least 2 out of 3).

Alex, you aren't alone.  One of the primary reasons I moved from San
Francisco to Seattle was that I viewed it as less earthquake prone.

Well a decade+ later, I now know that it *is* less earthquake prone
but when it does have earthquakes they are 8-9 on the scale and
tend to level everything.  So one is sitting at the roulette table.
I'm currently stacking the cards to lean in a different direction.

I don't know if I'd go to the full lead lined bunker yet -- but I
definitely think there is a strategy for cryogenic preseration
of your pseudo-stem cells in such an environment for decades.
If I get to express my vote we are going to push one of the companies
leaning in this direction over the edge within the next few years.
I.e. you will be able to sign up for this "precautionary measure".

You moved from somewhere with upcoming major earthquakes to somewhere with
upcoming major earthquakes *and* a volcano? Hmm.

Actually, Sasha introduced me once to one of his girlfriends this way,
though not exactly in those words. He said "Theese ees Michael, heese a
velly dangelous man." (with mischeivous grin)

Though I like your interpretation as well. ;)

It seems that Indonesia is at risk of the same level of diversionary
violence as Pakistan has suffered from. A primary opposition leader is
also alleged by the US to be an al Qaeda supporter, and the national
leadership can't afford to come out against him and be seen as
kowtowing to the US, while at the same time, this leader has made
statements today that 'we asked for it'. Thus, the stage is being set
for another front in the terror war. What will be interesting is how
Australia and Canada respond to their own citizens being victimized,
with few Americans present.

If the Muslims did this, they have shown that they
hate not only Americans and themselves, but also
anyone not Muslim.  The Europeans and Japanese would
surely realize it is their turn next.

If some other group did this hoping to blame the
Muslims, I just hope we have the means to catch them.

People always resent you for reminding them of risks they'd rather not
think about, and for making them feel like they haven't properly
prepared. They also have a little of the Cassandra Complex going on,
thinking that if you buy stuff like that, you will make it happen.

I'd say that most of us did some preparation prior to the millenium,
but have let things slide since. I sold most of my stock of ammo, used
my MRE's in hunting trips and when I forgot to go shopping and was
short on time. I am far more prepared tool-wise, and have just to
restock consumables. By spring I intend to buy some remote land of my
own, as I have been depending on having access to the family hunting
cabin in extremis to this point.

I have the same opinion. The constitution says patents and copyrights
should be granted for a 'limited period'. Granting them for the
entirety of an artists life is not "limited" in any way.

Now, on the other hand, for those claiming that those in support of the
Bono Act are just one hand of the US cultural dominance of the world
and exposing why globalization is a bad thing, I would note that the
Bono Act was simply bringing US IP law into equality with IP laws in
the other GATT signatory nations. If anybody is the bad guy here, it is
the rest of the world.

I misstated the units, which should be ft-lbs^2/sec^2. Foot-lbs are a
measure of torque, with no time component. My mass estimates are based
on my recollection of the amount of debris that Mayor Guiliani said
needed to be excavated from Ground Zero, which was 100,000 tons, and
was made up of not just the two main towers, but the subsidiary
buildings as well.

The Hiroshima bomb was about 12 kilotons of TNT. I understand that the
backpack nukes that the Russians can't seem to keep track of are in the
4-8 kiloton range, mere tactical weapons. 9/11 was about half the
destructive power of the sort of nukes we are worried about bin Laden
getting ahold of. The one's Saddam is intent on building are apparently
more in the W-88 range (250 kilotons or more). So while al Qaeda is
certainly a significant threat, I think Saddam is intent on gaining far
greater capability (and is willing to use it).

Keep in mind that my force estimate was for EACH tower, not them
together, since they fell at separate times.

Got into this in a cloning, stem cell, and abortion discussion with my
Catholic parents. Mum is also in the medical field, so she's not
biologically ignorant either. She was under the assumption that you'd
be sharing a 'soul' with your clone, and was of the opinion that a
fetus gets its soul at the moment of conception, but I asked if twins
share a single soul. She said no, she didn't think so. I then asked if
a fetus split in two immediately after conception to produce twins, or
if it split x many cell divisions down the road from conception. She
said it happens later, not until some number of cell divisions occur. 

So I concluded that twins (and therefore the rest of us) couldn't get
their souls till at least x many cell divisions after conception. She
couldn't dispute this conclusion at all. I then said that this also
means that if stem cells are harvested prior to this x many cell
division point, then there would be no danger of souls getting in the
way of this operation. She agreed. I then said that if a fetus was
aborted prior to this x many cell divisions, then such an abortion
would not be murder.

This, I think, is the point at which pro-lifers, pro-choicers,
pro-cloners, and pro-stem cell researchers can share common ground.

I think that you have a new take on this old question that
has not been addressed on this list, or at least not in a
long time.  (And of course, there's really nothing new 
under the sun---in The Mind's I there was a story called
"Where am I?" and also one in which someone was gradually
placed at a greater and greater remove from his actual
body.)

What I find of the greatest utility in your suggestion,
however, is that it *finally* separates out this "feeling"
that so many of us report (and that so many of us have)
that we are *in* our bodies.  Now, yes, if my memories
do in fact reside in my brain, and my brain is in my
body, then on some logical level I indeed am *in* my
body.  But the trouble that keeps coming up and preventing
many people from adopting a *logical* view of identity is
that of this nagging "feeling" that "the other duplicate
is not them".

(They don't have any trouble identifying with the entity
they'll be tomorrow, or were last month, even though
*formally* those entities are much more different from
them than in their newly minted duplicate.)

> My point is that the concept *me* and, more specifically,

Absolutely.  Apparently one can train oneself to have an
"out of body" experience, and the tall tales of alien
abduction often stem from such experiences.

So, what you have distilled here is an essence of feeling
of location---and once that people compensate for that
feeling, or take it into account, they'll be much closer
to accepting that their duplicates *are* themselves.
(Of course, your duplicate does diverge from you, but
it should take years and years before you ought to stop
identifying with him---just as it ought normally require
years for you to think that you've become someone 
different from who you used to be.)

Ja.  Planck's constant represents one bit on the great
metacomputer that runs the sim that we perceive as
time, space and everything.  We are all one grand
computer game.  spike

Foot pounds can be a unit of energy too, since it is
a force times a distance.  But do spare us the archaic
units, all of you, and state energy in terms of joules,
or newton meters.

That energy isn't converted to heat.  Steel mills used to have to use 
forced oxygen burning coke to get enough heat to melt steel, a blast 
furnace.  The WTC floors were separated from each other.  Jet fuel burns 
at about 600 or 700 degrees Fahrenheit, about 350 C, steel melts at 
around 2700 degrees Fahrenheit, about 1500 C, 1773 Kelvins.  It is 
obvious that some sources claim the jet fuel melted the steel supports, 
others don't.

Firefighters and policeman there that day reported multiple explosions.  
A bunch of them in the buildings with the smoldering remains of fires 
died when the buildings fell on them.

Pilots got together and said the pilots were definite experts.  One 
plane hit a tower in the center, the other plane hit the edge of the 
other tower.  The main structural supports were in the center.  The 
second tower hit fell first, where most of the jet fuel exploded outside 
that one.

Watch the video of a tower falling, see the floors pulverize before the 
roof falls in near free-fall.  Compare the video to a building being 
demolished, it looks very much the same.  The building is heavy, it is 
inclined by gravity to go down and not left or right.

It was blamed on bin Laden well before the alleged hijacker's passports 
were "found" at the Pentagon and down the street from the WTC, they're 
apparently tougher than flight data recorders.

The seismographs don't just report the buildings falling, but also a 
large detonation.

The WTC destruction was a huge crime.  It was a criminal act of 
unheralded proportions.  If a state was behind it then it would be an 
act of war.  In investigating a crime a question is of motive and thus 
who stood to gain...

We could reconstruct the occurences upon the building materials but they 
appear to have been "sold for scrap" and shipped overseas.

Death to terrorists.

This is the point where I usually roll out the mosaic soul dilemma: in at
least some cases, dizygotic twins fuse into a viable single individual.
This can be forced in vitro. What happens to the extra souls?

Of course such questions cut no ice with theologians, who might reply that
the creation and insertion of souls in the free act of the deity, Who Knows
All, Tells very little. A god that can accurately foretell quantum outcomes
(and who's going to trust a less potent god than that?) isn't going to be
fazed by twins, chimeras, mosaics and clones.

As there has been some mention now of the Emlyn Undecidability Principle
(urrmrmrmm), I think I'd better re-explain what I meant. It's a bit more
subtle perhaps than what people might have read at first. I've included my
original message below for reference.

I think it has been taken that I was implying that we can't saying anything
useful about the nature of identity, because there's no way to objectively
measure it. So we can just do any old thing. But that's not quite the
story...

What I propose is that you cannot make an objective statement about what the
experience of identity is, because it is an entirely subjective phenomenon.
We see that there are multiple points of view on identity, from the
materialists who view identity as a lie, to those who say that copies are
identical, through to subjective phenomenalists who support (some might say
reify) conscious identity as supreme, arguing that it cannot be copied by
anything so vulgar as making a physical duplicate (absolute
identificationists???), and then off to the side somewhere to totally
different philosophies who deify rather than reify identity, or those who
purport it has an immortal existence in an afterlife, or those who see it as
the Big Lie (pace Ross) of existence and that the ultimate goal of existence
is to shed the illusion (there is no icecream).

Most of these viewpoints can exist simultaneously because there can be no
objective test. Each of us experiences only his/her own conscious identity
(I assume - more to that later). This is what has been touted as my
viewpoint so far.

But there's more to it, which Damien touched on. I also propose that
whatever an individual truly believes about identity is the truth for that
individual (individual defined as the thing on the inside which is forever
isolated). There is a caveat to this, which is that this is only the case
for those parts of the belief which are truly untestable.

This comes up particularly when talking about xoxing. Materialists don't see
a problem with destructive copying, for instance, because they see xoxes as
equivalent, *even subjectively* one must assume. So, for instance, Lee would
be more than happy to be destructively teleported, because of his beliefs.

Subjective phenomenalists, eg Damien, abhore this idea. They would see it as
suicide followed by construction of a copy who is not them. The original (a
term not even used by some materialists I think) would be dead dead dead.
(fwiw, from a personal position I am still in this camp. Don't shoot shoot
shoot that thing at me!).

And there are probably other consistent positions, but I'll stick with these
two for now.

Interestingly, it matters very much what the individual believes. 

Subjectivists are going to be pissed off if you go xoxing them then
discriminating against the original (eg: by destroying them). If you did
this without them knowing, they wouldn't object, but they'd never expect to;
subjectivists would say that the copy would feel as though it were the
original, given no other information. If you just told them that you'd done
it without them knowing, they'd probably do some hurt to you, whether or not
you were telling the truth. This reaction is reasonable; if someone
convinced you that they'd killed your pet and produced evidence, it'd be
fair enough to be angry even if it turned out they were lying about it. No
one appreciates being violated, even if it's only psychological and only for
purposes of experimentation.

Materialists are going to be happy to be destructively copied. Faced with
copies of themselves, materialists would be happy to be destroyed on being
informed that they were surplus, because they'd know that they will live on;
the others are also them.

What these positions have in common is that they are untestable. You can't
construct a test to find out if identity is like materialists say, or like
subjectivists say. Why not? Because it's subjective. A subjective phenomenon
is owned, if you like, by the person that experiences it; no one else gets a
say.

This is not to say that you can't change your mind. A materialist, faced
with the disintegrator ray, might suddenly find that subjectivism has a
certain authentic feel. A subjectivist, on being transported, might find
that the world doesn't seem to have come crashing down around them after
all. A buddhist might decide that he really does want to own all the
icecream. 

But the idea that you cannot, from the outside, know the "truth" of
identity, because it is subjective, and therefore not possesed of objective
truth, doesn't absolve you from holding a position yourself about identity.
You still know about you; you still have to decide about teleport booths and
anaesthetics and mad scientists with death rays for yourself. The meta
position isn't either materialism or absolute identity by proxy; it allows
for both, and others, on an individual by individual basis.

Interestingly, those who hold less sophisticated points of view are making a
bolder statement. For instance, the heaven's gate guys held a (subjectively)
testable hypothesis; that the spaceship really will pick them up. What a
gamble! A materialist who decides to be terminated in favour of another copy
just trusts that his viewpoint is correct; the heaven's gate guys expected
to personally be trekking in short order (maybe they are!). Other afterlife
theories are similar. Of course none of these is objectively testable
(although I do wonder if Hubble was pointed in the right direction).

Related to the above, everything I've said is bunk if there really is an
afterlife; in that case, destructive copying is going to do something very
weird. Maybe that's the explanation for hell filling up in "dawn of the
dead" and related movies?

One last serious point, to support this subjective phenomenon thesis. Maybe
materialists don't actually experience identity in the same way that
subjective phenomenalists do? Maybe the schism is rooted in a real
difference, which we can, unfortunately, never measure? Damien, do you
really know if Lee fundamentally groks your references to identity?

-----------------
Original message:

Having been of the same stance as Damien on this one, I've recently changed
my view. I now think all of the vaguely consistent viewpoints are correct.

Basically, I think that whatever you believe is probably how it is for you.
After all, we are talking about subjective phenomena here.

For instance, when those in the xox-is-me camp are replicated, how are they
going to feel about it? The "original" will think "I am me, and so is the
other guy". The copy is going to think "I am me, and so is the other guy".
If one of them is to be disintegrated (say the "original"), then he's going
to be ok about it, because "that guy over there is also 'me'", unless he has
a sudden change of heart. He wont expect to *feel* like "that guy over there
is 'me'" because he "knows" it doesn't work that way.

On the other hand, if you believe that the copy is not you, then, on xoxing,
the original is going to say "See, I'm still here, don't point that thing at
me." The Xox will say "Wow, that feels like I just teleported from that
table to this one, but then it would, wouldn't it? Don't zap that guy, he's
the original. Don't zap me either, I'm valid even if I'm a copy."

I guess I'm saying that identity is constructed by the identified. On the
subject of identity and duplicates, believe what you will and it is so.

It's not just a story or a thought experiment, it's been the experimental
epistemology of VR for more than a decade. As I put it in THE SPIKE,
drawing on Howard Rheingold's descriptions in his book VIRTUAL REALITY (1991):

< Clad in a sort of wired wet-suit, with stereo visual and auditory
headset, you can dance with a four-meter purple lobster, run through tall
grass as a lion, or transfer your point of view into a robot body on the
far side of the room that gazes back at your own distant flesh. The
experience of disembodiment is so real, as your data-gloved hands control
the robot's movements and your gaze shifts its lens, that it can give you
psychic whiplash. Uncoupling from the VR rig can cause `simulator sickness'. >

How far are we from having a cocktail that enables 150 year or 
indefinite lifespans?

Longevity, longevity.  Everybody wants to live forever.  Jonathan 
Swift:  "Everybody wants to live
forever, but nobody wants to grow old".

What's the state-of-the-art in life extension?  Do telomeres and 
telomere fraying truly represent a limit on the reuse of replicated 
genes?  What enzyme enables a protein machine to add the telomere, what 
do you call them, endpoints back on to the segmented aglet-like 
telomeres?

http://www.genlink.wustl.edu/teldb/tel.html - "What are Telomeres?"

The leading causes of natural death are failures of the respiratory and 
cardiovascular system, and perhaps cancer.  Let's say malignant cancer 
was not an issue.  Heart treatments are quite advanced, proper 
cholesterol and perhaps moreso cardiovascular inflammatory management 
much helps in extending the use of the heart and associated vessels.  
The lungs are most at risk from environmental contaminants.  The 
composition of the alviolae, uh, alveoli, doesn't have a ready surgical 
replacement from pig lungs.  Lung brush, anyone?  Lung therapy is a 
broad horizon.

There are many other symptoms of aging.  Many aging people have found 
much relief in hormonal replacement therapies.  I'm just a layman, but I 
think definitely that the endocrine system is where to start in halting 
symptoms of aging.  That's kind of the internal way, and then the 
external way is about reconditioning muscles, tendons, and vessels.  The 
nervous system is a special case because often nerve cells have 
different or lacking ways to regenerate.

I guess there are survivalists and armageddonists.  It's not a bad idea 
to realistically stock supplies, with room for error.  If you're old you 
might want to take a half a baby aspirin each day.

Have a nice day,

Ross

Of *course* a subjectivist xox would *feel* continuous, but that's exactly
*not the point*. In fact, I'd expect teleported subjectivists to shed their
earlier qualms, a little like people warned against taking a potent
mind-altering (and perhaps damaging) drug:

1.	`I don't know, ingesting this dilithium seems rather hazardous. But
since you're threatening to decorticate me with a spoon otherwise--'

Once you bring `souls' in, everything's up for grabs. Suppose when the xox
forms, it has no soul *until the original is destroyed*, at which point the
xox's nonlocal link with the original *drags* the soul into its brain
through superspace. Suppose when the xox forms, it *sucks* the nearest
dying quasi-copy to it from a Many Worlds cosmos nearby. Suppose a xox
forms a perfect telepathic union with the original if the process happens
fast enough, and thereafter they instantiate a unitary extended
consciousness. Etc.

That's *di*lithium, d00Dster. Wow.

It uses a form of Lebesgue integral, it might use the F-Sigma Lebesgue 
integral, to determine a value for functions that sum to f(x)=1.

I think that a sum of an infinite number of zeroes is equal to zero.  
The sum of an infinite number of infinitesimals may be zero 
(infinitestimal), finite, or infinite.

It's like considering a square and asking, is it just a square, or four 
smaller squares?  Drop a pencil on the square and call the mark a 
point.  It's like wondering if a line segment is a set of points, and 
how.

It's kind of intuitive, people have a general idea of what a real line, 
it's a continuous path, the idea is to figure out what it means for 
anything to traverse the path.  Luckily there is time, a time-like 
vector, to consider the paths in space, measured in space-like vectors.

Also it's consideration of how some numbers are rational numbers, 
they're fractions of integers, a/b for finite integers a/b, and the 
other real numbers are thus irrational.  Irrational numbers have been 
proven to exist, for example e and Pi.  My opinion is that rationals and 
irrationals alternate on the real number line, although some 
considerations of that are counterintuitive.

Infinity and infinite sets are a part of several areas of mathematics, 
including analysis and set theory.

If you look at the sine function, it's average derivative is zero, it 
ranges from -1 to 1, sin(x) in the limit as x diverges to infinity is 
said not to exist.  The sinc function, f(x)/x in the limit has at point 
x a value between 1/x and -1/x, which as x diverges puts the value of 
sinc(x) between 0+ and 0-, or that the limit of sinc(x) as x diverges is 
zero.  The limit of sinc(x) is not always said to exist.

Heh, Bertrand Russell could prove Serafino to be the Pope.

It was real, but a court has recently overthrown the silly law.

Well, I didn't say that I'd change my mind - personally, I'd have to be put
in a destructive transporter at gunpoint, and after transmission I know my
xox would mourn my murder. But that's just me.

Maybe they are so for good reason. Mainly that the "Christian whacko
right wingers" are so enamored with the idea of having control over
teaching Creationism rather than Evolution. They probably won't put much
emphasis on teaching philosophy or critical thinking either since the
bible says, "be not a reasoner or a philosopher". In other words, don't
think or you'll discover this is all a sham.

We must be careful who we pick as allies. Conservative religious zealots
and by extension and association plain old conservatives are not
Extropic. They won't ever be our allies. They hear us talk of having
godlike powers one day and all they really hear is the serpent in the
garden saying, "You will surely be as gods, having the knowledge of good
and of evil". Insert here KNOWLEDGE=BAD. They hear us talk of science
based immortality and again they only hear the serpent saying, "You
shall not surely die", again with the reference to learning some secret
knowledge and how bad it is for mere mortals to learn it. They hear us
talk of the singularity, of knowledge increasing, and what they really
hear is the apocalyptic prophecy that says, "There will be much going to
and fro... [sic] ...knowledge will increase in the latter days". Sorry I
don't care to take the time or suffer the exposure again to look up the
exact text verbose. I think you all get the idea.

I see a lot of left and liberal bashing on this list and it puzzles
me... saddens me. This is because statistics show that the more educated
an individual is the more likely they are to be liberal and furthermore,
the more educated and liberal a person then also the likelihood they
will be less religious. Meanwhile we are under attack by the likes of
Leon Kass and Bush's merry band of science bashers. I don't see rabid
right wingers being transhumanist. The term conservative means favoring
the status quo. Conservatives are not in any hurry whatsoever to
drastically change everything they know and are comfortable with.
Actually most pine for and hope to return to the "good (bad) old days"
romanticizing the so called slower gentler times of old when women and
children were practically property. They certainly are in no hurry to
experience the type of things that will cause huge culture shock,
destroy religion's precepts and especially so greatly change the economy
as to practically do away with it.

So what DO conservatives have in common with Extropians? Oh yeah, they
favor a "Free Market". Well I gotta say I don't see that as being enough
in lieu of the enormous downside to consider them as allies.

Pascal's Wager looks a bit different if you add matrices for "belief
causes people to believe exploiting the earth is their god given right
which may lead to environmental destruction" or "belief causes people to
justify war, prejudice, hate and genocide" or "belief in god and an
afterlife causes people to cheapen the value of life leading to sending
their young to war and stiffling research into medicine" and one could
go on and on.

Try Howard Bloom's Lucipher Principle, chiefly the chapter on Islam's War
Against the West. See it or some of it here:
http://www.howardbloom.net/islam.htm

luddite+religious fanatic+violent militant=muslim

According to Bloom due to the militant teachings of the Quran, chiefly the
passages referring to not allowing an infidel to live, not even moderate muslims
can be trusted. Their apologists will say Islam teaches against violence...
unless it is jihad. The trouble is, it's far too easy to cry jihad at the drop
of a hat, for anything under the sun!

To me all religion must go. It will go two milliseconds after an augmented
populace goes online and the average human's brain power and logic acuity
increases even a little. Will we survive long enough in the face of the rise of
Islam? That is the question.

Personally I don't think China is that far from religion. Looked at a
certain way communism is the twin of Taoism. Think about. In Taoism you are
born into your lot in life and that just as nature is unchangeable. Sound
any different than the state prescribing one's profession and station? I
think the chinese so readily accepted communism because to them it was
little different than what they knew for thousands of years.

They could easily slip back into Taoism if the communist state failed as I
see coming anyway. Look how quickly the Orthodox Russian church gained
ground when the USSR fell out of favor. Weak people need their crutches
either religious or governmental. The trouble with Taoism is that it's the
ultimate luddite religion. The chinese could have developed rocketry to the
point of world conquest and even perhaps taken humanity to space several
thousand years ago but they didn't because Taoism teaches that nature is
unchanging so why try? It would be interesting to see how readily or not
transhumanism takes in China.

Again, unsinkable, (almost to the point of being a tautology).
If I am following, then your claim rests or falls on how
extensive is the *untestable* part.  That is, as your first
statement stands or falls, so does your thesis.

Yes, though I have a caveat here myself (see below).

[Very good description and definitions of the "subjectivist"
and "materialist" positions elided.]

This is incorrect (at least for me, but I think for all others too),
unless the word "surplus" carries a peculiarly meaning.  For
my *extreme* materialist position, twice as many of me are 
*exactly* twice as good.  So any thought experiment in which
I agree to be disintegrated must be constructed with great
care.  See my earlier posts for such constructions.

The usual construction is that a destructive-only method of
teleportation has been devised, and that it's impossible for
the original to survive.

The interesting scenarios, on the contrary, provide the
original with options to survive or not.  My favorite,
for example, is my old one where

    You walk into a room and discover a frozen duplicate
    of you created a few minutes ago.  There he is, sprawled
    out in the ice as was the Frankenstein monster.  On top
    the cask of ice sits a briefcase containing ten million
    dollars.  You must choose between (A) to have your xox
    and the $10M vaporized, or (B) to be vaporized yourself
    with your duplicate getting to be thawed out and sent
    happily on his way to the bank with his new ten million.

Only the most extreme "state-theory" followers, or extreme
materialists as you would call them, opt for choice B, like
I do, and as Robin Hanson does.  We don't mind losing a few
minutes' memories, and anticipate going to the bank tomorrow
and enjoyably depositing all that money.

You've made it very clear.  Although, just who is "no one else"
is part of the conundrum.  I would say that my close duplicate
is not someone else.

You're quite right.  That's why I propose the thought experiment
above to separate the men from the boys, so to speak.  And I
have had to *practice* imagining myself in that scenario and
*practice* the equanimity that I would feel looking down the
barrel of it.

> after all.

In many scenarios, evolution ultimately favors the materialist:
"Oh, c'mon Grandpa, teleport with us to Mars!"
"Now Marty, you must remember that Grandpa doesn't
     believe in teleportation."

The children look at each other in complete bewilderment.

"He thinks that some part of him dies every time he is
forced to teleport, and that he's not the same person."

"You mean that Grandpa isn't the same Grandpa we had
before we were forced to leave Earth?"  More incredulous
stares from the children (etc., etc.).   The practical
advantages of teleportation in many scenarios would
soon make believers of all practical people.

Yes.

It's an interesting possibility that there are real psychological
differences between those who would teleport and those who would
not (just as I surmised such differences between left and right,
before things turned ugly).  So far as I can tell, Damien *understands*
the view of people like John Clark and myself; that physics is
everything; that when you put the clock back together, it's the
same clock even if you use a few different carbon atoms here and
there.

I *think* that I understand his reluctance to teleport, but maybe
not!  I'm sorry.  I'm afraid I will have to go back and re-read
his posts, because I cannot articulate it at this time.  So perhaps
you're right and I don't grok it.

How about true hermaphrodites? If the xiang god really hates homosexuals than
the hermaphrodite is damned either way. I guess the all knower splits them into
two a male and a female with no quibling over xoxing. :)

I believe that it depends on the cardinality of the number of
zeros.  For example, we know that the area of the unit square
is one.  But it consists of an uncountable number of points,
each of measure zero.  Also, merely "infinitely" many, as
in countably many, are still zero.  One must go from aleph 0
type infinity to aleph 1 type infinity to get a non-zero
result.

It becomes an interesting difference between platonists and
formalists (or nominalists).  We platonists *believe* in the
real line, and the real numbers, because we've used them a
lot, and they have readily identifiable properties, just like
the World Trade Center had readily identifiable properties,
and so was a real thing.  (Yes, unicorns have well-known
properties too, but we (a) consider them not to exist in
the evolutionary record and (b) be too complicated to 
exist in the same definite way that the number 17 exists.)

Pi and e are even "worse" than irrational.  The square root of 2
is also irrational, but satisfies a polynomial equation, namely
x^2 = 2.  But e and pi were proved to be *transcendental*, which
is to say that they do not satisfy any polynomial equation.

I don't think that viewing rationals and irrationals as alternating
on the real line is supportable.  In the first place, as you know,
given a rational number, say, there is no *next* number, rational
or irrational either one.  In the second place, the rationals
seem to be rather badly outnumbered:  there are only countably
many of them, whereas there are uncountably many irrationals.
This superabundance of the irrationals is very striking in certain
examples, and gives one the feeling that rationals are very rare
creatures indeed.

> Heh, Bertrand Russell could prove Serafino to be the Pope.

Well, not anymore, because Russell has died (unfrozen).
It would be far easier for Serafino to prove that
Russell was once Pope.  Being unable to prove stuff
is yet one more reason to avoid dying.

Some people might be willing to die as long as a different person who is 
*almost* exactly like them has $10M with which to follow the same goals.

Another argument I've found to work with regard to cloning is to suggest
that we do now have the technology to do the following. Suppose we know
for certain that a woman carrying twins cannot do so and survive. That
even one of the twins might not survive but that she could carry one to
term successfully. So we could then remove and freeze one embryo and let
the other stay and go to term and be born. A year later after the woman
recovers sufficiently we re-implant the preserved embryo and it is carried
to term and also born. It is genetically identical to its now older
sibling. What's the difference in principle of this to a clone/original
set other than a greater amount of time separating their births?

Regarding stem cell harvesting. We take a cow egg and denucleate it then
insert the DNA of an adult human, zap it with a charge and it begins to
divide producing stem cells. Should we then treat it as a "potential
human" and take it to birth? Then what... tell it its mother was a cow?
These almost chimeral (a true chimera would have cow DNA not simply some
small bit of tissue) stem cells will work but who in their right mind
would consider the cow egg made embryo to be really a "potential human"?

Regarding the religious and their archaic and superstitious ideas about
souls, they haven't read their bibles closely enough. It supports only one
spirit being, namely the umm, holy ghost. It says precisely that the all
knowing one allegedly took dust (insert matter) and breathed the breath of
life (insert biochemical electrical energy) into the dust and the entire
concoction then "became a living soul". So then the word "soul" really
means the entire package not some ethereal intangible separate-of-the-body
essence. It elsewhere says about death and souls that when one dies "your
love dies also" and that "you know nothing" among many other things to the
same effect. This to me means that the mind does not survive destruction
of the body/brain (dust), no ghosts or floating spirits or immediate trips
to heaven. This then can be used to point out that minus the dust (brain)
the mind does not exist. How then can a few cells, many many divisions
away from developing the brain, be a soul?

Of course to me the bible supports the worst invention of humankind. I
don't recommend it but I am quick to point out to its believers where they
have it wrong.

Luckily the UK is not known for its earthquakes, although we did have a 2.5 a 
month ago. The previous one was about 15 years ago and rated about 2 or less. 
If I lived in SF I would move away. I have been looking at emigrating to the

The following tips might be of interest to the list (would be interesting to
see more, similar tips and/or comments, suggestions and criticisms):

- when going for surgery, get a pint of your own blood frozen (at the
hospital), just in case there might be the need for a transfusion. This way
you won't have to worry about the blood having been screened properly and
about any as yet unknown pathogens out there.

- carry an aspirin with you (and chew it in case of a cardiac)

- when flying, carry with you a see-trough plastic bag and put it on your head
in case of fire. Apparently many air crash victims die of smoke inhalation
after the plane has crashed. The air in the bag would allow you a few minutes
- hopefully enough to get out of the plane.

- when flying, ask for a wing seat (*apparently* those are the safest)

Cheers,
Fabio

There are a number of crucial differences between what one might call
"religion" in traditional China and the phenomena that go by that name
in the West.  In traditional China three cultural complexes fit into the
social and cultural space occupied by religion in the West and the
Middle East: Taoism, Confucianism and Buddhism.  Each are far more
humanistic than any of the "religions of the Book", all have a much more
syncretistic orientation than the totalistic tendencies of the Western
monotheist religions, there is no centralized authority in these
cultural complexes and, most importantly, none are truly theistic in any
meaningful sense. In their pervasive, widespread "low" or "folk" forms,
each become polytheistic: Taoism expresses itself as a kind of local,
naturist animism, Confucianism as "ancestor worship" (really "ancestor
veneration") and Buddhism as mythic spritism.  Sinitic polytheism (I use
this term because one sees it throughout East Asia) is singularly "weak"
as religions go -- the metaphysical claims made by folk practitioners
are modest, and the social normative impact of the folk belief systems
is very attenuated (because of the factors mentioned above) when
compared with the totalism of Western monotheistic religions.

Now, the subject you mention -- the fact of China's failure to have a
scientific or industrial revolution, despite being the pinnacle of human
civilization for most of the time since the Neolithic period -- is the
question that attracted me to sinology lo these many eons ago when I
first began studying Chinese language and culture.  Suffice it to say
that study of this question is one that has generated many different
answers (See Needham's colossal work, "Science and Civilization in
China", which was explicitly spawned by this question, and the work of
the scholar who is my intellectual godfather in this study, Karl
Wittfogel).  A study of Needham, especially, leads one to the conclusion
that the impact of "religious" ideas on the experience of technological
innovation in China was much more an epiphenomenon of underlying
physical and political realities than a cause of the lack of scientific
and technological progress.  This conclusion is buttressed by the fact
that there was a vital empirical tradition in China for thousands of
years.

I would pick B except for one thing, "a few minutes ago" is far too long for
my taste, I could tolerate a second and perhaps two but not much more. The
thing is if I picked B I don't want to have time to think "I'm about to be
vaporized and this is my last very thought" because that doesn't sound like
much fun, but that's just me. The trouble with your thought experiment is
that there is no wrong answer, it's just what you are comfortable with; I am
comfortable with changes where there is no way for me to know if it a
change had ever really happened or not. I'm curious, would you be
comfortable with "a few months ago" or "a few years ago"?

Got into this in a cloning, stem cell, and abortion discussion with my
Catholic parents. Mum is also in the medical field, so she's not
biologically ignorant either. She was under the assumption that you'd
be sharing a 'soul' with your clone, and was of the opinion that a
fetus gets its soul at the moment of conception, but I asked if twins
share a single soul. She said no, she didn't think so. I then asked if
a fetus split in two immediately after conception to produce twins, or
if it split x many cell divisions down the road from conception. She
said it happens later, not until some number of cell divisions occur. 

So I concluded that twins (and therefore the rest of us) couldn't get
their souls till at least x many cell divisions after conception. She
couldn't dispute this conclusion at all. I then said that this also
means that if stem cells are harvested prior to this x many cell
division point, then there would be no danger of souls getting in the
way of this operation. She agreed. I then said that if a fetus was
aborted prior to this x many cell divisions, then such an abortion
would not be murder.

This, I think, is the point at which pro-lifers, pro-choicers,
pro-cloners, and pro-stem cell researchers can share common ground.


Re: I wonder if it is possible for twins to share a soul at one point in
time. If so maybe it would explain some of the phenomena, or maybe there
brains just function on the same wave length.

Are you planning to live on this "remote land"?  If not..., somehow I 
don't think that after a large catastrophy land deeds will be worth 
much.  Not for a few decades, anyway (depending on the size of the 
catastropy).  Residence, however, would convey a large advantage.  So 
would not having a bunch of desperate neighbors (the big drawback agains 
preparation within a city).  In a city, any catastrophy that cuts the 
electricity and water for a week ...  doesn't matter how prepared *you* 
are, unless you have a *REALLY* good bunker, the fire will get you.  Or 
the mob.  Or both.  If the roads are cut, instead of water, then it will 
take a day or two longer.  But not much.

The cities aren't designed to survive catastrophies.  And if something 
massive happens, getting out is the only real option, if it's possible. 
 OTOH, on the average people live longer in cities, if they can afford 
the support services that are available.  This counts food, water, 
electicity, but it also counts the fire department and the police and 
the medics.  If I lived in the country, I might be dead from an infected 
leg.  First it was nothing, then within hours it headed towards 
gangrene.  Even with prompt access to an emergency room (seven hour 
wait, but only after triage had seen me) I was sick for a month.

A small town is probably the best trade-off, if you can find the right 
one, which includes being able to get along with the people who live 
there.  Problem is, they're boring!  And no place to earn a living.  And 
internet access tends to be ... limited.  (But some of them have cable 
systems, so this might [be changing/have changed].)

This is actually pretty straightforward.  Whenever it's feasible, you 
save over 30% by running as a single processor.  As you increase the 
number of processors, the overhead goes through the roof.  So you 
probably want to limit your cluster size to 8-16 processors to a 
cluster.  What you do to improve things at this point, is to give up on 
fine level forking, and instead chunk your clusters.  So you have O, 
8-16 clusters chunked into a node.  The clusters only transmit 
realtively high level inquiries and commands between themselves.  One of 
them is dedicated to extracting pieces large enough to practically 
parcel out to another cluster.  Etc.  This simple 8-16 way branching 
tree is an oversimplification, of course, but that's the basic approach. 
 Actually you will want to construct short-cuts between some clusters, 
and some clusters will dedicate themselves to message forwarding, etc. 
 (If you think about it, it's starting to look more and more like the 
way the brain is organized... I wonder why.)

The tricky part is the fine level details, and the software that can 
properly chunk and distribute problems.  I would bet that that software 
would need to be self-organizing, able to reconfigure itself to handle 
the various nodes that it ended up in, and able to determine the next 
goal to be addressed, and then act on it.  Conscious?  Intelligent?  I 
haven't heard good working definitions of those terms yet, so I don't know.

Notice that this description is given "as-if" the program is running on 
bare hardware.  I, personally, don't consider that a likely scenario.  I 
suspect that it will be running on top of a layer of one of the open 
source OS's.  Linux is a good choice, but there are others.  The HURD 
would be very interesting in this connection, if it finally gets ready. 
 Or it might be designed so that it could run on any POSIX system.  That 
would let it migrate easily.  But the version of the OS to follow is the 
embedded version, not the popular distributions.

Anyway, this architecture would allow modules to participate whether 
their connections to the rest were quick or slow, and whatever their 
level of computational capability.  But it might decide to give low 
priority to queries by nodes that didn't contribute much.  And I'm not 
quite sure how it would manifest a "sense of self".  It might well be 
partially dependant on the quality of sensory capability available at 
each node, as cognition doesn't seem to carry a "place" marker.  If so, 
this program would have a rather dispersed sense of self.  Possibly it 
would be similar to that which people feel for their family.  The parts 
would share most of their code, but many of their experiences would be 
different.  The distinction here is that it would be possible to make 
perfect copies of memories of experience from one node to another.  The 
question might be, but why?  The experiences of a baby-minder wouldn't 
have much relevance to an international telecommunications hub.  So they 
would grow apart.

Quite a bit of religion is certainly not about accepting one's 
current situation as divinely ordained.  Whether one agrees with 
the packaging or not, there is a strong push for transcendence 
of the status quo at the heart of many religions.  There are 
also twisted variants of most of them that put off real 
trancendence to the heareafter or one's next incarnation.

I don't think religion per se is an enemy.  I think human 
inertia and serious programming not to rock the boat is the real 
difficulty.  Sometimes that has a religious wrapping or 
rationalization but I believe it is a confusion to confuse the 
wrapping with the root problem.

Here we go again.  The old religion is for "weak people" line.

Actually, the highly intellectualized and rigid Imperial Chinese 
court grew more from Confucianism as I understand it.  Thousands 
of years ago?  No, I see little support for that.  Nor do I 
believe the above reflects real understanding of Taoism.

Samantha,
       I believe you replied to my discussion of Clare Graves Hierarchy of 
Values and how religion fits into that theory by showing me how religion 
actually operates on the first eight levels, approximately.
       As you may realise I listen to all discussion of religion in light of 
Graves Theory.  It seems to me that when I hear discussions or comments about 
religion on this list, religion is always narrowly analysed in light of level 
four religion with no recognition that other levels even exist.  As a result 
comments are made that are totally off the mark if applied to the rest of us.
       Would you like to comment?
Ron h.

Wow. Opinions taking from the convert-the-world-for-its-own-good 
arm of one religion about another religion ripping its bloodier 
quotes while ignoring one's own.  Impressive.  Read your Bible 
if you want to see war and violently repressive quotes. Mohammed 
as military general?  Only relatively briefly.  That is 
certainly not an accurate summation.

So, you believe the world has over a billion violent miltant 
religious fanatics?  Really?  Why would you believe that one 
religion manages to turn all of its followers into violent 
luddites when most of the religions have most of their adherents 
among those who do the minimal number of observances and take 
some social and existential comfort in their beliefs?  Something 
is very seriously out of kilter in the above equation.

Ever read the books of law in the Old Testament?  Hair-raising 
stuff that makes even sharia look mild.  Yet only a small 
minority  of Christians or Jews belive this would be a 
reasonable way to order a society.  Why should we believe it is 
different for Muslims?  Simply quoting from a religion's sacred 
writings is obviously inadequate.

You have far too little understand of religion if you believe 
greater intelligence will automatically be the end of it.

So true! The nineteenth century gets a lot of deserved credit (unprecedented
rise in living standards, abolition of slavery etc) but all that came as the
working out of social innovations from the 1715-1815 period. I think the
crucial thing about that period was a whole series of conceptual and
institutional breakthroughs (e.g. the very idea of "technology" - see what
Peter Drucker has to say about this.). Not to mention great cultural
achievements as well. Why did this happen though? I still think the
improvement in the weather had something to do with it, but IMHO the
critical thing was the crisis of religious belief that took place at the end
of the 17th century, one aspect of that being the revolutionary idea of ture
religious toleration.

I am inclined to agree with your earlier remark - "religion needs to 
go" - but only hesitantly.  I evaluate the majority of religions as 
harm-doers to the general public, but there'll always be the benign 
buddhism that's the exception to the rule.

As for the Quran, can you quote a specific passage that states infidels 
cannot be allowed to live so that I may look it up in my own copy?

I think it would depend entirely on whether I, the decision maker, would
experience a sense of subjective continuity under the self-vaporization
option. And I believe I would experience no such sense of continuity --
I will die if I choose B. As Eliezer pointed out, I might still choose B
as an act of self-sacrifice for the purpose of allowing someone like me
to pursue similar hopes and dreams. I might find such a decision
rewarding in itself, but I would not personally experience the
subsequent benefits of that altruistic act.

Think about his for yourself: while pondering your choice of A or B, ask
yourself if your identity truly equates to your frozen duplicate's
identity. If your answer is "yes" then why do you not also feel and
think nothing at this moment, as does your alleged duplicate in frozen
suspension? The answer seems obvious to me: you and your alleged
duplicate now exist as two separate people with two separate identities.
The word "duplicate" does not fit into the problem as so stated, except
in so much as it relates to the equality of outward physical
appearances. Your brain/mind exists in a state distinct from that of the
frozen person's brain/mind, making the word "duplicate" a misnomer. 

I can see no reason that your act of self-vaporization would make you
and your alleged duplicate into a single thawed-out person with a
continuous sense of self. Can anyone explain the mechanism by which one
individual's sense of self should pass to another individual upon the
death of the first individual? It seems to me that belief in such a
thing is tantamount to a belief in witchcraft.

Being sick and out of work today, I had time to dig around in the Koran 
myself...

FutureQ's posts on Islam got me thinking back to the last time I'd 
actually read the Koran - which was back in college when I had to 
translate certain chapters for my Arabic class.  The chapters I did 
translate seemed rather peaceful and focused on the goodness of Allah.

Going back to a translated copy of the book (N.J. Dagwood, 1955) I dug 
up some relevant passages.

From: The Slanderer
Traditional Chapter: 104
"Woe to all back-biting slanderers who amass riches and sedulously 
hoard them, thinking that their treasures will render them immortal."

(maybe i've been paying too close attention to eldred v. ashcroft, but 
i immediately wondered when a war would be raged against the riaa and 
mpaa... talk about cultural bias... :)

From: Ornaments of Gold
Traditional Chapter: 43
"Each apostle said: 'What if I bring you a religion more enlightened 
than your fathers'?'  But they replied: 'We deny the message with which 
you have been sent.'  So we took vengeance on them.  Consider the fate 
of those who disbelieved Our warning."

From: The Forgiving One
Traditional Chapter: 40
"Those that do evil shall be rewarded with evil; but those that have 
faith and do good works, both men and women, shall enter the gardens of 
Paradise and receive blessings without number."

(of course, evil is subjective - but it's interesting to see men and 
women receiving equal treatment, no?)

From: The Creator
Traditional Chapter: 35
"But those that plot evil shall be sternly punished; He will bring 
their plots to nothing."

From: The Creator
Traditional Chapter: 35
"As for the unbelievers, the fire of Hell awaits them.  Death shall not 
deliver them, nor shall its torment be ever lightened for them.  Thus 
shall the thankless be rewarded."

(the last two were rather vague - not in intents, but in methods.  If 
Death shall not deliver, what's the point of killing?  Of course, it's 
all in the interpretation)

From: Al-Furqan
Traditional Chapter: 25
"Never have We destroyed a nation whom We did not warn and admonish 
beforehand.  We are never unjust."

From: Exile
Traditional Chapter: 59
"Allah does not forbid you to be kind and equitable to those who have 
neither made war on your religion nor driven you from your homes.  
Allah loves the equitable.  But He forbids you to make friends with 
those who have fought against you on account of your religion and 
driven you from your homes or abetted others to do so."


...and on that note I think I'll stop.

These quotes were found from previously underlined passages and margin 
notes.  The point being, I don't believe there's a quote in the Koran 
that states "find non-believers and kill them" - but like any set of 
written rules, it's all in the interpretation and implementation.

I do agree with some of your counter arguments, but
lets not ignore the growing threats to the West in
general.  There is increasing evidence that China and
Russian are the real threats behind everything going
on right now.  Their financial and armament ties to
islamic fundamentalist cannot be ignored.  Their is
growing evidence that Russia and China are the
suppliers of "red mercury" and tactical nukes to
islamic terrorists.

Several analyst strongly suggest that the cold war
never really ended, and in fact we are seeing is a
very well thought out long-term strategy by both
Russia and China (now "friends") to destabilize the
Western Economic stability.  There is no doubt that
the global financial markets are on the verge of
collopse.   Derrivatives brokers are worried that one
little mistake on their part and the whole damn thing
will come down.

Who can doubt that all it would take is a single
suit-case nuke going off in the US to totally collopse
the already fragile economy?  Nevermine the political
fall out from such a nightmare.  Say goodbye to civil
liberties for starters.  There is now growing evidence
that "red mercury" nukes have been developed which
enable 2 megaton bombs to be the size of baseballs. 
Imagine if several of these went off in the US. 
Perhaps there was more truth when the Al Qaeda says
that soon, "America will be gone".  They did not say
"Ameriac will collopse" or "America will be
destroyed", but "America will be gone".  Could they
already have suit-case nukes in the US ready to go
off?

And of course there is the looming wat with Iraq, and
the grave possibility of Israel launching nukes in
retaliation for what Iraq might do.  Imagine the
radiacl increase in terrorism in the coming years if
nukes are used against a muslim state.

The Third World War may have already started, and what
we are seeing now are the beginning moves on both
sides.  Either way, I don't see a lot of truth coming
out of Washington.  Why all the smoke and mirrors? 
what the hell are they hiding?

Greg,

You clearly know more about this than I do. I was going on what I learned
watching James Burke's "Connections". Probably a simplified version for
quick delivery.

Since many of you will probably not take the time to read this,
I'll give you the gist of my read of the first couple of chapters.

1) It is a *really* good thing that the cold war is over and we
   are slowly dismantling its machinery.  Especially given the
   fact that the report doesn't do a worst case analysis of what
   was possible using the technology that was developed:
     http://www.thebulletin.org/research/qanda/bombsize.html
   The WTC event was a nonevent compared with a single large
   (weapons class, e.g. > 1 MT) nuclear bomb explosion.

2) Surprisingly, the harm likely to be caused by ~ kilo-ton sized
   weapons (those most likely to be obtained by terrorists) is not
   as bad as I thought it might be.  Its still bad -- but not
   anywhere near as bad as that produced by the MAD strategy.
   The U.S. could probably withstand a terrorist class event
   (perhaps even several of them) without the development
   vector taking a significant hit.

Of course the URL mentioned pointing out the fact that ~11 kg of
plutonium is the minimum required for a critical mass does raise
the interesting question of whether one could come up with a
smaller nuclear weapon if one used a more radioactive material?

Speaking as "a materialist", I would have no problem with being duplicated
and having the original immediately destroyed in the process.  This would be
the case with a Star Trek-type transporter for example.  Note that by
"immediately", I mean that there is no time for the two instantiations of
myself to begin to diverge in conciousness.

On the other hand, if two copies of myself are allowed to diverge, then each
of them is going to have a strong vested interest in self-preservation and
each will protest and protect themselves from being destroyed.  There is no
mystery or higher meaning in this.  That's the way we are -- built with self
preservation as one of our strongest drives.  Much stronger, in most cases,
than altruism, even with a $10M enhancement to the survivor.

It's interesting that if the two did begin to diverge, no matter how
briefly, then my morals would dictate that each then has an equal right to
exist and each should receive full protection.  If society decided
otherwise, then that same reasoning could be used to jeapordize other
individual rights that we consider valuable.

I wasn't referring to any other religion here but Taoism. You seem to feel it
necessary to appologize for all religion period. It falls upon deaf ears here. I
have studied several and when weighing the good they do with the bad they do the
bad has it hands down every time. We'll be far better off without it and that day
will come.

You are certainly intitled to your opinion and I to mine. I'll take reality over
false hope.

And how is religion not empowering this inertia? It's always the crutch to fall
back upon, the justification for misdeeds. Can you really deny that belief in an
afterlife impedes life affirming science, medicine and peace?

An atheist must stand upon ones own strengths. If that is not strength than what
is it? The opposite of strength is weakness. An inabilty to take responsibility
for ones own life and actions, to me, is weakness. If not to you then call it how
you like. For me going from xian to atheist was a struggle and took some decided
strength of character and will. Much easier to have kept the crutch.

And Taoism had no influence on Confucius? How confusing. To witt, I quote,
"Taoism is a Chinese philosophy that first began, scholars believe, sometime
around the time of Confucius, perhaps the most infamous Chinese philosopher, who
lived around the years 500 to 600 B.C.E.". Available here:

Since I just made a post in response to the report that

Classical "Suit-case" nukes are ~0.1 kt devices and would
not do enough damage to bring down the economy.

Can we have some evidence here?  What is this "red mercury"
stuff?  (I know I've heard the phrase before but I'm
unfamiliar with any physics that makes it reasonable
that you can get a 2 MT bomb the size of a baseball.)

I strongly doubt this is going to happen.  I'm fairly certain
at this point that 150+ years is going to require gene therapies
that augment or rewrite the genome.  I don't believe drug cocktails
are going to cut the mustard.

Fortunately, I'd say such technologies are within our 20-30 year grasp.

I'm not sure I understand the question.  It seems fairly certain at
this point that telomeres are an "add-on" to the human genomic program
that is one of several anti-cancer strategies our cells use.

There are a couple of components -- you need the RNA component and
the telomerase enzyme.  Sierra Sciences is working on being able to
extend the telomeres in your normal cells (of course this might
increase cancer rates -- so we have to solve that problem as well).

For women yes, but I don't know if the case is as strong for men.
As we have recently seen -- hormone replacements may entail
increased cancer risks.

The evolutionary biology of aging says its going to involve multiple
systems.  Its not going to be just one thing and there isn't going
to be a single magic bullet.  We have to tackle and solve the problems
one by one.  We understand heart disease pretty well and are getting
a good handle on cancer.  I expect a lot of progress in this decade
on many of the other aging-related diseases as well.

Actually, I seem to recall that there are different classes of

If you think Europeans haven't been targeted by Islamist terrorists
in recent years, then you either haven't followed the news or the
navel-gazing American media have ignored it.

Earlier this year, an attack on a synagogue on Djerba (Tunesia)
killed a score of mostly German tourists, and a dozen French were
blown up in Karachi.  A couple of years back there was a bombing
campaign in Paris, the Russians have suffered from Chechen terrorists,
and there have been attacks on tourists in Egypt.  Oh, and although
the final numbers aren't in yet, a bunch of Europeans have been
killed and wounded on Bali, too.

And of course Europe has suffered from internal terrorism at a time
when Americans still considered this a purely foreign problem.

Folks,

There has been a discussion surrounding the identity 
continuity problem (with Subject: duck me.)  Emlyn 
wonders about being able to measure or objectively 
observe the subjective of other minds.  And gts wonders 
about the subjective continuity between the original 
and the xox.

I think we will soon discover what the subjective 
properties of our mind are, which will lead to effing, 
objectivily measuring the subjective qualities of other 
minds, subjective continuity between original and copy 
or upload and a bunch of other cool stuff.

Ive attempted to describe what this effing, measuring 
the subjective of other minds will be like and 
how subjective continuity will be possible in a short 
story entitled 1229 Years After Titanic.  The effing 
and uploading ideas are described in 2 of the short 
chapters (6  Expanding Spirit Worlds, and 7  Sharing 
spirit worlds; one need not read the entire story to get 
the ideas.)  This short story is available here: 
<http://home.attbi.com/~brent.allsop>.

Id love to hear peoples thoughts about this.  Wouldnt 
this kind of subjective continuity and ability to 
observ/subjectively expeirence other minds resolve any 
issue even the most spiritual of persons might have 
about being uploaded onto a new platform?

Unfortunately I can't take the time to participate in long, drawn out
debates with regard to the multitude of issues raised by these two posts, so
I'll toss out a few ideas of my own and then retreat to let others consider
and/or counter them if they so choose.

I read the article specified above, and while it did raise a few points I
hadn't considered before, I found it sloppy from a point of formal argument.

In reference to Pascal's Wager, the author quotes Blaise Pascal as
saying/writing: "Reason can decide nothing here...According to reason, you
can defend neither of the propositions."

The author then states: ". . . Secondly, the argument is not really an
argument at all, but rather a crude attempt to psychologically manipulate
people. Although Pascal doesn't specifically mention hell, it is strongly
implied in his argument."

and "The third point is that Pascal is guilty of religious ethnocentrism, of
seeing the position only through his own biased Catholic eyes. Apparently,
he never met anyone who wasn't a Catholic. . ."

The sloppiness that jumps out at me stems from the fact that Pascal is never
specifically quoted as including Catholicism as a key element of his wager.
Maybe he does (??) but then at least quote it if you're going to
systematically attack it.

Next the author says:

"Which leads us to the question of why this allegedly all-powerful Supreme
Being would allow so much confusion to occur. If he wants the best for us,
his children, then he should make his demands known in a clear, unequivocal
way. There should therefore be only ONE church. If god exists and if he or
she had done this, then perhaps there might be some validity to Pascal's
Wager."

For a compellingly logical paper that answers some of these points see:
http://www.markalanwalker.com/evil.htm


The author then says: "In addition, Pascal's conclusion does not logically
follow his premise. There is much to lose here, including our self-respect,
our intellectual integrity, and self-esteem. If we throw all this away for
an imaginary "next life," instead of losing nothing, as Pascal claims, we
lose everything!"

Ok, but I know many religious people who seem to display considerable self
respect. And not all people's values stem from intellectual integrity, (Is
that good or bad? I dunno, but it's a different argument for sure) As for
self-esteem, well that assertion seems way off the mark. But even if true,
check out this new study that hints that some of us could use a little less
self-esteem.
http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2002-07/uog-ncb072602.php

Now on to what FutureQ wrote.

"belief causes people to believe exploiting the earth is their god given
right
which may lead to environmental destruction"

Come, come now my fellow transhumanist; and I too am an atheist by the way.
Every time you open your nostrils to suck air into your lungs, you are
exploiting the earth. It's all a matter of degree, and it's exceedingly hard
to find two people who agree on just how much exploitation is too much.

You write: "belief causes people to justify war, prejudice, hate and
genocide"

Well I suppose that *we believe* Saddam is a bugger and a threat, so that
belief justifies war and thus by default prejudice (i.e. us good, them bad).
But I don't suppose anyone is claiming we should hate the Iraqis in this
case. As for genocide, granted that seems to be generally confined to
zealotry - except wasn't Hitler's Nazi Germany somewhat secular? I guess we
might transpose the fatherland for god though.

You write: "belief in god and an afterlife causes people to cheapen the
value of life leading to sending their young to war and stifling research
into medicine"

Maybe, but you glom too many things together here. Cheapening the value of
life may be a good tactic for sending the young off to war and I won't argue
that religion sometimes takes this tack, but war clearly benefits medical
research in many cases - i.e. Hey, these guys keep dying when we saw their
wounded legs off, now what on earth might be causing that? Or - if someone
drops biological weapons on our guys (and gals) how can we protect them from
harm?

Just my 2 cents

Kings and solar cycles are trivial stuff compared with what happened in
1687, in that year Sir Isaac Newton an obnoxious unfriendly man but probably
the greatest genius the human race has so far managed to produce published
"Philosophia Naturalis Principia Mathematica". The next milestone you could
claim for Homo Sapiens was in 1800 right on the dot because that's when
Alessandro Volta invented the electric battery making it far easy for anyone
to experiment with electricity and magnetism. The next milestone could be
claimed for 1900, also on the dot because that's when Plank discovered the
quantum.

The argument is that "your" (past) sense of self passed into the duplicate
*ahead* of time, as the duplicate was made...  the confusion here has to
do with the use of the indexical pronouns "I" and "you", especially as it
refers to the present, or the past, or the whole history.

Allow me to suggest a formalism for a moment: to say that any given
something exists is to say that there exists an X which has the relevant
property that defines that something.  Thus, "there's something red" would
be written:  \exists(x): red(x).  Standard Russell.

OK.  Well, extend this to personal existence.  "I exist" would be
re-written as: \exists(x): me(x).  There's some X which has the "me"
property.

Now suppose you split into two.  I'd argue that both of the split persons
have your property me(), *where me() is the property you had when you were
one person.*

However, they now also each have their own indexical property that was
co-extensive with me() when there was only one person: one split has
me[1](), the other has me[2]().  You *were* me[1]() as well as me[2]().
Now, each split is one or the other, and not both.

Now, as you point out, when when the Nth split talks and thinks about
himself in the present, he'll be thinking about the property me[N](), not
the original property me().  That's as may be, but there's something
interesting about me[N+1](), even if you're just the Nth split; it's not
merely the case that you're "very similar", but you used to be the same
person.

That person me(), who both of you used to be, will survive so long as at
least one me[N]() property continues.  So when any Nth split thinks about
the person he was in the past, he'll think about me()... for example, all
splits will remember being the same person, etc.

We can make time-indexed synonyms from the perspective of the Nth split:
me[now]() is synonymous with me[N](), and me[past]() is synonymous with
me(), the original property.  And then what you notice is this:

  If I push that button, me[now]() will die, but me[past]() will survive.

This is an extraordinary situation in which to find yourself; if you're at
all like me, you have no relevant moral intuitions with which to settle
this matter.  I'm used to the idea that I should try to keep me() alive,
and I'm not at all used to the idea that me[now] might die while me[past]
might live.  I want them both to live, I guess, but if one goes, it's not
obvious to what degree "I" have lost anything.

If you want to reject this notion, you'll have to give some kind account
of why I would pay more attention to one or the other: why I'd pay
attention to me[now]() over me[past](), *or vice versa*.

Certainly, if you think that me[now]() is the only interesting property,
[perhaps because "I" is automatically present tense?] then you'll reject
the claim that "you will survive the vaporization."  Similarly, if you
think that me[past]() is the only interesting property, [perhaps because
we are defined by our memories?] you'll accept the claim.  But I see no
sense in "picking" one over the other: I am both me[now] and me[past].

It just makes no sense to say "I will/will not survive the vaparization"
without specifying whether what is meant is me[now] or me[past], in much
the same way that it doesn't make sense to say that my car is 10 long,
without specifying units.  Conversationally, we can get in the habit of
choosing one or the other, but morally, neither seems to be any less
interesting than the other.

Not much comment accept that I very much agree and look at it 
similarly.  I also think levels 2-4 are often considered to be 
all religion is about rather than only level 4.

Imo the 'growing evidence' would seem to imply red mercury was an urban

reddish liquid/semisolid, created by irradiation of mercury in an 
accelerator. It's supposed to be a neutron reflector/multiplier.

I'm also pretty much unfamiliar with the physics as well. Until evidence 
is presented, I'm sticking with the 'hoax' hypothesis.

I do, for one.  A "suitcase" nuke would do little more
damage than 911, and have about the same effect on the
economy (not insignificant, but certainly not major).

Yes, I agree. Anything less than an instantaneous destructive
duplication would result in two distinct individuals. 

To be genuine, a destructive teleportation would need to occupy no more
time than the smallest meaningful division of time. This would be the
time required for a photon to traverse one Planck length: 10 -43
seconds.

You seem to feel it necessary, judging form your having done so, 
to attack all religion period.  That is unnecessary and actually 
loses credibility imo.  I disagree strongly that we will ever be 
without some aspects of spirituality/religion. Although I do 
fervently hope that the majority of sentients will get beyond 
their rather limited understanding and practice of today in 
these matters to the extent religion/spirituality is part of 
their lives.

Many things are used as a rationalization for this inertia. 
That does not mean any of them are the cause or that removing 
any of them will remove the inertia.

I see no logical necessity that belief in an afterlife should 
impede life affirming science or medicine.  Much has been done 
for peace by religious people and religious memes just has much 
has been rationalized under the rubric of religion.  So I don't 
believe religion per se impedes peace.  What does impede peace 
is a belief that one has the truth, the whole (or sufficient) 
truth and that those who think sufficiently differently are a 
dangerous threat at best and should either be converted or 
destroyed at worse.  Relgion has no monopoly on that sort of 
opinion or the highly unpeaceful and inhumane actions that often 
grow out of it.

Strength does not need to denigrate others who believe 
differently.  Strength does not need to puff itself up. Strength 
is needed whenever one stands on one's own judgment in the face 
of significant others who believe differently and in the face of 
what one would prefer to be so versus what to the best of one's 
ability actually does appear to be true.  Atheists have no 
monopoly on strength.  Religious people are not known to be 
missing such strength.

I do acknowledge the strength your struggle (as well as that of 
others and my own) required.  But that by no means implies that 
those who hold different conclusions are "weak".

Taoism is actually much older from my understanding.  But I bow

I believe when push comes to shove, that those that believe strictly in their Quran or
Bible or Torah for that matter and cannot think for themselves--however many that may
be, would become violent. History proves it.

I don't cut any religion or religious tome any slack. I'm the first to cite the bible
for it's genocidal verses and much much more. I think though your comment is confused
by the fact you thought the above quoted text from William belonged to me which it
does not.

Funny then how many Moslems have no compunction with violence. Is it religion or
culture? A mixture of both? Which or both are responsible for the archaic notions that
it's manly to kill and devour ones enemies? Did you even read the Howard Bloom
article? Here's a quote.

"Man's greatest good fortune is to chase and defeat his enemy, seize his total
possessions, leave his married women weeping and wailing, ride his gelding (and) use
the bodies of his women as a nightshirt and support." Genghis Khan

"He butchered three of them with an ax and decapitated them.  In other words, instead
of using a gun to kill them he took a hatchet to chop their heads off.  He struggled
face to face with one of them, and throwing down his ax managed to break his neck and
devour his flesh in front of his comrades.  ...I ...award him the Medal of the
Republic." General Mustafa Tlas, Syria's Minister of Defense praising a hero of the
1973 war with Israel before the Syrian National Assembly

"Appeasing of governments which revel in slaughter is an invitation to worldwide
catastrophe." Fang Lizhi" From Howard Bloom's article found here
http://www.howardbloom.net/islam.htm.

Hair raising enough for you?

> Why should we believe it is
> different for Muslims?

See the above. It's about a culture of violence fed upon a religion that reveres it
also. Each feed upon the other. Perhaps you feel it is ok for them to have schools
that specifically teach hatred of infidels and little else? No science, no art, no
trade, just hate and kill infidels to show your love for allah. Oh yeah that's a good
thing.

Nah, I just think that if people really read what they are supposed to be believing
and also had enough science education to weigh against it they would chose reason over
faith. The fellow that made this website to follow has gathered some of the most
repugnant verses of several religions.

After reading these how can the rational mind not toss religon on the dust bin of
history?

As far as I can find, there is no such thing as "red mercury" 
except for in the world of computer games, alchemy and a perhaps 
a record label.  There is no information I have been able to 
find that says "red mercury" as a uber-weapon material is 
anything more than a wild rumor.  If you have information it is 
real then please present it.  Otherwise I would suggest dropping 
it as it lowers the quality of the other points you make.

Why should we be that afraid of tactical nukes?  Where is this 
evidence that terrorists have these nukes?  So far there has 
been none forthcoming.  Why the scare tactics with lack of evidence?

Analysts or conspiracy theorists?  Why exactly would it be at 
the moment in the interest of either country to do this?  China 
is being brought on board the gravy train fairly rapidly by the 
West.  There is no evidence that terrorism is the reason that 
global financial markets are so shaky.  Look to unsound 
economics, levels of innovation and change the markets and 
economic theories where never set up to handle,  and greed far 
beyond the bounds of what is healthy and unrestrained by any 
ethics or longterm thinking to explain the state of markets.

Many things "could" be.  But I can't see the point in having

The impending war against Iraq is a fundamental danger to

Aha, I answered my own question (or the great Google did
but I typed it in...):

Red Mercury seems to be an urban legend without much
substance to it:

http://www.eng-tips.com/gviewthread.cfm/lev2/19/lev3/64/pid/466/qid/26894

Interestingly it does beg an answer to my earlier question
as to whether there is a material other than U-235 or Pu-239
that can make a nuclear weapon with less material. U-235
decays releasing an alpha particle with ~4.7 MeV while
Pu-239 decays with an alpha particle with 5.2 MeV. Other
isotopes like Am-241;-2433 (alpha, 5.4-6 MeV) and Cm-242/3/4/5/6/7,
alpha, 5.3-6.2 MeV) would seem to be likely candidates.

Some of those isotopes seem to be much nicer choices as they
have half lives in the days to years time frame rather than
the tens of thousands to millions of years.  So I suspect
they would go "poof" with quite a bit less material involved.

Anyone enough of a nuclear engineer to know what the critical
parameters are?  Is it rate of alpha particle production?
Or perhaps neutron capture rates (thermal neutron cross section???).
Also -- nuclear reactions as I was taught them were based on
an exponential rate in the increase of neutron production
(alpha particles shouldn't be able to enter a nucleus) --
how does the release of an alpha particle get translated into
neutrons? (Does the alpha particle itself decay very quickly?).

Possible post-of-the month.  Anders recent pointer had perhaps more
information density and Damien's recent post (perhaps even several
of them) more literary quality.  But Russell may have just hit the
right note with informed opinion, content and references to back it up.

All IMO.

Of course in the end they too are going to get their comeuppance when they
find out that the Roman Empire never actually collapsed and that the whole
thing was just are really, really long-term and well though out strategy to
propagate the necessary social and technological conditions for the
establishment of the enlightenment, capitalism, and ultimately molecular

Also, carry a handkerchief. If you take more than a few minutes to
escape the aircraft, you will need more air than is in the bag. Tie the
bag tight around your head just below your nose, so you can see and
rebreath fine. Piss on the handkerchief, place it over your mouth, and
breath through it. The piss removes the toxins in the air (this was the
basis of the original 'duck head' French gas masks of WWI).

Ok, that at least makes it "plausible" but we need a *lot* more
evidence to move it into the "probable" catagory.

A neutron reflector seems very unlikely -- a neutron multiplier
might be feasible (at least given my very limited knowledge of
nuclear physics).

The question would be whether there exist decay paths that tend
to rapidly produce an ever increasing number of neutron producing
decays (begs the question of how an alpha decay produces neutrons
that I posed in another thread).

Robert

Can I get some side bets here as to how high on the FBI/CIA watch
list this thread is taking us?

Methinks this is unfair and inaccurate. Taoism is the way of infinite
change.
Rocketry and world conquest are probably undesirable ambitions, and space
colonisation is an expensive pipe-dream.

Transhumanism is long over by the way .... the Industrial Revolution
singularity
which brought about the transhuman-era ended with the solution to
Schopenhauer's
World-Knot (the M-B Problem) back in the 1980's ... and us Posthumans
emerged
20 or so years ago following this 200 year long transition phase.

I currently live in a small town (pop 13k) which is the core of an area
with a pop of about 100,000 within 30 miles radius. It's been ranked
the 2nd most livable small town in the US a couple years ago, and high
bandwidth access is available, if you are in the right location. Cable
internet is coming in next year. It's currently available 20 miles to
the south of us. The town immediately north of us, Hanover, was just
featured in Wired for its college, Dartmouth, having a campuswide
wireless network (the article is recommended reading), and since so
many Dartmouth students live in my town, Lebanon, I've been thinking
that it might be profitable to launch a wireless network here as well.

Yes interpretation aaaand who's doing it. It may be more informative to
listen to the latest prophet. From Bloom's article.
[begin quote]
However, Allah issues many a darker order as well.  And the percentage of
modern Islamic adherents who have focused on Allah's calls to combat is
dismaying.  Today, the descendants of the Persians who fought the Greeks in
480 BC are devout Moslems.  In the '30s, one of them labored diligently to
become an Islamic scholar.  He pored over the Koran for years.  As he
demonstrated his superior knowledge of Allah's pronouncements, he rose in
the ranks of Iranian holy men.  Finally he achieved the penultimate
title--ayatollah (roughly equivalent to a Catholic cardinal).

His name was Ruhollah Khomeini, and he wrote books, pamphlets, and even
taped and distributed his speeches to inspire the citizens of Iran with
sacred virtue.  The ayatollah's words roused Iranians to overthrow the shah
and usher in a government based on strict Islamic doctrine.  What did the
ayatollah's pronouncements say- Among other things, that infidels are like
dogs.  Their existence is an affront to Allah.

Here's how the ayatollah himself put it: "...Moslems have no
alternative...  to an armed holy war against profane governments.  ...Holy
war means the conquest of all non-Moslem territories.  ...It will ...be the
duty of every able-bodied adult male to volunteer for this war of conquest,
the final aim of which is to put Koranic law in power from one end of the
earth to the other.  "The leaders of the USSR and of England and the
president of the United States are ...infidels....
...Every part of the body of a non-Moslem individual is impure, even the
hair on his head and his body hair, his nails, and all the secretions of
his body.  Any man or woman who denies the existence of God, or believes in
His partners [the Christian Trinity], or else does not believe in His
Prophet Mohammed, is impure (in the same way as are excrement, urine, dog,
and wine)[sic]."

Concluded the Ayatollah, "Islam does not allow peace between...  a Moslem
and an infidel." Though many of us imagine that the promotion of harmony is
a prime objective of every major world faith, the ayatollah disagreed.
"The leaders of our religion were all soldiers, commanders and warriors,"
he wrote, "...they killed and they were killed."

The concept of a peaceful prophet was so alien to the ayatollah that he was
convinced Christ's message had been deliberately distorted by Westerners.
Said Khomeini, "This idea of turning the other cheek has been wrongly
attributed to Jesus (peace be unto him); it is those barbaric imperialists
that have attributed it to him.  Jesus was a prophet, and no prophet can be
so illogical."

Khomeini's dicta may seem irrelevant now that he has long been dead, but
his words have actually gained in influence since his demise.  Early in the
'90s, Iraq's humiliation in the Gulf War undermined the credibility of the
secular Moslem regimes, leaving a power vacuum into which Fundamentalism
leaped.  There are currently roughly one 100,000,000 Islamic
fundamentalists (rechristened "Islamic revivalists" by some scholars ).

Activists among them, employing the slogan "Africa for Islam," are making
diligent--and often violent--efforts to seize power in numerous sub-Saharan
states.  They have gained sufficient favor with South Africa's ANC that
Nelson Mandela, in a 1992 visit to Teheran, told the Iranians that Africa
must be reshaped along the lines of the Iranian revolution.(Ironically,
when South African leader Bishop Desmond Tutu gave a speech to a
Palestinian crowd in 1989 lauding Palestinian interests, he failed to
realize that the Arabic banners carried by his listeners read "On Saturday
We Will Kill the Jews, on Sunday We Will Kill the Christians!")

Khomeini's works advocate vigorously converting or murdering all those who
do not embrace Allah's holy meme.  Then they urge a holy war on the nations
of the West.

The ayatollah wrote, "Any nonreligious [i.e.  non-Islamic] power, whatever
form or shape, is necessarily an atheistic power, the tool of Satan; it is
part of our duty to stand in its path and to struggle against its effects.
Such Satanic power can engender nothing but corruption on earth, the
supreme evil which must be pitilessly fought and rooted out.  To achieve
that end, we have no recourse other than to overthrow all governments that
do not rest on pure Islamic principles, and are thus corrupt and
corrupting, and to tear down the traitorous, rotten, unjust, and tyrannical
administrative systems that serve them....  If Islamic civilization had
governed the West, we would no longer have to put up with these barbaric
goings-on unworthy even of wild animals....[Western governments are] using
inhuman laws and inhuman political methods...  Misdeeds must be punished by
the law of retaliation: cut off the hands of the thief; kill the murderer
instead of putting him in prison; flog the adulterous woman or man.  Your
concerns, your 'humanitarian' scruples, are more childish than reasonable."

Khomeini had a prescription for such problems: "All of humanity must strike
these troublemakers [the governments of the West] with an iron hand....
Islam has obliterated many tribes because they were sources of corruption
[i.e.  sources of non-Islamic influence]...." Judging from the Ayatollah's
rhetoric, the next tribes he would have liked to see obliterated were those
in Europe and America.

Allah is rapidly providing Khomeini's followers with a sword to carry out
their master's wishes.  He has offered Islam the fire in which the Koran
says those who follow false faiths are destined to burn: nuclear weaponry.
He has also provided the long range missiles needed to use it.  According
to the late imam's logic, there may be only one just and righteous thing to
do: employ this technology to wipe out recalcitrant heathens like you and
me.

Keep in mind that it was not only steel providing structural support.
The structure also involved the use of pre-stressed concrete.
Temperatures such as you cite would quite readily decompose the
concrete polymer back into quicklime, thus destroying any structural
support it provided.

Yes, and there were many vehicles in underground parking, as well as
gas lines ruptured, filling collapsed spaces with gasses that were
heated and erupted explosively when exposed to the air.

Incorrect. The structure of the towers were primarily in the many
vertical members seen in the outer facade, which you'd have known if
you'd seen any of the many documentaries on the construction of the
towers broadcast in the last year (esp on the History and Discovery
channels).
Thus, the impact of the airliners damaged much of the structural
supports, and the resulting fire weakened those remaining. Once that
single collapse occured, the impact on lower floors exceeded their
standard load capacity.

A building is inclined by gravity to do so under any circumstances. If
you look at an intentionally imploded building with the WTC, you'd see
that WTC wreckage was spread over several blocks from the actual
footprint of the towers, while intentionally imploded buildings will
collapse all material into their own basements whilst leaving
neighboring buildings untouched.

The hijackers were identified by security video camera footage, not by
passports. The passports merely confirmed identities already surmised.

FLight data recorders are in the tail of the aircraft, and so would
remain in the building to be crushed and torched. The passports were on
the persons of the hijackers, which being in the cockpits and first
class areas, were ejected through the buildings to the sides opposite
the impact points, thus the passports escaped the fires. In fact, we
have nine of the hijackers bodies in storage right now, with no idea of
what to do with them, as their home countries and families have not
claimed them, partly because they don't want to publicly admit that the
events were actually caused by their own people and not by Jews under
Mossad orders, as is popularly believed and propagandized in the muslim
world and by dupable fools in the west.

I was paraphrasing what Howard Bloom wrote here.
http://www.howardbloom.net/islam.htm

I believe he interpreted the following, which is at the bottom of his
article in the referrences as meaning this. I trust if he wrote it into a
book it has the meaning he attributed to it.

[begin quote]
. Said Mohammed, "I have bequeathed to you that which will always be a
guide to you, if you will take hold of it; the Book of God and the
practices of my life." This saying and its implications have been critical
in the development of Islam. (Mohammed Heikal, The Return of the Ayatollah,
p. 80.)
. "I will instill terror into the hearts of the unbelievers: smite ye above
their necks and smite all their finger-tips off them. The Qu'ran,
downloaded from America Online's "Islam Library," original upload 1996,
"Al-Anfal"--sura 12.
"...And slay them wherever ye catch them...." The Qu'ran, "Al-Baqara"--sura
191.

Exactly! That's just how I perceive it. I'd have to sense continuity and to

won't. Don't point that thing at me!

Carey Sublette is the internet nuclear weapons guru.  His FAQ is in many
places, this is the most recent version I could find quickly:

http://nuketesting.enviroweb.org/hew/Nwfaq/Nfaq0.html

The materials section will answer your question in detail.  The short
answer is that there is no weapon material with appreciably smaller
critical mass than plutonium:

http://nuketesting.enviroweb.org/hew/Nwfaq/Nfaq6.html

Radioactive decay has no bearing on weapons use, other than high activity
is detrimental to design due to cooling issues for weapons in storage and
transit and high neutron activity causes predetonation.  Relatively stable
materials are preferred.

The Federation of American Scientists used to host the FAQ, but dropped it
after 9/11.  What respect I had for the organization went with it.

As demonstrated in a previous list posting on using Americium in
spacecraft propulsion, it is highly unstable, with criticality masses
in the fraction of a gram level, as I recall. To make a bomb, you'd
have to have small amounts of Americium embedded within small BB type
shells of frangible neutron mediating material. Use a conventional
explosive to fragment the shells, thus exposing the Americium cores to
each other and reaching supercritical levels. Scale the amount of
Americium used to the kiloton yield desired. Beware of rapid
decomposition of the Am material, given it's short half life, your bomb
would quickly go stale and inert. THis might be useful from a land mine
application, where you'd want your mines to go inert after a set
period, though this is just for the nuclear stage of the explosive. THe
chemical explosive would remain volatile, though I imagine that in such
a case, the inert BB's would then be useful for shrapnel as in a
standard US Claymore type mine. 
If you have an automatic expiration circuit built in, you could have
the mine self detonate after the Am stage has gone inert.

I think you know what I meant. There is a difference between exploitation and
use. I could have added more adjectives such as "wanton exploitation" but I
figured everyone here could figure out my meaning with fewer glam words.

You have the religious right wing wackos aligning with the
screw-the-environementalist-tree-huggers repubs, neither group well educated,
and all voting to keep on, ahem 'wantonly', 'blindly', disregarding their
childrens future--ly' exploiting. Oh and why not?! After all GAWD is coming

I don't hate the Iraqis... not for their ignorance nor their religion or lack
thereof, nor do I advocate it. It's unfortunate they don't seem capable of
uprooting the guy that will cause them so much grief.

Hitler was not secular. See here.
http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/william_edelen/religionviolence.html

[begin quote]
Hitler had religion and wanted more of it for Germany. He was a Roman Catholic
and was confirmed as a "soldier of Christ" in that church. He was steeped in its
liturgy. Hatred of the Jews was promoted in Germany by Catholics and Lutherans.
In his book MEIN KAMPF Hitler wrote: "I am completely convinced that I am acting
as the agent of God. I am now a Catholic and will always remain so." [end quote]

I suppose we should have more war to ramp up the research engine toward
immortality then? Some will die so others may live... hmmm, sounds familiar
somehow. Pardon my tease. Again you knew full well what I meant. But next time I
will separate things better even if it means repeating something and more typing
for me more reading for others.

More precisely I meant the same attitude, "Why worry? GAWD is coming/has heaven
waiting/will cure you/is against this science stuff.", prevails in stiffling
medical research. I happen to need stem cell research to both walk and to escape
diabetes. I'm none to happy that religious folks are against such research on
purely ignorant reasons. Suffer me not the good intentions of fools!

I think neither of us have moral intuitions to settle the matter as you
see it. But I think you see it wrongly. :)

In our example there are two instantiations of me[past]! One of them is
a subset of me in the frozen state and one is a subset of me in the
active state in which I'm pondering the vaporization questions. I can
eliminate either instantiation of me[past] without eliminating me[past]
or me[now]. Me[past] dies only if the frozen person and I both die.
Me[now] dies only if I die.

Yes, that is exactly why me[now] is the only interesting property. I am
not who I was at that time in the past at which that rascal Lee Corbin
xoxed me and zapped my duplicate with a freeze gun. I am who I am at
this present moment. 

The killing of the frozen copy of me from the past will not eliminate my
past identity nor will it eliminate my current identity. But the killing
of my current identity will surely eliminate my current identity even if
my past identity survives.

Quite. The problem in actuality is that it is our own leadership which
no longer has the intestinal fortitude to engage a cold war. It takes
two to tango, and it was we who chose to refuse to trade with the
Warsaw Pact as the lines were demarcated so eloquently by Churchill in
his Iron Curtain speech, and emphasized with such force with Stalin's
jumping so quickly into the nuclear game, as well as the crushing of
the Prague Spring. We could have easily announced a policy of
'engagement' in 1947, claiming that by trading with the enemy we would
transform the enemy into a friend. We didn't, and in the end, those who
chose the course of Cold War were vindicated by those freed from
tyranny, despite the cost and duration of the conflict.

The Cold War existed because our leaders saw the world in such an us or
them degree of contrast, much as Bush is trying to do with little
success amongst the Democrats and the socialist controlled europeans
with respect to radical islam. Unfortunately, the radical muslims are
not cooperating with appropriate quantities of humanist-offending
atrocities, at least not in range of tv cameras owned by networks
willing to broadcast such with liberal viewers willing to recognise the
threat as such. The current attack in Bali helps a little, but what is
really needed, in actuality, is for the baddies to set off a suitcase
nuke, or for Saddam to launch an NBC attack on Israel.

The left never wants to take necessary actions until repeatedly smacked
in the nose with the fact that their cozy assumptions about the rest of
the world are based on pure socialist/postmodernist horse puckey. Just
as most male youth support for leftism is primarily a strategy for
getting laid, most male youth support for pacifism is primarily a
strategy for personal risk avoidance. Rather than being adults and
declaring CO status and getting drafted as a combat medic, they would
prefer to stay in college as long as possible or move to a neutral
country, whatever works for the times. Today, with no draft in sight,
college students are not even at risk of being drafted, and are now
left making guilty excuses for moral cowardice.

The Low Intensity Conflict practiced by al Qaeda does not engender the
intensity of reaction from those who would rather be in their dorm
rooms zapping mutants on their X-Boxes rather than overseas zapping
real bad guys (given the similarity of the sim with real combat, the
only difference being real risk to the players corporal body in
reality, one wonders at their reticence). 

Note that military recruitment has not risen in response to 9/11, in
contrast to the rise in enlistments that occured during Gulf War I. A
professor at Dartmouth College quizzed his students as to why they were
not enlisting to defend their country, to a rather negative and
lackluster response. Where in the days of the "good wars", large
fractions of college classes would drop out to enlist in the service
within days of outbreak of hostilities, not one student at this
hallowed hall of democratic liberalism has enlisted to make the world
safe for decadent western liberalism.

If you are neutralizing mutants in your video games, you really don't
have the testosterone left over to get all pumped up enough about al
Qaeda to go marching down to the military recruiter.

This is the key point.  Call the thinker A, the duplicate B, and the
person that they both were yesterday C.  Now A identifies with C
and is quick to accede "A and C are the same person".  But it's also
clear that B and C are the same person in the same way.  Therefore,
A and B are the same person.  Now I admit that this is too facile,
but it conveys the right idea IMO.

Yes, that's true because you really all *are* the same person.
Recall that we don't have any trouble believing that the same
person can be at two different times in the same place, and
we should just get used to the idea that the same person can
be in two different places at the same time.   It just takes
a little while getting used to the alienness of the idea,
that's all.

Yes, it is extraordinary, but only by historical accident.
It might have turned out that duplicating physical objects
was no harder than exploiting nuclear energy.  Now if we
were very used to duplicates being around, I predict that
over time we'd accommodate the perspective from physics,
namely, there isn't much difference between someone and
his duplicate.  The whole difference is in a few memories,
and we forget things all the time.  Besides, since I'll 
be the same person next month, I can hardly fail (from the
point of view of physics) to be the same person as my xox.

So since you have realized that your "moral intuitions" aren't
founded on anything objective, you *can* decide that duplicates
are self because that's what a completely physical materialistic
analysis would suggest.

> If you want to reject this notion, you'll have to give some kind account

Yes.  But you'll wait in vein, I predict, because I don't believe
that such an account exists.  IMO, people simply haven't gotten
used to the idea of being in two places at the same time.

You're right here too.  This by the way is why I doubt Emlyn's
principle, which in one form casts doubt on how objective the
question is.  I believe that "whether X is Napoleon" is an
objective question, and has a true/false answer (modulo degree).
For example, if you are presented with a collection of molecules
that claims to be Napoleon, it's either true or false that it
has enough memories and personality dispositions to be Napoleon
or it doesn't (module to what extent, of course).  It's even
possible that a certain collection of molecules would deny that
it is Napoleon, ridiculing the suggestion that it could be a
famous 19th century personage, yet truly be Napoleon because
a scan of Napoleon was taken at Waterloo, and then subjected
to intense brainwashing whose point was to convince him that
he was really the author of a book on Napoleonic warfare.

In the same way, something is either me or isn't me (again up
to a matter of degree).  But my *opinion* on the question may
not be important.

### Incorrect. Randy Weaver was less than a gnat on a T.Rex.

Nobody will even find your remains if a well-armed and unscrupulous
government is treating you as a serious adversary, rifle or no rifle.

The only thing between you, Mike, and oblivion is the good will of the US
government, maintained by the cooperative influence of millions of citizens,
most of whom don't need the internet, much less rifles to achieve that.

### Now, this is the most preposterous claim I read on this list in some

Yes, it does seem that there was something quite
special about the 18th century.  It was the age
of Reason, after all.

Quite!  I was very serious about the Maunder Minimum.
When the "little ice age" faded in the early 1700's
everything seemed to take a turn towards the better.
Historically, at least, global warming has always
been a *good* thing.  In every case, humanity has
thrived as it got warmer, and shrivelled when it
got colder.  The same would be true next time, I'm
certain, but having something to worry about---no
matter how much in defiance of history or logic---
provides a panic and an excuse for drastic action
(read huge government spasms).

Well, both Protestantism (i.e. weakening of the Roman
Church) and the printing press both had 16th century
origins, so I can't explain the toleration of the
18th century.  You're very possibly right.

### Yes, I am beginning to think there is no material difference between the

Nor were those who read Marx or Mao and who do think- long 
enough to decide this is true anyway - and decide to kill all 
who get in the way of their idea of utopia.  Do we think all 
those absolutely certain religion is an unfortunate infection 
that rots the brain and is dangerous to all "right-thinking" 
folk will not become violent in service of their beliefs or 
excuse any atrocities that may come on the basis of their low 
opinion of various belivers?

I don't think there is much excuse for spreading "All Muslims 
are EVIL" memes around here.

Didn't you know?  Extropian list members' posting
personalities were studied beginning in the early 90's
for a two month replacement program with FBI agents. 
These FBI agents were double spies for the CIA, who
never really trusting the FBI and wanted to get in on
the action and set up the FBI with a huge blunder. 
The CIA ploy was orchestrated, by environmental
extremists fearing government blunders and extra-legal
activities would make martyrs of the extropians. 
These in turn were actually extropian leaks trying to
thwart reactionary luddites, who coincidentally all
managed to replace their on-line personalities with themselves.

If so then A must be among those who went to school each morning on the

True, but then it also takes a while to get used to the alien idea that

Or perhaps people simply haven't gotten used to the idea of rejecting

Just watched part of a CNBC show called After Hours with Maria Bartiromo
(essentially a show about securities, with a splash of redolent news).

Guest was Bill Joy, who seemed to regret the idea of "robots" in the future
(making them sound very much like Borgs).  Said robots would have no human
qualities - no joy, love, sex, etc.  Joy's Wired article (from April 2000)
was mentioned:

http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04/joy.html

... and Ray Kurzweil was mentioned as well.  Maria seemed more enthusiastic
about "being immortal" than Bill (which enthusiasm may have been due to
Maria's more ebullient personality compared to Bill's).  Bill gave something
for the audience to contemplate before the commercial fadeout:  (I'm
paraphrasing) "*Imagine* you're 1000 years old ... can you *imagine* how
many people there would be? ... Can you *imagine* ...?" (etcetera, along
those lines).

Lee -

When I read this, I was almost sure you were playing devil's advocate,
playing out a stream of thought that seems logical within it's limited
context, but one that wouldn't be very useful in the context of the world we
live in.  I thought you must be arguing this viewpoint either for the
pleasure of constructing it, or the fun of see what reaction it would bring.
I was certain you must have been playing with word meanings and the
ambiguity we have when we talk about ourselves past, present, and future as
if there's no difference.

I was surprised, once again, to find that I have apparently misjudged your
intent.  I find the same ideas, in more expanded form, in an essay you wrote
at http://www.quantium.cwc.net/lr80.htm so I must conclude that you were
serious and sincere in what you wrote.

One of the reasons I continue to subscribe to this list is that it continues
to surprise me.

But you say that a few minutes ago is too long for your "taste",
and you refer to what you could "tolerate".  I think that *all*
that needs adjusting is your attitude.

> The thing is if I picked B I don't want to have time to think

But supposed that you bought my argument and then got used to
it.  Then you'd say, "Gee, tomorrow when I wake up, I won't
be remembering this.  Isn't that odd."

Actually, one can do that today!  Take the sleeping pill 
midazolam at 11:00 PM and go to sleep at 12:00.  You won't
remember anything between 11:30 and 12:00.  You can write
funny notes and leave them for yourself in the morning.
It will be weird.  But with the sleeping pill, we don't
imagine any danger to our identity.  But with the
delayed-choice teleporter (or the above example which
amounts to the same thing) people do.  I think, again,
that it's basically because they haven't internalized
the notion that they *can* be in two places at the same
time.

Practice remembering that last week you were at the
library and you were in the supermarket.  You can't
know for sure that those two things really didn't
happen at the same time!  If we had duplication
devices, and techniques for merging small amounts
of memory, then they might very well have occurred
at the same time.

If you *do* choose B, and get vaporized, the
John Clark that gets up the next morning will be
easily within the permissible sphere of possible
John Clarks that could get up tomorrow morning.
You have no reason to believe that you are *not*
any one of them.  Some will have retired tonight
after watching a frightening movie, some after
being arrested and thrown in the poky for a few
hours.  Some will have received annoying phone
calls. Some will have been beat up by hoodlums.
But if any of these things happened to you, you'd
still be the same person.  And so is that xox
in the ice.

Speaking of absolutes,  how about a meme like along lines of a  quote by
William Kingdon Clifford:  "It is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone,
to believe anything upon insufficient evidence."

Why, yes--it's easy if you try.

Six to ten billion, on dismally conservative estimates (no Spike, no upload
explosion, no devastating plague, asteroid or war).

How many of them would be children? As many as the oldsters who at any time
sign the social compact agreement to die within a year in order that a
fresh life might be created.

This should give Joy and other frightened people some comfort, since they
can delete themselves while giving a new human a chance, rather as
evolution has arranged things until now. Others will have to make do
without children, rather as technoculture has arranged things for most
people over 60 now.

forced to learn the English system, however here is
a tip that will help you not goof the Gc and miss
the answer by a factor of 32.  Simply throw out the
unit pound mass.  As soon as you see pounds mass,
immediately convert to slugs.  Then go ahead and
use the pound force as the amount of force needed
to accelerate one slug one foot per second^2.  When
the problem is finished, convert slugs back to
pounds mass, if necessary.  That way, all your
equations work the same, regardless of their
being posed in English or sensible units.  A
pound works like a big newton and a slug works
like a big kilogram.

Honest, just do it that way and you will always
get the right answers.  American engineering
students need to learn only one system.  spike

Cool! Maria as an Extropian I can go for that! I'd like a chance at a dance with

Thanks Olga for the post. Again Joy show's his lackluster plain lack of

It's unfortunate that some prefer to see the spread of knowledge and fact
as spreading hate. I hate no one. I merely chose to share some literature
by a respected author and researcher that bravely encounters some
uncomfortable facts. Don't shoot the messenger.

I do dislike when people let their religious beliefs stiffle reason and
thereby chose to disaprove the technologies we need for our goals. My life
depends on them not just my immortal aspirations. If someone threatens my
life by overt violence I am justified in seeing them as an enemy. How is it
different for ones that vote my demise? Maybe to some this Extropian stuff
is an interesting intellectual diversion or hobby. It's plain survival for
me.

Perhaps someone could elaborate the virtues of religion that will advance
the cause of Extropianism.

Samantha, I admire you for posting this.

But FER CRYIN OUT LOUD, lady!  Hell yes, Islam
itself is a serious problem!  And not just Islam,
but our own homegrown McVeighish wacko terrorists,
who want to bring down western civilization, and
everything we have worked so hard to build.  We
have a HELL of a problem on our hands.

That's interesting, and does provoke speculation that as
an era draws to its close, it makes a *statement*, or
several statements as it were.  You could have added
relativity to the pre-1914 fin de cycle, and the steam
engine, Wealth of Nations, and so on to the previous
fin.

But I'd bet we definitely *have* crossed over into
numerology or something related at this point ;-)

Your use of "subset" is telling, IMO.  When you forget something,
Gordon, do you become a subset of yourself?  Does you[now] die?
(See below too.)

I dispute, of course, that you should think that the vaporization
of you at this moment necessarily destroys your present identity.
(On the other hand, you may mean by "current identity" or "present
identity" only "past-identity + current memories", in which what
you say is tautologically true since your current memories do not
survive the vaporization.)  This is because if you had a severe
blow to the head that produced a peculiar amnesia that merely
took away this last week's memories, gts would still be alive
and well, and you'd think so too.

Note that cryonicists often talk about how desirable it would
be to have a backup.  Suppose that in some SF scenario it is
possible for cryonicists to get a scan made every two weeks.
Then, if a terrible accident occurred, they could still be
restored from backups, sans their most recent memories.  I
regard this as survival.  Do you?

Samantha,

No apology necessary. I'm just glad someone finally actually read what I
tried to share. Personally, and in light of 9/11, it scares the hell out
of me. We have a people that live in ignorance and not entirely of their
own doing. Their leaders are despots that fear democracy and so feed the
ignorance and the hate. This ignorance leads to fear of modernity and
all things the west, "The Great Satan", has to offer. So the concoction
becomes hate+luddite+ignorance+fear+religious fanaticism. Can there be
anything more against Extropianism?

Thanks,

FutureQ

P.S. It took me several days maybe a few weeks really to digest what
Bloom wrote. The thing is his references are all in order, he's not
making it up.

Well, of course there really isn't *any* such thing as "the
same place" period.  I meant, of course, the commonplace
notion familiar to people since the dawn of history: the
same place relative to the Earth.

Of course, when I also claim, "people should get used to
the idea of being in two places at the same time", a 
similar objection *could* be raised.  After all, we know
now that true simultaneity does not exist.  But all this
is, IMHO, rather beside the point.

So (just to pursue a fancy, here) you generally speaking
don't consider yourself to be the same person that you
were last week?  Wow ;-) it must really be easy to get
out of promises, "*I* never said that!  The previous gts
said that!"  ;-)

Thanks for that reference, Jef.  The essay to which the above
refers is my 1996 "Duplicates are Self: A Proof", which perhaps
isn't so modestly titled as it should be.  ;-)  But in it I lay
out the best arguments I've ever had for why indeed duplicates 
*should* be regarded *exactly the same* as self.

Yes, but that's only because you aren't a selfish individual.
Your idealism here is at variance with the goal of investigating
what personal identity is (or what we should believe about it).

I postulate an MSI (Most Selfish Individual) for the purposes
of identity investigations.  This is an extremely intelligent
but also extremely self-centered and selfish person whose
own existence is almost the only thing that matters to him.

Yet I contend that the MSI will, upon correct reflection, 
make choice (B) above.  He is most definitely interested
in personally surviving the episode, yet also wishes to
enhance his future security by the acquisition of so
much money.

Maybe, but it looks interestingly (to me) like modulations in the 300-year
generational cycle I proposed in THEORY AND ITS DISCONTENTS. That model is
syncretic, part empirical and drawn from other cycle theorists, part
extrapolated from climate periodicities and a guess that these are driven
by solar energy incidence periodicities.

===========================================

	Within this double feedback circuit (negative loops ensuring a measure of
stability, while positive feedbacks produce genuine growth and
complexifying change), the four phases of each long cycle enact a two-state
combinatory of order and disorder. In cycle phase 1, preference for order
in the global system is high, but its availability is low; this is the
generation waging global war. In phase 2, preference for order remains
high, and, due to the decisive close of the previous phase, available order
is now high as well, leading to a regime of world order. In phase 3,
preference for order has fallen to low, despite its prevalent and perhaps
oppressively high availability, so a regime of delegitimation sets in for a
generation. Finally, both preference for and availability of order are low,
and deconcentration brings new hegemonic challenge to the boil, preparing
the way for a return to the start of the long cycle. It is arresting to
compare this schema with Wheeler's fourfold categorisation, charted above,
where WARM/DRY matches Modelski's global war phase, and the remainder march
in close agreement.
	Of course, the long cycle schema was not developed by synchronic reference
to external biological or even economic pacemakers such as climate, but
after study of the historical narrative at the diachronic level of
competing states, today usually regarded as radically contingent. The major
wars of these five great sequences are given as the Portuguese cycle, with
its ceaseless Italian and Indian Ocean wars of 1494-1516; the Dutch cycle,
with the Spanish-Dutch war of 1580-1609; the first British cycle, with the
wars of Louis XIV, 1688-1713; the second British cycle, with the wars of
the French Revolution and Napoleon, 1792-1815; and the American cycle, or
wars with Germany, 1914-45.  Interestingly, Modelski's attempt to forecast
this pattern into the next millennium immediately went awry (along with
almost everyone else's) by assuming that the principal challenger to
American suzerainty in 1973-2030 would be the Soviet Union. Presumably the
slot would be filled now by Japan, or perhaps Unified Europe, or the
Asia-Pacific Tigers [note: written in 1996, ignoring resurgent militant
Islam...DB]. It is a significant mark of this schematism that while its
roster of players is determined by sensitive dependence upon initial
conditions - and hence to some considerable degree remains unpredictable -
the general orbit envelope of the attractor (to borrow the terminology of
chaos theory) is quite predictable. Indeed, it represents rather neatly
what I earlier dubbed a `stochastic emergent schematism'.

	Generation Gaps: The Ontogenetic Sequence

Perhaps the most striking feature of this century-long process is the role
played by massive conflict, or more exactly its successful conclusion, as a
definitive time-marker. Whether or not the long cycle is calibrated to more
primitive pulses (physiologic, ecological, even solar dynamic), one can set
its clock by the celebrations that mark global armistice. Arnold Toynbee
famously found in this unhappy recurrence a key to alternations between war
and peace: `the survivors of a generation that has been of military age
during a bout of war will be shy, for the rest of their lives, of bringing
a repetition of this tragic experience either upon themselves or their
children' (A Study of History, Vol. IX, 1954, cited Modelski, p. 115).
Perhaps the uniformity of experience shared by those children (in our own
recent history, the `baby boomers') is at least as salient as that of their
warrior parents. As Modelski notes:

	if long cycles are processes of social change, then the successive phases
of each cycle might imply the need for different skills, capabilities and
orientations that could be supplied by succeeding generations... In that
sense, the existence of generational differences might be an essential
mechanism for the functioning of such a long-range process of social
change... (p. 116)

For the moment, then, we shall leave in abeyance the question of
`historical phases' and `discontinuities', and turn to the second theme
announced at the start of this chapter. Let us consider the collateral
metaphor drawn upon the course of an individual human's passage (as mapped
by Piaget and other developmental specialists) from infancy to death. Might
this ontogenetic sequence provide insight into cultural patterns of growth
and decay - if indeed there really are any such regularities, the kinds
alleged by Huntington, Wheeler, Dewey, Thompson and Modelski?
	It might seem that even so `genealogical' a metaphor must offend against
contemporary taste, insinuating a determinism repugnant to our
sensibilities, one especially distasteful to today's heightened awareness
of contingency and the non-linear complexities of chaos.  To a generation
of Theorists attuned to Foucauldian strictures on dispersed, bottom-up
`micro-power' vectors in preference to centralising, top-down,
`macro-power', any apparently organicist metaphor must look preposterous.
But as Foucault's translator and commentator Paul Patton has remarked,
`While he does argue that the small-scale relations of micro-power are a
necessary basis for the effects of global hegemony, Foucault does not deny
the efficacy of macrosocial forms of power' (Patton, 1987, p. 236). A toxic
epistemological slide is not inevitable, therefore, if we are careful: 

	Although Piaget insists that development is continuous, he does allow for
the existence of stages. During any given stage many superficially
different patterns of behaviour can of course be seen to occur. Underlying
them, however, there is held to be some common structures which explains
them and gives the stage its unity. So transition to a new stage means that
some fairly fundamental re-organization is taking place. There is, however,
no sharp break between stages and there are no completely new beginnings....

	The main stages follow one another in an order that is held to be the same
for all children. But this is not because they are `pre-programmed' or
wholly determined by maturation.... It is because each stage builds on the
one before it. Thus the earlier construction is necessary for the later
one. (Donaldson, 1978, p. 133) 
	

While this is true of childhood and early maturation, perhaps as far as
adolescence, is there any reason to suppose that the shape of our lives
(let alone our cognitive structures) is segmented beyond, say, the age of
14 or 16? I think there is. The sage Confucius, in the fifth century BCE,
offered a celebrated partitioning that is still resonant:

	At 15 I set my heart on learning; at 30 I was firmly established; at 40 I
had no more doubts; at 50 I knew the will of Heaven; at 60 I was ready to
listen to it; at 70 I could follow my heart's desire without transgression.

By way of comparison, let us split up a notional (and, because of the power
inequities of our culture, male) 20th century Western lifetime into
somewhat arbitrary but not absurd sectors of 12.5 years. What is more, I
will code these according to parameters of the Jakobson/Bakhtin schema:

	From birth to 12.5, early construction of the social self, peaking at
puberty. [PHATIC (establishing communication channels)... seguing into WE
(addressee as social self/ interpellated subjectivity)]

	12.5 to 25, the construction of the subject's individual self, peaking at
the establishment of (his) own early parental role. [I (addresser)]

	25 to 37.5, emphasis shifting away from individual subjectivity toward
confident dealings with, especially exploration of, the large-scale `real'
or objective world. [IT (world)]

	37.5 to 50, the `writing' of (his) self and activity into the world,
peaking with (his) own children rearing their own first children. [TEXT
(theory)]

	50 to 62.5, consolidated mastery of the rules of culture and world alike,
peaking with the shift from specific work competences to supervisory roles
and preparation for retirement. [CODE (meta-level)]

	62.5 to 75, mature settling into `elder' role, custodian of the mores of
(his) social order, and preparation for death. [PHATIC/ ALGORITHMIC
(intertext)]

	One may readily draw comparisons (perhaps all too easily) between this
schema and developmental stages advanced by developmental psychologists of
various competing schools - Jean Piaget (1962, 1979), Arnold Gesell and his
collaborators (1941, 1971), E. H. Erikson (1968), C. Buhler (1968), Jerome
Kagan (1984) - educators such as Candida Peterson (1989), and
anthropologists such as Colin M. Turnbull (1984) and Michael Young (1988).
Erikson's Freudian scheme runs as follows (I add my own suggested
equivalences):

	1. Trust/confidence	[PHATIC]
	2. Autonomy vs. Shame (`ways of behaving')	[WE]
	3. Initiative vs. Guilt
	4. Industry vs. Inferiority (use of tools and skills)
	5. Identity vs. Role Confusion (advent of puberty)	[I]
	6. Intimacy vs. Isolation (true genitality develops)	[IT]
	7. Generativity vs. Stagnation	[TEXT]
	8. Ego Integrity vs. Despair	[CODE... PHATIC]

While it is an acknowledged defect of Erikson's system that he fails to
develop a full account of mature life, still, the resemblances with my
account are provocative. Note the closure, perhaps as in `stages' of
historical change, from an unformed phatic/rule-learning beginning in
infancy to a sedimented post-code phatic/rule-governed conclusion in the
elderly. 

	The Six Ages of (hu)Man

Let us assume provisionally that this developmental history reflects a
(somewhat flexible) genetic/cultural clock regulating individual
development with some robustness across many cultures. Clearly, this is
likely to have altered in an unprecedented degree during the 20th century,
when its later phases became stretched out by our own high-tech medical
culture, with delayed or extended child-rearing, healthy maturity, and
senescence. Still, it is feasible that such a grand template might be
assimilated and rehearsed in broad cultural shifts of Jakobsonian Dominant
(within, of course, the limits of each bounded culture or civilisation). 
	But again we are brought up short. Can science, the realm of
non-intentional objects, be expected to say anything central about the
human condition of subjects? Climatic phases might be recurrent, but aren't
we humans set free of biology, children of self-reflexive, infinitely
mutable culture? While a naturalist such as E. O. Wilson might hope to draw
broad sociobiological lessons from animal behaviour and the processes of
genetic adaptation, these days it is generally regarded as an illicit move
within the humane specialties. The fashion in human studies is `thick
description', empathetic immersion in local ways. Global grand theories of
social structure and change, especially the strongly reductionistic sort
first made popular several decades ago by Desmond Morris, Edward Wilson and
Richard Dawkins, are automatically rejected as misguided and simplistic.
The case is not, however, so simply dismissed. To cite Ernest Gellner once
more:

	Most pre-scientific societies... build up a tolerably coherent
world-picture, in which background world-story, social organization, and
natural fact are all congruent. The time-ordering sub-system will tend to
dovetail in with the personal hierarchy sub-system: the big periodic
festival, marking the seasonal rhythm, also underwrites the hieratic
rankings. (Gellner, 1988, p. 60)

Given this traditional interlock, it would not be surprising if the
palpably biological stages of the individual's developmental unfolding were
incorporated into the grander seasons of a society's ebbs and flows. Of
course, each year brings new births and deaths, so one might wonder how a
universal ontogenetic cycle begun anew with each child might be registered
(prior to the epoch of long cycles and their great punctuating global wars)
against the continuum of history. 
	Hunter-gatherer orders will indeed tend to blend time into timelessness,
disrupted chiefly by random natural catastrophes or rich years, time-bonded
by the round of annual liturgies. Once civil society has precipitated,
however, the clock tends to be set by the accession of chiefs, kings, or
perhaps high priests or prophets and external conquerors. Although somewhat
discontinuous, these events in turn will tend to follow the generational
unfolding of a healthy human family (since kings and priests live well, if
spared in battle). And, as we have seen, it is possible that ecology itself
provides a calibration mechanism, chiefly through modulations or ripples in
the prevalence of game or agricultural produce, perhaps via biological
adaptation to such roughly boom-and-bust dietary cycles. 

	Cultural Stages

The surmise that the historical variety of human cultures might comprise a
taxonomy is by no means exploded. Ernest Gellner, for example, sees history
as passing through three great phases: hunting/gathering, agrarian, and
industrial (Gellner, 1988, p. 16ff). `These three kinds of society differ
from each other so radically as to constitute fundamentally different
species, notwithstanding the very great and important diversity which also
prevails within each of these categories' (ibid.) Anthropologist Marvin
Harris (1979), a cultural materialist, lists a larger variety of social
orders - which I construe as sub-divisions of Gellner's - comprising a kind
of evolutionary trajectory. That is not necessarily to say a predictable
one, but certainly one that makes sense, step by step, in hindsight, in the
way that a cladistic diagram makes sense of branching evolutionary
histories. Nor, I hope, is it absurd to map this sequence against the
emergence of certain privileged domains of subjectivity. The speculative
attributions to Harris's classifications shown in brackets are mine:

	Hunter-Gatherer bands (phatic/algorithmic); 
	Pre-State Villages (we); 
	Chiefdoms (I/charismatic authority); 
	Low Energy Centralised States (world/it); 
	Industrial States (theory); 
	Post-Industrial States (code... phatic/algorithmic).

I cannot stress too strongly that this arrangement does not imply any
`immaturity' in members of extant pre-industrial cultures, or any `savage
mind' more primal or concrete than our own blessed state.

Well sure, if I felt differently then, well, I'd feel differently and the
universe would continue on without a glitch. As I said before there is no

Remind me not to take any midazolam, but the thoughts I lost are only part
of the problem, the other part is the unpleasant thought that will not be
lost, at least for a short time; I don't like the idea of having a last
thought, of knowing that there will no continuation of my present thought
process. I can no more give you a logical reason for my preference than I
could tell you why life is better than death.
And you didn't answer my question, would you be comfortable if the copy was

a few milliseconds ago, then I'd have no problem with getting vaporized.

The life extension = overpopulation arguments always amuse (and sometimes
dismay) me. 

As I see it:
- To get big life extension, you require a wealthy and educated society
  +
- Wealthy and educated societies seem to struggle with negative population
growth

- It is my opinion as a parent (anyone got studies to back this up???) that
doubling a person's reproductive lifespan isn't going to double the amount
of children they have (it certainly wouldn't double the amount that I'd
have). I'd say it's likely to have an extremely small effect on the amount
of children one person has over a lifespan.

- The average amount of time before having a child is likely to increase
dramatically. We already see that trend now, only capped by the fact that it
becomes increasingly dangerous for women to have children beyond a certain
age. Imagine if a woman could safely put of childbearing until they were
150. What would the time before having one's first child look like? Would it
continue to hover around the late twenties, or rise a lot higher? I also
propose that the length of time between children would increase at least a
bit.

- If the average amount of time before having a first child increases
dramatically, this will drastically shrink the birth rate (babies per unit
time), so we are likely to see an overall population growth rate that is far
closer to zero than the current one is, even given a death rate of 0. iirc,
Max argues this point well on his population page
(http://www.maxmore.com/LifeExtensionandOverpopulation.htm).

People have been worrying for a long time that we head for an overpopulation
nightmare. They see that population growth is (birth rate)-(death rate), and
reason that if death rate falls, population growth will be even worse. The
error is that these are actually intermingled; it is likely that the birth
rate would fall much further than the death rate, for reasons that I've
outlined above, and that this means population growth (not actual
population) would fall. Life extension is actually part of a *solution* to
potential overpopulation, not an aggravating factor.

The theoretically minded will object that the population still grows, and
that we will still *eventually* have a problem. I agree! And its a problem
that we really must find a solution to... *eventually*. I'm sure that, given
some tens of thousands of years, which a very small population growth will
give us, we can find a solution which satisfies everyone and doesn't involve
voluntary suicide. Or it may become a non-problem for some other reason that
we haven't thought of yet. Here's the gist of it:

Translated by N.J. Dawood
Edited by E.V. Rieu
Published by The Penguin Classics

There is no copyright notice anywhere in the book, but the date given 
at the end of the introduction is 1955 - and it appears to be an 
original print.

Also of interest, as stated in the Introduction by N.J. Dawood:

"It ought to be borne in mind that the Koran contains many statements 
which, if not recognized as altogether obscure, lend themselves to more 
than one interpretation.  I have taken great pains to reproduce these 
ambiguities wherever they occur, and have provided explanatory 
footnotes in order to avoid turning the text into an interpretation 
rather than a translation."

I don't really have the time - or indeed, after this many years out of 
practice, the knowledge - to translate the text on my own.  But I'd be 
interested in reading a modern translation of the text to find how it 
may differ.  I may just pick one up now.

Would you want to live under a system that could enforce such regulations
for *everyone*, *everywhere* (e.g., no frontiers permitted)?

Peter, I was confused by your message, so I tried to find this 
endorsement in order that I could be clearer about what I meant (and 
hopefully what Les had in mind as well.)  I found the following 
passage, which seems to be what you meant:

     The most direct way to fight discrimination in housing or
     employment is to send a well-qualified minority applicant to a
     suspect and, if the applicant is refused, send a less
     well-qualified majority applicant. If that person is accepted,
     repeat the experiment once or twice to be sure, then nail them!

In this quote, his point is that some people (let's call them "bigots") 
are making distinctions based on superficial characteristics.  Les 
appears to believe that it is reasonable to prohibit making some kinds 
of distinctions in housing and employment.  (As a libertarian, I limit 
the context in which I'm willing to prohibit discrimination mostly to 
government employment and purchasing.  I'm willing to let private 
individuals discriminate on whatever bases they wish to, but I find it 
unacceptable for people who have extracted money from taxpayers by 
force to be allowed to use their position to perpetuate discrimination.)

In order to prevent bigots from discriminating when we wish to prohibit 
it, it is reasonable to track the attributes the bigots pay attention 
to.  That doesn't make the attributes relevant for other purposes.

I think Les admitted in his article that race does mean something in 
some places.  There is a distinction between most of the people in 
Ghana and most of the people in Norway and it's reasonable to call it 
race.  It's not very useful to try to find the same degree of 
distinction between groups in the US, or to try to figure out which of 
a few small groups Les Earnest should be assigned to.

Peter continued:

The narrower sense of nonsense that I intended when I wrote

 > Any studies done in the US that try to correlate
 > anything with Race are nonsense

is easier to explain.  As Les pointed out, the classification systems 
that have been used in this country for several hundred years have 
extremely low correlation with the underlying partially segregated 
breeding stocks.  A single african ancestor among one's grandparents 
was sufficient to categorize people as black.  There's an astounding 
variety of ancestry among people within any of the categories "black", 
"hispanic-surname", "pacific-asian islander", or "white".  I doubt 
there have been more than a handful of studies done in the US in the 
last 300 years that claimed to be correlating something with race that 
used any better classification than those.

That means that Herrnstein and Murray couldn't have had any base data 
to work from that was meaningful on the subject of correlations between 
intelligence and race.  Any studies that base a conclusion on this 
level of classification of the race of the participants are nonsense.

Does that give you enough more understanding of what I was getting at 
to allow you to discuss my claim?

What part of `dismally conservative estimates' didn't you understand?
 
But while we're here...

If biological intelligence *did* find itself sequestered on a single world
(absurd, dismally conservative postulate though that is), there quickly
would *be* no frontiers left. Thereafter, social mores would adjust to
limit ad hoc fertility. Regulation need not be imagined as imposed from
without, by and large. We don't now have squads of anti-cannibalism cops
bursting into houses to check the ovens; people have internalized a
revulsion for anthropophagy. I can imagine a world order in which immortal
people who insist on their `right' to have as many children as they wish
are encouraged by hisses and boycotts to emigrate to Fertilia, formerly the
Sahara, where they might exercise their whims for as long as it takes--but
they're not welcome back among civilized people unless they agree to obey
the social compact I mentioned.

oooh, no, I'd say *this* is post of the month, just for the humour
value  :-)


And without wading into what seems to be a shockingly narrow-minded
argument (are all muslims bad?) can I just mention that as a practising
pagan, I'm WAY WAY WAY more scared of xtians than I am of muslims, and I
grew up with muslims, and as an Australian I'm WAY WAY WAY more scared
of americans than I am of arabs. I suspect that Osama's "Crusader"
rhetoric is scarily on the ball.

And no, I'm not going to get sucked into this thread, I just thought I'd
throw this out.
not all religions are bad, but all monotheisms certainly are.

Hmm.  Well, *survival* may still be an objectively
true or false state of affairs (along a sliding scale
of course).  I hold that it is.  That is, if you are
dragged screaming and kicking into a teleporter-with-
delay, and we talk to you during the five minutes in
which your duplicate is alive and well in New Zealand,
then any assertion that you make that *you* aren't going
to live through this will, IMO, objectively turn out to
be false.  No analytic examination of the solar system
will reveal John Clark dying.

Gee, you must really hate going to sleep!

Yes, the burden of proof is on me, who claims that there is
a logical reason why no one dies in the delayed-teleporter
scenario.

Clearly the longer the interval, the more uncomfortable I
become.  Specifically, the last two months have been great,
but there is no doubt that the early summer Lee would pick
up and move onwards, and that I'd be him (am him, whatever).

In fact, any time in the last 30 years, I'd still survive
(say back to my mid-twenties or something), but I'd be
badly damaged of course.  Beyond that, it's best to look
upon it as I'm a goner.

> I'd be most comfortable if it was a few milliseconds ago,

Yes.  What about a 60-second delay teleporter where it's
with some sexual fantasy company?  And, by the way, just
how much would I have to pay you to try midazolam?

By God, as soon as they were forced to come
up with "slugs" those damned stubborn English
types should have seen that they had been given
a Sign that they were on the Wrong Track!  And
they should have instantly adopted the metric
system.

Slugs, indeed!

So it's absolutely *definite* that the pound
force is the weight (force) of one pound 
against Earth's gravity?

I am stubborn, and I am old.  And I am not
so flexible any more.  I refuse to touch
slugs.  Or to have *anything* to do with
them one way or the other.

Would you *please* say how many pounds (as
force) is equivalent to one newton?

Would you please have pity on me, and have
mercy upon my utter humiliation, and tell
me how many foot-pounds (force times
distance) equal one joule (i.e. one
newton-meter)?   Please save my sanity,
or what little is left of it.

Thanks,
Lee

You're trying too hard to take my comments out of context. I merely made a
comparison by example. Take it line by line if you must. It should be very very
obvious to this list that certain medical technologies are under fire from a
bunch of different religious groups. Need I name each and every one and supply
chapter and verse of their arguments? Sorry, I won't do this. I expect this list
to be savvy enough to understand the obvious. I expect we all have read the
headlines. Maybe you haven't. If so then perhaps that is the problem in your
understanding who I consider to be enemies of our movement. This can't be news to
this list. BTW, it's Howard Bloom.

Then factor in the comments of Gen. Smedley Butler: "War is a racket."

Maybe not all war. But he figured it was the way to bet. And he wasn't stupid or unversed militarily--he 
was twice decorated with the Medal of Honor, for ations at Haiti and Veracruz.

Mean to say, there's necessity and there's "necessity"; and there's peril in not keeping an eye out for the 
difference. Parallax and camouflage breaking benefit from having more than one eye open.

Bzzzt. Contrafactual. You just *let* yourself be sucked into the thread.

Intolerant people should be intolerated? Deep.

For those who may be struggling, as I am, to understand how
the world appears divided between the Bayesians and the
non-Bayesians, here are two quotes from an early book by
Jaynes:

"When a problem of statistical inference is studied long enough,
sometimes for decades, one is always forced eventually to a
conclusion that could have been derived in three lines from
Bayes' theorem."

"We are not afraid to use Bayes' theorem to work any proposition
whatsoever back and froth from one side of our symbols to the
other.  I think that in refusing to make free use of Bayes'
theorem, modern writers are depriving themselves of the most
powerful single principle in probability theory."


I always approve when mathematicians use the word "whatsoever".

And leave us never be afraid to use a powerful tool.

These two quotes are from page 165 of an old type-writer written
book of Jaynes http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/mobil.pdf .

Good post, Lee, and one that certainly expresses my feelings about the
18th century.  I wish I had more time to elaborate, but for now can put
it this way in summary: I feel like the 18th century was scientific
humanity's vigorous and playful childhood (with the Renaissance and
Reformation being its cradle and nursery, respectively).  Unfortunately,
we had a tumultuous and violent adolescence and early adulthood (the
19th and 20th centuries ... to continue the metaphor.  A central thesis
of my current world-view is that the West took a deeply wrong turn in
the French Revolution, which fully expressed itself in both the
"premature rationalism" (no time to explain) of Marxism and the
regressive emotionalism of the Romantic movement.  

I'm currently reading "The Culture of Hope" by Frederick Turner, and
hope to be able to write an extended review of it some time in the next
couple of weeks -- for now, let me say that folks who found your post
stimulating may well enjoy this book as one that shares the idea that
much of what has happened *since* the 18th century as wrong-headed.

### Yes, yes! Reject common sense! After all, it is (or was) common sense to
think that the Earth must be flat, or else the people living on the other
side would have fallen off. And once you reach the esoterica, like quarks
and individualities, the pitiful little bag of mental tricks that makes up
"common sense", is badly deficient.

By all means, join us, the persons exhibiting un-common sense.

But it didn't.  It took over the catholic church, and when the political 
front collapsed (a true set-back, admittedly) it had a fall-back 
position.   Acting via the church it has, over the past several 
centuries, set up several additional fall-back positions in the 
commercial sector, at least (e.g., the Bank of America).  It does 
continually keep trying to get the political power again, with 
intermittent successes.  But governments have a short half-life compared 
to it's other positions.

I don't know whether I'm serious or not.  Perhaps it depends on what you 
consider to be the "self" of an organization.

NO!  Do not convert from a good system to

No Mercy!  No humiliation!  Well, other than

Dont converrt.  Estimate the height in
meters, the mass in Kg and work from there.

Lee, your sanity is not in danger bud.
Think metric.  spike

Well, yes, I do agree that we must always question what is thought to be
true. However we must be careful not to throw our brains into the trash
merely for the sake of making some fanciful argument.

I would tend to disagree. The pool size of mainstream match-making sites
is much larger, self-selected (everybody is looking, and has minimal
technology interest by being online) and allows you a high-throughput
semiautomatic screening by spatial and compatibility profiles. The
communication is semianonymous and low-friction, at times realtime and
multimedia. It definitely beats the meatspace meat market by orders of
magnitude as far as efficiency is concerned.

You were one of the very few specific exceptions I mentioned. I cannot
think of significantly more, in fact I can't think of a yet another recent
example. I think the matter warrants an informal poll.

Question 1: Have you or anybody you know met their current or past partner
in the online and offline Extropian/Transhumanist community? 

Question 2: Did the relationship persist, and do you think the means of 
contact made a significant difference to other fora/legacy means?

If you reply to me, I'll summarize (and anonymize, if you ask for it).

But I am stubborn!  And despite your exhortations,
I have finally succeeded in obtaining a slug-less
derivation.

Oh YES!  Always have.  I hate ft-lbs and
all that.  Especially, ugh, slugs.  (Whatever
they are.)

Listen, I can't help it if Mike Lorrey found
out the WTC data in practically the only way
he could, namely those awful English units.
[Four page rant about English vs. French
rivalry reluctantly deleted.]

> Lee, your sanity is not in danger bud.
> Think metric.  spike

I'm trying!  Okay, like I say, I finally did
it, and here is the slug-less derivation:

Voila:  

1 ft-lb = 1.355818 newtons.

Proof:  1kg weight (not mass) is equal to
        2.2046 pounds, as one knows from
        daily life.

        One also knows that 2.54 cm equals
        1 inch.  So there are .0254 meters
        in one inch, and when we multiply
        by 12 we get .3048 meters per foot.
        Exactly.

        One also has the acceleration of
        gravity as 9.80665 meters/sec^2

Therefore,  (warning!---view in fixed font!)

            9.80665m      1kg       .3048m
  1ft-lb *  -------- * ---------- * ------
              sec^2    2.20452 lb     ft

equals (i.e. multiplies out to be)

  =  1.35588 m^2 * kg / sec^2

because all the units cancel out.  But the
last expression is the definition of a newton.

So from now on I hope that it takes less than
hours to convert from ft-lbs (should the dreadful
need arise again) to newtons.

Okay, but I liked what you said last year even better:

"The non-Bayesians?  I thought they were all hunted down
long ago!"   (or words to that effect)

and

"We are all Bayesians now.  (Vorlon voice)"

Well, maybe so.  So chalk it up to historical antiquarianism
or love of punishment or something.

Actually I hope that you are right and we can suppress
the word Bayesian from all those phrases, such as
"Bayesian probability", etc.  Jaynes, for one, began
his essay with an admonition that probability is nothing
more than common sense.

My friend Kimball Collins swears that someone on this
list recently proposed a thought-experiment that has
helped convert him to the pro-teleportation view.

He says that the poster in effect suggested that (a)
one go to sleep, (b) a duplicate of one is made while
one sleeps (c) the original is disintegrated and the
duplicate later wakes up.

According to Kimball, this experiment makes it start to
look a little silly to think that who wakes up isn't you.

So we thank whoever came up with it.

John Clark too might allow an overlap like this
since one is not conscious when it occurs.

Strictly speaking, yes, I am not the same person I was last week. 

With regard to promises, people would never break them if what I am
saying were not true. Rightly or wrongly, when a person willfully breaks
a promise it is because he has "changed his mind," i.e., his personality
has changed such that he is now a different person with a different set
of priorities. 

Lest you think this should be interpreted as a license to disregard
one's integrity, keep in mind that the breaking of a promise is not in
itself immoral or evil. Such things must be considered in context.
(T'would have been nice had Osama's followers decided to break their
promise to destroy the WTC, for example.)

The reason why I think that a mailing list has an advantage over match.com is 
that you usually see the person you might be interested in posting other 
messages responding to other people not just you. I saw my husband responding to 
people he didn't want to date. Therefore I saw much more of his character than 
if I would just have chatted with him.

I agree with what you say above about the mainstream match-making sites, of 
course. But I also think that it's much easier to lie there than on a mailing list.

The sliding scale is the killer, and no objective test will ever be
developed for this sort of thing because it involves consciousness and that
by definition is subjective. And besides, the desirability of survival and
the undesirability of unpleasant thoughts is certainly subjective.

    > Gee, you must really hate going to sleep!

The very last thoughts before I sleep are so weak and unfocused that they
hardly deserve the name, and the thought "this is the last thought I will
ever have" does not occur to me and that is the one I don't much like.
At no point do I feel that a thought can not be continued in the morning
so I'm not frightened.

    >just  how much would I have to pay you to try midazolam?

I don't know if the drug really works as you say but if I was fully awake,
active and alert and believed that everything I thought for the next
half hour would be totally lost by tomorrow morning it would scare
the holy hell out of me and you don't have enough money.

    >What about a 60-second delay teleporter where it's

You flatter me, but the truth is if I thought I was 60 seconds away from
oblivion I would have a lot of things on my mind and I'm not sure I could,
ah, rise to the occasion.

A light-foot is pretty close to a nanosecond, isn't it?

One of my early jobs was timing sporting events; mostly bike races
in the summer and ski races in the winter. I wrote lots of software to
interface with timing equipment and print reports.  One of those was
to calculate velocity from two timers set a short distance apart on
a ski hill.  I had to add unit conversion factors, and for some reason
(probably just boredom) we came up with about two dozen possible units
from "percent Earth orbit velocity" to "furlongs per fortnight".

________________________

It seems that both means are possible turf for mating dances.  One aspect
of being transhumanist and, especially, an extropian transhumanist, is that
there is a tendency for diverse interests, but an over emphasis on
excluding others who have different beliefs.  It isn't necessary for
partners to have all the same beliefs, but a desire to learn and an ability
to explore.  Since many people in society are aligned deeply with singular
beliefs, certain areas are obtuse for finding partners. However, there are
many other avenues. One problem with the transhumanist community is a lack
of wide spread interests, but a narrowing focuses of right and wrong with
little space for compassion for the rest of humanity.

Better than email or net dating services, I find conferences, seminars and
festivals rich and populated venues for meeting people.  I have met many
friends at these types of events, especially film festivals and Extro
conferences.  Even better, or equally as profitable, are resorts:  ski
resorts.  Apre ski coziness by a fire can be a charmed location for
relaxing and enjoying all sorts of people.  Even if you start with only a
sport in common, you will find someone who relishes a joy of life that
could be a needed change from a computer potato you might meet at an online
debate.

Recently, I was having a drink with a girlfriend on a curbside patio in
Santa Monica on 3rd Street Promenade.  Midstream in conversation, I looked
up and saw a man walking by who looked familiar.  We both did a double take
and than recognized each other.  He joined my friend and me and we had a
wonderful evening.  During the evening we discussed a myriad of topics, but
one that we explored the topic of compassion and why there is a seemingly
lack of compassion in the transhumanist and, especially, cryonics
community.  

Transhumanists and cryonicists talk about living longer - why we love life
and don't want to give in to the taunting call of death.  We are so focused
on our own need and desire to live longer that we come off as not giving a
damn about the rest of society.  However, each of us may think that this is
untrue in deference to our peers, and ourselves but to the public it seems
that we are self-centered.  Rather, my friend suggested that we, and
himself included, show more compassion to the world and express our
concerns for all of humanity about the tyranny of death.  My friend is
Michael West.

You may think that this has little to do with the dating dance, but in fact
it has a lot to do with our self-image and what we want in our potential
partners.

I met my husband at a transhumanist event.  He is the only man that I would
have gone out with in that crowd.  Why? Because I sensed a quality that was
unique amongst the crowd.  The difference I found was that I favored men
who have a sense compassion and integrity, and who place these ideas at the
top of their list.

I'm not saying that these qualities - honesty, compassion, and integrity -
are missing amongst transhumanist.  I am saying that we tend to hide these
qualities, as if they re not as important or as professionally beneficial
as intelligence and making a presence in the transhumanist community.  

Where someone may write a paper that we all love to talk about, or where
someone may coin a word or phrase that we all thing is just terrific, or
where someone may come up with a new organization that will do things just
a little differently and we all think this is just great -- I have believe
there is a lack of interest in pursuing human dignity as a values that
should be right up there at the top of our priority list in principle and
in action.

When we consider the avenues for finding someone we feel in sync with, it
is essential to think about what our life mission is and what we want to
reflect to ourselves and the world in our relationship.  It doesn't matter
if you, as an extropian transhumanist, or a transhumanist, find a partner
who loves astronomy and space exploration as much as you do, but he or she
does not have an affinity for other aspects of transhumanist interests. 
What does matter is that you feel a trust in your partner that you can
depend upon and that has your best interests in mind.

>Question 1: Have you or anybody you know met their current or past partner
in the online and offline Extropian/Transhumanist community?<

Yes.  Yes.

>Question 2: Did the relationship persist, and do you think the means of 
contact made a significant difference to other fora/legacy means?<

Yes.  Yes.

Not quite right. Idolaters are to be given the choice of death or
conversion - so bad luck for Hindus!. There's a different status for "People
of the Book" who are tolerated but not allowed to proselytise. The Quran
says these are Jews, Christians and Sabaens. Nobody even at the time knew
who the last category were (the scholars think it referred to the Mandeans,
a sect who claim to be the disciples of John the Baptist) so it was used to
include people like Zoroastrians who had a written scripture. Because Islam
is the "final, complete revelation" you can't have a new religion of the
book, hence the hard time given to Bahais, and heterodox groups like
Ahmadhis. Steve D.

Absolutely - just look at how the flowering of the Middle Ages corresponded
with a warm spell in the 9th to 1th centuries.

The printing press is from before the 16th century even. The Reformation is
a total disaster for religious open mindedness. Eventually though a near 150
years of religious carnage put many people firmly off religious dogmatism
and gave rise to the novel idea of true religious toleration. It also
undermined belief in Christianity among many of the elite. I also think the
switch in both Catholicism and Protestantism from Christianity as a
"religion of doing" where for most people it was simply something you did,
to a "religion of belief" where you had to believe things and know why you
believed them  eventually undermined belief among many. I think if you look
at the records you can see the shift starting in the very late 17th
century - as Greg points out Newton's great work is a major landmark. It's
at about that time that the great witch mania draws to a close as well.

Oooh, oooh, a question I can finally answer.
Slugs are these really nasty *slimey* little vermin
(overgrown worms really -- but one can at least use
worms to catch fish) from 2-5 inches long that like to
hang out in the boxes that allow access to my sprinkler
system.  They made the resurrection of my sprinkler system
this year (broken valve due to freezing damage a number
of years ago -- a long story I won't bore you with)
a distinctly unpleasant exercise.

I got even with them though -- I left the covers to
the boxes open drying out their normal habitat.  The
problem was that *then* they started migrating out of my
yard.  That made walking down walkway to enter my house a
dicey exercise at dusk or later.  They are *definitely*
something you wouldn't want to step on.

Lee -- if you like, I might still be able to find one or
more slugs still lurking in my yard.  I could box
them up (I'm fairly sure they haven't been classified
as hazmats) and ship them to you.  Now, I will claim
a complete lack of knowledge as to what you did with
them after you received them.  While I think they
are currently still considered primitive organisms
one never knows when the animal rights activists
will make slug baiting a felony offense.

If you aren't interested, then I could always ship them
to Anders (since he was kind enough to recently send me
his snail mail address).  In his winter climate it seems
likely that they would be sufficiently immobile that
even someone with as little firearms training as myself
ought to be able to disassemble them with a shotgun.

This does of course bring up (at least in my mind) the
problem of programmable self-assembling utility fog.
Utility foglets programmed to behave as slug sub-elements.
Even when blown apart by a shotgun blast, they seek out
each other and reassemble themselves.  Makes Mickey's
adventures with the broom in Fantasia seem like a warm-up
exercise.

This odd little letter is just one reason why you should
*always* be nice to people on the extropian list.  Its
not advisable to test how creative they can be (if they
happen to have one of those hormonal takeover events
that makes them annoyed with oneself).

Can you?  Presume N=2, and you're #2.  You can eliminate #1, in which
case, one instantiation of me[past] is gone, but me[now]() is still
around, and me[past]() is still around.

But you can't eliminate #2 without eliminating me[now], right?  So it's
not the case that you can eliminate either instantiation of me[past]
without eliminating [...] me[now]...?

(This is just to clarify that we're using the formalism the same way, not
because I think you've made a mistake.)

Something like that... still, we seem to disagree on whether "I" can refer

This is false, if taken literally.

You *are* the same person you were when you were six years old.  This
isn't to say that you aren't *also* the person you are now, but, come on,
you're also the person you were yesterday.

Your claim seems so odd that I fear I must have misunderstood it...  Have
I?

If "I" is automatically present tense, what are we to make of 1st person
claims in the past tense?  "I was hungry" must be a grammatical error...?

Damien -- I haven't been following this thread (I'm not even sure
why it has this title) and I may be taking your point in an entirely
orthogonal direction...

But -- the Sahara is a very energy rich region -- its only lacking in
water which is in relatively close proximity (i.e. salt water).  So
long as you have the energy available to tailor the salt concentrations
within cells to levels that most existing biological molecules find
tolerable -- or have the technologies to rapidly evolve new biological
molecules to tolerate altered salt concentrations  (both of which seem
on our technology horizon) then this scenario isn't the "banishment"
that one might expect.  In fact it might be an enabling path that
would lead to a population explosion and their subsequent distribution
through the solar system and eventually the galaxy.

It doesn't solve the problem that there may indeed be limited resources
in the universe and/or the lifetime of the universe may be limited.
It does however raise the head of the "Law of unintended consequences".
(Esp. those that extropians might find productive.)

All that glitters is not gold.
Some that is dull might be worth as much.

Last Sunday's Observer newspaper (UK) had an article about a new system
the UK Government has developed to use cellphone masts as radar masts
to track any moving object within range. Google has other references
that seem to validate the claim.
Initial uses envisaged seem to be for perimeter defence, e.g. around
nuclear power stations, where any movement could immediately be
investigated.

But civil liberties people are worried that the system could be used to
track suspects movements by following them via each cellphone mast they
pass. In UK that means continual surveillance. If you add in that within
two years every cellphone will have a unique tracking identifier, then
you have a pretty complete system.

And they are now researching using the radar to watch movements INSIDE
nearby buildings.
We'll have to use tin foil as wallpaper to keep them out.

You say that "strictly speaking" you're not the same person you were last
week...  But you also say that promises should be enforced in a "moral
context."  I presume we agree on the point that our mutual moral context
holds you presently responsible for promises you made in the past.

It's hard to imagine a reason why you might be responsible, unless you
have a very special historical relationship with the person who made the
promise.  You may refuse to call the relation "identity," (though, for
everyone else's sake, I hope you DO refer to it just like the identity
relation in ordinary conversation,) but whatever you call it, the
relationship is quite unique and morally relavent.

Whatever that morally relevant relationship may be, you have that same
morally relevant relationship to anything that instantiates me[past]().
The guy with me[1]() and the guy with me[2]() *both* have to honor
promises made by me[past](), whether or not you're prepared to call the
person with me[1]() "the same person" as the person with me[past]().

By bracketing the question of whether we should say that me[now] "the same
person" as me[past], I've attempted to show that, within our moral
context, we must make the same moral choices regardless.

If we speak in a language in which you must honor past promises because
you are "the same person", then we'll have a moral rule that requires
enforcement on account of this.  If, instead, we speak in a language in
which you must honor past promises made by your past-person, then we'll
have a moral rule that requires enforcement on account of your special
relationship to your past-person.  The rule is translated with the
language; practical choices remain invariant.

So, in particular, rule statements like "I should try to keep myself
alive" should be interpreted relative to their language.  If your
rule-statement is in a language in which "I" is first-person-only, then we
may translate it into a language in which "I" applies across time.  Then
it might be stated formally as "I should try to maintain me[now]."

Similarly, if the rule-statement is in a language in which "I" applies
across time, then we may translate it into a language in which "I" applies
only in the present tense: "I should try to keep myself and me[past]
alive."

Frankly, I find the latter rule most compelling; I find it compelling *for
the same reason* that I believe I should honor past promises now...  it
doesn't matter whether or not you let me call that reason an argument from
"identity".

[I may, of course, ask by what rule you speak "strictly" when you say that
you're not the same person as you were last week...?  But I think that'd
be tangential to the point: it doesn't matter what you call it, so long
as we share a moral context.]

I'm having difficulty with my cell phone.  I just spent 1/2 hr with tech
support to discover that the problem they suggested is the very same
problem I told them about.  Too many sales and not enough service
bandwidth. Reminds me of using AOL early on when they were doing the free
disk promotion and users got a constant busy signal, almost 24/7.

What cell phone service would you suggest as being the most user-friendly?*

*  little or no busy signals
*  little or no static interference
*  little or no poor reception

Thanks,
Natasha

### Wow, this is really cool! Spike, you read it? Maybe we wouldn't even
need to set up all those cameras, we could simply tap into the phone
network. I imagine tower owners might sell you tracking data, say, a plan
covering the 1 mile radius from your home, and a few minutes of roaming.
Yes, roaming with a cell phone might assume a totally different meaning -
peeking into places far away from your regular haunts.

I wonder when this system will come to Virginia. If we had it now, the
Virginia sniper would hardly even make it into national news - he would have
been caught after the first shooting.

Deliver basically means "save".  Death shall not save them from further 
punishment.  Killing them shall send them to Hell.

"Deliver us, Lord, from every Evil, and grant us peace in our day" - from 
the Catholic mass (what I can remember of it).

My point remains.

If death doesn't save non-believers from the Hell-fire, and they're 
going to die anyway, what's the use in killing them?

On reflection, I suppose that's best kept a rhetorical question as it 
can be answered in any number of odd ways - we kill the infidels to 
cleanse the earth, we kill the infidels to raise our standing before 
allah, we kill the infidels because it gives us joy-joy feelings.

In deference to Samantha's post; I believe FutureQ's original point 
also remains - and I'm paraphrasing here - on the whole, religion 
causes more problems than it solves and it's not limited to the faith 
of Islam.  I believe there *is* a place for religion in the world; I 
just wish its prominence weren't so, well, prominent - I guess.  :)

I really need to pack and get out of here (my flight leaves in the
morning and I have other things I must do later tonight) but as always
your messages are intriguing and worth addressing in as much detail as
possible...

In the second case above, in which we refer to two identities of the
same person, past and present, we have in my view no moral obligation to
keep a past promise unless breaking the promise would be morally
repugnant to the identity we are *presently*. This is to say we are in
no way obligated by our former self who made the promise. 

In other words, contrary to your words above, your moral obligation to
keep a promise made by your past-person is not as you claim "on account
of your special relationship to your past-person." It is rather on
account of your current moral assessment of the need to act consistently
with the promise.

A world in which people acted according to their best moral intuitions
at any given moment would be better than one in which people acted
against their moral intuitions at any given moment merely for sake of
keeping bad promises. I think people realize this intuitively, and that
this is one reason people often break promises. 

As I wrote to Lee, the fact that people often break promises is evidence
for my case that personality and identity change through time. 

Barring intentional deception (some people make promises they never
intend to keep) you who decided today to break your promise of yesterday
must not be the same person who made that promise yesterday, else you
would not be breaking the promise.

Hell, I can't even determine the "self" of myself (recent threads
involving Damien and Emlyn being cases in point).

Perhaps we should have two extropian list threads
(a) where you get to make up yourself (and others) being as
    close to (or beyond) the limits of physics as you can justify;
(b) where you get to freely speculate within our current knowledge
    base [i.e. must be based on and not violate conventional
    physics.]

Any takers...

Exactly! That's just how I perceive it. I'd have to

It is not witchcraft at all, if you have a 
representational view of awareness like that which 
Chalmers and others are arguing for more and more these 
days.

We have conscious knowledge of what surrounds our body 
in our head.  At the center of this conscious knowledge 
is the conscious knowledge of our body.  Again, all in 
our head even though it seems like it is reality 
itself.  We even have conscious knowledge of something 
best called a spirit, even though there is no real 
spirit in reality that this knowledge represents.  This 
knowledge of ourselves is represented as existing inside 
of our knowledge of our skulls, looking out of our eyes 
as if they were windows.  Even though this knowledge of 
ourselves doesnt represent any physical object or 
entity  it is still very important and very real.  In 
reality, this knowledge is really what we are.  It is 
the minds (I) even though it is only a conscious 
representation of such.  When having these types of 
discussions it is important to include this conscious 
representation of knowledge even thought there is 
nothing in reality it represents.

When we have an out of body experience, this knowledge 
of ourselves as a spirit, leaves our knowledge of our 
head  all of which is really simply the conscious 
knowledge in our brain.

There is no reason why two brains can not be 
subjectively merged together to produce a single 
awareness space.  In reality this is precisely what we 
have  a right and left hemisphere connected by the 
corpus collosum.  There is no reason other brains can 
not be merged with our brain in the same way.  Within 
such a merged space knowledge of ourselves could 
theoretically freely travel between enabling the kind of 
continuity most people think they require in order to be 
uploaded/transported right?

I don't Bloom deserves to be taken too seriously.  I read all of
"Lucifer Principle", and it's largely a propoganda piece for one
simple idea--the idea that memetic "superorganisms" as he calls
them can have major influence on history.  But his scholarship is
shoddy, and his rhetoric is precise and careful and calculated in
exactly the way one would expect of someone who is more interested
in pushing a point of view than in finding the truth.  Perhaps he
is so afraid if these memetic organisms because he himself so
easily falls prey to them.

What pretty much clinched it for me was that he actually argues
that conventional medicine out-competed homeopathy on memetic
grounds.  The fact that homeopathy is complete fraud and that
conventional medicine actually works was apparently irrelevant to
him, since he only saw the memetic competition, and completely
ignored the more rational basis for idea's success.  I don't see
any reason to think his opinions on religion are any better.

I think that if I had foreseen which direction this
thread might have taken, I might not have started it.

Has no one read Bastiat?  The "Broken Window" fallacy?
 Jeez.  OK, for the economically dis-informed:

Someone breaks a window.  So, now employment is
thereby created for the glazier, the glass
manufacturers, the sand diggers, the window
installers, etc., etc., etc.  Logically, then, if we
wanted to get REALLY prosperous, we ought to break
every window in town, and, by extension, burn the
whole place down and maim ourselves in the process so
that the doctors and hospitals would make a whole lot
of money and we would all get rich from the trickle
down.  Right?

WRONG.  All the people whose work contributed to
replacing the window would have been doing OTHER
productive things with their time.  The net economic
effect of a broken window is the cost of one window,
including labor.  This is a minus, not a plus.

The net result of most wars is that a whole lot of
property gets destroyed and a lot of people are killed
or injured.  Although there has always been an
undercurrent of propaganda to the effect that war
somehow brings prosperity - fueled by the profits that
certain isolated defense sectors of the economy derive
- usually even the victors are much worse off.  

One of the propaganda pieces goes that WWII pulled the
U.S. out of the Great Depression.  In fact, it was all
the Federal manipulations of the money supply and
their equally disasterous "fixes" that created the
Great Depression and kept us in it for so long.  (Oh,
and it was the net losses of WWI catching up with us
that triggered it to begin with.)  

When we got sucked into WWII, the expansion of the
money supply finally killed the ongoing deflation that
had prevented anyone from investing in production and
had thereby locked us into a downward spiral, but that
could have been handled other ways, and in fact we
were already emerging from the Depression before the
war, albeit slowly.

I'm reminded of when my boss - reportedly a strong
admirer of a certain Herr Shicklegrubber - allegedly
told some of the new college grads how the Holocaust
death camps had advanced medicine by 50 years, due to
all the unfettered scientific experimentation that
went on.  Hey, and they almost had the Bomb, too!

The only real thread of possible truth to this idea
that war somehow brings good in the form of prosperity
or technical advances is in those societies in which a
parasitical ruling class eats up so much of the
production for useless, non-productive luxuries that
little or nothing is left to invest in R & D.  Then,
being forced to shift resources into defense and the
related R & D may actually yield a positive net return.

Also, carry a handkerchief. If you take more than a few minutes to
escape the aircraft, you will need more air than is in the bag. Tie the
bag tight around your head just below your nose, so you can see and
rebreath fine. Piss on the handkerchief, place it over your mouth, and
breath through it. The piss removes the toxins in the air (this was the

Since you asked: 

You appear to me to love the fine art of sophistry. I feel you'd rather
turn a clever phrase in defense of nonsense than seek the truth.

But getting back to your "equivalency of duplicates argument," (I don't
want to let this become another What's-Wrong-With-Lee thread), you
ignore the differences in the personalities of duplicates that must
arise after the time of duplication. As I and others have acknowledged,
there is a divergence not only in memory, but also in *personality*,
that occurs after copying. Those divergences make the original and
alleged copy into two distinct individuals.

Can you think of a better term? My frozen copy from the past contains
imprints of memories that are a subset of my own memories. Vaporizing
his copy of those memories does not destroy my copy of them.

This line of reasoning also leads to the absurd conclusion that two
entirely different people are actually the same personality. For example
you could argue that your lack of any memory of being me is equivalent
to having "forgotten" all memories of being me, and that your
personality is thus identical to mine in the same way that my past
copy's is identical to mine. But obviously you are not me. Your argument
fails by reductio ad absurdum.

I would regard it as survival of someone very similar to me, but not me.
I am the person who died -- not the person who was frozen two weeks ago
and later restored. 

To illustrate, I may have experienced some major changes in my
personality after my last backup. Perhaps as a result of some traumatic
experience in the last week before I died, I experienced a religious
conversion and decided with firm resolve to commit my life to the god
Thor. Would my non-religious backup be a true copy of me, the devoted
servant of Thor? Hardly. We would be two entirely different people with
different beliefs, values, hopes and dreams.

I would doubt that piss removes toxins universally - a wet rag gets rid of 
some smoke, and people tasked with cleaning up scenes of mass killings have 
used kerchiefs soaked in gasoline to kill the smell...but it does nothing 
for poisons...the alkaline nature of urine might be a good shield against 
acids - which burning plastics tend to generate (HCl).

Urine is a good sterile fluid to use to wash out a wound, in dire straits - 
IF the donor has no urinary infections...

I think we can also bracket a certain set of questions about when promises
ought to be kept, to consider directly the question of why you would have
*any* present reason at all to keep any promises whatsoever.

Suppose we're in an ordinary and uncontroversial case of promise keeping.
You need money for the bus; I lend you that money on the condition that
you pay it back to me the following day.  The next day, you have enough
money on you and are more than capable of paying me back.  Suppose as well
that you have no other moral obligation to do something else/better with
that money.

Whether or not you're the "same person" you were the day before, you have
*some* present moral obligation to pay me back.  Why?  Why (within our
moral context) would your moral assessment of the situation show that you
should pay me back?

Obviously, others might argue that it has to do with the fact that you're
the same person who made the promise.  You can reject that, and even use
that rejection to give an account of why promise-keeping isn't something
we want to do at all costs.  But then you've got to give some other
account within our moral context.

I'd argue that it at least has to do with at special relationship you have
with the person who made the promise, regardless of whether it's called
"identity."  What's wrong with that picture?  How could anything be wrong
with the idea of an unnamed "special relation"?

Quotes from What Muslims Don't Tell You by Abdullah Al Araby (includes 
Hadith)
=============
Islam does not permit freedom of choice regarding religion
"Fight those who believe not in God nor the last day. " Surah 9:29

Islam does not teach the equality of all people
"Ye (Muslims) are the best of peoples, evolved for mankind..." Surah 3:110

Any person who accepts Islam, then later turns away from it will be subject 
to death.
Mohammed said, "Whoever changes his Islamic religion, kill him." Hadith vol. 
9:57

A Muslim may not be killed if he kills an infidel
Mohammed said: "No Muslim should be killed for killing a Kafir (infidel). " 
Hadith vol. 9:50

Ethnic cleansing is practiced
Mohammed said to the Jews "The earth belongs to Allah and His apostle, and I 
want to expel you from this land (the Arabian Peninsula), so, if anyone owns 
property, he is permitted to sell it." Hadith vol. 4:392

Why Saudia Arabia does not allow churches to be erected on its soil:
Mohammed's last words were: "Turn the pagans (non-Muslims) out of the 
Arabian Peninsula." Hadith vol. 5:716

Resisting Islam, punishable by death, crucifixion or the cutting off of the 
hands and feet (Surah 5:33)
[5.33 The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His apostle and 
strive to make mischief in the land is only this, that they should be 
murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on 
opposite sides or they should be imprisoned; this shall be as a disgrace for 
them in this world, and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous 
chastisement,]

These rules will be imposed also on non-Muslims in an Islamic State
"If any one desires a religion other than Islam, never will it be accepted 
of him." Surah 3:85

No opposition party is allowed in an Islamic State
"O ye who believe obey God and the apostle and those charged with authority 
among you. If you differ in anything among yourselves, refer it to God and 
His apostle." Surah 4:59

If you don't abide by these laws, you are considered:
An unbeliever (Surah 5:47)
A wrong-doer (Surah 5:48)
A rebel (Surah 5:50)

Violence
Allah orders Muslims in the Quran to terrorize non-Muslims on His behalf
"I will instill terror into the hearts of the unbelievers, smite ye above 
their necks and smite all their finger-tips of them.It is not ye who slew 
them; it was Allah." Surah 8:13-17 (See also Surah 8:60 & 9:14)

Mohammed practiced violence to force people into Islam
Mohammed said, "I have been ordered to fight with the people till they say, 
none has the right to be worshipped but Allah." Hadith vol. 4:196

Mohammed also said, "Know that paradise is under the shades of the swords." 
Hadith vol 4:73

Fritz has thumped the Iceman himself,
Vladimir Kramnik!  The man known for
keeping his cool under intense pressure
has crumbled in game 6, to lose with the
white pieces.  The score is now tied at
3 points each, with two games to go.

I am in total awe of Fritz7.

Furthermore, this game was won honestly
by Fritz, no horrifying blunders by the
human.  Fritz demonstrated brilliant defence,
and the deadly calculating fearlessness for
which computers are so deservedly famous.

I guess we now get to call Kramnik
the slushman.  {8^D

I actually hope for a draw Thursday.  I want
to see how the world's best carbon unit does when
he goes into Saturday's game knowing if he
wins, a million bucks.  Draw, half a million,
a loss, NaaaaDaaaaa! The pure drama is worth
the wait.

Oy Vey!  A ft-lb is a force times a distance.  A newton
is a force.  See what a mess the English units
cause us?  It is Britain's revenge for that nasty
General Washington affair back in 76.

A newton is about a quarter of a pound, if
you really really must know it in those terms.
2.2046/9.81 = 0.225 pounds force to the newton.
About the weight of a stick of butter.

Oy veeeeeyyyyyy!  No Lee, no no my son, do not
mess up the MKS system the way the English system
is already messed up.  Do not even utter the words
1 Kg weight.  Baaad boy Lee! Bad!

Kilograms are mass units only.  ONLY!

The English system can be partially rehabilitated
if one throws out the unit pound mass, and uses
pound ONLY for force and slugs ONLY for mass.  On
the earth, a slug weighs 32.2 pounds.  That way
the equations all work the same way between
systems, and the only damage to our collective
American psyche is that we have wacky looking units.
But we still get the right answers.

Did you mean ft-lbs to newton meters?  A newton meter
is a unit of work, also called a joule.  A joule per
second is a watt.  Great system, very simple,
elegant, none of those ugly horsepower units.

Would you care to elaborate more upon this?  In my
opinion it is also the way in which a scholar would
approach conveying said opinion were it true...

in that he is threatened by them who are subject to
them, or that he, himself is mentally subject to their
devices?

"...Because the measure of the success of a web of
memes--a myth, a hypothesis, or a dogma--is not its
truth but how well it serves as social glue." -p.108

and in fact he's addressing this on more than just
medicine throughout the book.

Barbaric medicine outsurvived its falacies being
brought to light, there must be a different catalyst
then it's truth.  I don't see why this wouldn't apply
to homeopathy.  In fact science, many times throughout
history (I assume instances like Galileo are common
knowledge enough not to cite) has been temporarily
thwarted by the ruling class.  It's only when it gets
enough force of believers that a change occurs.  
 
and in fact when you say homeopathy is *complete*
fraud, are you entirely denying that eating certain
herbs can in effect help boost the immune system as in
eating healthy always can?  Or just the more fanatical
aspects of it?

> I don't see

which opinions?  Referring above; that he suggests its
success was in forming a social glue?  There were many
other comments he had about religion, so in lieu of
presenting them all as questions, I'll end this here...

Roger that.  The blood of these victims of the Virginian

and most rape victims in the past 8 years at least.
We have had the tech to stop this kind of crime and we
didn't use it, all in the name of privacy.

broad brush condemnation of Moslems as I know too many personally where that

       However based on the comments I read when I lurk on the Moslem site I 
found the Bloom piece representative of maybe 50 or 60 percent of the people 
commenting.
       In addition this has been my experience in face to face encounters as 
well as in reading press.  There does seem to be a rather large number of 
radicals out there that don't mean us any good.  Nor can I find that the 
radicals hate us for any wrong we have done them.  However they do seem to 
use real or imagined wrongs as a means of whipping up the moderates.

I was going to sift through my copy and compare the quotes, but as mine 
isn't enumerated and doesn't include the Hadith - it seemed like a 
thankless exercise in futility.  I did manage to find the first quote 
rather easily and have included it in the bottom of this email.

Though as previously stated, it's all in interpretation and 
presentation.  No point in dragging this thread out.

The keyword here is *mutual* transparency.  Let's start by tracking all 
elected officials and legislators, and any bureaucrat making more than 
$50,000/year, then work our way down.

I totally transparently agree! Of course this will one day mean someone watching

For those accusing me of intolerance all I can say is I am merely intolerant of
not being tolerated. I sure don't advocate forcing anyone to believe one way or
another as it seems from these quotes Islam appears to. Kudos to Avatar
Polymorph for posting these quotes. There should be no doubt now that just as I
said those that believe and live by these words are a danger to our dreams and
the entire world. Kind of reminds me of Dune were 10,000 years from now the only
remaining religion seems very Islam-ish.

It appears that even those that might try to modernize and soften Islam are in
danger themselves of Mohammed's wrath. Scarry stuff.

This, as far as I'm concerned, does not cut any slack for the other major tomes
either. In this day of science and learning and (hoped for) respect for life and
freedom, these tomes each have their own violent and archaic, outdated, and yes,
'intolerable' precepts that modern humans should not have to be affronted by. I
look for the day we all grow up and give up on phantoms and the books that
support belief in them.

To me Extropianism means the humans becoming as close to what historically we've
considered the domain of godhood as possible. Who or what will we worship then?
Why?

Only if you do it outdoors, FutureQ.  I maintain
that our front door can and should form the dividing
line between private and public life.  In-home privacy
is sacred, even to the staunch transparency advocate.

To some degree, we would voluntarily extend that curtain
of privacy to our offices and of course public restrooms,
locker rooms, etc.  spike

Roger that.  See how fast most of the sillier laws
disappear off the books.  The ones that would remain
are those that have a clear and present *victim*.
(Self, as a victim, doesnt count.  Why, for instance,
is there a law against suicide?)  They would be
laws that practically every rational person
would agree that we need to have.  spike

Is the statement self-inclusive? :-)

In point of fact, human beings depend on the ability to draw 
conclusions and proceed on the basis of them before there is 
sufficient evidence.  Perhaps this is overcome by the intention 
behind "believe" in the above.

Knowing where everyone is and knowing what everyone did are very 
different things.  So no, this would not result in the immediate 
apprehension of the sniper.

By the same logic that made transparency seem good elsewhere we 
shouldn't mind too much if "duly authorized" personal use 
technology *now* available to look right through our walls and 
observing anything they feel justified in observing.  The logic 
does not stop at your door.  Unfortunately.  I would also point 
out that even "limited" transparency like the above utterly 
removes the ability to organize mount any serious opposition to 
the current rulers.  It nearly removes the ability to 
successfully opt-out.  Why would you want this kind of power in 
the hands of those folks who gave you whatever list of things 
you find most odious about the powers that be today?

Your message gets confused if you let it be read as "All Muslims 
or all religious people are EVIL" instead of "Islam is dangerous 
and there are also real dangers in all religions and in 
religious belief".  See the difference?

A lot depends on what you call "religion".  Personally I think a 
form of cyber-gnoticism is quite compatible with Extropianism. 
I think taking on in real-time the creation of heaven on earth 
is compatible with Extropianism and can advance the cause. 
Being a techno-bodhisattva, dedicated to the well-being of all 
sentients and freeing them from suffering, is compatible with 
extropianism and can advance the cause.  Seeing technology as 
God (or the diety of one's choice) giving us the means to 
overcome all physical adversity and to "grow up" into the 
fullness of phrases some religions apply to human beings such as 
"the children of God" is, imho, quite compatible with 
extropianism and can well advance the cause.

If you could use the religion-shaped aspects of human 
psychological and social structures to advance all the 
transcendent good goals of religion but do so within and using 
the reality of science and technology and spread such memes this 
could greatly advance extropic goals.

The best of spirituality and religion has a lot to say about 
going beyond the evolutionary programming, the human defaults 
and seeing oneself as One and considering the well-being of all 
ones own well-being.  This sort of stuff might easily save us 
from using our wonderful technology to enslave ourselves or 
frittering away any and all possible utopias for the sake of 
continuing scarcity-model, evolution-enforced competitive 
patterns - selling our future for a larger pile of green than 
those around us, disowning one another as we rush once again to 
"get ours".

Does that give you a few ideas in answer to the question?

It is not at all "obvious" that it is religion or primarily 
religion that is opposed to certain new technologies or new 
technology in general.  Some of those technologies are opposed 
even more vigorously in some European countries where the 
density of fundamentalist religious folks is far lower than in 
the US.  Perhaps you need to read a bit more deeply than the 
"hadlines".

A quote from the second Pinker URL in ct's message
(far below):

> Some people, most of them men, are born
> with criminal tendencies.

Now compare this with the writings of the great 19th
century investigator, Cesare Lombroso, Professor
of Criminal Anthropology at the Univerity of Turin:

     "Criminal behavior arises from inevitable
     tendencies determined by the organic
     constitution of the delinquent."

See the following for more of his theories of crime:
http://www.maps.jcu.edu.au/hist/stats/lomb/lombro3.htm

For more personal information about our forgotten
heroic savant---author of the widely acclaimed
L'Uomo Delinquente (1876; "Criminal Man")---who
was indeed a pioneer a century ahead of his time,
see

http://www.epub.org.br/cm/n01/frenolog/lombroso.htm

Look into his eyes and tell me you don't see Truth!

But sir!  I meant the force that a mass of 1kg

Well, you will probably turn out to be right,
but I *want* to think about the force of a mass
of 1kg in Earth's gravity.

Then I strive onwards (back to the drawing board

Yes; somehow my conversion technique resulted in 
joules.  I'm going back to study it again.

Actually, I heard that it takes a kind of super-horse
to maintain 1 horsepower.  And indeed, if you run up
a flight of stairs you're expending a *lot* of energy
per second---several horsepower IIRC.

Here is how to convert from pounds to newtons (both
units of force) and from foot-pounds to joules (both
units of energy) without touching repellant slug.

Input:  our familiar knowledge that one kilogram
        is about the same as 2.2 pounds, and
        one foot is about 12*2.45 centimeters,
        or .3048 meters.  (Yes, I know that this
        "common" daily way of speaking conceals
        great perils.  Boy, do I know!)

So, from F = MA

2.20452 lbs (force)  =  1kg * 9.8 nt-m/sec^2  (mass times acceleration)

Therefore 1 lb = 9.80554/2.20452 kg nt-m/sec^2

               = 4.448 newtons

or, as Spike wrote, a newton is about one-quarter
pound.

Next

1 ft-lb = 1 lb * 1 ft (force times distance)

        = 4.448 newtons * .3048 meters

        = 1.356 newton-meters

        = 1.356 joules,

so a joule is also .7374 joules, though one 
doesn't want the conversion THAT WAY, because
the 1 ft-lb = 1.356 joules is the one you need
to go from the awful English units to the sane
metric ones.

I hope that this finally meets with approval 
from Spike's careful eye.

I think there are a number of principles with privacy. It should be 
respected except with regard to ensuring sysop is in place including with 
regard to ensuring protective shielding, access to resources (including 
assemblers and self-boosting tech), access to exiting mechanisms from 
virtuality (VR) and the like. Not good to have Saddam torturing Iraqi 
dissidents in some bad VR environment (some "hell")  for example. Finally 
where privacy is violated for the above reasons, the information should 
remain confidential (i.e. used for that purpose alone and not actively 
disseminated outside that). That's my view.

People always seem to forget that there is a land between total
transparency and attempts at a cloaked cyphertopia: open societies. Since
it is easier to discuss tech than social stuff, we often forget that the
best way of dealing with tech like this is the creation or change of
social institutions. If the government is spying, you better change the
government or make sure it is kept accountable.

Am I the only one who thinks that a system allowing you to obtain complete
trajectories and fingerprints of all moving objects on a 24/7/365 manner
in realtime something that is bound to be abused, and abused horribly? 
Think of all the pattern matching and crosscorellation analysis you could 
do with that data. <SHUDDER>

Technology is an asymmetrical enabler, since favouring centralism. Why
giving up privacy, which is irreversible, in face of statistically
insignificant threats? The mind boggles.

Think microphones on a grid as well as cameras.  The
mics triangulate on the position of a gunshot.  When
someone falls dead, they figure out the gunshot was
not someone hunting or setting off fireworks.  The
cameras help figure out who done it.  spike

This is the most important point.  As transparency
increases, we must compensate by decreasing the amount
of political power that anyone gets.  They dont need
as much power.  A U.S. president would be like a mayor,
except with a reallly big city and a lot of people
looking over her shoulder.  Police couldnt look
thru walls without getting caught.  spike

It depends a whole lot on the economic surround.  You are assuming that 
the benefits of the efforts of those needed to repair the situation will 
descend to them in like manner if they are not required to repair the 
situation.  This isn't the way things tend to work.  Mind you, 
frequently the emergency repair people are worse off if there is a large 
disaster, but they are also worse of if there are no minor disasters for 
awhile.  Fire-fighter benefits are cut, etc.

Yes, the broken window is a fallacy.  But the explanation isn't simple, 
it's complex, and possibly chaotic.  If the galazier has no windows to 
repair, e.g., he might loose his shop.  Then when windows need 
repairing, there's nobody to do it.  And they will need repairing, 
eventually.  But in the mean time, the landlord doesn't want to support 
the glazier, even though the community needs him.

Do you really think that they would enforce the laws just because they 
could?  They'll do just as they do right now.  Save the law until they 
want to pin something on someone, and they can't get him on anything real.

Ok, fine.  The question then arises as to *why* that is the case?

Is there a fundamental human character trait that makes one wake
up in the morning and go out into the world and promote "hatred"
(as in "prejudiced hostility or animosity" [Merriam-Webster])?

> Nor can I find that the radicals hate us for any wrong we have

Ah-ha (maybe) -- on this basis the "radicals" are promoting "animosity"
to generate a larger power base (presumably).  But is the larger power
base organized to preserve a historical world view (i.e. Muslims must
defeat Christians or Jews), or is it organized to uplift an underclass
(i.e. impoverished Arabic individuals)?

It would appear (to me) that there are multiple paths for "uplifting"
(as in improving economic conditions).  Why is there a focus by people
(from say the Palestinians to the Tamil [I could add *lots* of other
"tribes" here]) on eliminating the "opposition" instead of finding
those paths?

Does the problem lie in the quest for power by the leaders instead of
the seeking of economic uplifting for the masses?

I'll make a side note that Osama Bin Laden and Al-Queda seem to be
dedicated to tearing things apart.  That seems to me to be an
unextropic position unless a greater vision is proposed in place
of what already exists (even then it seems desirable to propose
an extropic means of taking what previously exists apart).
I'm unaware of such a proposal.

The "real" question I may be asking here is whether the so called
"leaders" of disenfranchised groups have a legitimate claim for
improving their situation (i.e. they have a "plan") or whether
they are individuals operating primarily for their own self-advantage?

If you could manage that, then this might be something less than a 
nightmare.  How, though, are you proposing to manage it?  The people 
pushing this system the hardest are those anxious to *increase* their power.

Actually slugs, being composed of normal matter don't
"repel" more than any other entity.  All matter repels
since it involves the force of negative electrons coming
into contact with each other.

While Lee's post is some very nice documentation on how
to convert betweeen various units it doesn't deal with the
more significant issue of what to do about slugs.

I have discussed this at greater length in:

Robert,
       I think I have seen evidence for both of those and perhaps evidence of 
a third path also -- the path of the religious fanatic.
       Right after 911 I was talking to a young Moslem male.  He was probably 
between 25 & 30 y.o.  He was hanging his head and roundly cursing the guys 
that initiated the 911 attack.  He told me how he and his family had came 
here and not only worked hard but had a lot of progress for their work.  His 
view was that the 911 attackers were messing things up for everyone.
       As to bin Laden I think he is in this for self aggrandisement -- power 
and wealth.  Some tell me he isn't but as I look at his moves it appears that 
he is.  For someone to tell me he isn't after power & wealth is like 
insisting that a bank robber isn't after the money.  He is promoting one 
agenda verbally but I notice that the achieveing of that agenda will bring 
him lots of power and wealth.
       I have also been face to face with two men that told me their theories 
on the motives of United States.  Both of them seemed totally disconnected 
from reality.  They were easy to distinguish from folks that honestly 
disagreed with us on this matter or that.  I have also heard a lot of this on 
the Moslem list where I listen.  Some of those people have complaints that 
are totally disconnected from anything we have ever actually done or even 
thought of doing.

Could you expand on this, and especially give some evidence for it?

That some tech promotes centralism (client-server architectures) and
other promotes decentralization (like PCs and portable cameras) is
fairly obvious; statements about tech in general are far more
interesting. If we look at societies where technology is introduced, do
we see it causing centralism? If we look at the kind of societies where
technology develops fast, are they highly centralist or move in a
centralist direction? I think the answer to the second question(s) is a
clear no to the first part - the technological societies are on average
the least centralistic and power-distant societies - and the level of
centralisation change seems better described in terms of other
tendencies. 

I also think that the changes in centralism in countries where tech is
introduced are far from irreversible; I could imagine that at first
elites get the expensive tech, but if the country starts to develop
economically there is also a high level of equalisation of tech access
and a general trend towards decentralisation.  But it would be nice to
have some discussion about this. 

Is there any good measure of how technological a country is? If there
is, I could play around a bit with some sociological data about
power-distance etc. Hmm, maybe one could look at the ratio of high-tech
production to low-tech production. Time to look up the CIA world
factbook...

On the other hand, the NSA has repeatedly been critiziced for gathering
enormous amounts of data which nobody has any real use for. Sifting
through the sheer mass is too much work, and automated techniques will
produce enormous amounts of suspicious patterns that have to be studied
by humans, mostly resulting in nothing useful. Unless one assumes some
magical AI a huge system like this would likely be more of a drain of
resources than a 1984 nightmare. It won't be security through obscurity,
but rather inefficiency through too much data acquisition. 

Besides, would systems like the one that started this thread even be
helpful against a sniper? Tracking bullets seems to require a higher
resolution than I can imagine you get using microwave/radio signals from
the existing systems. Even if you could do the tracking accurately, the
information that the sniper was at location X at time Y might not be
very helpful if location X is (say) the roof of a building filled with
people where he could vanish into the crowd quickly. The assumption seems
to be that the police would immediately know something was afoot and
immediately appear at location X; in reality there are lots of delays
that just makes the system helpful in doing the investigation - it does
not solve the crime immediately. 

I see the temptation in the system, and the false security it could
create. But the important thing for all privacy advocates is to make sure
that whenever proposals for employing systems like these are made, clear
demands for accountability and efficiency testing are made. So far it is
often a choice between no system or a system (where the pro-system side
usually wins in the present climate of paranoia), not a choice between no
system and a monitored system.

The usually valid assumption is, whatever their other goals, one of 
their goals is to increase their own power.  I think this could even 
have been said validly of Ghandi.  When people organize power, one of 
the things they intend is to use that power to forward their own ends. 
 These ends are subject to change as their environment changes, so the 
other original goals will not necessarily continue, whether laudable or 
vile.  There's nothing surprising about successful criminals going into 
business, or successful businessmen going into crime.  The label isn't 
the thing.  We may call a person a businessman, but that just means that 
it's an easy observable.  It doesn't mean that it's near the core of his 
self-identity.  Similarly, a politician is more likely to become radical 
if he sees a good chance of that gaining him support.  His espoused 
goals aren't to be trusted.  But if it's a route to power, he's likely 
to maintain it.

N.B.:  I didn't say anything about sincerity.  People are really good 
about being sincere.  And then changing their minds when it becomes 
convenient.  And they really were sincere, to the best of their own 
knowledge.  So I don't weigh sincerity very heavily.

Uplifting only happens when the exterior conditions make it feasible. 
 Social controls are the main force preventing "uplift".  Of course, 
these include not only local forces, but also things like the WTO.  But 
the knowledge of what to do to achieve ends is available.  The social 
mechanisms to facilitate its use are less common.  
Some of these are individual (inculcated), and
Some are dispersed:  Beliefs about how to be successful, Status of 
people who do various things, hold various jobs,  Attitude towards 
corruption, theft,  etc.  Governmental policies towards large and small 
enterprises.  Etc.  
And some are external, here I would rank the WTO as being on the same 
level as an invading army.  That's only slightly extreme.  If you don't 
comply with the WTO, then the invading army will be along shortly.

It sure seems that way.  I do have to continually remind myself that 
almost all of my information has been filtered through the government, 
and to remember the propaganda efforts of prior wars, and what relation 
the truth had to the news, however.

I don't think it works that way.  Leaders often have a plan, but this is 
not in distinction to their operating for their own self-advantage.  You 
can be practically guaranteed that they are operating for their own 
self-advantage **>>as they see it, given their value system<<**.  That 
says nothing either good or bad about them.  Knowing their value system 
would help in understanding them, if you feel you need to.  I'm not sure 
that it would , by itself, help in predicting their actions.  For that 
you need a more detailed knowledge of their model of how the world 
works, what their current place in the world is, and what their options 
are.  I don't think that I can trust government propaganda to supply 
that information in any reliably useable form.

With a flurry of private email suggesions for better ways to communicate on
cell phones, I thought that since I'm having the challenge of
cell-phone-calamity others might want to know the results of my query.

Most responses were in support of AT&T and Verizon.  One reply was in
support of Tmobile and one for Sprint.

Overstating the case a bit, aren't you?  I'm, otoh, quite dissapointed
with the series until now.  Pretty much every game that kramnik won, it
would have won against any other computer, every game he lost, he would
have lost to every computer since about 1998 or so.  The draws are
trickier to tell, but none of them seemed to show any brilliance by the
computer.

Doesn't work like that.  Win is +1.0 million, draw, +0.8 million, loss
+0.6 million.  win,win,win.

Technology in forms of distributed surveillance and centralized databases 
with statistical methods gives an edge to the rulers, not the ruled. In 
theory the ruled could develop decentralized software and user-owned 
infrastructure to control the LEOs, and work around the power monopoly 
handicap.

In practice there's both no talent and no drive. 

Deployment of such pedestrian cryptography techniques as MUA-MTA and
MTA-MTA is dependent upon single activists. How lame is that? Do you see
the video feeds of literally millions of surveillance cameras in UK and
Germany being made avaliable to anybody but the LEOs? I don't think so.
How many of us here could write a really useful machine vision package to
robustly extract biometrics from lousy video feeds, and to make hundreds
of thousands of people run the software, especially if it's illegal to
record your friendly LEO at work (it is, and where it isn't we can think
of something to harass you until you think twice before doing it again).

Thus there is a consensus amongst any cypherpunks with a modicum of clue
that going Brinworld in the current world order is a massively Bad Idea.  
The chips may turn some day, but unlikely, given human nature.

If you've been watching the trends in technology over the last two decades
you'll see that so far the technology, even wielded inefficiently, has
deepened the power asymmetry. There's definitely a danger of going
Emergent in our future.

Terrorists, schmerrorists. The prudent approach is to resist the erosion
of privacy. Unconditionally.

### Actually, homeopathy is not about eating herbs - it's a doctrine based
on the theories of Paracelsus, that a poison which causes certain symptoms
will prevent the same symptoms if taken in a very small dose. In practice,
homeopathy means taking a drop of an active substance (e.g strychnine),
diluting it in a pail of water, then taking a drop and again diluting in a
pail of water...etc., then using the resulting "medicine" to treat any
condition that resembles symptomatically the effects of, in this example,
strychnine poisoning. By the time the dilution is done, the number of active
ingredient molecules in the preparation could be probably counted by hand
(if you could pick them out with an atomic force microscope).

Homeopathy is 100% pure bunk.

Did I mention that while shaking the dilution you are supposed to keep the

Do you think that people who invented psyops will stop using it for some
reason? I don't trust much what is being said about intelligence's
abilities, or lack thereof. Oh the poor, overworked, incompetent dearies.  
Right.

It is hard not to see funny patterns in design and especially design
omissions of officially approved and officially suggested cryptosystems (a
way where you cannot let your hand not show) if you watch them for a few
years. I think it's better to titrate paranoia at a tolerable tradeoff
between cheerful disregard and hiding in the bunker hugging your assault
rifle, and assume your adversary is efficient, intelligent, and puts its
budget to reasonably good use, adding estimates of what the classified
capabilities could be.

> Sifting through the sheer mass is too much work, and automated

I do think that Echelon is for real, and that it involves OCR for faxes,
realtime and offline speech recognition for voice and pipes everything
which in clear past sophisticated AI that doesn't just look at keywords,
but also the meaning, and to use filtering and ranking for sources, and
crosscorellate traffic. Whom were you talking to, Tim May? Been browsing 
StormFront, and doing really interesting Google searches, eh? How very 
interesting.

I would be extremely surprised if there wasn't a database slot with my
name on it, which contains my entire traffic, voice included. I doubt that
human eyeballs have seen it, or will ever see it (unless I do something
terminally stupid), but it's sitting there, slowly being filled up.

I don't think theres a slot for everybody in the world, or even everybody
on this list, but it's technically and financially feasible. Professional
paranoia thus would require to assume that anything going over in clear
gets intercepted, analyzed, and probably stored verbatim for later
retrieval and reanalysis.

> techniques will produce enormous amounts of suspicious patterns that

Suspicious patterns are also just information, which can be stored. You
don't/can't act on all of it. If you recrunch more of the data with the
same or the same data with more sophisticated algorithms you can reduce
the amount of noise. Any spook hates one thing: losing bits.

> have to be studied by humans, mostly resulting in nothing useful.

Human eyeballs are a scarce resource, so you only let them see highest
ranking hits. Your rate of success is being fed back into ranking
algorithm design. You refine it for a few decades, using really bright
people, you get rather good results.

> Unless one assumes some magical AI a huge system like this would

You should look at some NSAs patents. And that's unclassified information, 
you can assume that they can do lots better than what they're 
(deliberately) letting you know.

Storage is cheap. Crunch is less so, especially intelligent crunch, but 
you can reprocess the archives afterwards.

This isn't about snipers, or terrorists. They're just useful idiots. If
they weren't there one would be forced to invent them. It doesn't matter
who's responsible for 9/11 or blowing up these dancing club visitors in
Bali, the only thing which matters is what will this be used to motivate.

If he was dumb enough to have a cellphone along with him, and there are
records of all cellphone IDs with their cell assignments there's going to
be just one ID occuring at all sites of shootings. At some point in the
future this will be doable with blanket license plate OCR, blanket
biometrics, or other remote fingerprinting methods. Having a classifyable
total record over all moving object's trajectories is just a holy Grail,
you can do a lot with much patchier, haphazard info.

Of course not. But everything will be used as excuse to boost
capabilities. Sell more hardware (benefits industry), less jobless
security consultants (benefits persons), show you're a politician doing
Something Good for Your Country (and your own pocket). Completely win-win.

The best system is those you don't have to explain, because it's
invisible. If you have to install accountability, you can always modify or
deliberately let it break afterwards. In any case you'll have trouble
inspecting something you don't know is there; you're not allowed to;
requiring skills you don't have.

There's your assymetry.

My apologies, I'd actually never cared what it really
was, and a quick examination of pro-homeopathy
web-sites gives very misleading information as to what
it is.

Still, I don't know that this makes Howard Bloom's
opinions about memetic warfare any different, but am
curious to hear a more detailed critique of his ideas
from anyone who may disagree with the Lucifer Principle.

It does, of course; that's the reason many such "alternative"
practices still exist despite being useless.  I'm not denying
memetic influence.  But Bloom actually imples that modern
medicine succeeded /only/ for memetic reasons rather than its
actual superiority.  That's a ridiculous claim.

I'm talking about specifically Homeopathy, not herbs or
other alternative stuff.  Homeopathic medicines don't
contain "herbs" or any other ingredients--they are pure
distilled water.  They list ingredients on the label which
are used in their preparation, but the final medicines
don't actually contain any of what's listed (which is a
good thing, because most of the ingredients themselves are
poisonous).

I'm not sure it's possible to have that dividing line even if we
wanted it.  I think there will come a time when our culture does
have to "grow up" a bit to the point where video of Pamela Anderson
picking her nose won't be newsworthy, and so we will have less
need or desire for that kind of privacy.

True enough that this will probably not work for non-living poisons, but
it is amusingly similar to the idea of inoculations against bacterial

### Actually, homeopathy is not about eating herbs - it's a doctrine
based
on the theories of Paracelsus, that a poison which causes certain
symptoms
will prevent the same symptoms if taken in a very small dose. In
practice,
homeopathy means taking a drop of an active substance (e.g strychnine),
diluting it in a pail of water, then taking a drop and again diluting in
a
pail of water...etc., then using the resulting "medicine" to treat any
condition that resembles symptomatically the effects of, in this
example,
strychnine poisoning. By the time the dilution is done, the number of
active
ingredient molecules in the preparation could be probably counted by
hand
(if you could pick them out with an atomic force microscope).

Homeopathy is 100% pure bunk.

Did I mention that while shaking the dilution you are supposed to keep
the
vessel properly oriented to the Earth's magnetic field?

### Not really. A truly powerful opposition to a (quasi)democratic system
like in the US is the *open* opposition, not revoluzzers scheming in

### "Power" is not given, it's taken. As soon as a technology exists, the
power-hungry ones will stop at nothing to control it. You don't need to
"hand" it to them - they'll take it. By hobbling the popular use of
surveillance technology you only make their task easier - they don't have to
deal with inquisitive citizenry, people who expect to know, demand to know,
and have the means to obtain knowledge. Instead they only have to subvert
the checks and balances built into the system, which has been slowly going
on for decades, and at some time when the balance of power tips toward the
rulers, there will be no going back. Transparency won't help, and yes,
*then* there will no way of organizing serious opposition. The rulers will
own all the cameras, and you will be at their mercy.

The data density would be ridiculous.  Non-starter.

Open source is a good thing. It fills an important niche which is not
occupied by commercial software. I'll freely admit being somewhat of a
zealot here, having been using it since 1989, or so, and lately
exclusively.

I don't think such a machine is really possible. Lying does involve
specific activity patterns in the brain, but this looks like something
requiring expensive hardware, extensive subject-specific calibration, and
have a high false positives rate. The technician would also be a
vulnerable element in the loop.

Moreover, people in power would find ways to not expose their internals to
the world. The deployment of a truth machine would warp the shape of the
society around it, instead of making things as a whole more transparent.  
Those low in the hierarchy will be made sure to be screened at every
opportunity. Consider drug tests. Is this something a CEO would do, unless
she knows she's safe, and it's good for the worker morale? Shit, no.

I have no idea what would happen to society if lying became transparent. 
For everybody, every time. It is something profoundly unnatural to all 
living things. Chimps cheat. Everybody does.

> How do we measure privacy in a psychology of open source and truth?

Open source has objective advantages. It's pants-down full disclosure,
tends to provide systems that earlier into their life cycle have higher
quality, less bugs, and discourages pointless innovation (i.e. change for
the sake of profit maximization). It encourages more benign forms of
cooperation, fostering a form of 'digital communism' and prestige
accounting by low-cost altruism.

I don't see how else it chimes in with 'truth'.

Actually, their are memesets, religious and otherwise, that 
promote the view that the world will not be "right" until those 
holding different viewers are overpowered and/or destroyed. It 
is not simply a matter of fundamental human character traits. 
It is not simply an individual phenomenon.

Classic imperialism of all stripes, including Islamic, does not 
seem to be primarily concerned with "uplifting" in physical or 
economic ways.

In the face of an imperalistic and exclusive group memeset the 
particular leaders of the moment are not terribly relevant.  The 
memeset needs to be rendered harmless or contained.

### Why do you think that technology of this kind favors centralism?

Why should pattern matching and cross correlation be a bad thing (in a
democratic society)?

You give up privacy but gain much more - great control over your rulers.

Who will guard our guardians?, asked ancient Romans.

People are often irrational.  Reality isn't.  So it is perfectly

### Not really. The lawyers on this list might comment more but as far as I
know laws which are not enforced cannot be arbitrarily used, and it's
possible to get a court to throw the case out. This is why cops cannot
ticket you for driving 56 miles in a 55 mile zone, unless they can prove
they ticket everybody the same way.

Curiously, a few minutes ago while checking Science Daily
http://www.sciencedaily.com (btw thanks Anders, since your pointer to this
site awhile back, it has indeed become my favorite) I noticed this
interesting headline: High-Tech Study of Maggots Yields Cancer Clues.

I read the article which is quite good, and then decided to click the
associated link back to the original news source: University Of Rochester
Medical Center (http://www.urmc.rochester.edu)

On the urmc site I could find no mention whatsoever of the study, but I
noticed they offered a mailing list for anyone interested in receiving
breaking news. Next I went back to Science Daily and read the fine print at
the bottom of the article, which indicated that story had indeed come from
an email press release.

Nothing odd so far, but here's what happened next. I decided to paste the
entire headline: "High-Tech Study of Maggots Yields Cancer Clues" into
google to get an idea of how many other news sites might be carrying the
story (in the hopes of finding more science news sites of Science Daily
caliber).

Google returned only four hits, but the third one was a link to the
following ALCOR document! www.alcor.org/Library/pdfs/alefione.pdf

But the document has nothing to do with maggots, and only tangential
references to cancer so it struck me as odd, given the vastness of the web,
that I scored a prominent >H hit in this roundabout manner. Does google know
something about me and the types of web sites I'm likely to be interested
in? I know that Amazon.com is getting very good at compiling such user data,
but google? Could google be accessing Amazon to mine data on my interests I
wonder? Or was the whole thing just a fluke? Probably.

My understanding of the present system is that the output is only blips
on a screen. Bigger, faster blips would be vehicles, smaller blips -
pedestrians. (Remember the radar screens from the Gulf War showing
hordes of dots streaming back to Iraq?)
This is fine for isolated areas, say around power stations, defence
establishments, etc. Any blips that appear could have a camera zoomed in
on them. And mobile military want to use a similar system to spot enemy
troops hiding in the countryside.

If a Virginia shopping mall was being monitored when an incident
occurred, then possibly a blip moving away at high speed would stand out
as unusual. If it did then it could be tracked and followed from mast to 
mast until it stopped, or the tracking could be passed over to a police 
helicopter.
Similarly if a suspect was being monitored then a visual sighting of him
leaving home could switch over to use the system to track his movements.

But the overall recording of dots moving around a city is not a privacy
problem at present.
Now if they can add cell phone identification within two years, then
recording the movements of every unique cell phone becomes possible. 
This data could indeed be stored for years. In theory, it would only 
be examined by human eyes if a crime was being investigated.
As Samantha said there would be far too much data for everyone's
individual movements to be examined.
But once the data existed, then it could be analysed by computer and
lots of 'interesting' items might be highlighted. What would be
considered 'interesting' would, of course,  depend on which
agency/department/team/bureaucrat was doing the analysis.

And I think there is no chance that the public would be given access to
the data files so that they could check on the movements of politicians
/ spouses / business competitors / etc.

Somehow I don't think I'll be carrying a cell phone in the future.

I'm not so sure a transparent society would not be an inviting climate to

think that it could be a healthy boot camp for self-discovery.  

Last night I went to a seminar (WITI - Women in Technology) on negotiating
and the speaker (Tessa Albert Warschaw, Ph.D (best selling author) talked
to us about all sorts of deceptions in negotiating - business and personal.
Even on this level, speaking "truth" was more advantageous to the person in
the long run.

You think the foot-pound is confusion. Back in my day, we had to make
do with the cobble-cubit. Can you imagine calculating
cobble-cubits^2/moment^2, when each and every jurisidiction had its own
standard for each?

And here I was using cobble force in my conversion. Of course, there is
no TNT equivalent to cobble-cubits^2/second^2, being a pre-Nobel
measurement.... ;)

Let's see...there are about 6 gigapeople on the planet, and it
takes less than 32 bits the store a location on the Earth's
surface to around meter resolution, and you'd probably want
updates at around .1-second resolution, so the total possible
raw incoming data stream would be on the order of 200 Gb/sec.
Conveniently, most of those 6 gigapeople are stationary for
long periods of time, and they tend to cluster themselves
neatly into a few thousand clumps, so data compression would
probably get you down into the 100 Mb/sec range, which seems
well within the bounds of even present technology.

When I lived in the Rainy City, I used to load table salt in a
backpack-type fertilizer sprinkler and go out mass murdering slugs in
my yard in the early morning hours. The grains would hit the slugs and
they would melt down like crowds of Wicked Witches doused in Evian, en
masse. I felt like a petty-Saddam, gassing his subjects and challenging
the world to give a damn. Its a good thing that slugs don't make any
noise or the PETA folk in my neighborhood would have ridden me out of
town on a rail. A light rail (oh, but they didn't get the funding for
that by the time I left either...).

A preliminary note: 

Being a data-glutton, I played around with Hofstede's cultural
dimensions (taken from
http://www.stuart.iit.edu/courses/mgt581/filespdf/numbers.pdf) and the
UNDP technology achievement index
(http://www.undp.org/hdr2001/techindex.pdf). There is a reasonably
strong correlation (0.66) between the individualism score and the tech
score, and a negative correlation (-0.57) between the power distance
score and tech. A surprisingly weak negative correlation with
uncertainty avoidance (-0.14) - I would have thought that factor
affected creativity much more. 

This is just a first step, and doesn't show any causation of course.
Maybe high tech environments make societies more individualistic and
less hierarchical, maybe collectivist and hierarchical environments
seldom innovate or adopt new technology, or there are deeper factors
affecting both (or a combination of all).

If technology tends to drive societies towards centralisation, then
societies that has had technology for a long time would be more
centralized than others (possibly confounded by a higher rate of
innovation in more decentralized societies). But instead the new tech
nations like Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Japan appear more
centralized than old tech nations like the US, Britain and Sweden; there
are also some highly centralized old tech nations like France. 

In the context of this debate I would like to dig up measures of how
centralized power actually is, rather than how the culture works; I will
likely try using the Freedom House and Heritage Foundation indices to
get an impression, but I would love if there is some kind of
centralization index. I have also the World Values Survey to mix in, for
a true orgy in data mining. But now I have to sleep.

Actually, the 550 ft-lbs/sec was established as a dragging measure, not
using a frictionless surface. The horsepower was established back in
the time of real county fairs, etc where outside of racing the primary
entertainment was load dragging contests (using both oxen and horse
teams), which measured how much weight (pounds) an animal or team of
animals could drag along the ground x many feet in x many seconds.

Needless to say, it wasn't a perfect measure, since different types of
ground would have different coefficients of friction, primarily due to
moisture content. The standard of 'dry ground' was subject to human
judgement by non-scientific means.

Hi Extro's

Much as I agree with comments on this list about
the need to move on from primitive supernaturalism
(albeit Islam, Xian or Jedaist) .... I disagree about the
means to bring this about. 

Scientism is just too cold and uncomfortable for the
poor humans. Also, you can never convert a die-hard
supernaturalist by rational argument ... they prefer 
wishful thinking to reason.

The more positive postion that we are ALREADY
moved on/ grown up "posthumans" is essential is we
are to apeal to those mired in the pit of conventionality.
"Transitional" status is simply too wishy-washy.

Only by the steam-roller application of brutal truth can
we hope to assault the entrenched vested interests of 
big-money religion. MVT is the unanswerable alternative
to supernaturalism, nothing else give the blanket answers
that humanoids seek. Posthuman evolution blanket-covers
the whole spectrum of philosophical and psychological needs.
Reverse hypnosis is the best method to overcome a point-blank
rejection of rationality and empirical argument.

As a posthuman I intent to demonstrate above-human effects.
I consider my position more advanced than mere "trans" human
philosophies and will break all-comers on the raw truth of MVT.

Fraternally,
Steve Nichols

Er, what makes you think they're interested in saving the 
non-believers?  The reason they want them dead is so that they'll burn 
eternally.  They don't want them saved, they want them suffering.  Killing 
them gets that happening sooner.

Actually, I think this is a bit too fast.  A purely physical analysis
shows just what I said, and nothing more: 1 and 2 are both me[past], but
only 1 is me[1] and only 2 is me[2].

Physical analysis will not reveal whether the property of being "me" is
the me[now] property or the me[past] property.  If anything, "I" am both.
But, if so, then 1 may rightly take the conjunction of these properties:

  If I push that button, me[1] will die.  Since to be "me" is to be me[1]
  and me[past], and since there will be nothing that is me[1] and me[past]
  after I push the button, "I" will die if I push that button.

But perhaps rather than the conjunction of me[1] and me[past], I'm merely
the disjunction of me[1] and me[past].  If so, 1 may rightly say:

  If I push that button, me[past] will die.  Since to be "me" is to be
  me[1] or me[past], and since there will be something that is me[past]
  after I push the button, "I" will survive if I push that button.

There's no reason to think that "I" am me[past] any more than there is
reason to think that "I" am me[now].  That captures the spirit of Emlyn's
argument as well: you can call your "self" whatever you like in this
picture.

If no account exists, then you are not licensed to conclude that
duplicates are self.  You'll have to conclude, like I did, that the
question doesn't actually make sense.  'Are duplicates "self"?' can't be
answered without knowing which self: now or past.  (The answers are "no"
and "yes", respectively.)

Disagree strongly -- at least in the short (10-100 year) term.

Western Europe is increasingly turning away from religion in general;
less than 60% of the UK's population believe in any kind of deity,
for example, and the level of overt religiosity on display in the USA
is quite disconcerting to one of us who visits you guys. It's not just
the UK, either; about the only seriously religious states left in the
region are Ireland, Poland, and some eastern parts. (Even Italy is seeing
a drastic decline in the viability of the Church.)

There are major demographic trends in train that could upset this, of
course. Chief among these is the collapse in the birth rate in western
Europe, which is being counter-balanced by a level of immigration
from the south and east that is increasing to a level comparable to
immigration into the US from Latin America. Many of the immigrants
are from muslim countries -- but it would be a mistake to view them as
fundamentalists. For example, Germany's large Turkish minority are muslim,
but there's relatively little tradition of wahabite-style fundamentalism
there.

Moreover an interesting demographic trend turned up in the USA recently;
in addition to the birth rate among first generation immigrants being
high, the birth rate among the established older ethnic groups has
begun to rise from the sub-replacement levels of the 1970's and 1980's.
It is possible that the birth rate in the EU will reverse its decline,
within a matter of a few years -- we simply don't have enough data to
know what conditions gave rise to it and what may cure it.

Basically, if the original European populations continue to reproduce
at an average birth rate of 1.1 children per female, then in a few
generations the main population will change to an immigrant base; and
if those Muslim community leaders can hold it together they *might*
stand a chance. But I wouldn't bet on it; an evening spent wandering
around pubs in Bradford will show you just how much respect for
the Koranic injunctions against alcohol the second and third generation
muslim population of the UK has ...

Talk about synchronicity. The father of a friend's co-worker was saved,
inadvertently, from a brain tumor by his ear by maggots which had
gotten into his head via his ear canal while asleep (yeah, the word is
his personal hygeine wasn't the best either). High Icky Factor.

Quite serious. The gas mask originally deployed by the French Army in
WWI was simply a wooly mask with goggle eyes. You were supposed to piss
on the mask before donning it, and your urine filtered out the toxic
gasses as you breathed air through the mask material.

I didn't say it wasn't a high icky factor, but when the choice is
survival or asphyxiation via painfully toxic gasses, what are you gonna
do? Given the state of French plumbing and water purification
technology for most of French society, I imagine that breathing pissy
air was no big challenge.

Yes, but the question is whether "individual" phenomena tend to
promote or retard such trends.  We know about Hitler, Stalin and
Sadaam -- would you argue that it is better to destroy the societies
that support such megalomaniacs -- or better to destroy the megalomaniacs
themselves?

Where is the core problem -- in the individual or in the society?

Agreed.  Imperialistic activities seem to be conducted in the
interests of those conducting them.  Is there a question as to
whether Sadaam was *not* interested in controlling the oil resources
of Iran or Kuwait when he invaded those countries?

Quite possibly perhaps.

The slow evolution of Iran over the last decade seems to suggest
that the "excluded middle" may indeed prevail.

This seems to suggest that a bio-nano-tech enabled populus will
trump any power seeker (to me).  So they can never succeed in the
long term and they might as well give it up now.

*So* debates about the elimination of Osama or Sadaam do not become
explorations of whether their removal is right or wrong but whether
the timing and means of their removal is the most efficient (or extropic).

I want to be clear about this -- they have cast their vote (and made
it very public) -- at that point I strongly question whether others
should grant them the benefit of the doubt.

Hi, I read your story on the Titanic, very interesting. I imagine you're 
familiar with Frank Tipler's The Physics of Immortality where he postulates 
using light trails to reassemble quantum duplicates (Omega Point theory) (in 
this theory this occurs after/during conversion of the universe by 
nanoprobes into a giant energy-computronium turing machine/virtuality 
computer). Personally I do not wish to intrude into people's privacy except 
to create sysop (protective shielding) and as you speculate do what may be 
necessary to ensure transference of the apparently dead as soon as possible 
(numbers: for humans, by some estimates, 100 million anatomically modern 
humans have existed, by others criteria somewhat more).
===

I also had a look at your qualia stuff. Although very interesting I don't 
think I agree with it. I would agree that we have internal maps/mirrors 
within/forming our consciousness and that these will become more 
sophisticated. Concurrently, however, we will have increased/changed sensory 
input and new direct neurological interaction with other consciousnesses, 
i.e. we will be able to hook in to a radio telescope as an "eye" and "talk" 
to another being brain-to-brain. As to whether this is new "qualia" or not, 
I am not sure, but I suspect we have lower-level cultural "qualia" change or 
modification already (at least for 100,000 years) so this is a sign it is 
possible to do it.

I am not convinced about the demerits ofduplication "uploading" rather than 
upgrading, whether in some "switching" toggle or within a constructed 
qualian spirit world. Personally I think continuity and neuron-by-neuron 
upgrading make perfect sense, unless you are talking about Tiplerian quantum 
duplication/splitting.
===

As an aside, you write: "Others theorize about small communicating nano 
robots swimming through the blood supply to reach the required locations in 
the brain where they can do similar things less invasively.  With such 
ability, Hans [Moravec] theorizes, such devices would be able to provide 
enough information to enable the writing of a program that perfectly 
simulates all the relevant behavior in the particular region of the brain.  
Observations made by such devices could verify that the software simulation 
was indeed behaving identically.  Adjustments could be made ?until the 
correspondence is nearly perfect?."

This should be clarified by the question of minimum size and computing 
power. Drexler points out this is 60 to 100 supercomputers and repair/change 
machines within each cell - and then there are intercellular equivalents 
("floating" around). This is enough to control the genome and alter it, at 
least.It is also enough to gather some information about current human-type 
brain activitiy (chemical and electrical state of each neuron).Transmission 
of such information may however be "slow", even if there are newly designed 
specific cell or cluster-style broadcast nodes (and there may be heat 
problems etc). Those parts of a brain or brain shell that are 
augmented/upgraded into computronium and have quantum tunnelling /computing 
facilities should be capable of faster broadcast linkage. Damien Broderick 
has noted some speculation that individual atoms can be made to store large 
amounts of information, so perhaps the upper limit is higher. I would note 
that this sort of new-"composite" brain and new-symbiotic cells 
formation/structure is a development of existing evolutionary trends, for 
example the integration of mitochondria (self-directed evolution of course 
takes us into new directions beyond these). ---- However, if you are right 
about qualia and current style neurons being essential to the "experience" 
of being human, then add-ons and cellular add-ins (molecular supercomputers 
etc inside cells operate in the "dead" areas) are the go I guess!

Lord, I can't really believe this -- there is no peer reviewed

Indeed.  I didn't back my assertion with a specific quote from the 
Koran.

In my quick parsing of the book I *did* run across passages that could 
be interpreted as promoting conversion of non-believers.  Other quotes 
said non-believers would suffer in the Hell-fire.  It was all quite 
vague and open to interpretation - which itself could be interpreted as 
a mechanism of religion that promotes self-propagation.

There's no point laboring in debate over these interpretations.

Those of us who are quick to deride religion must keep in mind that 
some people view the Extropian principles as the structure of a 
"techno-futurist" religion.  That was the impression of a friend of 
mine who I had asked to read them.  I'm sure there are threads in the 
archive regarding Extropianism's status (or lack thereof) of being a 
religion.

What is it that you dread, Gene?  Abused by who?
The government?  As before, I presupposed you would
compensate away much of the government's power as
transparency increased.  This is a critical point.
No government can be trusted with the power that
transparency would provide.

In the case of the Virginia sniper, the government's
role would be almost superfluous, for a band of armed
citizens would have taken him out by now.

I think of them as statistically significant opportunities.
I like asymmetrical enablers.  I tend to be on the side that
is always asymmetrically enabled.  spike

I rethought this after I realized we do not have
*assured* privacy in any public place now.  There
are small battery powered transmitting cameras that
are cheap and reasonably high res.  Does anyone
here doubt that they are being strategically placed
in locker rooms now?  In hotel rooms?  spike

> Those of us who are quick to deride religion must keep in mind that some
people view the Extropian principles as the structure of a "techno-futurist"
religion.  That was the impression of a friend of mine who I had asked to
read them.  I'm sure there are threads in the archive regarding
Extropianism's status (or lack thereof) of being a religion.

A religion was formed around a jazz musician (John Coltrane), and in
Portland, Oregon, there's a Church of Elvis (they don't speak in tongues
there, but plant theirs firmly in cheek).   Then there's "Scientology"
(what's that supposed to mean?).

An acquaintance of mine thought the Extropian principles sounded "New Agey."
(I think "New Age" is sometimes used as a catch-all for ... just about any
philosophy that's not entirely understood.)

One way to differentiate between what is and what is not a religion (at
least in the USA) is to find out whether an organization receives the
oh-so-special religious tax exemption.  Even so, it's not always clear
(e.g., the American Humanist Organization has some kind of religious
exemption, even though they are not a supernaturally-inclined group of
folks, i.e., they have "religious atheists" in their group).

Anytime I think about religion (any religion), scads more than the usual
number of my neurons commit hiri-kiri (I can almost hear them in unison,
somewhat like the Whos in Whoville).

Oh, ok, but either way, I want to see the sweat

I see this as revenge for the early resignation
by Fritz's huuuuman caaaarbon-based team in a
position which still had some fight left in it.
It should have been played out longer: the Iceman
might have melted under pressure.  Hey, he did in
game 5.

The next kicker is that Fritz started
the match a 50 to 1 underdog.  (Undermachine?)

Whenver I see "whether - or" I look think of the excluded middle 
fallacy. Individual phenomena have a dynamic relationship with 
group phenomenon but it is syngerstic, neither is precisely the 
cause of the other.  Putting Hitler, Stalin and Sadaam in the 
sam list is itself questionable and biased.  Humanity itself 
supports the possibility of dictators and various monstrous 
types.  Would you destroy all of humanity to avoid the 
possibility of such?  That these types pop up in one or the 
other society may say as little or much about that particular 
soeciety or people than one person contracting a deadly flu and 
another not contracting it.  The "germ" is about and under the 
right conditions will work its mischief.  Generally speaking it 
is somewhat superstituous to blame the particular "patient" it 
gains a foothold in.  That is of course not to deny that there 
are certain societal/governmental poor health practices that 
make it easier for such diseases to take hold.

It would be best to diffuse the megalomania and that which makes 
it possible in human beings and human societies without 
destroying anyone.  It is best to defeat the illness without 
throwing the living sufferer[s] into the furnace!

Iran is just beginning to pull away from the modern equivalent 
of the Inquisition and a long drawn out war with Iraq that 
decimated parts of the population.  I would be very surprised by 
them moving much faster than they are.  Wouldn't you?

Well, perhaps assuming the "populus" controls the bio-nano-tech. 
  Otherwise the power seeker gains almost absolute control and 
is next to impossible to escape from or overcome.  If 
government/industry/military controls these technologies and 
prohibits them from the people then we can be fully controlled 
and exploited by such powerful interests.

Concentrating so heavily on them at all is actually missing, 
imho, the most important questions and issues of the day.  Pay 
enough attention to contain and if absolutely necessary, remove 
them (not convinced this is the case for Sadaam) but don't 
ignore everything else or risk everything else on such a 
relatively minor "symptom".

I assume this "they" is the people of Iraq?  Didn't you notice 
thre was no alternative and that not voting can be real 
dangerous?  How on earth can such a "vote" be indicative of 
anything - much less lead to an attitude that the people of Iraq 
are expendable or part of the disease?  Careful flinging victims 
in the furnace.  We could overbalance and fall in ourselves.

That would be a bit hard to prove. Let's say you've been carrying 20 k$
cash on you when crossing state borders. The cops confiscate that as drug 
money. (Happens now and then). You'll never going to see it again.

How are you going to prove that this is not selectively enforced? How are 
you going to prove a negative?

No. You're going to court (got legal insurance?) against a large
institution. The cops always cover for each other. Who's going to cover
for you? Do you know who passed by the radar, how fast, and how many they
did ticket, and how many they could have ticketed during the time? Do you
think they keep logs? Knows the judge? Jury?

We're not discussing the properties of a specific system, but reasonable

I am not at all worried about current capabilities.

You can assume that a blip retains the identity as it follows a contiguous
trajectory (or semicontiguous, if you use kinetic models and blip
properties info to resolve ambiguities). If you have a complete recording
of all trajectories in the area, you can look at what happened after the
fact in the relevant area. As soon as this is a repeat offense, it will be
very hard to avoid making a pattern, even if you know how the system 
works.

You're not tracking a single blip. You're tracking all the vehicles in the 
area using distributed infrastructure. Once they're in the main memory, I 
can track millions of individual objects in realtime on an off-shelf PC. 
Do the math.

The hard part is gathering the information with an array of sensors. Lots
of smart sensors needs to be installed, serviced, and gathered info from.  
Several trends (integration density, integrated software radios,
ultrawideband, cheap DSP, etc.) would seem to make blanket surveillance
affordable, especially if implemented as an incremental-cost rider on a
bona fide infrastructure.

If we're talking about more or less blanket coverage of large parts of the 
city including all movements of vehicles and people this completely nukes 
privacy.

You're describing capabilities of several years (a decade, if not more)  
ago. There's a directional ID catcher gadget issued to individual LEOs.  
The base stations know your position to within ~100 feet. Where do you

Guess what, definition of a crime changes in time and in space. Look at

That's nonsense. 10^6 objects at a 1 Hz position refresh rate generate few
MBytes/s raw data flux. A current desktop is easily capable of processing
that stream in realtime. Same PC could easily hold TBytes of cheap RAID.
Stored naively, as a raw dump (of course, one wouldn't do that), that's a
FIFO almost two weeks deep. Then it's flushed out tiered archive storage.
Off-shelf clustering allows me to scale up that capacity by four orders of
magnitude. This means I can track all objects on Earth surface today with
a completely inconspicuous few 10 M$ facility. Allow for a decade or two 
of technical advances, and continuation of current basic right erosion.

One could do traffic remixing in ad hoc meshes. Or make a habit of
swapping cellphones with friends (it's a good idea to do it with the
consumer cards you get at Albertsons and elswhere).

I'm not sure the phone identity gets changed when you swap out those 
prepaid smart cards. Probably not.

Hey, you're not tracking a race of teleporters. Movement is always
continuous, incremental, few m/s on foot or a bit faster in cars. Anything
larger/faster (bus, train, ship, plane) will be tracked as a single unit.  
And current location services have orders of magnitude less resolution, so 
you need less bits to represent.

Much too quick. Even 1 Hz refresh rate I mentioned is overkill. 0.1 Hz 
would be more than adequate, and I would adaptively go slower for slower 
objects.

> raw incoming data stream would be on the order of 200 Gb/sec.

Actually, if you just want to track all objects without any analysis or
recording, and use clever coding, a single box with several GBytes RAM and
GBit Ethernet would do the trick. Cute, but useless, so you still need a 
cluster for real work.

Absolutely. A small cluster of consumer grade boxes would do. If it wasn't
for the cost of distributed smart sensors, it would have been done
already.

You're addressing a far stronger claim, and one which I didn't made.  
Global trends in urbanization alone would seem to confirm it, though. It 
would be interesting if you can ferret out more data confirming or denying 
it. Bring on the good stuff!

I was addressing merely the fact that technology advances alone allow for
a much closer tracking of what is happening elsewhere, selectively
empowering these who are in possesson of that information. The value of
the network, or of a database is a function of its size.

I'm arguing that the awareness that technology drives power assymetry is
not widespread, and hence results in no palpable counterpressure in the
legal domain. Since a lot of these developments are irreversible we should
be pushing this information into the (unfortunately largely aphathetic)
public. I really don't care much for the way Emergents solve problems.

So they are running psyops against their own funding agencies and the
politicians who give them work to convince them that they are not doing
a great job? Plenty of the post-911 criticism *within* the intelligence
community has been about the lack of coordination and ability to combine
disparate data into something useful, rather than suggestions that the
real need is for even better data acquisiton. If you read the comments
from various groups on this subject, the political sphere seems eager to
grant new listening powers and new data gathering projects (obvious
political gains, since they "are doing something"), while many in the
intelligence community try to get ways of managing the flood of nearly
useless data.

You can always ask Harvey, I think he knows.

The NSA cryptographers know what they are doing. But that is just the
glamorous side of the agency. After all, most information is plaintext
anyway. If you can set up an Echelon you can get any amount of
phonecalls, data packets and radio you want. But the next step, turning
the data into information (and then into knowledge), is far harder and
not easily mechanicanizable. Doing automatic voice keyword recognition
seems to be done, and a bit of context analysis will bring down the
flood to just a big stream of signals containing interesting things. But
what to do with that? Intelligence analysis is tricky, and even the NSA
doesn't have unlimited analysts. Distinguishing people talking about 911,
roleplaying games and other noise sources from real signals is hard,
especially if you don't have any context. In most cases agencies focus on
likely suspects and groups, simply because they would not have resources
to deal with more. 

[BOTE calc: Assume ~1 billion people being scanned, making one phonecall
or email each per day. Every thousandth conversation is suspicious in
one way or another and is automatically detected. That is one million
conversations per day that has to be looked at, if only to throw them
away. If it takes one minute to make this decision and there is a 7 hour
workday, we need 24,000 analysts just for this initial sorting. Actually
thinking about the meaning and implications likely requires far more.]

Just as trickery with cryptosystems gives hints (sometimes long after),
so does intelligence failures. The 911 failure has been brought fairly
clearly into the open due to political infighting between agencies, and
the problem was obviously not lack of information but lack of
correlation. Now, this could be a big psyop from the NSA and the others
to fool the enemies of the US to believe that the intelligence community
isn't as good as it really is (at a small price of a few thousand
people, enormous costs and inevitable political attacks on the agencies
themselves). That seems rather unlikely compared to the possibility that
accidents do happen and that the net does have sizeable holes.

Sure. But the problem here is where to put the sensitivity. If you flag
if patterns have reached suspicion level X, you will get both type I and
II errors. X is likely set to the level so that the amount of work
needed to be done equals the number of available analysts A. But if we
assume suspicion to have a power law distribution (everything seems to
have it :-) with exponent alpha, the level would scale as
A^(-1/(alpha-1)). If the distribution is wide enough (alpha near 1) X
would have to be ridiculously large. Worse, if we assume the level of
suspicion to be an actual indicator of likeliehood of evildoing, the
risk associated with the "subliminal" suspicion diverges as alpha
approaches 2 even as this allows a more efficient scanning for the
analysts.  OK, a somewhat BOTE example not directly tied to real
numbers, but I think it shows that just piling up data doesn't really
help.

There are far too few around. And the problem really isn't the right to
privacy (that is very much an american thing, although integrity is its
european counterpart), but that people are not comitted enough to keep
open societies open. Thank heaven for those antibodies that are out
there, but there is a real need for a more vigorous society-keeping
movement.

So the goal should really be to work towards more symmetric societies.
Open societies can in many ways be defined as societies where information
is more symmetric between citizens and rulers (and between ruling
groups).

Yes, that's correct. I know that. And as of at least a year ago the
~100 feet location of all calls to cell phones are recorded and can be
checked. (Billing enquiries, police enquiries, etc.).
But the point is that at present you have to actually make or receive a
call on your cell phone in order for it to be identified. To the Celldar
system under development, blips on the screen are just blips.
What they want to introduce in the next two years is a passive
identification so that the blips can be identified and they know
instantly who they are tracking.
And it would be really 'useful' to link this future cell phone id with
all the video surveillance cameras as well.

Again, I agree with all of that. But 'examine' doesn't mean the same as
'recorded'. I agree that years in the future you will be able to keep a
database of the movements of everyone in the world (or at least everyone
carrying a cell phone). But humans won't have time to look at it all.

Depends on the friends you have. ;-)
One-time use cell phones are probably the best bet - if you really must
carry a cell phone.

And it would be really 'useful' to link this future cell phone id with
all the video surveillance cameras as well.

Again, I agree with all of that. But 'examine' doesn't mean the same as
'recorded'. I agree that years in the future you will be able to keep a
database of the movements of everyone in the world (or at least everyone
carrying a cell phone). But humans won't have time to look at it all.
You have to use computer analysis to pick out the highlights.

Depends on the friends you have. ;-)
One-time use cell phones are probably the best bet - if you really must
carry a cell phone.

By those who have access to that data, as opposed to those who don't. Even
if given access to this data, a large group will be at a disadvantage vs.
a small elite group derived from old power.

I agree. Because you can't really get rid of government in immediate

Sure, no one wants to be on the loser's side.

WOW I'm impressed! They counted all 11 million votes in one day?!! Why don't 
we hire some Iraqis to handle our voting? LOL Un-friggin-believeably obvious 
propaganda... will someone figure out just how long it would ACTUALLY take to 
count 11 million paper ballots?

My guess is that anyone voting "no" was summarily deported (aka executed) 
from the country.

Saddam: Iraqis Confident After Vote
By SAMEER N. YACOUB
Associated Press Writer

October 17, 2002, 7:09 AM EDT

BAGHDAD, Iraq -- raqi President Saddam Hussein said the referendum 
re-electing him for another seven years has increased the determination of 
Iraq's people to fight for their country, Iraqi media reported Thursday. 

Saddam spoke Wednesday at a meeting of the Revolutionary Command Council, 
Iraq's main decision-making government body, the official daily al-Iraq said. 

The meeting was shown on state television but -- as usual for Iraq TV -- 
without sound. The broadcast came after Iraq announced that 100 percent of 
the more than 11 million Iraqis casting ballots in Tuesday's referendum voted 
"yes" on extending Saddam's term. 

"After announcement of the referendum's results, Iraqis have become more 
confident in the future and more determined to fight for and to build their 
country," al-Iraq quoted Saddam as saying. 

He also criticized the United States for what he said was an effort to sway 
the vote's outcome by intensifying a propaganda drive against his leadership. 

"This shows that they (the Americans) are ignorant of the psychology of the 
Iraqi people ... especially when such peoples have trusted their leaders and 
chosen the right path," he said. 

He added that the U.S. administration was "incapable of knowing the 
psychology and the reaction of the Iraqi people." 

In scenes shown on TV, the Command Council members did most of the talking 
while Saddam listened. Saddam was in a suit and waved his glasses around for 
emphasis at times when he spoke. The members -- all in military uniforms -- 
leaned attentively toward Saddam, who is the council chairman. 

Tuesday's referendum was ridiculed by Iraqis in exile and was described as 
"not serious" by the United States. 

Baghdad erupted in celebratory gunfire after announcement of the vote 
Wednesday morning, but the city seemed normal for the rest of the day. On 
Thursday, the only sign of Saddam's victory was one line of honking cars 
decorated with ribbons and Saddam posters, presumably organized by his Baath 
Party. 

On Thursday, the Babil newspaper owned by Saddam's eldest son, Odai, carried 
the headline: "100 Percent is Not Enough! To Express our Love and Loyalty to 
Saddam Hussein." 

The United States, which accuses Iraq of possessing weapons of mass 
destruction, is pressing for a new U.N. Security Council resolution that 
would give U.N. weapons inspectors broad powers to search for hidden arms in 
Iraq. 

Washington wants a clause in the resolution authorizing a war against Iraq if 
it resists full inspections, but France has been leading a campaign against a 
so-called automatic trigger. 

Iraq has been under U.N. Security Council sanctions since invading Kuwait in 
1990. U.N. resolutions require the country to destroy all its weapons of mass 
destruction. The sanctions cannot be lifted unless the weapons inspectors 
declare the country free of prohibited weapons.

### With the multiply redundant, all-encompassing data structure showing all
instances of cops stopping people and taking money from them. If they do
take from all of them - they'd have to do as much explaining as when they
take only from you. Also, they couldn't plant drugs in your suitcase, as
they do now whenever they want somebody really bad. Their own video feeds
would be a matter of public record.

That would be the first time you could feel safe in the presence of a cop.

The other part of the story would be the decrypted, time-stamped feed from
your own cameras, which would be sent from your data-storage provider on
your request, with similar feeds from your associates, proving the
legitimate provenance of your money.

### I go to court every time I get a ticket. It frequently works, even
nowadays.

With the Transparent Cop (TM) Secy Svce, there would be no "covering for
each other". Any discrepancy in their records would be a reason for throwing
the case out. My own record and the records of all drivers in the disputed
area could be subpoenaed and would prove the truth, all the truth, and only
the truth, as seen through a thousand eyes.

### Yes, if you naively insist on privacy, these data will not be released,
but, no matter how hard you protest, "they" (state, corporations, large
organizations, mafia) will have all the data on you. If you do not have
transparency, no amount of laws, no amount of cryptography will protect you
from the systems they will install, openly or in secrecy ("privacy, you
could say).

Do you get it?

Insisting on privacy is like the proverbial ostrich hiding its head in the
sand (a stupid myth) - losing the chance to see and control your enemy that
would come from transparency, while still staying exposed.

I am, and I was an active tournament player back then.  Fischer
was (and still is) insane, but he certainly wasn't the only one
who knew of the inevitability of computer chess even back in
the seventies.  Most of those working on software were saying
things like "...if this program were just a million times
faster...", and today they are.

These blips certainly don't show small-grain fast moving objects

So we are following all the speeders? :-)  The real culprit is 
very unlikely to telegraph by suspicious moves.  What I do 
wonder is why the current systems in place in some locales in 
the US that consist of acoustic devices on street corners and/or 
cameras, especially the latter, can't be used to track every 
vehicle that entered or left the area in a period of time.  Find 
the vehicles that were in all areas of sniping and then checkout 
each driver/owner.

Having the feds know all my movements is "not a problem"?  How 
so?  This could be used to build up strong circumstantial 
evidence of supposition of association which is all that is 
needed to label someone as a likely terrorist or aid to 
terrorism these days.

In practice every slightly to highly nefarious possible use

And current highly questionable laws.  Prosecutors!  They would 
have a field day with such a system.

I am not worried about that compared to what the governmental 
octupus plus its corporate favored could and would do with the 
information.

Or maybe insist the standards are open and anyone can build to 
the standards or have it built in order to know precisely what 
they are carrying.

How would you "compensate away the power" and how would you keep

the system?

What's so hard about counting 11 million votes?  Even if you've got only
10 thousand people running it, that's only 1100 votes each, that's about
40 minutes if you are taking a full two seconds per paper.  The vote
counting in many countries larger than 11 million people is routinely
done in a day, which is why the situation in the USA was so risible to
many people.  (this is not a comment on the overall legitimacy of the
ballot, just the objection raised seems senseless to people who have
seen election results obtained in two hours).

I'm forwarding this from another list just to point out the acceleration
of a trend many people may be unaware of.  The state-of-the-art in Hg/Cd/Te
sensors to date (in my understanding) had been 256x256 or or perhaps 512x512
pixels.  This report documents it going to 2048x2048.

### I do not totally share your pessimism here. MRI machines are getting
cheaper, multielectrode cortical arrays will be cheap and ubiquitous, too.

On the other hand, we'd need something more than just the ability to detect
the patterns of frontal cortex activation which are associated with the
extra processing needed to consciously lie. Smart liars could in the future
use self-deception at a much higher level than possible now. Most of us
can't genuinely expunge from memory the traces of our misdeeds, so if asked
about them we always have to do some real-time suppression, and such
activity can be even seen on evoked potential EEG, like the P300 wave which
accompanies the recognition of visually or verbally provided, previously
encountered patterns.

Future liars could perhaps fully erase all the traces of murder from their
mind. They would be genuinely surprised if confronted with evidence. In this
case, the questions of identity continuity and culpability would arise.

This problem could be solved by using a personality analysis, looking for a
propensity to behave improperly (as defined by the societal context), rather
than specific misdeeds. Persons devious enough to engage in partial
self-erasure for improper gains would be excluded from cooperation as a
matter of principle, not punishment.

All this is looking far into the future. Traceless self-editing won't be
available for a long time. Until then universal surveillance, MRI, EEG, MEG,
and multielectrode arrays should provide enough capability for catching
liars.

### Only if you let them. If you actually make it illegal for a celebrity or

Barkow writes about an evolved interest in strategic information about
fellow humans, especially the high status ones, inherent in our cognitive
architecture.

"They" will have nowhere to hide, at least as long as the correct
legislation is forced on them by the collective will of the electorate. I
only worry that by the time the majority sees the light and demands it, it
might be too late - total surveillance without total transparency will be
there, and it will be very, very difficult to wrest power from the

I wanted to share with the list my impressions from this year's Foresight
Conference, which ended last Sunday.

There were about 300 - 400 attendees, and the quality of presentations was
mostly good. There were few purely theoretical pie-in-sky talks (such as
mine), most of the material presented contained at least some experimental
data, and some, like the talks on gold nanoparticles for DNA detection,
already have significant practical applications.

The regulars told me that the conference is getting more and more
mainstream.

I met Ralph Merkle and Robert Freitas. We had a chat about uploading.

For the abstract of my talk go to
http://www.foresight.org/Conferences/MNT10/Abstracts/Smigrodzki/index.html.
Kary Mullis said he liked it, although obviously as a piece of speculation
it isn't really hard science. I can email the full PowerPoint document
(772kb) to anybody who's interested.

There are not that many people, animals, vehicles, ordnance cruising
around. Ultrawideband radar could track a large insect, I think. A bird,
certainly. By the time we have the infrastructure, we have the crunch and
the hardware to represent that many moving objects (assuming, we really
need it).

It would make a good sense to run a distributed GIS on boxes strewn over a
landscape. After all, if I make a query to where a closest bar which is
serving cheap caipiri~na it rarely involves a asking patch of desert
downunder.

Yes. While many of us enjoy being radical, the mainstream has caught up. 
Robert Freitas is still ahead of the pack.

A few hours if properly organized.  In the recent German election,
there were some 48.6 million ballots cast--actually each of these
held two votes--and these were counted in under nine hours.  And
yes, they were paper ballots.

Yes, I suspected I had overestimated your claim. But as you say, it is
interesting and important nevertheless. 

When I think about centralization of societies I don't really think
urbanisation matters. It is more about power: does a smaller group get
more influence and/or control over a larger group? In the "standard
model" of how things are many people share (to a large extent based on
second- and third-hand marxist theory) the answer is seen as a fairly
clear yes (usually phrased as "the rich get richer, the poor get
poorer"). This is usually based on the assumption that the power elite
runs everything for its benefit, so hence technology (and anything else
happening) must be controlled in such a manner as to mainly benefit the
elite (at least a marxist would have a dialectic answer). 

But is this true? The simplistic (conspiracy) view doesn't hold. And I
doubt even more subtle models. Looking at Gini indices of different
nations doesn't show any strong correlation between income disparity
(which I distrust as a measure of power, but I have the numbers handy)
and level of technology / time as a technological society - there are a
bunch of high tech low-Gini societies like Denmark, Japan and Sweden and
the most unequal high-tech society (the US) has 31 more low-tech
societies with higher Gini indices. Overall, the correlation seems to be
negative: low-tech societies seem to have greater levels of income
disparity than high-tech societies. 

This shouldn't be surprising, since it is a kind of syndrome of mutually
reinforcing factors: high disparity, high power distance breeds
corruption and discourages change which in turn reinforces existing
structures. Individualism and a fairly open society allows invention and
change, helping people get richer and more comfortable, which in turn
makes them more interested in other matters than just staying alive -
including politicsn and self-determination. There are still plenty of
cases that are different (like former eastern Europe), showing that the
interactions between culture, wealth, politics and tech are hardly
simple. But there seem to be an overall trend.

As I have argued elsewhere, databases doesn't increase their value in
the same nonlinear way as networks as they are extended. But generally
speaking, technology amplifies power. Hence it makes people with power
more powerful, especially if the technology is mainly used by them or
cannot be usefully used by others.

This is a very good point. Maybe we should institute "adopt a
lawyer/politician/pundit". Each of us should try to find such a figure,
and start giving them briefings on relevant issues and subjects. I have
watched with amazement (and pride) how a law student friend of mine have
taken to linux, open source, freedom of the net and cryptography after
being given some explanations. Imagine this happening all over the
place.

Very true.  I'm used to seeing towns with 1 Church and 12 pubs (I kid you 
not).  Unnerving to see 12 Churches and 1 bar, I can tell you.

Correction:> Northern Ireland.  The Republic is a lot less religious than 
most think or the figures suggest.  In part due to observing N.I., mainly 
due to drastic social change over the last 20-25 years.  And as I've said 
before; the country that invented Guiness turning Islamic?  Don't think so :)

Otherwise in agreement 100%

You know, I never thought I'd find out that I had something in common with 
Mike (other than >Humanism) until now.  I have to confess to having 
"answered the call up" and undertaken "Slug Patrol" as we call it.  This 
basically consists of my wife acting as spotter so that I can swoop in, 
armed with my plastic bottle of Saxa, pulling back our dense garden foliage 
and dispensing grainy death from above on the offending critters.  Maybe I 
was an F4 pilot in a previous life.  It certainly does give a hit of 
satisfaction watching them shrivel as the first invisible flecks of salt 
strike home.  We were so successful with this spring that we say a drastic 
reduction in the overall numbers of slugs we came across over the course of 
the summer.  In fact, there was no need for patrolling beyond midsummer.

Sticky-backed Copper tape works wonders for potted plants.  Run it around 
the rim in an unbroken circle.  Very effective.

Another useful tip for those plagued with slug problems is to use small 
rimmed trays almost filled to the top with beer.  Yep, you heard 
right.  They can smell it.  They climb up the edge of the tray, begin to 
drink and promptly fall in and drown.  Place many at strategic points all 
over the area.  Bud is our choice of beverage for this, but most any beer 
or lager will work.  You can get covered slug trays for just this job also.

As is typical of most of the dirty jobs around here, I get cleaning duty 
when they're full.  Not pretty.  Oh, and don't breathe through your nose 
while doing it.  Still, using beer does have one good sideffect;

Swig, top up, swig, top up, swig.....

"Known"?  "Known" to whom?  I can be treated very badly without 
any proof offered that some of my associates are terrorist or 
not and if there is any proof it is not visible to the public 
under the current secretive arrangements, generally speaking. 
So it is a little facile to brush the potential problems under 
the rug with a "if you don't have anything to hide then it can't 
hurt you" sort of response.  We all have something to hide! 
Unless you agree with the government and the current laws 100% 
and abide by them 100% of the time (some studies have shown this 
is actually impossible), you are a possible victim of government 
in a society with 100% surveillance.  This must be faced quite 
squarely and factored in by anyone who calls for such 
"transparency".

We vote it away, Samantha.  Many of our laws are guard-rail
type laws: they are in place to help prevent the commission
of a crime.  Drug laws, instance.  The main reason we have
them is to prevent dopers from stealing to buy dope.  So
if you can prevent theft by other means, there is no longer
a compelling reason to have anti-drug laws.

Gene mentioned the problem of carrying a lot of cash and
having it confiscated as drug money.  If we had no drug laws,
drug money would be just as legitimately owned as any other
variety.

Another example is speed laws.  We don't need them.  We
only need laws against driving unsafely.  Depending on the
circs, it might be perfectly safe to haul.

I like to think of this system as providing statistically
significant opportunities.

Consider for example, a kind of mini-borg that could
develop.  Unlike the Star Trek variety, this one would
be totally voluntary.  You will not be assimilated
unless you want to, resistance is welcome.

I got thinking about this one day after I had visited
the hardware store to get some materials to repair my
sprinkler system.  I passed by a broken sprinkler in
front of a public building that was spewing water.  I
had half a mind to just stop and fix it.  Of course I
would have been sued.  But if we had some means of forming
a huge interconnected metaman that pooled its talents,
and just dealt with problems as it witnessed them,
the improvement in efficiency would be difficult to
imagine.

In the broken sprinkler example, a repairhuman would
need to be called, she would need to drive her van
or truck to the scene, fix the thing.  The bill would
need to be a couple hundred bucks, just to cover the
repair of a 2 dollar part.  I could have fixed it for
practically nothing.

Back to the problem of power abuse: we really can stop
this.  For instance, consider speeding.  Everyone here
has done it.  Well, ok, everyone other than Eliezer and
Johnny Grigg.  What if we got a ticket *every single time*
we exceeded the limit?  Would not a political candidate
arise who would be elected on nothing besides a promise
to remove speed limit laws?

As surveillance increases, I expect the legal system
to compensate, first by removing absurd guard-rail laws.

True.  The moderates will ignore the inconvenient passages, and the 
fanatics will exult them.  Either way, it's the fanatics you've got to look 
out for.

I'd say most people would see it in a religious context unfortunately.  It 
would seem to be as a result of most peoples' frame of 
reference.  Something we need to be aware of.

So very funny that you would bring Scientology into the mix.  My mother 
has recently unearthed an old question/answer bit of homework from 
grade school - I was around 8 years old at the time.  The question was 
something like "what religion do you think is most likely to be true?" 
and my reply was something like "I'm not sure, but Scientology sounds 
as close as we can get."

This coming from someone who had no clue what Scientology's all about, 
only knew the name - but was old enough to know that "being different 
is good" and that most everyone else would be saying Christianity 
because of all these reasons our parents taught us.

Needless to say, growing up to find out the truth about Scientology, I 
was very disappointed.

The incident above also makes me wonder if grade school teachers 
consciously give their students bizarre assignments for sociological 
study purposes.

I got my wish.  Today's game was a short draw.
Now it all rides on the outcome of Saturday's
game.  The pressure is on.

Of course I want to see the computer win,
but that should be expected.  You see, I am a
compusexual: a computer trapped in a man's body.

I suspect there are many closet compusexuals
among us.  These are they who derive unnatural
pleasure from pure thought and computations.
Such as chess.  I have learned to spot others
nearly without error.  The last Extroschmooze
was practically crawling with them.  Oh my,
I enjoyed myself during that time.

### On seconds thoughts I agree - the court should have no right to issue a
subpoena. On the other hand, the "presumption of innocence" might need to be
reinterpreted. If somebody accuses you of something, provides even as little
as a grainy video showing possibly you at the right time and place, but you
refuse to provide your recording, we (the jury) will naturally think you
have something to hide.

### Exactly!

Transparency forces the acknowledgement of truth. If current speed laws are
a fiction, they would be one of the first legal white elephants to go. A lot
of the legal deadweight would be challenged and rejected.

BTW, are Eliezer and John, eh, angels, to never speed?

Now this is a good idea; the classic low tech solution to a high tech
threat. How about a community organistion that put together a pool of
rental, pre-pay phones which you could check in and out, where the link
between phone and user were never recorded?

Better, disposable phones where the user need never identify him/herself. I
hear that this might be about to exist here, maybe it already does in the
US? I don't know about the no-identification bit, but that's what I'd opt
for.

(I just read cryptonomicon for the first time; can't shake the paranoia
about communicating in the clear!)

I think it is more complex than that.  Many of us 
scientific/engineering types tend to see the world roughly in 
terms of "it" level categories, that which can be studied 
objectively "out there" by science and systems theory and so on. 
  It is easy for us to neglect the "I/we" categories that 
include subjective, inter-subjective, spiritual,  and so on 
aspects or try to deconstruct it in terms only of "it" concepts 
and categories we are comfortable with.  But any authentic 
self-sustaining movement must include all parts of reality, not 
just or predominantly those we are most comfortable with.  Any 
movement that captures enough people to make real change must 
engage people on all levels that are vividly important to them. 
In that light I believe extropianism must include "I/we" aspects 
including spiritual aspects if it is to succeed at all.  Also, 
as I have stated often, some of the most fundamental problems we 
face are problems of values, ethics, and understanding/support 
of one another.  It is in our misunderstanding and fast judgment 
of one another, or assumptions that we can win while the rest of 
the world goes to hell,  that we will most likely err in the use

As I am sure you know, our drug laws have almost nothing to do 
with this and will not be defeated so easily.  We have the Feds 
denying the ability of states to make their own decisions about 
any drugs.  We have a massive re-education problem about the 
entire subject.  The folks at NORML can tell you how easy it 
isn't to get the people mobilized to vote against these laws and 
how seldom that turns out to be enough to change them.

And this is just one tiny part of the interlocked monolith of 
regulation and control.  How will you educate and mobilize 
enough people (a majority or majority of their representatives) 
to stop most of it?

Actually it is none of the governments business to assume that 
someone carrying a lot of cash is up to no good.  I guess they 
are happier if folks are carrying more debt than they can repay 
in the next 10 years instead.

Sure.  But what happens when you disagree with your Borg 
collective or your collective disagrees with another one?

We could have a lot of efficiency also if we werent' all so busy 
attempting to to maximize the amount of green we receive that we 
often literally sell-out what we believe would be our best work 
and best contribution.  We sell our lives to "make a living" and 
then wonder why we need drugs to get through the day dependably. 
Imagine what riches have been squandered away.  Imagine what 
riches of new ideas and technologies are still born because 
their are too many fences and the fences are too high across the 
in intellectual commons of humankind.  Sometimes I think the 
greatest danger to Singularity is not war or terrorism but is 
being nickled and dimed to death at every increasing speed, 
scope and efficiency.

Competitor.  Competition helps us sharpen the senses,

Economic competition.  May the richest borg win.  May
the others live to play another day.

Samantha, dont think of it as selling out for green stuff.
Think of it as a grand game, where dollars are used to
keep score.  Its all just a game.  The real trick is to
have fun while you are making a living.

Drugs are not needed.  A better job is needed.  Ive
sensed an undertone of career dissatisfaction in a
number of your posts.  You are living in the greatest
part of the greatest planet in the galaxy in the best
of all times in the history of humanity.  Reach out
and grab the life you want.  spike

This very message gets amplified by two to three orders of magnitude, and
goes fanned out all over the world. It is not paranoia to assume that a
fair fraction of not all of them make a passage through an ASIC bank
somewhere, or past a racked box with a NIC switched to promiscuous mode.  
In fact it's pure prudence to assume this is happening.

Now, can you do something about it? Of course. There's a thing called
STARTTLS (RFC 2487), which is available in form of patches for all
mainstream MTAs (sendmail, qmail, postfix, exim). In fact, the author of
qmail is taking the matter to court next week, I believe, intending to
make STARTTLS default in qmail (can be wrong about this, though). On the
last leg of the journey there's IMAP/SSL and POP/SSL, supported by most
email clients. Purists can just ssh to a *nix account (unfortunately, I
can't run an MTA reliably from a largely blackholed dialup IP pool), and
use a MUA reading directly from the mailspool.

This is still not bulletproof, since you can MITM attack the public key
exchange, but there are measures against that (a few admin vigilantes
verifying the fingerprint via voice, caching of certs and
cross-correlation of (IP, cert) tuples across many machines, raising alarm
when a cert has changed, etc), and we're clearly decades away from the
capability of blanket MITM. Basically, this mode of attack is currently
completely theoretical, and we should rather work protecting the bulk of
all email traffic (instead of a small fraction as it is happening
currently) against blanket snoopery.

It's simple economics; people dislike crime, and expect the
government to do something.  When the odds of catching a real
criminal are very low, the only things the government can do
to lower the crime rate are (1) raise sentences to ridiculous
levels to hope for deterrence, (2) relax standards of evidence
for conviction, (3) criminalize related behaviors that are
easier to catch.

If it becomes easier to catch those who commit real crimes,
the benefit of long sentences and sloppy evidence and consensual
crime laws goes down; when it goes down low enough where the
injustices of them outweigh the benefits, both the people and
the government will be falling over themselves to repeal them.
The people don't consciously think that way, but that's the
way it has to work out--economics predicts the behavior of
even those who aren't consciously rational.

A transparent society would have greater respect for the
rights of the accused, fewer consensual crime laws, and more
lenient treatment of criminals, because it could afford to.

How?  Why should the power holders allow you to?  How will you 
force it or otherwise get around them, especially as they gain 
keener tools to watch and block would be agents of change at 
every step?  I am not cynical.  I am just the opposite.  But

In practice cops confiscate cameras and slap on extra criminal 
charges that are upheld by the courts.  It is actually illegal 
to film "public" officials acting in their "public" capacity in 
many circumstances

Are you claiming our current economic system and ideas are quite 
sufficient for a world of actual abundance rather than the world 
of scarcity they were designed for?  If so then please show your 
argument.

Will you stop the tongue-in-cheek cuteness and give your best

....or is that Buddhist Transhumanists?

I'm preparing an article for Betterhumans about the seemingly 
disproportionate large number of Buddhists in the Transhumanist community, 
and inquiring wetware minds like mine want to know why.

If you consider yourself to be a Transhumanist Buddhist, please take the 
time to answer the following questions to help me in my research:

1. What was your original spiritual upbringing?
2. Assuming your background was not already Buddhist, how did you come to 
discover and accept Buddhism?
3. How and why is Buddhism so compatible with your Transhumanist worldview?

Check the ExI archieve. (Which is down right now but I'm trying to get
someone to fix it as I write this.)

A couple of months ago there was a lengthy discussion on topic of
Transhumanism and Buddism.  I'm not at my studio computer, so I don't have
access to the posts, but I'm sure you can get them from E.Shaun.  

You will probably want the entire conversation/debate to be objective
rather than soliciting individual posts from that and related threads which
may not reflect the entire list.

Natasha

It's one thing to be stubborn, but don't be disingenuous; we've
answered many times, you just don't accept the answer.  Mutual
transparency is self-reinforcing: the other side can't be
secretive because you can catch them trying.  And how we get
from here to there is mostly a matter of culture: we simply
have to create an ethic among the people that the government
and its agents do not have a right to privacy in their official
duties; once that's understodd and accepted, the technologies
of surveillance (all of which are /created/ by the people,
remember, not the government) will be turned first upon those
for whom secrecy is seen as unethical.

It will be difficult to change the culture that way, because
we have all grown up in a society where "privacy" was a useful
tool to protect ourselves from an overly intrusive government,
and our initial knee-jerk reaction to surveillance technologies
will be negative (we also have Orwell to thank for much of that
misperception--but like all sci-fi writers he gets the future
completely wrong).

### Vote for the right people. Talk to people. Convince them about the
virtues of transparency. Write letters to newspapers. Proselytize. Organize
a million cameras march. Wear a camera. Scream loudly when they take it from
you. Insist on your right to know. Gain a 30% voter share in favor of
transparency.

Wear a camera.

And how will transparency be maintained?

Once there is transparency, it will be a largely self-maintaining mode.
Trying to hide will be visible, and punishable.

### All accounts to the contrary, the American people are the power holders
in the US. It isn't the optimal solution, because 50% have by definition
below average intelligence, but all you need to get anything done, be it
evil, or good, is a suitable block of determined voters. No need for a
revolution, just masses of people making the right choice.

Do you think that the success of the civil rights movement is due to
revolutionaries, and activists? I don't think so. Civil rights prevailed
because a sufficient number of previously apathetic voters grew weary of the
evil the used to condone by their inactivity, and goodness won. Martin
Luther King and others were catalysts but the true force were the morally
motivated voters.

### Be a martyr. Call the local college. Organize students in defense of
gargoyles. Appeal to a higher court. Write an article on Law Review, or ask
your lawyer friend to do it for you.

It took only one courageous woman who wouldn't yield her place in the bus to
start the transformation. Maybe it will take the one person who won't give
up the camera, to transform this country again.

Wear a camera.

The third millenium and in particular the 21st century will see more and
more the unification of science and, lets say, of the religious world, of
the integrated understanding of our universe, both marching hand to hand.
At least that was the prediction of Master Deshimaru.

How can there be such a thing as "anarcho-capitalism"?

I mean, private property itself is the hugest state intervention in the 
natural order of things around. The state exists to protect private 
property... that's what it is, it is the thing which enforces the existance 
of private property. It's a common organization formed by those whom people 
are subservient to to protect thier wealth by force.

What is socialism? Well, one dictionary defines it as communal control of 
the means of production. Another says that it is either communal or state 
control of production. Now you can use the clause of 'state' in the latter 
definition to declare that tyrannies like the USSR and the PRC are 
socialistic, but I don't think that's in the spirit of socialism. I mean, if 
you look at socialist literature, another thing they mention is, 
classlessness. And you certainly can't have classlessness in the midst of 
tyranny, that's about as massive a political oxymoron as you can have. So, 
there is no really no such thing as 'authoritarian socialism', this is 
something that was made up to scare people, it has no basis in reality.

The USSR wasn't socialistic, it was tyrannical, the means of production not 
controlled communally but rather by an elite group, the Communist Party. Yet 
in the United States, the means of production are also controlled by a 
similar elite group, although here people have been able to win certain 
rights which make it a more decent place to live. But if you want a 
libertarian society, then what is needed is to get rid of these elites 
entirely, and bring the means of production under a more decent kind of 
operation, probably not "democratic" in the sense of "total" democracy with 
no respect for the rights of the individual, but rather a sort of 
individualistic pseudo-democracy. I know that sounds kind of strange, but it 
isn't sharply defined ; we can't do that until we get there, and that's a 
long way away.

If you look up "french libertarian" on Yahoo!, you'll find, not these 
"capitalist libertarian" websites, or "anarcho-capitalist" websites, but 
you'll find libertarian communist and libertarian socialist websites. That's 
no coincidence ; in Europe, it is generally understood that you can't have a 
society which is grouped into classes of wealth and power and still have it 
be libertarian, that's a huge contradiction.

There are lots of names for libertarian socialism, and another popular one 
is anarchism. If you read the anarchist FAQ, there's a lot more than I can 
say here that's written there. It's pretty interesting stuff, so you might 
consider skimming it before replying. The address is www.anarchistfaq.org. 
Needless to say, anarchism is totally different than "anarcho"-capitalism in 
character ; you can pretty much instantly sense that there is a large gulf 
between the two once you start reading. That's because "anarcho"-capitalism 
is not libertarian, it's an oxymoron which has been perpetuated by misguided 
people who have accepted the propaganda line that private control equals 
liberty (liberty is slavery, pretty much) and taken the absurdity to its 
extreme.

During elections in Italy, around 50 million votes are routinely counted
in one day. The same is true for most european nations. No high tech
involved, just manual counting.

In fact, no one here understands what happened in Florida, and WHY it took
such a long time to count those votes manually.

So the lock on your house only exists because of the state?  Clearly
"personal" property (which is generally recognized even by socialists
because there's simply no rational alternative) is a natural thing
that requires no intervention--simply the commitment of the user to
retain direct physical control.  You don't need states and laws to
chase an intruder out of your cave--you just need a club.

But even the more abstract forms of property that today are protected
by the state will arise from natural systems like that by mutual
agreement.  It would be harder, for example, to chase intruders off
of a large field, for example, but methods will be created: fences and
other technologies, and cooperation agreements.  For example, a small
village /does/ have enough human labor to protect a large field, so
they can agree among themselves to all protect the field from outsiders
in exchange for part of its produce.  This is a much better deal for
them than a complete commons, because without the ability to plan for
the furute one cannot make progress--and one cannot plan for the
future unless you have some assurance that the resources you have
today will still be there tomorrow.  "Ownership" is just a simple
way of making that possible--indeed it's the simplest possible way
to achieve that goal (any other system requires complex laws).  And
once they all have a fixed set of rights (and that all property is--
a set of exclusive rights), they can and will trade them to increase
efficiency by comparitive advantage.

Property, trade, and cooperation are what make specialization and
progress possible.  Humans will find ways to accomplish these things
with or without a state.  For example, Posner offers several examples
of where property rights have arisen among people that directly
conflict with laws, but the people protect them because they are
more economically efficient than the actual laws.

Abstract: We developed high-density microfluidic chips that contain
plumbing networks with thousands of micromechanical valves and hundreds of
individually addressable chambers. These fluidic devices are analogous to
electronic integrated circuits fabricated using large-scale integration. A
key component of these networks is the fluidic multiplexor, which is a
combinatorial array of binary valve patterns that exponentially increases
the processing power of a network by allowing complex fluid manipulations
with a minimal number of inputs. We used these integrated microfluidic
networks to construct the microfluidic analog of a comparator array and a
microfluidic memory storage device whose behavior resembles random-access
memory.

NASA studies lasers to divert asteroids By DEE ANN DIVIS, Science and=20
Technology Editor

HOUSTON, Oct. 18 (UPI) -- Though there is only a remote chance that an=20
asteroid will strike Earth, the spectacular crash of the Shoemaker-Levy come=
t=20
into the planet Jupiter in 1993 and a razor-thin miss between an asteroid an=
d=20
Earth only last year have sharpened attention on work NASA has been doing to=
=20
prevent impacts and their devastating results.

Even a small asteroid or comet of only about 100 meters can cause tremendous=
=20
damage. It was an asteroid of that size that flattened 2,000 square miles of=
=20
forest in Siberia in 1908. Though there is still only a one in 250,000 chanc=
e=20
of impact, an asteroid that is roughly 1.2 kilometer across -- big enough to=
=20
destroy a continent on impact -- is expected to pass near Earth on Feb. 1,=20
2019.

But it was a comet that did hit that really caught the world's attention.=20
When the comet Shoemaker-Levy struck about 10 years ago, scientists had a=20
ring-side seat as it tore planet-size holes in the golden surface of Jupiter=
=20
in a series of impacts -- impacts big enough to destroy Earth.

"I think it made an impression," Jonathan Campbell, a NASA researcher at=20
Marshall Space Flight Center, told United Press International.

There are roughly 1,000 to 2,000 Earth-orbiting asteroids in the one to=20
10-kilometer class, that is, if they were a smooth ball instead of large=20
lumpy rocks they would be about 1 km across. There are far more smaller=20
asteroids, about 200,000 in the 100-meter class.

Campbell, whose work at NASA is part of Marshall's new National Space Scienc=
e=20
and Technology Center, is studying using a laser to shift the orbit of such=20
dangerous asteroids. Carlos Roithmayr, a scientist at NASA's Langley Researc=
h=20
Center in Hampton, Va., is also looking at using lasers. Both scientists=20
presented their projects Thursday to attendees at the World Space Congress i=

HOUSTON, Oct. 18 (UPI) -- Though there is only a remote chance that an aster=

<BR>
Even a small asteroid or comet of only about 100 meters can cause tremendous=
 damage. It was an asteroid of that size that flattened 2,000 square miles o=

<BR>
"I think it made an impression," Jonathan Campbell, a NASA researcher at Mar=

Private property and "the state" both existed before the idea of capitalism 
did.  They have clear pre-human antecedants.  For property read territory, as 
in a hunting territory.  For "the state" read the gang that clustered around 
the dominant male.  Baboons do this, Lions do this, chimpanzees do this, 
people do this, dogs and wolves do this.  Cats don't.  They aren't social 
enough to have needed the state.

Capitalism is probably a human invention.  I'm not even sure how it could be 
defined so that we could look around for non-human analogs.

In these discussions I find a mostly unstated
presumption that the recording devices will be setup,
operated, and owned by the govt.  To me that means a
big brother situation, and any expectation of
symmetric transparency is nonsense.  

However, if the cameras and microphones are set up and
owned by private individuals--around and in their
homes, cars, businesses, and on their persons, then
not only do you have a high degree of control of the
data--the govt gets it only by subpoena or as a
consequence of an established tradition of
demonstrated deference to the citizen data-owners--
but you have the govt data-collectors vastly
outnumbered.

I am not convinced that the govt has under all
circumstances and for all time the upper hand in this.
 If the random handy video camera can in a
fluke--Rodney King-- force accountability on the cops,
then what would be the result of an environment
saturated with privately-owned recording devices?

And if bugging the govt in non-national security
areas, becomes illegal--it probably already is--then
what about throwaway fly-on-the-wall devices that have
no owners and dump their data to a net for all to
view.  Much like file trading of copyrighted works,
tracking the origins and multitude of destinations
becomes overwhelming, and that's even before any
enforcement action is attempted.

Some revolutions are effected by force of arms, but

 It is actually illegal to film "public" officials
acting in their "public" capacity in 
many circumstances.

If enough people break this law then it ceases to
achieve its corruption-protecting purpose, and the
corruption *may* face the challenge that finally beats
it.

Ok, my good friend Spike has *finally* gone over the edge.
I knew it might happen someday, but I thought it might be
when he got a bit older.  :-(

On Thu, 17 Oct 2002, spike66 wrote:

Jimeny cricket spike.  Of course there is a reason to have
anti-drug laws.  To prevent people from killing themselves
and/or others!  If I could take a drug to eliminate the
pain I've been in the last few days I *would* do it.
(Its a chronic back condition.)  I'm trying to tread
a thin line between lesser of two evils (the prescription
medications and the non-presription medications) until I get
to see a physician who is well enough informed to give
me some alternate options.  I'm even considering whether
I should undergo back surgery to have a couple of disks
fused and from what I've read about *that* proceedure its
a *really* extreme solution for me to even be *thinking* about.

Now of course there are the recent reports on how much more
brain damaging Extasy is (though Eugene has pointed out to
me articles claiming this may be poor science -- so take
them with a grain of salt).

And then of course I saw some recent TV program (Law and
Order probably), about how some PCP pumped female actually
started consuming (lord doesn't she know about Mad Cow Disease???)
her female rival for her boyfriend's attention when an opportunity
arose to do that (you wonder where the writers get these stories).

Spike -- get this -- drugs are "usually" bad.  They can
destroy a reasonably rational thinking process on which the
whole structure of society is based.  They are risky
for the people taking them and they are potentially
risky for *you*!

The normal concept of legal "deterrence" (no, you shouldn't
*eat* human bodies -- we have a law against that) may
disappear when people are on drugs.  They may not be
thinking "rationally".  IMO, drug consumption is something
that should primarily be allowed but it can only be allowed in
environments where people behaving irrationally cannot
not pose threats to others.  Additionally, if my experience over
the last couple of days is any example, then regulating
certain prescription drugs is actually a *good* idea --
and I would *not* have said that a month ago.

> Another example is speed laws.  We don't need them.  We

Again I have to disagree here.  (Nods to Rafal who I think
*really* objects to speed limits.)  The problem *may* be
a cultural one -- i.e. in Germany the slowpokes know enough
to stay in the right lane.  But there are fundamental safety
problems with vehicles travelling at highly different
velocities on the same roadway.  The reaction time of
a 70 year old is *not* the reaction time of a 20 year old.
Drivers cannot always predict when they are going to encounter
"black ice".  Less informed drivers may not even know what
"black ice" is!  So they might be driving *safely* given
normal driving conditions but nobody is going to find them
guilty of driving unsafely with respect to "things they did
not know".  [This is why you have commercials that say in
the fine print at the bottom -- "This should not be attempted
by non-professional drivers" or statements to that effect.]

Bottom line -- high velocity vehicles are carrying more
"energy on board" and represent a greater threat than
low velocity vehicles.  Public safety -- IMO justifies
speed limits.  After you have had a vasculoid system
installed and agree to drive on a separate highway system,
you can go any darn speed you can propel your vehicle to.
(So long as your automobile and health insurance aren't
in *my* insurance pool.)

ROTFL.  Raises the interesting question of what *do* Eliezer
and John do for fun?  :-)  [I'm not asking this rhetorical
question so we get a large number of responses -- both of
them are valued members of the list and it simply wouldn't
be nice to voice our opinions in this area to large numbers
of people.  Take the responses offlist and gossip about
them behind their backs...  :-)]

I don't think so -- there are enough people that care about
the safety of themselves in their cars or their children
crossing the street that there would be a fair amount
of debate on this idea.  In WA state they have been
*decreasing* the acceptable levels of blood alcohol
and increasing the ages where *any* is tolerated.

Well, I think we can watch the U.K. to see how it plays out
before we take such actions in the U.S.

Can we get a citation or two on this?  I would expect it to
be a violation of my freedom of speech rights.  The only
exception I can think of is restrictions on filming government
buildings that I think came up in WA last year.
(These were non "national security" buildings but happened at
the height of the 911 paranoia.  And the confiscation of
the camera did cause quite a bit of noise.)

Ah but what about "ubiquitous" surveillance?  I'm watching
my property for intruders and a cop pulls from their car
and mistreats someone on the street in the same camera view?

Its going to require some really strange changes in the
laws for the cops to get my tape or for it not to be
used as evidence in court (at least in the U.S.).
Obviously automated heat detecting/motion sensing cameras
would be even more likely to detect such situations.
This might only work well in relatively dense cities of course.

I'll probably get lambasted for suggesting this but perhaps
it is because government bureaucracy is greater in Europe
than in the U.S. and you simply have more people to do
the manual counting.

I'll balance this by saying that in part it was due to
the fact that we may have a greater fraction of really
undereducated people in the U.S. (I'm being polite here).
This leads to a lot of "I want to vote for Bush *and* Gore".
Thus you get into endless debates over whether those darn
"chads" were clearly punched.

That is exactly what I am claiming.  Not just sufficient,

Our current economic system was not so much designed
as it evolved.  As abundance increases, as a direct
result of humans creating wealth as a byproduct of
our labor and brains, our economic system evolves to
be ever better adapted to the world in which it
exists.  Attempts at designing economic systems
have led to such horrific abominations as communism
and totalitarianism.  May economic systems be left
to evolve, hands off.

This is my best thinking please.

Part of having it made is knowing when you have it made.
We have it made.  We will have even more in the future
as wealth is created in ever more efficient ways.  No
drugs needed.

Unfettered competition has winners and losers, but in
the long run everyone wins.  Attempts at deterring
economic competition in a misguided attempt to make
everyone a winner ends up making everyone a loser.

A perfect example of what I am talking about is just
down the street from where you live.  Intel in
Sunnyvale and Advanced Micro Devices next to it
in Santa Clara.  Those two guys have been hoping to
strangle each other for years.  The winner:  us!
We win, all of us.  We get processors that are
better, faster, cheaper (to borrow a phrase.)

What part of your question did I not answer?  spike

Wow.  You guys are way meaner than I am.  I generally try
to take spiders outside -- though I'll sometimes resort
to flushing them down the toilet.  Either of these alternatives
I view as giving them a "fighting chance".  (I generally view
spiders on the positive side of the fence -- taking out health
risks such as ticks and flies.  But of course there are exceptions,
particularly if they bite you and infect you with some unknown
strain of some undiscovered disease.)  So my general perspective
is "me inside" -- "spiders outside".

Now, I don't think there is any positive benefit (to humans)
for slugs.  But I'd definitely favor the "repel" rather than
"maim" strategies.  You two are definitely toast if slugs
ever involve intelligence and read the extropian archives.
Man -- you have got to learn to think long term.  I posted
a post earlier this evening about how fast science is

a "fate worse than death"!

Kudos to whomever changed the topic -- we have way too much

If there were no drug laws, drugs would be so cheap that anyone could afford
to use them. The real reasons for drug laws lie rooted in the quintessential
human desire for control of anything disapproved.

Myself, I don't like associating with heavy drug users. The ones I have
known were mostly selfish, unstable, hurtful people. But so what? It's a big
world, and I don't have to pick drug users for friends. It's their choice,
and a choice that neither I nor anyone else should grant themselves rights
to change.

Why should people be prevented from killing themselves by the agents of the
state? Really now.

And on to the "prevention" thing. Laws of prevention are a sickness in our
culture. They are the result of and foster the growth of a society in which
no-one is considered responsible for their actions. No-one is thought
responsible enough to make their own chioces and live with the results.

If we must have these codified laws -- and personally, I'd be a lot happier
without them, since they do no better than a system based on three simple
rules and human judgement, and cost us all a lot more -- then laws of
deterrence serve better. Punish people for what they do. It's that simple.

There are a million courses of action leading up to the one point of person
X killing person Y. Are you going to support laws that stricture and
constrain every one of those courses of action? This seems to be the
direction our sick society is headed; presupposing that everyone will murder
unless deprived of every means. Of course, the laws don't do anything --
they are just letters on paper -- it is the agents of the state who have to
enforce every one of these things. Monsterous inefficiency, not to say
making slaves of us all.

How much more efficient it is just to punish people who kill. That devolves
enforcement to where it belongs, to the person who makes the choice in
knowledge of the result.

Sigh. So are videogames, you know, or so they say. For every heavy drug user
I have known, there are ten or more who used in moderation and were fine and
dandy people. I can think of people who messed up their reasonably rational
thinking processes and carefully planned lives and finances working 80 weeks
for dotcom companies. Are we banning work next?

I won't even start on religion in this context: too fat of a target.

Didn't you research what you took before you took it? I mean, personal
responsibility and all that.

This one is an excellent example of why we have stupid laws that restrict
personal freedom. Person X cannot handle or is worried about their own
freedom/capabilities to perform act Y. Person X is a politician, ends up a
politician, or has the ear of a politician. Voila -- bad legislation is next
up. Person X projects their feelings on act Y onto the rest of the populace,
therefore justifying removing their freedom.

I'm going to stop here rather than jump in on the speeding thing. This sort
of stuff really is rather depressing. So many people would rather be slaves.
Worse than that, they don't want anyone else to be free.

I think what drives this is the human socio-economic equation.  We all either
want to be recognized or view ourselves as attractive, clever, sophisticated,
etc. -- whatever the currency of your local environment is.

So you are going to innovate and adopt new technologies *if* they
give you an advantage in your local environment.  [Take a look at
how much GMO food is being planted in the U.S. -- contrast that
with how much is being planted in the EU.]

In "collectivist" environments there is a problem how to promote
new ideas in a way that supports the pre-existing hierarchy.
[The classic -- I don't want to make my boss look bad problem.]

In strictly "hierarchical" environments there is a problem of how to break
out of the system.  If you are lucky you have a mentor promoting your
work.  Then you get the credit, recognition, etc. If you aren't then you
have a higher up who credits themselves with your insights.  In this
case the best course of action is to get out of the system.

Since the network is going to (effectively) be "free", I'd place the
emphasis on *who* gathered and/or has the "information" and/or who
manages the databases.

A more sophisticated analysis would compare the relative costs (and *trends*)
in those costs of (a) collecting; (b) storing; and (c) analysing the
information.  I don't believe those vectors are on similar trends.

While I disagree with the "irreversible" position -- I'd hit the floor
with respect of the rest of this comment with a resounding "here here".
If we let it go *too* far -- cleaning up the problem is *much* more
difficult.  We are witnessing the U.S.-Britain/U.N. discussion on this
precise issue today.

I originally wrote this note directly to Spike.  But as I expanded
its discussion I thought it might be useful to the list.  Spike, I
hope you will excuse this expansion of the discussion without my
extensive re-editing.

Spike, while I generally agree with you here, I think you
*may* want to think about the "fickleness" of the masses.

Right now there is a real concrete trend away from investment
in the stock market and VC funds in general.  The government
(on the other hand) made a huge boost in funds in healthtech
over the last decade and is still pushing boosts in funds for
nanotech.

So the public sector is picking up the slack while the private
sector is running scared.  I've got no arguments with your
perspective on socialism, communism, totalitarianism, etc.

*But* you do need to devote more thought to whether *if*
engineered economic systems can be optimal (I'd view us as having
a half-assed engineered economic system at this time.)
The "freedom of the proletariat" perspective may not
work *if* the proletariat is undereducated with respect
to what can best help their cause.  After all the proletariat
presumably would prefer to watch "Friends" than consider what
threats they might be facing or read a difficult article on
technological innovation from Science or Nature.

There is a balance to strike between long term and short
term investments.  (Wouldn't everyone like to have a
replacement heart that costs $200?)  Private capital
can only place those bets on 3-5 year time horizons.
Government capital can look much further down the road
(and should do so for the good of its citizens).  After
all, "I" as a citizen of "20" would desire that my
government use my tax dollars to look out for my
interests at "40" or "60".

There is a real time horizon analysis perspective that
one has to engage in here.  There are two possible goals --
"maximization of yield", i.e. ROI (i.e. additional tax
dollars a government would derive from superior economic
growth) and maximization of the *minimization* of the
"years of potential life lost" (which may have some very
interesting feedback effects on the maximization of yield --
more educated people living longer, as well as decreased
medical care costs, etc.).

I don't know how these should be traded off against one another and/or how
they should be optimized but I'm fairly certain that we don't have good
ideas with regard to how most economic systems and variances thereof are
influencing either saving human lives and/or accelerating human
development. (Obvious cases of regimes executing their citizens in large
numbers excepted.)

I don't believe that one can claim any "Western" democratic
system is the "best" system if one takes into account these
factors.  We are in unexplored economic territory.

 He pointed out that the correlation is less than 1. "Extremely low"
suggests that it is below 0.1. Nothing that I have read suggests that
it is below 0.9.

 It seems to confirm my guess that you are claiming that the existence of
noise in data shows that the data have a signal to noise ratio of zero.

House Gets Own Nanotech Legislation to Consider. One month after the Senate
Commerce Committee passed legislation promoting nanotechnology funding and
development, Rep. Mike Honda, D-Calif., introduced the Nanoscience and
Nanotechnology Advisory Board Act on Thursday. The bill, H.R. 5669, would
establish an independent advisory board comprised of leaders from industry
and academia to advise the President and Congress on research investment
strategy, policy, objectives and oversight related to the government's
National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI). (DC Internet 10/18/02)
http://dc.internet.com/news/article.php/1484461

Nano-Machines Get Some Fresh Air. For nanometer-sized machines, air is so
thick it saps their energy. That means most contraptions must be confined to

Study reveals nanoscale structure in amorphous material. The common view
that amorphous materials are simply jumbled collections of atoms may give
way to a more ordered theory of the materials' formation, according to
experiments conducted at the University of North Carolina.  Studies of an
amorphous form of zinc chloride have revealed an unexpected order at
nanoscale distances that may lead to new engineered materials in a wide
number of industries, said project head James Martin. "What I'm calling
'amorphous-materials engineering' will allow us to design nanostructures and
then go in there and make them, [just as] we do with crystalline engineering

MIT model predicts birthplace of defect in a material. Applications include
nanotechnology, more. Defects such as cracks in a material are responsible
for everything from malfunctioning microchips to earthquakes. Now MIT
engineers have developed a model to predict a defect's birthplace, its
initial features and how it begins to advance through the material.
The model could be especially useful in nanotechnology. "As devices get
smaller and smaller, understanding the phenomena of defect nucleation and
growth becomes more and more important," said Subra Suresh, head of the
Department of Materials Science and Engineering (DMSE). A seemingly
minuscule dislocation--a local disorder in the arrangement of atoms inside a
material--or a crack can drastically compromise the performance of a device.

Chemists Synthesize Key Component in Drive Toward Molecular Electronic
Devices. University of Chicago chemists have successfully synthesized an
electronic component the size of a single molecule that could prove crucial
in the continuing push to miniaturize electronic devices. The component,
called a molecular diode, restricts current flow to one direction between
electronic devices. In the semiconductor industry these components, called
p-n junctions, form half of a transistor. Man-Kit Ng, a 2002 Ph.D. in

I thought of a couple new angles on this.

First, one can argue that narcotics are already
effectively legal in the U.S.  In a sense.  If
one loads up a bunch of supplies, gets a mess
of drugs, hauls it all out to Darwin California
(gotta love that name) one can move into any
empty house, (plenty of them available there rent
free), and do all the drugs one wants.  No one
will bother you out there, I can assure you.  The
dozen or so fellow citizens of Darwin may let
you perish on the street, but they will not bother
you just for doing drugs.  Darwin is the ultimate
libertarian city.

This leads to my second idea: if all drug laws
were eliminated, the welfare system would also
pretty much collapse.  Reason: the drug abuser
would become the poster child for politicians
who ran on the platform of cutting welfare.  They
could stir the soul of Joe Taxpayer by relating
(probaby fictional) accounts of dopers who are
collecting welfare checks and staying stoned
24-7 on now-cheap dope.  JT would respond in force
to that poster child, I can assure you.

Eventually anyone who was legitimately needy,
not just unable to hold a job because of a dope
habit, would need to prove themselves drug free
in order to collect.

Come to think of it, that might not be such
a bad thing: legalize all drugs, then offer
welfare only to those who test out drug free.
The welfare collectors have fewer competitors
for a limited resource, the taxpayer's burden
is reduced, and (assume Peter Fonda voice) the
dopers are FREE to get HIGH without any HASSle
from the MAN.*

Wouldn't everyone win in that scenario?

Why should welfare dollars come with no strings
attached?  We pay the bill, we should be able
to make the rules, eh?

I think about it, but I still conclude that the
masses know what they want.  No one knows better.
If we want to develop super-longevity, we must
*sell it*.  There will be no lack of buyers.

And there will be no lack of non-buyers.  I would
expect a very large percentage of the proletariat
that would choose to live out their miserable 70
years and perish.  As time goes on, more and more
may choose to live longer and longer, this being
a function of improving quality of life provided
by advancing technology.

One of the things I see changing in the next
couple decades (assuming no singularity) is that
it will become a *lot* more fun to be very old.
Currently we do damn little to entertain the elderly.
Take this from one who has organized musical groups
to play at the nursing home: their entertainment is
truly pathetic.  Hey, they like *us*.
And we suck.

I can imagine some really good VRs, that infirm and
nearly immobile persons could use to enjoy a fantasy
mind trip.  And of course there is the previously
examined notion of genital stimulation for the
elderly and infirm, something that isn't done
at all currently, but should be.  It might not
add years to the life, but it would add life to
the years.

If these VRs are any good, people will buy them.
If people buy them, they will make money.
If they make money, people will develop and improve
them.  Companies will compete, better and better
sims evolve.  Rich old geezers will have orgasms.
Wealth will be created.  Everyone wins.

What are you personally, and your geek posse are going to do with with 
some 100 million to a billion video feeds? 

I can tell you the best you can do. You can record a few days worth of it 
to the hard drive, and yield it to anybody who asks for it. Oh, and by 
that time video evidence won't be admissible in court since easily

There's going to be no prestige accounting, no biometrics extraction, no

There are several million such video feeds in the U.K.. They are not

In most places, both civilized and uncivilized, it is illegal to record
police in action. LEOs (and even shop proprietors) don't like being
recorded, and will do everything in their power to harass you, take away
the evidence, and make it (and/or you) disappear.

The 'evidence' will be not admissible as evidence, and soon enough 
fakeable so that you'll need prestige accounting to make it worth 
anything.

Right now it does. Show me how this is about to change. Please outline

You must be really bored. How many video feeds will you watch personally 
during an 8 h day? The best you can do is to record it. No machine vision

Let's see: you'll lose your equipment, all your computers, will be
prosecuted (I don't know whether it's misdemeanour or a felony), pay fines
(and/or go to jail), wind up with a criminal record. In case the recording
was encrypted you'll be forced to yield the key by marinating you in jail.

Kindly skip the rhetoric. Try making recordings of LEOs legal for 
starters. It's easy in a democracy, right? All you have to do is convince 
your peers, so the law is changed.

If enough air molecules aggregate spontaneosly in a corner of your room
you'll suffocate. It is not impossible, you know. Just improbable.

I'll suggest you try filming your next cop in action (use a throwaway 
video camera) to make a shining example. When you get slapped for it, make 
a case, and try to have a law changed.

Several people have tried it already. Somehow, it hasn't made the national
news. Perhaps the revolution won't be televised, after all.

Nonsense.  Some of the drugs on the list, like pot and various 
psychedelics, don't kill, aren't addicting and have really 
important therapeutic uses.  The case against them was grossly 
inflated from "Reefer Madness" on.

Most of the kids in the US as well as we aging children of the

You watch that brain-rot?  Sheesh!  Drugs are definately a step 
up if that is what you are doing to yourself. :-)

No, drugs are not "usually" bad.  Society is based on many 
things, not much of it so "rational".  Psychedelics do not 
destroy rationality but they do take you, for a while, to what 
is beyond what you thought was the border of the rational and 
beyond the rational itself.  Does that leave only "irrational". 
Nope, I found there are other possibilities.  There is the 
post-rational.  I spent quite a bit of time in my arguably 
misspent youth finding out both personally and through working 
switchboards and clinics and observing others.  I have also read 
quite a bit on the subject.

The 10 million dollar question is whether an economic system 
evolved for scarcity will evolve fast enough to something that 
matches the very different conditions of abundance.  It is not 
simply a matter of what the governments or economists do, it is 
a matter of how fast or slowly embedded human economic memes 
shift.  I would present that there is no reason whatsoever to 
suppose that human memes shift as fast as our technology is 
currently moving us to a vastly different environment than our 
economics evolved in and a vastly faster changing situation that 
the means of evolution themselves can deal with.  In these 
circumstances saying strictly "hands off" is not altogether 
justifiable.  We are not back in some relatively prehistoric 
condition as referred to with communism and such.  If Kurzweil 
and others are correct we will see tens of thousands of years 
worth of change in this century.  If some of us are correct we 
will see an orders of magnitude more in one generation.  How in 
the heck in the face of that are we to draw meaningful and 
certain conclusions from stuff at the beginning and middle of 
the 20th century?

What of those who don't in the least have it made?  What of the 
nearly half of humanity that is living in more extreme poverty 
and even starvation than most of us could imagine?  Will we also 
lift them up?  Will we expect them to magically catch up if only 
they act just like us when there is no infrastructure or 
background for them to do so?

Actually, we lost big time for a lot of years of having bacwards 
compatible Intel stuff be almost the only game in town.  We 
arguably did not get the best architecture and still want 
because those competitive circumstances are such that nothing 
too innovative can easily be started and catch up.  Only a few 
player can play in that space.  And they have a vested interest 
in playing a lot of the same old game as long as it is 
profitable regardless of what is best for us.


In software the situation is much worse.

Nanotechnology offers great advantages.  Drexler in 89 predicted nano as 
a super-tech.  It may well be.  Nano may offer us each longevity and

That's ridiculous.  Camera confiscation happens in China, not here.  You 
can follow around a cop with a camera.  There's a television show called 
"Cops" for example, they follow around cops with cameras.

I think the cops are pretty quiet about how much they illegally invade 
privacy.  They're too busy enjoying, you know, or being involved in, all 
the eavesdropping.

You can arrest them, it's called citizen's arrest.  Being a cop just 
means they get to write traffic citations, and they're called upon to 
enforce laws.

Yeah.  Most government records have no security protections from not 
being released.  It's causal that any governmental withholding of public 
evidentiary records is a sign of miscreance, malfeasance, or 
institutional malaise.  Anything else would be uncivilized.

Anyways, cops are just people wearing a uniform.

It would appear that scientists now have a good handle on
how prion diseases cause neuronal cell death and eventually
produce Mad Cow Disease.

It turns out the misfolded prion proteins overwhelm the
normal protein recycling apparatus in the cell and accumulate
to cause cell death.

Prion Diseases

Votes are not counted by any government worker: people to handle vote
operations and counting are hired shortly before (typically, students
looking for a couple of days of work and some bucks. It's also considered
a civil duty with some honor in it). Some kind of officer acts as a
supervisor. All operations are public.
So it seems it's just a matter of organization.

Speaking of which, I cast my first electronic vote today.  Nice Treaty and 
all that........

It was easy to use and the results will be available by midnight.  Areas 
that used paper ballots will have official results by tomorrow.  Still, 
with only a medium turnout expected I doubt they'll be too strained.

Constitutional amendment, anybody?

Those who might be reading this thread without a
background in how we got to where we are (As in just
how unbelievably BAD the MicroSoft products actually
are), or a basis of comparison to where we might be
might want to check out Steven Levy's classic
"Hackers".  Altho it ends in 1983, all the key
conflicts and most of the major players are already
covered in such a way that you can easilly see how the
present day is a direct product of their various
philosophies.

The case of Bill Gates, for example:  Most people
today do not realize that he is directly responsible
for the entire marketing model for software that is
used for 95% of that market.  Gates began sueing
people who pirated his MicroSoft BASIC, way back when
a state of the art micro-computer might have 2K or 8K
of RAM and a audio cassete deck for storage.  Prior to
his attack on free and/or open source, virtually all
software for micros had been written by amateurs or
professional programmers for their own use and
released to anyone who wanted to use it, together with
the source code.

We could have continued with that model.  There were
plenty of professional programmers who enjoyed seeing
their name spread around by adoring fans.  That model
could have segged naturally into a peer reviewed
open-source model that included commercial packages,
but also provided for libraries of proprietary
routines available to anyone for personal use and
experimentation, but subject to royalty fees for
commercial packages.  

Under that model, the 90% cost for marketing and
packaging to go on store shelves would have been
reduced to virtually nothing.  The money would have
gone to the programmers and the on-line or print
review sources, such as magazines.  Even with small
royalties, the programmers would have made a whole lot
more than they typically get today.

Using standard libraries and open source the code
itself would have been much smaller, faster and far
less buggy, as well as costing less than 10% of what
software costs under the model that Gates perpetuated.

I suggested in print in the late '80's, in one of my
published magazine articles, as a refinement of this
model, that computer manufacturers (I focused on the
Amiga) sell their computers with a CD with ALL the
currently most popular software on-board - the top
five wordprocessors or desktop publishing programs,
the top five graphics suites, etc.).  Without the
separate marketing costs adding 90%+, the CD would
have added perhaps $50 - $100 to the cost of the
computer, while still putting more money in the hands
of the actual programmers.

It is truly sad to see that gargantuan pieces of
bloatware that pass for state-of-the-art software
today and are full of bugs and typically lacking in
the basic features that we expected to find 15 years
ago.

How is it - if the Gates model is so good - that The
Gimp can rival PhotoShop and be both smaller and free?
 Or, Blender, which only recently got too big to fit
on a FLOPPY zipped, but directly rivals 3D Studio Max
or Lightwave.

This cannot be repeated often enough. Those of us who are occasional,
informed users (I do enjoy my occasional dosage of psychedelics and
designer drugs) know how far the party line deviates from reality.

What kills in practice is usage of unknown drugs of unknown potency by
uninformed users. The current idiotic 'drug war' policy thus results in
palpable casualties in the trenches, by creating a society of uninformed
users exposed to an array of unknown drugs of random potency. Thanks a
lot, drug warriors. I hope you won't see the results of your policy on 
some of your own children.

I wouldn't make such a strong case, though e.g. THC appears to be

The results in fact completely backfire: having been lied to in small
matters, the users blanket reject the official information sources even
when those offer accurate, valuable information. This is not mere
conjecture. I'm paraphrasing actual opinions from the trenches.

While I consider this most just as advanced entertainment, some of the

I recommend you record the cop giving you the ticket with a camera. Just 
try it. (I recommend it to be better a cheap camera, though).

Just try it. And then report to the list. Okay? Even better, try filming 
an actual arrest of suspects.

Yeah, just pull a gun on an armed cop. It's really easy, and happens all 
the time.

I do have a bit of a mean streak that rears its head now and again, but I'm 
a pussycat really.

I agree with you about the spiders though, they're our allies.  A glass and 
a piece of card and they're on their way.  In fact we're quite the animal 
lovers here.  We have one dachshund, an aquarium of fish, another fish 
upstairs, 7 finches, 2 outside pond fish and 3 chickens.  Oh, and feeders 
for the many wild birds that frequent our backyard.  We even have a 
"hospital box" for the sick ones.  Like I said, I'm really a softy at heart :}

Oh, did I mention the pond frogs?

We have been extremely busy at Creekside lately.  With furniture deliveries, painters everywhere, vacuuming, various machines/systems to master, outfitting the office with every gadget and gizmo imaginable(we have a honey of a fax/scanner/printer), etc., we are eventually getting there!

People from all over the county and beyond are dropping by to take a look at the place.  A young German couple was very disappointed with me when I told them I could not rent them a room! lol  

I often have to put on my "tourguide hat" to satisfy the curiosity of visitors.  People are really taken aback by the beauty and upscale design of Creekside.  I love giving tours and showing the place off. : )

David has included me in the writing of a preliminary brochure for the Creekside which has been fun for me.  And I must say this place certainly can inspire a person to wax poetic! lol  When you come and see you will understand what I mean...

The health inspector paid us a visit the other day and liked what he saw.  I should hope so after all the effort painting and cleaning the kitchen! lol  We had a talk with him where we outlined our menu plans and I got roped into down the road taking a five hour long course in gov't rules on restaurant cleanliness. lol

I just want to say we are very much looking forward to hosting a cryonics gathering on the 26th and 27th of this month!  Things may be a little rough around the edges at that time, but you will from then on have the right to say "I remember the very fun cryonics gathering they had before the place was even officially opened!"  And the bottom line is the cabins by then will be(they basically already are) very inviting, clean and ready to go!

David from time to time takes me aside and teaches me about various aspects of being a manager in this business.  He has been in the field for decades and really knows both the human and technical side of it.  David Pizer is the master and I am his apprentice...

Today we planted trees, I would say close to a small forest worth of them! lol!  Doing this work during the hottest part of the day sure is a good way to build endurance(or invite heatstroke!).  

I see the planting of each young tree as the start of a time capsule right on the Creekside Preserve/Ventureville property.  As the years go by I will see them grow and blossom into large trees which beautify the place and offer needed shade.  And I would like to think as they near their full size Ventureville will not only take shape(and take off!), but that they will be here to welcome back those who in the mid to late 21st century return from cryonic suspension.  The oaks we planted will be witness to some mind-boggling history in the making over the next several centuries! : )

I moved into my living quarters last night and slept well.  This place is my home now.  I have double doors which lead out onto the patio which encircles the main lodge building.  

I just wanted to let you all know what we have been up to.  I hope many of you attend our upcoming cryonics gathering which will be our first opening of the doors to the public!

best wishes to all,

John Grigg

That doesn't make it not ridiculous.

Freedom of the press should guarantee the right to chronicle police 
activities.

Searching for "confiscated the camera" does bring many reports of people 
having their cameras confiscated, there appears to be some blanket claim 
about the recording being evidence.  A cop in the United States doesn't 
have grounds to destroy film.  I think that a subpoena should be 
required to get a person's camera, but I'm not a lawyer.

http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=%22confiscated+the+
camera%22

Confiscation of cameras or film is a sign of either a high security 
area, which is rare on the real world, or an infringement on the right 
to a free press.

Private areas may reasonably request "no cameras", and refuse service to 
camera-carriers.

I've seen tapes of arrests on television.  Not all of them were 
sponsored and presumably censored.

I'm of the possibly misinformed opinion that I can go to a police 
station and get a tour of the whole thing, it being a public building 
provided by taxpayers.

You don't have to bring them in, but you can file a complaint against 
them.  You can ask a cop for his name, affiliation, and badge number and 
he will give it to you.

People very rarely pull guns on cops.  It would be stupid, the cops are 
often armed.  I would say that most cops would never need a sidearm 
except for its psychological effect.

>> Anyways, cops are just people wearing a uniform.

Cops are public employees, tasked and equipped to protect and serve the 
public.  Anything else they are is not a part of their mandate.  This is 
about cops in the United States, where the citizens have certain 
supposedly inalienable protections.

Anyways, some cops are just people, they're just.

There are some problems in the police system.  Sometimes innocent people 
are intimidated by them.  There used to be rampant illegal beatings.  
The field draws some unfortunates with sadistic tendencies.  Take as an 
example the Abner Louima case.  I thought that was disgusting.  It's a 
sign of a major problem.  Most cops wouldn't rape some bum with 
broomsticks.  The prison system is also notoriously a problem.  There 
are inhumanities in the prison system that should be abolished.

A cop is a person with a uniform, a public safety officer.  They have 
the right to give traffic citations, and are part of an organization 
with sometimes extended arrest powers and a system in place for them to 
manage their liability in injuring people as they arrest them.

So anyways, I still think filming police is legal, and constitutionally 
protected, so anyone can go around taking pictures for their own little 
newspaper they never have to publish.

It looks like Neal Stephenson finally has a new novel written entitled 
"Quicksilver", scheduled for release in January.  His "Cryptonomicon" still 
stands as my second favorite novel, behind only "Atlas Shrugged" for 
obvious reasons.

Does anyone have a heads-up as to what the new novel is about?

Ah.  Now I won't feel so bad when one of the better programs on 
my computer beats me.  :-)   The days when I could win simply by 
playing carefully until the machine showed (so it seems to the 
subjective human) its lack of imagination and drive are over.

Those of us extremely skeptical of the wisdom of central planning
are also very skeptical of other ways in which the government
"maximizes" certain outputs of the economy.

The default assumption I endorse is that it's still
too complicated---and will probably always be too
complicated---for "engineered" solution.  The reason
that it will *never* be practical, and I do know how
strong a word "never" is, is that the very elements
about which the planning is to be done, i.e., human
or other beings, are themselves too complex to predict.

And some of us are saying that no one knows what
will best help their (or our) cause, and that
history shows the great power of freedom to 
succeed where engineering has failed.

Unlike some people, I seldom believe in axioms.  However,
Axiom #1 has to be: there is no accounting for taste.

For all you know, the very most productive member of some
nano-team goes home and relaxes watching "Friends".  We
don't know.  We can't know.  What we do know is that that
individual must have the freedom to buy what he or she
wants to buy, so that they remain properly motivated.

Yes, in the 80's and early 90's everyone used this
argument to show how greedy western economies---with
their focus on short term results---would never be
able to match Japan.  Because in Japan, they were
very wise (much wiser than mere market-mechanisms)
and so could look ahead for the long term.

That would be fine, but it's too complex, for the
aforementioned reasons.

There is a reason that it's unexplored.  It's too difficult
for all the geniuses and all the computer simulations and
programs that thousands and thousands of economists around
the world have tried.

    This is the 69'th update of my fly longevity experiments. Average
temperature was 24.2 C during this run. Here I check to see if freshness
is as important in cinnamon, as it is with paprika. I also recheck paprika
for consistency in its lifespan advantage.
    Aged cinnamon from an opened container proved to be surprisingly
toxic. By comparison the two higher doses of fresh cinnamon offered a
survival advantage late in life. The higher dosages of paprika also
offered an advantage.

Lee,
       Yes, if you read von Hayek's Road to Serfdom he describes the 
situation you have just mentioned and says that at some point a planned 
economy gets too complex for an elected legislature to manage.  At that time 
conditions often get so bad that the electorate starts demanding a strongman 
take over to make the decisions to make things come out right.  Then as 
absolute power corrupts absolutely we get a Hitler.
       You mentioned "Axiom #1 has to be: there is no accounting for taste."  
Let me offer Axiom #2, "There is always a thug that thinks he is God and will 
kill to prove it."

BTW, my strongest game is Checkers.  Did you ever notice that you can find 
flaws in the programers game and exploit those?  I once had a checker program 
that I could play to a draw -- typically this was a position that repeats 
over and over.  The program would repeat the position a certain number of 
times before making an inferior move rather than repeat again.  That move to 
break the repetitive cycly was invariably an inferior move.

Mandrake does tend to push the bleeding edge.  They've got too few people 
trying to do too much.  And they need work on quality control.

But every problem that they ship with, you can fix.  Whether it's worth it to 
you or not may be a different matter, but its problems are fixable.  If 
problems bother you, then stay away from the *.0 editions.  (I've also heard 
reports that SuSE is having a few QA problems.  Nothing heard yet about Red 
Hat, and I wouldn't hear about the others.)

That said, MS produces the technically worst programs I've seen being sold 
recently.  They're pretty, but really no prettier than Linux themes.  If you 
want something that's pretty problem free, give a look at Red Hat 7.3  (note 
the .3 at the end?).  This will give you an almost uptodate system that has 
very few problems.  Of course, the 8.x series breaks binary compatibility 
with the 7.x series.  So you can't install rpms from one onto the other.

The reason that I'm so down on MS software has to do with some experiences I 
had two weeks ago at work.  First one of my programs that had been working 
for over a month quit cold.  The only solution was to recompile.  No program 
changes were needed, the original was fine.  It just needed to be recompiled.  
(I think it compiles the code in-line with the program text or something, and 
doesn't necessarily notice if the editor corrupts it.)  Then I heard about 
another of my programs had started giving wrong answers.  No warning.  Just 
wrong answers.  Again, recompiling fixed the problem.  But it also started me 
wondering,  I'd known for years that sometimes programs spontaneously broke, 
but everytime I'd noticed it, it had been because they started failing.  How 
many silent errors were being propagated.  And I realized that I had no way 
to even estimate... And this behavior has persisted over three versions (of 
MS Access, but probably applies to all of their code that uses VB scripting).

Yeah, I'ld like a constitutional amendment.  Requiring any voting system to be

permanent records.

Electronic systems are too much black boxes.  You're supposed to trust them to 
be honorable, when they haven't been on much that you can check.

You are correct.  But power at the point determines what happens.  And if the

You are assuming that the police will always act legally.  They are at least 
as prone to breaking the law for their own convenience and pleasure as 
ordinary people are.

There is (or was) an organized group that did just that in a city around where 
I live.  They reduced complaints against the police markedly (after an 
initial rise).  But the reason that it's an organized group is for 
self-protection.  Individuals trying the same activity didn't fare well.

News reporters are in active communication with a powerful organization.  This 
makes individual policemen much more tolerant.  If you saw it happen on 
television, however, the odds are good that it was "approved" (perhaps after 
the fact).

That's one that you not only would not get, but in my opinion you should not 
get.  Some areas are justifiably private.

You'd better have both excellent evidence and a really good lawyer.  And you 
still might loose.  In recent decades the citizen's arrest powers have been 
greatly weakened and the requirements hightened.  And the risk increased.  
Also, I believe that you must be stopping a felony.  And I'm not sure all 
jurisdictions even recognize it.

Legally and constitutionally you are on firm ground.  But if they destroy your 
camera, it's your word against theirs, and who do you think the court would 
support?  Can you prove your case "beyond a reasonable doubt"?  If not, then 
it's even legal for the court to support the abusing cop rather than you.  
Unless they're the one filing the complaint.

Don't put the police on a pedestal.  They're people doing a hard and dangerous 
job.  Sometimes they take "shortcuts".  Sometimes they "know" what is 
"proper", but couldn't prove it in a court of law.  So they "take the law 
into their own hands".  But that's a slippery slope.  And when you give 
people power over other people, there is a certain tendency for it to make 
them crazy.  The more power, the greater the tendency, but if you give a bit 
of extra power to a lot of people, then you will have many who abuse it.  
Perhaps they'll justify it to themselves, but they sure won't want to be put 
on display.  And they have the power, if not the right, to stop you.

Of course one should never feel bad when computers
do better than humans.  They are our mind children,
our evolutionary future, our last and best hope for
the kind of future you and I have described in this
forum.  We want them to excel at everything.  We should
be proud of what mankind has wrought.  spike

Above assumes a single 'best' metric. Which is plain wrong, unless you add
the extra qualifier 'for you'. However, I agree. There are things which NT
does better than Linux, and Windows 2000 does better still (haven't used
XP in depth yet, but the Microsoft tablet PC is very slick, albeit still a
bit rough about the edges in the latency department).  Then there are
things which Redmond systems do very badly, or not at all.

Depending on your valuation of those factors you're running one or several
systems (there's a Win2k warez (I of course wouldn't pay the full price
for it) system on my network which I access via VNC, largely as a bridge
to access hardware I don't have Linux drivers for).

I don't think he meant the system instability issue. I have to kill and
restart Mozilla every week, or two as well, or else run out of swap.

All the distros and alternatives (largely, *BSD) have their strengths, and
their weaknesses. I've used all of those you mentioned. While I run RH 7.3
on two of my boxes I'd rather use Debian and/or Gentoo, but I'm too lazy
to tinker with these on my own time and budget.

Once again, 'worse' is a metric specific to individual users. There's
things in Office 2k which are much better solved than in current
OpenOffice.

It's a tolerable tradeoff between bleeding edge and stability. It's far 
from being perfect, but it's a local minimum in terms of workload as far 
as I'm concerned. YMWV.

I've never used MS Sofware much. As long as I don't have to pay for it 
(the price tag is not worth it) and don't have to warp my being around it 
(speed does feel good, and the first ones are always free, but 
nevertheless I don't use amphetamines) I use it now and then.

You shouldn't have looked into that palantir in the first place. I
personally believe that fire burns (according to the accounts of victims
in the heavy burns unit), and I've got a blister or one on the occasion,
so I don't quite long for the whole body barbecue experience.

Again, this is not an incitement to start a flambe fete. Your mileage WILL
vary.

I forgot to credit Hayak; I have read "The Fatal Conceit", and all
of those who disbelief in the efficacy of central planning should
acknowledge Hayak and Von Mieses as our forefathers.

But I'm not so sure about your phrase "at some point a planned
economy gets to complex" to manage.  I think that from the outset
*every* economy gets too complex to manage in the sense that
it would be more productive and more suitable to the people
if it were *not* managed.

That's plausible, but on the other hand, mostly it's the other
way around.  A planned economy comes into being when a strongman
seizes control.  Of course, perhaps most often of all, the two
simply go together:  the people want socialism (actually that
happens very rarely), and appoint a strongman to make it happen.

Yes, and you never need more than a thousand men to find one.

Lee,
       My memory is that von Hayek felt Hitler was as much a case of being 
recruited as having sought the job.  I don't want to get too involved in that 
argument as I wore out my PB copy of vH's book before I was half through it.  
I now have a HB copy on order and hope it lasts until I finish the last page.
       BTW, I am not denying Hitler also sought the job.

A new and unusual venue for this month's ExtroBritannia get-together on
Saturday the 26th of October at 12,00 o'clock: London's Science Museum.

The reason: it's a great place with plenty to see for technophiles            
and the current exhibition "Metamorphing" is the perfect backdrop to          
this month's topic: morphological freedom. As background reading,             
we'll use Anders Sandbergs' paper of the same title.                          

http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/exhibitions/metamorphing/

http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/Texts/MorphologicalFreedom.htm

We are meeting at 12.00 o'clock in the "picnic area" (see below for           
directions). As the name implies it's ok to bring sandwiches (some            
might prefer to go to a caf or restaurant  we'll see...)                    

While you are at the Science Museum you might want to have a look at          
some of the many other exhibitions (the James Bond one, perhaps?              
Please note that this, unlike "Metamorphing" is not free and costs            
8,95)                                                                        

http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/exhibitions/bond/

IMPORTANT:

Once inside the Science Museum make sure you get hold of a map                
(you'll need it!) and make your way to the "megabite picnic area" on          
the first floor (marked by the number 5 on the first floor on the             
map). If this is your first time, look out for a copy of                      
Kurzweil's "the Age of Spiritual Machines" being displayed at our             
table.                                                                        

DIRECTIONS:

The Science Museum                                                            
Exhibition Road                                                               
South Kensington                                                              
London SW7 2DD                                                                

Buses:

Nearest tube station is South Kensington: still inside the station,           
turn right just outside the ticket barrier, take the underpass and            
just follow the signs (it's quite a walk).

Lol  My strongest game is also Checkers!  I've beaten my fair share of human players online.  I was even getting kind of cocky until a person claiming to be a ninety year-old lady from Texas beat me into the ground!   

The online computer opponent checkers program I was using was just too easy to beat.  Is there a Deep Blue for checkers?? LOL   

I suppose the multitasking necessary to play really good chess is beyond me.  Or maybe I just have a lack of interest due to a cruel stepfather who in my formative years viciously beat me(at Chess) just too many times! 

I've heard some people say online chess was ruined by people who would cheat and use computer programs to play for them in tournament contests.  It would be interesting to have a online tourney where people are actually allowed to cheat in this way!  Only later would they reveal what system they were using.

Now what did this thread have to do with Hussein?  I would say he is one "chess player" who is in danger of checkmate fairly soon.  Of course Bush's pieces are capable of moves Hussein could only dream about doing...

Mandrake?  As in Linux?  Apart from the fact that you
are in a small minority, as virtually everyone with
whom I have ever discussed this who worked with both
NT and Linux vastly preferred Linux, including system
administrators for many of the BIG university or
corporate networks, I don't recall that I specifically
mentioned Linux as being what I would compare NT - or
any MicroSloth product to.  In fact, I use The GIMP
and am starting to learn Blender <www.blender.org> on
my Win2000 system at work.  

To me, it is utterly bizarre to see a reasonably fast
Pentium with almost a Gig of RAM slow to a c r a w l,
just because it's printing to a PostScript printer,
or, worse yet, formatting a floppy.  On my Amiga 1000,
running at 7.14Mhz (clock - the processor ran at half
that), with 1 Meg of RAM, in 1986, I ran over 30
programs simultaneously once just as a test...  THAT
finally bogged the system down.  

But, on the Amiga, I could set the task priorities for
virtually anything on the system.  I could format
multiple floppies - or hard drives - while printing,
while downloading, while rendering, and while entering
new data, all at once.  And, I could create macro
programs piping and controlling applications thru
interprocess languages like REXX.  AND, I could add
new hardware while the system was running.  AND, I
could redefine "logical devices" on the fly, which the
system would treat just like partitions on a hard
drive, so that I could add a fonts directory from a
floppy or zip to the fonts directory ten levels deep
on the hard drive and the system would see them as one
device.  Thus, saving countless hours of work
relinking files on a "modern" MicroSloth idiot box.

We should have been 15 years beyond that point by now.

Mike, you are definitely right up to a point.  Yes, for example the French partisans in occupied WWll France did create a lot of damage to the Nazi's(especially as the Allies were closing in and they needed the German infrastructure hammered hard), but the Germans were very adept at terrorizing the population into submission with interrogations, torture, natives turned into informants, and public executions.  

Despite this, there were French men and women who refused to be cowed and fought as partisans.  But on the other hand there were innocent people who were shot as "revenge" for German troops killed by partisans. 

If the Japanese had successfully occupied parts of the American west coast during WWll, one can only shudder to think what they would have done to us considering the crimes they committed in China!  Japanese occupying troops would have probably killed hundreds of thousands of non-belligerant American citizens to try to quell a rebellion.  They would have made U.S. rebels realize for every Japanese soldier killed or target bombed, dozens or hundreds of Americans would be publicly executed.

Of course considering the American tendancy for war and retaliation, the Japanese would have found themselves in a nightmarish situation with no escape but to retreat from North America or surrender.  

The resulting legal actions resulting in death sentences against the defeated occupiers might have made the Nuremburg trials look tame by comparison.

Actually, the nation which I always thought really fortunate in not having being invaded by Imperial Japan was Australia!  The Japanese would have carried out a great deal of horror there before Allied forces could have rooted them out.  I'm just glad it never happened.

On the tv news program "60 Minutes" they had a segment about how the Japanese today view the war.  Amazingly, they have a whole literary and film genre built around it!  They seem to enjoy books and films which show it as a glorious adventure. lol  A film I would love to see even shows THEIR take on the Pearl Harbor attack.  A small part of the film was even shown which had pilots shouting gleefully as they rained bombs down on U.S. warships in harbor!  

Hopefully nations over the longterm will move beyond this sort of behavior.  I realize some of you may say the possible U.S. invasion & occupation of Iraq is comparable to what I have written about.  But I think you will find the Iraqi people to be very relieved to have a certain murderous and parasitic tyrant & his thugs removed.

best wishes,

John

One of my favorite cartoon characters on TV today is Plankton, on
Sponge Bob Square Pants (See Nickelodeon). For such a small guy, he has
amazing powers of imagination and megalomania. Your post reminds me of
the episode where Sponge Bob wandered through everybody else's dreams
and found that Plankton's dream was about him being a 100' tall monster
squashing and blasting the buildings and denizens of Bikini Bottom.

As you are likely just a leftist troll trying to stir up trouble, I'll
reply concisely here.

A private property owner needs no state to protect their property, they
only need their natural right, recognised all the way back to
Aristotle, to keep and bear arms. The state's only interest is in
perpetuating itself by confiscating the private property of private
individuals, and being used by leftists like yourself to tell
individuals what they are allowed to do with what property they
magnanimously allowed to keep in their posession.

Your lack of ability to comprehend this is a quite typical indicator of
a normal leftist's lack of general intelligence.

The term 'anarcho-capitalism' is, if anything, a redundancy, much like
the term 'stupid leftist'. One need not say both words to communicate
the desired concept.

Another display of left wing cluelessness. ANY sort of socialism is
anti-anarchy, specifically because the act of communal ownership of
property mandates STRUCTURE to manage that property for everyone. Since
'an-archy' means 'without structure', any system that requires
structure to mediate between the natural needs and demands of
individuals, rather than purely chaotic market mechanisms.

Since capitalism mandates chaotic market mechanisms to function,
capitalism is therefore without structure.

Where left wingers get confused is by conflating the concept of
corporations with the concept of capitalism.

A capitalist can easily be for capitalism and against concepts of
corporations as limited liability entities. Such capitalists are the
only true anarchists (since governments are themselves corporations).

I could go on and on, detailing the errors of Proudhon and Bakunin in
the formation of their so called 'socialist libertarianism', but that
is a separate issue that I will only waste time on if someone is truly
interested, willing to have their minds changed, and not just trolling
the list for tao.org.

Linux is not THE solution. Those who're comfortable with the alternative 
OSses, and don't mind the consequences long term should stick to whatever 
system they have.

I personally value stability and being in control far more than bells and 
whistles.

Btw, a week ago or so Blender finally went open source. I see that they no 
longer are slashdotted, and show the full page. Verrry nice.

There were at least as many system tasks running on my A2000 in 1988 as 
what ps aux | wc just told me. It's really nice to run full-featured 
binaries which were few 100 bytes to a few kBytes large.

Amiga OS was noticeably more advanced than your average (some like it in a 
pot, three decades old) old man OS. Frankly, both our software and our 
hardware stinks. It vividly demonstrates that on the short run progress 
can and actually does reverse. We obviously have to wait for the trend to 
pull us out of this swamp.

Look, I've used a 12 (FORTH) MIPS box from 1985, or so, which had a 2
kByte multitasking OS, including the compiler. Judging from descriptions,
Lisp machines from 1983 were really, really nifty.

A number of the better alternative reality branches never happened.

Do I whine? Nope. I mostly keep my mouth shut, and use the best tools I
can find for whetever $$$s I have. I could do much better with a couple
more k$. Apart from clustering, which scales in a fine-grain fashion the
next step of improvement would cost an order of magnitude more, and offer
a much worse ROI. Anything beyond that would be ridiculously expensive
(100 M$ to several G$), and would involve custom hardware.

I'll admit that I haven't seen statistics to back up my sense of 
agreement with Les' points.  His arguments and my experience were 
enough to convince me of the validity of his points.  Can you point to 
credible statistics that show that the correlation between the 
categories produced when Americans self-categorize according to any 
common system and the underlying genetics (in any reasonable sense) is 
higher than .8?

That's a strong overstatement.  I'm surprised that you would believe 
(or merely suggest) that I reason that erratically.

I believe (subject to challenge, of course) that there's so much noise 
in the data we're discussing and so little analysis has been done so 
that conclusions based on the data should not be trusted.

 Look I am not a programmer, and I am not a sysadmin. I have no ax to grind,
but I only want a simple, dependable and easily manipulable platform from
which to conduct research.  Linux has only one advantage compared to NT, as
far as I can tell from my evaluations: it has more free source code for
certain types of interesting applications, and the internals are better
documented in many respects.

As far as stability is concened? Puh-leeze. All those halfbaked little open
source apps crashing all over the place on Mandrake?  NT has it as far as
stability is concerned. Plus, there are severe hardware adaptablity problems
all over the place with Mandrake....


And as far as ease of configuration and adaptability to hardware goes, NT
easily beats Mandrake. Of course WinME, Win98 etc., are even more adaptable
to given hardware, but are not too stable....

My evaluation shows that Mandrake eats more RAM than NT.

However, I can sympathize with the anti-MS feelings, and that is why I still
have Mandrake running---by not using Linux, we give away leverage, and give
away money.

Under current bodylocked states more effective lie detectors are already in 
use (facial and eye recognition systems). The Western Australian police 
system is proposing introducing them, amongst others.

I personally recommend not lying in order to behave ethically.

However, the notion of total transparency of thought is inimical to free 
will. The idea of Singularitarian sysop (systems operation) as protective 
shielding is I believe the idea to explore. Non-consensual intrusion into 
the neuorological systems of others under the conditions of the predawn as  
we move proceed through the final stages of the beginning Singularity is 
unethical because it breaches the idea of freedom of choice and empathetic 
love of others. The proper solution to non-consensual force is sysop, not 
invasive totalitarian monitoring and control.

As far as politicians and their promises are concerned, I suggest other 
possibilities than lie detectors. For example, in a world of 
self-replicating Drexlerian assemblers, it would be possible to have more 
levels of government including local governments. These local governments 
can have particular cultural flavours. This principle could be extended 
further in virtualities. There could be more frequent elections. There could 
be more frequent voting on particular issues. There could be core lists of 
promises and default elections if they are not adhered to. There could be 
disclosure of donations while money exists. Etc.. There is a lot of 
potential for creative thought in this area.

Just a THANK YOU to Gina Miller for this service. I forward most of the 
articles on to half a dozen people (retaining the attribution and original 
source address) to spread the word on nanotechnology. It's important to make 
others realize that what we hold for granted as being obvious and common 
sense matters are actually being expressed in the "real world" sphere.

Ron,

I would think the world's best Checkers player would stalemate the world's best Checkers computer program every time if he/she is playing in top form.  Checkers could be considered the "thinking man's tic tac toe!"

As for the U.S. attack on Iraq, I'm not sure if within forty days all the military forces will be in position for an invasion.  Also, we may still be courting French and Russian support for the war forty days from now.  But I realize President Bush(from the American equivalent of a Roman patrician family) is determined to get Saddam(talk about a MAJOR LEAGUE family grudge, lol!) and my gut feeling is he will go through with things.  

I have a very bad gut feeling that even though Bush and others want to oust Saddam to curtail terrorism, it may ironically have just the opposite effect.  The temporary U.S./U.N. occupation of Iraq could reinvigorate Al Quada(and other groups) with a raging desire to carry out what in the western world would call the ultimate nightmare scenario.  Several hundred-thousand dead in some U.S. or European city may be the price we pay down the road for this military campaign to overthrow a tyrant, but I hope I prove to be just a worry wart on the matter.  We will have a much better idea one to five years after the war(when tempers have hopefully cooled down).

We are in a "damned if you do, damned if you don't" situation here.  I truly believe Saddam must be stopped now before he is fortified with a multitude of homegrown nukes and the accurate delivery systems to use them.  And for all we know, he might have a few tactical nukes he bought from renegade Russians on the black market.  If so we might suffer horrific casualties if we get sloppy and he gets lucky...

I think we all know he has a "Hitler in the bunker at the end of the war" mentality and does not care about his people.  So he will be crazy and desperate enough to try anything once he knows his military's back has been broken and we are coming for him.

Best wishes to my president and the military personnel involved,

John

I also want to thank Gina for ~The Nanogirl News~ which regularly bolsters my conviction nanotech is rapidly developing and will eventually transform humanity.  I realize people regularly thank her on this list, but I just did not want to be an ingrate.

Gina, if you ever quit doing the news, there will be a massive write-in campaign by extropians to get you started again!  It will be the transhumanist equivalent of rabid Futurama fans begging for their favorite show to not be canceled! : )

Avatar, I never even thought of sharing Gina's list with others online!  GREAT IDEA!!  I will start with my brother Mike!  Even though he thinks cryonics is bizarre, this might appeal to him considering his interest in electronics and computers.

best wishes,

John

Nothing, John.  It was some perhaps inappropriate

I miss wordplay on extropians.  We have all been far
not silly enough lately.  Wars do this I suppose.

It was good that this chess match was held in Bahrain.
It shows that some Arabs are way hip.  Looking at the

Whoever was dissing the Nanogirl News a couple
days ago, stop that.  Gina is providing a valuable
service collecting this material, then offering it
to us free.  Thanks Gina!

Your post reminds me of the episode where Sponge Bob wandered through everybody else's dreams and found that Plankton's dream was about him being a 100' tall monster squashing and blasting the buildings and denizens of Bikini Bottom.
(end)
 
I knew this show had hit it big when I saw Sponge Bob toys plastered everywhere in my local retail stores! lol  I wonder how long the show will maintain its popularity...

While visiting a friend and his grandchildren(that's the ONLY REASON I would watch a kid's show..., lol!) I took in two episodes of the show.  I saw a Halloween edition which had extropian overtones and actually disturbed me!  

A "real world" painter in a boat above Bikini Bottom drops his pencil.  Sponge Bob finds it and soon learns whatever he draws comes to life.  He draws himself(with the skill level of a ungifted kindergartner...) and the picture comes to life!  It goes on a rampage and even after Bob thinks he has erased it, the creature comes back!  The story had overtones of both Frankenstein and the dreaded gray goo scenario.  Mike, I think at the next extro you should give a presentation on the extropian metaphors in this fine children's animated childrens program. : )

OK.  I admit to having watched "The Powerpuff Girls Movie" awhile back! lol  And you know what..., it was a real hoot!  The scene where a game of tag gets totally out of control(city is ravaged) on their first day of school is very cool stuff.  I think the fathers in the theater were enjoying it more than their kids were!

In a live action film I could certainly see Robert Bradbury cast as their concerned father figure/guardian.  In one of the scenes he could lecture them about the importance of not offending creatures such as slugs which later on may be uplifted.  They would then remind him about Mojo Jojo who is about the meanest and most calculating uplifted monkey around!       

I sometimes look at my employer's dog Albert(a great dane), and wish there was a way he might be uplifted now.  He could be put to work around the lodge, and would generally be happier having some freedom and responsibility.  I imagine him being like a "dog boy" soldier in the Rifts roleplaying game.

Tomorrow I start being a leader of men around here(just for a few days)! 

best wishes,

John

There's a young woman, the only american, with mad cow disease. My
question is, is there anything left of "her" to be cryonicaly suspended?
She's non communicative and given only months to live at this point. Too
bad her family didn't get involved, then move to Oregon and press for a
suspension after voluntary suicide when she still had some faculty of
self left to make such a decision.

Which brings us to a more relevant question: what trends do we see that
will pull us up from this swamp? Are there any, or are we just assuming
that techno-santa will find a way?

There seems to be several areas where we ought to improve:

* User interface usability 
* Software efficiency
* Software robustness 
* Security 
* Hardware 
* Development freedom

What useful trends do we see here in the fight against locked down buggy
unusable bloatware?

Actually, I'm seeing a reverse trend. R&D expeditures are declining. Shops
like the former Xerox PARC simply do not exist anymore. Even IBM research
has started taking hits.

The software industry is in a state rather resembling rigor mortis.

Augmented reality should bring new innovation. Once we have affordable

Well, the trends in bloat speak for themselves. Perhaps I should get me a
low end Palm, and start hacking http://www.quartus.net/products/forth/

Ditto.

Ditto.

Hardware is a low margin industry, and thus can ill afford dramatic 
innovation. Incremental innovation tends to get stuck in local optima.

Well, we're certainly seeing a large scale tend to more openness, both in 
hardware and software.

Have a look at most terminal cases while taking a stroll through your 
typical home for the elderly. There is not much to suspend in most such 
cases.

What a sheerly silly statement.  Rational behavior changes depending on 
whether you're living in a world where other agents are mostly rational or 
mostly irrational.  If it were irrational to behave rationally in an 
irrational world, then it would be irrational to behave rationally by 
behaving irrationally.

Good lord, no!  Sex is *multiplayer* fun.  It would be philosophically 
unacceptable to wire it into a single-player game.  I'm with Greg Egan and 
Spider Robinson on this one; the proper generalization of sex is telepathy.

Eugene,

But do you feel that in the case of mad cow could the remaining tissue of
dead neurons might be rebuilt by nanotech or does the body/brain reabsorb
the dead tissue? In other words is there any hope at all of perhaps the
trackways remaining, or some kind of physical remnant of the depleted
neurons, some hint as to structure? I have no knowledge of how the disease
presents the remaining brain tissue so I am asking perhaps a dumb question
but that is how one learns.

Note the term 'spongiform' in the name Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy.
It means 'sponge-like', which is unfortunately an accurate description
of how the brain looks like after the disease has advanced. Damaged
neurons and pathways are resorbed, leaving big voids. While future
super-nano might fill in the blanks with new neurons, the information
making up the person has been irretrivably lost.

No. The structure is gone irretrievably. Try finding an MRI scan (showing
extensive lesions) of your average Alzheimer patient, it should be
possible to find one on the web. BSE lesions are even more extensive
('spongiform' illustrates rather vividly you how the brain looks like).

In general MRI scans of even healthy but elderly patients tell a stark 
story.

Unfortunately, no. It pays to die in your prime, assuming there's no 
delay, the suspension is done competently and runs smoothly (there's a 
multitude of opportunties to screw you up, and dead patients tell no 
tales), even not considering that we don't know how much information gets 
erased even with a best case (which is very rare).

I have been running Mandrake 7 for over a year as my mail and web server. 
Not one lockup or crash (once I fixed a small problem with galloping log 
files...)

I also have Win2000, which is NT made pretty. It needs a reboot about once 
a week, due to apps hanging it up. Also, for those imprudent enough to run 
MS servers and mail products, it has a slew of security holes, and it seems 
like new ones are found weekly.

I've had several virus attacks on MS products that got past the virus 
scanner. Not one on Linux.

Note that I don't do everyday work on the Linux box - all my business and 
engineering apps unfortunately are Windows based, with no Linux equivalent. 
So, I have a biased view :)

Mike,
       If it is a socialist state it exists, like National Socialist Germany 
or Communist Russia to allow a few thugs to lord it over and terrorize the 
rest of the citizenry.  In addition the state serves to allow a few mooches

>From the Anarchism FAQ

www.anarchistfaq.org

A.1.4 Are anarchists socialists?

"Yes. All branches of anarchism are opposed to capitalism. This is because
capitalism is based upon oppression and exploitation"

"And since individuals do not exist in a social vacuum, it also means that
freedom must take on a collective aspect"

Arent 'freedom' and 'collective aspect' an oxymoron?  Isnt 'collective
aspect' a polite way of saying 'forced to behave as part of a particular
group' ?

"Are these conditions of freedom met in the capitalist system? Obviously
not. Despite all their rhetoric about "democracy," most of the "advanced"
capitalist states remain only superficially democratic -- and this because
the majority of their citizens are employees who spend about half their
waking hours under the thumb of capitalist dictators (bosses) who allow them
no voice in the crucial economic decisions that affect their lives most
profoundly and require them to work under conditions inimical to independent
thinking"

Its hardly reasonable to compare the despotic regimies of evil dictators
such as Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot and Hitler to 'spending half of your waking
hours under the thumb of a capitalist dictator'  Especially when you can
choose to not work, or to work for yourself.

They quote Chomsky on this topic...

"The capitalist workplace is profoundly undemocratic. Indeed, as Noam
Chomsky points out, the oppressive authority relations in the typical
corporate hierarchy would be called fascist or totalitarian if we were
referring to a political system. In his words : 

"There's nothing individualistic about corporations. These are big
conglomerate institutions, essentially totalitarian in character, but hardly
individualistic. There are few institutions in human society that have such
strict hierarchy and top-down control as a business organisation. Nothing
there about 'don't tread on me`. You're being tread on all the time."
[Keeping the Rabble in Line, p. 280] "

Except in a corporation you can (gasp) quit your job if you dont like it.
Though I guess in a typical despotic totalatarian regime, you can always
simply choose to starve to death or be exectuated instead of participating
in.  Chomsky seems to equate working for a company, earning money for what
you produce to spend on increasing your standard of living, as being a
plantation slave or worse the living life of the worst peasant in communist
russia or cambodia.  

Anarchists would elimate working for others because it exploitive?  What if
I want to choose to work for someone else?  Anarchists would forbid me that
choice?  And they consider this FREEDOM?

They comment on the 'but you can quit' counter argument here...

"Many capitalist apologists have attempted to show that capitalist authority
structures are "voluntary" and are, therefore, somehow not a denial of
individual and social freedom. Milton Friedman (a leading free market
capitalist economist) has attempted to do just this. Like most apologists
for capitalism he ignores the authoritarian relations explicit within wage
labour (within the workplace, "co-ordination" is based upon top-down
command, not horizontal co-operation). Instead he concentrates on the
decision of a worker to sell their labour to a specific boss and so ignores
the lack of freedom within such contracts. He argues that "individuals are
effectively free to enter or not enter into any particular exchange, so
every transaction is strictly voluntary. . . The employee is protected from
coercion by the employer because of other employers for whom he can work."
[Capitalism and Freedom, pp. 14-15] " ... "A moments thought, however, shows
that capitalism is not based on "strictly voluntary" transactions as
Friedman claims. This is because the proviso that is required to make every
transaction "strictly voluntary" is not freedom not to enter any particular
exchange, but freedom not to enter into any exchange at all."..."Some people
giving orders and others obeying them: this is the essence of servitude. Of
course, as [right-Libertarians] smugly [observe], 'one can at least change
jobs,' but you can't avoid having a job -- just as under statism one can at
least change nationalities but you can't avoid subjection to one
nation-state or another. But freedom means more than the right to change
masters" [Bob Black, The Libertarian as Conservative]. Under capitalism,
workers have only the Hobson's choice of being governed/exploited or living
on the street."

So here the Anarchists argue that because you can not choose to NOT work,
capitalism isnt freedom, even though in all other cases you have control
over your employ?  But similiary, Anarchism necessities that you can not
choose to engage in capitalism, thus by the exact same standard that
Anarchism claims capitalism is not free, Anarchism itself is not free.  How
about, instead, a system where you can choose to work OR not work?
Anarchism claims this is not freedom, because you are left to 'wander the
streets'  But how does one support a society of individuals that, in order
to be free, must be able to all choose to NOT work?  (as the need to work,
as defined by Anarchists, is not compatable with freedom) So what does a
society of non-workers do for food?  Mustnt they gather their food?  Or
should someone gather their food for them?  Should the people that are best
capable at gathering food be the ones obliged to do the food gathering (or
producing)  And if they, instead of being obliged to do the food gathering
and producing, instead claim that they have the right to choose not to work
(as work is slavery and thus not freedom) who forces them to produce?  When
it comes down to it, who forces you to produce and gather foodstuffs just
for yourself?  No one but the desire to live.  Thus, by Anarchist standards,
no one can ever possibly be free because they are forced to work for
themselves to stay alive.

"So, when capitalists gush about the "liberty" available under capitalism,
what they are really thinking of is their state-protected freedom to exploit
and oppress workers through the ownership of property, a freedom that allows
them to continue amassing huge disparities of wealth, which in turn insures
their continued power and privileges"

All the while raising the objective standard of living for the entire
population by producing more goods at less cost and making them more
available to more people who also make more now than they have ever before.


"In capitalism, you are "free" to do anything you are permitted to do by
your masters, which amounts to "freedom" with a collar and leash"

In Anarchism, you are 'free' to do only what is permitted by other
anarchists, which also amounts to 'freedom' with a 'collar and leash'  There
is no such thing as a life without a collar and a leash, as nature imposes
her own collars and leashes upon us.  

As if charactherizing a looter complaining of his 'need' in Atlas Shrugged
Anarchism's FAQ says "However, due to past initiations of force (e.g. the
seizure of land by conquest) plus the tendency for capital to concentrate, a
relative handful of people now control vast wealth, depriving all others
access to the means of life."

Depriving all others access to the means of life?  'But what about the
little guy...'  'but its not *fair*, its not *fair*'  If giving you more
free time than any group of humans have ever had in the history of mankind,
living longer healhtier lives spent with your loved ones, embracing yourself
in all aspects that make life worth living imported from all parts of the
world, and doing so without backbracking slavery is 'depriving all others of
access to the means of life' I shudder to think of what "anarchism" has in
store for us.  

Chomsky them makes the comparison to working for someone in a company to be
robbed by a theif at gunpoint

"When a robber denies another person's right to make an infinite number of
other choices besides losing his money or his life and the denial is backed
up by a gun, then this is clearly robbery even though it might be said that
the victim making a 'voluntary choice' between his remaining options. "
[quoted by Noam Chomsky, The Chomsky Reader, p. 186] 

So what would an anarchist society be like if put into place?  I am having
difficulty seeing how anarchism is different from communism?  If anarchism
requires that to be free you must be free of the need to 'work' but one must
'work' to stay alive, how is an anarchist society even logically possible?
If you are not allowed to work as much as you want, in fact you must be
guaranteed the right to choose not to work (or it is not freedom, by their
own definition) who supports you choosing not to work?  Doesnt the person
now supporting you have the right to choose not to work as well?  What if
everyone chooses not to work?  I must not be familiar enough with Anarchism
to understand the society they invision, can anybody help me get a clearer
understanding of this?

Thanks

Neptunium Goes Critical During Experiment At Los Alamos

Los Alamos - Oct 18, 2002
A full-controlled criticality of the element neptunium was achieved in 
late September at Los Alamos National Laboratory's Technical Area 18 using 
a six kilogram nickel-clad neptunium sphere in combination with 
approximately 60 kilograms of enriched uranium.

The experiment was conducted using the "Planet" assembly device at the Los 
Alamos Critical Experiments Facility or LACEF. The neptunium and enriched 
uranium assembly was constructed at TA-18's Critical Assembly and Storage 
Area-One, and mounted on the "Planet" device. The actual criticality was 
controlled remotely to assure the safety and security of the experiment.

The experiment has yielded preliminary data that show the critical mass of 
neptunium is actually less than previously predicted. Following additional 
experimentation, the data will eventually pinpoint the element's exact 
critical mass, something that has not been determined before in the United 
States.

Neptunium is an element produced as a by-product of nuclear power 
generation. Prior to this experiment, the critical mass of neptunium was 
only estimated with computer models from data based on earlier experiments 
using much smaller amounts of the element in less than optimal 
configurations.

"The results of this experiment are of interest to scientists working in 
the fields of nuclear safeguards, nuclear nonproliferation and criticality 
safety," said Steve Clement of the Laboratory's Advanced Nuclear 
Technology group, part of the Nonproliferation and International Security 
Division.

"While the actual criticality was achieved in about four days, this 
experiment has been in the works for 12 years, so on many levels, it's a 
major accomplishment."

Neptunium is a man-made actinide metal, grayish in color, which lies on 
the periodic table of elements between uranium and plutonium. The isotope 
of neptunium used in this first criticality experiment was neptunium-237.

The element has other isotopes that are very short lived, but 
neptunium-237 has an extraordinary long half-life of two million years. 
The International Atomic Energy Agency approved monitoring neptunium in 
1999.

Rene Sanchez and David Loaiza, both of Advanced Nuclear Technology, were 
primarily responsible for the successful criticality, along with a team 
that included Clement, Robert Kimpland, David Hayes, Peter Jaegers, 
Charlene Cappiello, Bill Myers, Ken Butterfield, Charles Hollas, Charles 
Goulding, Joetta Goda, Eric Sorensen and a support team of special nuclear 
materials custodians and others.

"Fabrication of the sphere was completed about 18 months ago here at Los 
Alamos," said Sanchez. "Since then we've been in planning, getting 
permission from the Department of Energy to do the experiment and taking 
care of security issues.

Loaiza, left, and Rene Sanchez, both of Advanced Nuclear Technology 
(NIS-6). Loaiza and Sanchez credit the hard work and tenacity of the whole

ultimate sucess. Photo Credit: Los Alamos National Laboratory
"Once all that was in place, it took about four days to do the technical 
operations of the experiment. It could not have been accomplished without 
the hard work and determination of the whole team, NIS management and the 
NNSA Office of Los Alamos Site Operations."

"After working together as a team for so many years doing something and 
wondering 'Is it ever going to happen?' it was such a great feeling to 
actually bring it together," said Loaiza. "The people here at TA-18 are 
just amazing, excellent people."

The work was done to support the DOE's Criticality Safety Program and the 
National Nuclear Security Administration's Nonproliferation Program and 
Emergency Response Program.

So-called "bare" criticality is achieved when sufficient mass of fissile 
material is present to sustain a nuclear chain reaction without any 
reflective materials. The neptunium criticality was achieved in a "low 
power" state, where the overall radioactivity is kept relatively low, at 
about 300 millirem per hour, and no significant heat or fission byproducts 
are created.

Since the neptunium sphere alone was not of sufficient mass to sustain the 
nuclear reaction, it was placed in the center of several thin nested 
shells of enriched uranium configured in an upper and lower half, with the 
neptunium sphere located in the lower section.

The uranium in this case helps drive the system aiding in the neptunium's 
ability to sustain the chain reaction. The two halves of the assembly were 
placed in the "Planet" device, one half above the other, a safe distance 
apart.

During the experiment, measurements are taken as the lower section is 
raised and brought closer and closer to the upper section until sufficient 
mass of fissile materials is present and criticality is achieved. Since 
the reactivity of enriched uranium is well established the critical mass 
of neptunium can be readily calculated from the experiment's resultant 
data.

"LACEF is the only operational general purpose critical mass laboratory in 
the Western Hemisphere. It is the only facility in the United States where 
this kind of experiment could be done," said Clement.

The team plans to continue with further experiments using a variety of 
reflecting materials. This will enable the scientists to determine the 
critical mass of neptunium under a variety of conditions, as that mass can 
vary depending on the amount of neutrons reflected or absorbed by 
materials surrounding the nuclear material.

Los Alamos National Laboratory is operated by the University of California 
for the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) of the U.S. 
Department of Energy and works in partnership with NNSA's Sandia and 
Lawrence Livermore national laboratories to support NNSA in its mission.

Los Alamos enhances global security by ensuring the safety and reliability 
of the U.S. nuclear stockpile, developing technologies to reduce threats 
from weapons of mass destruction, and solving problems related to energy, 
environment, infrastructure, health and national security concerns.

Court rules mother can use deadly force to protect fetus
Michigan panel rules in favor of woman who killed after man hit her in stomach

By ADAM LIPTAK
THE NEW YORK TIMES

A pregnant woman may use deadly force to protect her fetus even when she does 
not fear for her own life, the Michigan Court of Appeals has ruled. Legal 
experts say the decision has opened another front in the legal wars 
surrounding abortion.

The court emphasized that its decision was a narrow one, concerning only 
assaults against pregnant women, but it acknowledged that it was entering 
charged legal terrain.

"We are obviously aware of the raging debate occurring in this country 
regarding the point at which a fetus becomes a person entitled to all the 
protections of the state and federal constitutions," Judge Patrick Meter 
wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel.

The case arose from a lovers' quarrel involving Jaclyn Kurr and her 
boyfriend, Antonia Pena, the man who had impregnated her. She later testified 
that after Pena had punched her in the stomach, she responded by stabbing him 
in the chest with a kitchen knife, killing him. At the time she was 16 to 17 
weeks pregnant.

She was charged with manslaughter, and the jury rejected her assertion that 
she had been acting in self-defense. She was sentenced to five to 20 years in 
prison.

This month, the appeals court reversed her conviction and ordered a new 
trial. It said the trial judge should have let her argue that she was 
defending not only herself but also "her unborn children."

The court noted that the age of Kurr's fetuses -- she was apparently carrying 
quadruplets -- meant that they could not have survived outside the womb and 
that she could abort them under the Supreme Court's decision in Roe vs. Wade. 
She miscarried a few weeks later.

"One is left with a most peculiar legal situation," said John Mayoue, an 
Atlanta lawyer who is an expert in the various ways the law treats embryos 
and fetuses. "Although she may use deadly force to protect the viable or 
non-viable fetus, thereby ending someone's life, she also has the 
constitutional right to terminate the pregnancy herself without consequence."

Linda Rosenthal, a lawyer with the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, 
said the decision was consistent with the Supreme Court's abortion 
jurisprudence.

"When a woman is carrying a wanted pregnancy and she has made that decision, 
which is constitutionally protected, she has the right to protect the embryo 
or fetus," she said.

About half the states have laws making assaults that cause miscarriages or 
stillbirths criminal. In debates in Congress last year about a possible 
federal version of the law, opponents understood the central issue to be 
abortion and not crime.

"We should have no illusions about the purposes of this bill," said Rep. 
Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., about the Unborn Victims of Violence Act. "It is 
another battle in the war of symbols in the abortion debate, in which 
opponents of a woman's right to choose attempt to portray fetuses, from the 
earliest moments of development, as children."

He continued: "If causing a miscarriage is murder, then, by implication, so 
is abortion, the Supreme Court never mind."

Michigan law allows people to use deadly force to defend themselves when they 
believe their lives are in danger or when they feel threatened by serious 
bodily harm. Kurr failed to convince the jury that the punches amounted to 
either.

The law there allows the use of deadly force in defense of others. The trial 
judge ruled that the fetuses Kurr was carrying were not "others" for these 
purposes.

"I believe in order to be able to assert a defense of others there has to be 
a living human being existing independent of your client," Judge Richard Lyon 
Lamb of the Kalamazoo County Circuit Court, said to Kurr's lawyer. "Under 22 
weeks, there are no others."

In reversing the conviction, the appeals court held that the concept of 
defending others "should also extend to the protection of a fetus, viable or 
non-viable, from an assault against the mother."

The court stressed that it recognized the defense only in the context of an 
assault, thus excluding the destruction of embryos existing outside the body 
and medical abortions.

Gail Rodwan, Kurr's lawyer, said the opinion was limited in its holding but 
not in its implications.

"The opinion certainly does recognize the sense that the fetus was another 
separate from the mother," she said. "That may be something people could 
seize on."

Anti-abortion advocates have on occasion asserted the defense of others to 
charges such as criminal trespass in blocking access to abortion clinics. In 
that context, the defense has been rejected.

Through her lawyer, Kurr, who remains in prison, declined to comment.

Rodwan, in her brief on behalf of Kurr, said that abortion rights should not 
be affected by a ruling in her client's favor. 

Heather Bergmann, a prosecutor, said the state will ask the Michigan Supreme 
Court to hear the case. Its principal argument, she said, will be that the 
right to self-defense is adequate to protect both pregnant women and their 
fetuses.

6 players simultaneously, but according to the website:

Note: Chinook on the web is not the tournament program. The web version uses a 1994 computer (one 
processor) and our 1990 opening book. It only uses the 6 piece databases, has some search enhancements 
disabled, and conducts much more shallow searches than the tournament version.

So you're sort of playing "Chinook--" (or, more correctly, "--Chinook").

I don't know about the rest of you, but I would LOVE a computer that acts 
just like a toaster. That is, it does it's job as soon as it's switched on, 
no waiting for boot-up etc. I think that upgrading computers should be as 
easy as plugging in a new "card", cassette or whatever (Atari 2600 anyone? 
LOL). Users should NEVER have to open a case, configure software, or "plug & 
pray". I just don't understand why hardware/software developers insist on 
making things difficult for the end user. I want my PC to be as easy to use 
as any other appliance or power tool out there. I spend inordinate amounts of 
time cleaning up my PC, configuring, re-configuring etc. If they could 
improve that part of the process and make everything a seamless whole, then I 
would be a much happier camper!

I realize that things aren't going to change overnight, and I hope that 
EVENTUALLY we will get to that stage, but it always seems like the industry 
is constantly bickering over standards and the like, worrying about their 
competetive advantage, instead of making things absolutely simple for the end 
user. Not to mention the uproar that will come when all of the IT 
professionals out there (including myself) who make their living fixing all 
of the problems with today's computer systems have to deal with their own 
obsolescence due to smart, self-installing, self-configuring systems!

I seem to remember from back in the 1960's that there was a program that 
played an unbeateable game of checkers.  Nobody could beat it, not the 
world champion.  (Was it designed by "Samuels"?)  But nobody was 
interested in playing something they had no chance of beating.  So all 
commercial programs use a less perfect algorithm.

Chess is more difficult to program, but even so most commercial chess 
programs are stronger than most players.  Or they can be.  They come 
with adjustable strengths.  Becasue nobody likes to loose all the time.

Go is more difficult than chess, but the programs are starting to get 
pretty good there, too.

It's a good slogan, but as a usable definition it lacks a bit.  Still, 
it might be a fair place to start from.  How do you define capitalism 
and how do you define evolution?  I feel a connection, but I find myself 
unable to verbalize it.  Do you intend evolution here to include the 
formal mathematical theory?  If so, then you are talking about something 
as omnipresent as gravity.  This might be what you mean, but I'm unsure.

Territory, e.g., has two ESS within a species.  In one the holder of the 
territory defends his turf against invaders, in the other he quickly 
moves over into another's territory.  The second form is rare, but it is 
an ESS that evolves naturally under certain specifiable environmental 
constraints.  (I think the main known example is a group of social 
spiders in central america.)

Similarly, if we can create a mathematical theory of capitalism, we 
would necessarily define the environments in which a socialism of some 
sort would be mixed with it.  In fact, it's probably impossible to 
define it without also defining the theory of socialism, where a group 
is evolving.  Examples of this occur frequently, from the many examples 
in the hymenoptera to the rare examples in the mammals (mole rats are 
the only one's that spring to mind).  It would need to specify both of 
those, as well as the stable states in between.

I only have a vague outsiders knowledge of the details here, but with 
proper definitions your slogan may capture a true essence.

"A private property owner needs no state to protect their property, they
only need their natural right, recognised all the way back to
Aristotle, to keep and bear arms."

To keep and bear arms. I suppose that would imply the right to use them to 
defend againist infringements upon their property-- infringements upon their 
right to hoard an arbitrarily large amount of resources compared to other 
people and keep it from them by force. But if you want to do that on a large 
basis, you're going to need organization. If you don't want to do it on an 
organized basis, then you're just going to get warlordism and a violent 
chaos, sort of like the stereotype of anarchy which has been impressed by 
the powerful over the years. On an organized basis, you'll have tyranny, but 
at least some sort of organization will survive.

"The state's only interest is in
perpetuating itself by confiscating the private property of private
individuals"

Well, what do we mean by the private property of individuals? Does the 
private property of individuals even have any objective meaning outside what 
the state tells people it does? Because, if someone goes and steals my car, 
the state says that the person can't have my car, and attempts to find them 
and stop them. I mean, we can talk about what 'the state' means, and I'm 
sure one can define it to mean many things, but I think it's pretty clear 
that control of resources means power over other people. And any 
organization which concentrates control of resources under an elite will 
necessarily elevate that elite to great power in society. So, the state in 
the USSR elevated the ruling elite there to great power, and the state here 
elevates the ruling elite here to great power, in the form of the rich, who 
have great control of the resources here. So it seem sensible to me to 
simply define the state as the organization-- however formed-- which 
concentrates resources in the hands of an elite, or people who have a large 
excess of resources under thier control compared to other people, who need 
those resources. So, under that definition, it doesn't really matter how you 
defend private property-- any way you defend it is by way of forming a 
state, whether it be many small states in the form of armed individuals who 
are each defending thier property alone (which is likely to lead to complete 
chaos and utter devestation) or on an organized basis (say, the Communist 
Party in the USSR or corporate power in the US).

"and being used by leftists like yourself to tell
individuals what they are allowed to do with what property they
magnanimously allowed to keep in their posession."

Well, I certainly don't advocate any sort of centralized power which tells 
people how much resources they have-- that would obviously be a complete 
tyranny. And, I think, the degree of organization that you have in a society 
which does that-- I mean, which centralizes control of resources under an 
elite-- is roughly the degree of misery and tyranny that you're going to 
find in that society.

"Another display of left wing cluelessness. ANY sort of socialism is
anti-anarchy, specifically because the act of communal ownership of
property mandates STRUCTURE to manage that property for everyone."

Well, what kind of structure? Look, I mean, there can't be anything wrong 
with structure, if you didn't have structure you'd be back to the level of 
early primates or something. It's what kind of structure that matters-- if 
it is a tyrannical structure, where people are being coerced and exploited 
and enslaved, that's undesirable, but I don't see how communal ownership 
could possibly do that, because in the past, it is non-communal ownership, 
that is, the control of resources under a centralized power such as a 
dictator or a state (perhaps concentrated into sectors of power like 
corporations or bureaucratic departments which are in the end backed up by 
the state). Communal ownership means, I think, that generally resources are 
able to travel freely and without centralized control. As far as I can see 
that's pretty inherent to the definition of communal ownership. The USSR 
wasn't communal ownership, by the way, it was actually very centralized 
ownership, under the Party. The US is different, but still similiar in many 
ways.

"Since
'an-archy' means 'without structure', any system that requires
structure to mediate between the natural needs and demands of
individuals, rather than purely chaotic market mechanisms."

Well, something that I see right away is that you've created a tautology of 
sorts here-- you're trying to prove that capitalism is anarchistic, and then 
you go on to say that anarchy requires 'purely chaotic market mechanisms', 
implying that you already assumed what you were about to prove... now, I 
don't think that's necessarily too relevant here, but it probably is to some 
degree.

"Where left wingers get confused is by conflating the concept of
corporations with the concept of capitalism".

Well, I think you're right to say that corporate capitalism is different 
from just capitalism, and I think there might be better ways of organizing 
capitalism, if you insist on sticking with it, than organizing into 
corporations in an advanced society. However, if you want to keep your 
society advanced, and a large sector of the population from simply dying of 
starvation, you are going to find some method of large scale organization, 
you can't just rely on "chaotic market mechanisms" (if I'm interpreted what 
that means correctly, which is easily not so). That doesn't mean involuntary 
organization, I mean, I certainly don't agree that anybody should be coerced 
into doing anything they don't want to (as they are in our society, because 
if you don't find a way to get money you generally can't have basic things 
that a human needs, like a small house, even if one is just sitting right in 
front of you, unused, the property of a wealthy individual...and generally 
the only way to get money is to do what the people who have money tell you, 
thus, coercion) but it does mean organization, because if you don't have 
some kind of organization you're going to have a huge humanitarian disaster.

Well, except that the information that I've seen appears to indicate 
that current cyronics does a lot of damage even during the original 
freezing process.  It's a big gamble.  Such a big one, that you're 
probably better putting things off as long as possible in the hope that 
the technology improves.  What you should do is make sure that you 
maintain optimum levels of cholesterol (needed for neuron maintenance, 
deadly as it accumulates in the arteries), anti-oxidants (needed for 
protection from the immune system, but you don't want attackers to also 
be protected), etc.

If cryonics is your only choice, then take it as the best choice 
available.  But don't think of it as a good risk.

Quite. I wonder how is it that socialist "anarchists" can claim that
true anarchism is socialist when the single common characteristic of 
every commune that ever existed is a tendency to become tyrannized by
control freaks.

I would posit that it is because non-free market based systems of
economic distribution are so unwieldy that they require tyrannical
control mechanisms to strongly dictate rules of distribution to avoid
communal dissolution and strife. Given this, it is quite plain to see
that it is impossible for any form of socialism to exhibit any sort of
anarchy in anything but the more benign artistic/cultural aspects.

The mere fact that the socialist 'anarchists' had to write a propaganda
piece calling itself "THE anarchist FAQ" to claim otherwise, whithout
any factual proof in practice, demonstrates how implausible in reality
such a point of view is.

I don't think your story is quite correct there.  The Samuel's checkers
program of the '50s was impressive because it learnt its evaluation
function while playing itself.  It did play some US state champion and
did quite well, but is not "generally regarded" to have been a brilliant
checkers program.  Chinook, otoh, is a giant man-thrashing beast.

Chess is not really much harder to program.  The algorithms involved are
almost identical.  It might be more tedious due to chess's quirky rules
and trickier evaluation, but pretty much identical tricks are used.  The
difference is that chess has a much bigger state space so search
algorithms don't get as deep in the time allocated.  Go has a much
bigger state space still.

Charles,
       Could you expand on a "mathematical theory of capitalism" just a 
little bit?  For most of us that propound Capitalism I imagine it to be a 
matter of morality rather than either economics or mathematics.  Now, I 
believe we would agree that Capitalism has economice consequences but that 
isn't the basis for Capitalism.  We believe a person has the ownership of 
their bodies and the products of their labor.
       Socialism is also based on a view of morality.  They believe they have 
the right to be thugs and moochers.

I've disproved these statements before. The first fallacy is that
capitalism is based on oppression and exploitation. Since capitalism is
based on a chaotic free market, there are no mechanisms inherent in
capitalism that mandate oppression or exploitation. Any social
phenomena that evolve such characteristics are also present in
socialist societies to far greater degrees than is found in capitalist
societies, primarily because the ability of the individual in a free
market to choose their 'tyrant', be it themselves, or one of many
millions of possible for profit or non profit employers, induces a
competetive market that is not present in socialist societies, where
the state/commune is the only customer for the individual's labor, and
as such exerts monopoly pressure on the individuals ability to survive.

The second fallacy is the untrue assumption that individuals cannot
exist in a social vacuum. Individuals have proven time and again
throughout history that it is entirely possible for individuals to
exist in a social vaccum. Furthermore, society cannot exist without the
presence of two or more individuals, ergo society is the dependent
entity, while the individual is the independent and sovereign entity.

They must demonstrate one example of an individual, living in a
communal setting, where "freedom takes on a communal aspect", where
their independent thinking is permitted to fully express itself, free
of the peer pressure of consensual dictation, in any way other than
within the bounds prescribed by the commune's established code of
political correctness.

As I've said before, left wingers such as Chomsky, et al, tend to
conflate the concepts of capitalism with corporations. Since
corporations are legal entities that only exist with the consent of the
state, it is rather obvious that the free market, which existed before
the state was even a concept in Nature (i.e. evolution via natural
selection is a capitalist free market, while hive and pack animals
first invented the concept of the state), can exist independent of
state protection.

Indeed, as an example within modern history, we see that international
and global trade in capitalist free markets existed in great abundance
long before there was even a concept of a world government.

Ah, so the ability to avoid work to earn a living is seen as a natural
right. This cuts right to the heart of the socialist fallacy: that the
individual is for some reason entitled to have their needs met without
having a responsibility to work for it. This is inherently a looter
mentality, and inherently fallacious. 

Name one higher mammal in nature that does not have to work for its
living, not just in gathering food, but in seeking out water, shelter,
reproductive opportunities, as well as avoiding predatory
victimization. You can't.

Freedom isn't free, and as Andrew Johnson once said, "Freedom means
having the right to choose between working or starving." The right to
not work is no right at all, unless it falls as a subset of the right
to choose to not live as a corollary to the right to life. As such, a
left anarchist is quite free to not work in a capitalist system, they
simply are not permitted to obligate (and thus oppress and exploit)
others to prevent them from choosing to not live via starvation.

A lot of modern cases allow the complete motherboard to be opened within
seconds by pulling upon a tab. The cards can be removed and inserted
equally simple, by using polymer latches and ratcheting plugs. In fact, as
conventional buses will eventually have to give way, we might be getting
encapsulated pieces of hardware mountable on a rail, or assembled by
stacking.

The upgradeability of a current computer is largely a fiction, anyway. The 
incompatible 'standards' follow up upon each other too quickly. Components 
get obsoleted so quickly there's no point in reusing them in the next box.

The complexity is much higher. Also, the industry is used to a breathless 
type of development, focusing on breathless featurism and faux innovation. 
Users basically pick up the bill of shopping over price, list of features, 
and a few numbers.

Don't buy the latest and greatest, then. Buy from vendors which don't make
you jump through hoops. Though there's not a world of a difference,
instead of a Dell, buy an iBook. Iterate, and pick the vendors which 
deliver.

One of the user classes driving the industry are gamers. They're 
relatively young, buy the bleeding edge, and are not interested in 
standards nor in stability.

That would be a good thing. Science and R&D could use lots more talent.

As many on this list are aware, I am a big supporter of the concept of
Objective Truth, and that human philosophies can be objectively treated
as true or untrue based on their relative degrees of congruence with
the Objective Truth embedded in the structure of the universe. 

When you say I'm talking about something as omnipresent as gravity, you
are entirely correct. Capitalism, i.e. the theory of free market
dynamics, is expressed in nature in not just the process of evolution,
but in biology in general, where biological ecosystems are free market
(i.e. spontaneously organized and chaotically operated) systems for the
distribution of solar and geothermal/chemical energy and matter.

I'll note that those who believe in socialist anarchism also have a
vastly higher than normal tendency to believe in Gaia concepts, that
there has to be some meta-intelligence that encompasses the Earth's
biosphere and directing its development. This characteristic is
primarily, I think, because such individuals are constitutionally
incapable of understanding how chaotic systems can sustain themselves
in meta-stability without some overriding controller or dictator/tyrant
governing things. Such individuals, like the petty tyrants commonly
found in any commune, are inherently insecure control freaks that
cannot accept the idea of individuals living in true liberty.

This is true. There is no reason why enclaves of communalism cannot
exist within a capitalist plenum, generally to provide shelter for
those insecure types who cannot live as truly free individuals. The
fact that socialist societies cannot tolerate capitalist enclaves
within them demonstrates which should be the plenipotentiary system.

That some species in the capitalist plenum of nature find niches where
communalism can function is a demonstration of this.

The bottleneck lies typically elsewhere. I.e. you have to be incredibly 
lucky so that the vitrification (freezing should only be done if you 
can't load the tissue with cryoprotectants; and latest approaches allow 
quantitative vitrification) artifacts are the dominating damage.

Even dramatical improvents in vitrification (which won't be all that
dramatic, as physics sets you limits) are completely useless if not

Johnny can't CR. Despite it being the only working life extension there is. 
Supplementing has not demonstrated a significant life extension.
(However, supplementing done wisely doesn't hurt, and you will especially
profit from supplementing when doing calorie restriction, or living a
risky lifestyle).

Right now your chances of being suspended optimally are very slim. 
However, I'm rather optimistic that in 30, 40 years cryonics will be a 
mainstream option. By that time I expect at least partial validation.

Yet another problem easily solvable by technology: think wireless.
A camera that simply broadcasts its data to a wireless recorder--or
better yet, directly to a web server that posts the data while other
sites archive it--is immune from that problem.  You can't confiscate
what you can't find.

There are few viruses which have been written for linux. A
windows-aimed virus cannot attack linux or mac or BeOS, etc, nor can
the reverse occur.... yet.

If you do 99% of your work on one box, it will crash 100 times more
frequently than the other box, at the very least.

For four years, I did pretty heavy graphic and publishing work on an
NT4 box, while using the linux box for mail, ftp, and web serving.
Early frequent crashes on the NT box were due to a) an unstable
application suite (Corel Ventura 7), b) a publication 1800 pages long
that had been upgraded through 4 versions of Ventura and thus had lots
of corrupt code in it, and c) an underpowered machine for the size
publication I was working on. I eventually was able to clean things up
so that I could operate the NT machine for a month or more without
crashing, while doing even more work than I was able to do when I
started.

The amount of work the linux box did was rather trivial in comparison
yet still crashed a couple times a year, and was incapable of filtering
out email attached viruses targeted at MS operating systems. I know of
no linux application that can handle as large and complex a publication
as I did all the time with Ventura (unless Corel has ported Ventura to
linux by now).

I think the fundamental problem is that the computer has a far more 
complex function than a toaster or a car. It is a general purpose 
information transmission, storage and processing machine, and hence it 
needs a lot of degrees of freedom.

That is of course no excuse for making interfaces confusing or too 
complicated. If you don't need the general purpose part the computer can 
(and should?) be "dumbed down" to only run the relevant programs and act 
within a convenient behavioral space. This is not unlike many existing 
systems for office work.

Think wireless jammers. Think people first jamming you, and then ripping

because you came to rely on your augmenting warez. You're of course
familiar with Steve Mann, and his http://wearcam.org/ and 'shooting back'.
Strangely enough, he's no longer travelling after his recent harrowing
experience, after being harassed by airport security, and several 10 k$
worth of hardware having been destroyed by thug hirelings.

You can just push the video into coming distributed P2P infrastructure. It

Yes, but you can be held in jail, until you yield the key to the encrypted
evidence, a mild form of rubberhose cryptoanalysis. Sure, you can trigger
an automatical release with a watchdog/dead man's switch, but what if this
will be associated with a penalty? Contempt of court is rather rubbery.

I expect that police agencies will respond to this threat to their
ability to control crime scenes by deploying wireless networking
jammers on squad cars, which only allow authorized police units the
ability to transmit wirelessly.

This wouldn't be difficult to do using packet manipulation techniques,
where unauthorized packets get their data stripped or scrambled.

I will also note that it seems that the ubiquitous surveillance society
in Britain is now the highest crime society in the western world. The
crime rate is now 55 per 100 population, annually, in London, according
to British newspapers, and, just as ubiquity in cameras hasn't halted
crime, the nationwide ban on gun posession has resulted in skyrocketing
gun crime rates. The Gun Control Network, the Brit equivalent of the
Brady Campaign (formerly Handgun Control Inc.), the foremost proponent
of the post-Dunblane gun ban, now claims that they never said that the
ban would reduce crime (an easily provable lie).

I think the current situation in Britain thus easily disproves two of
the most insidious assertions I've opposed on this list in recent
years: that Transparent Societies and Gun Control are good things that
reduce crime. They both actually result in increased crime. I hope this
now means that we can state, as a tautological and undebatable fact,
that I, and a number of other list members, are right, and that we
should no longer have to deal with the idiotic assertions of others to
the contrary on this list.

Only if the public allows them to.  If the public understands that
any reasons they give for such technology are just bullshit justifications
for avoiding getting caught by another Rodney King tape, there's no
way they would allow it to happen.

The amount of vulnerabilities for open source *nixen is maybe one half to
one third of Redmond's offerings, by benchmark of bugtraq listings (of
course, one doesn't count the same vulnerability in different
distributions multiply, unless one is a FUD monger). Most reasons for this
is because Redmond subscribes to security by obscurity, whereas the open
source community exposes its soft white underbelly and throat completely
to straight razor wielding street rabble. There is not much open source
wormviruses around because the admins are more or less competent, and keep
the system well patched, virulence is much attenuated by high dilution
(there's value of diversity vividly illustrated). Plus, average *nix has a
clear distinction between user and admin, whereas the canonical way to get
anything done under Redmondware is a user with full admin rights.

Coding crossplatform worms is a lot of work. Way more work than your
average h4x0r d00d is willing to invest. If we had 10 independent-codebase
platforms with each 10% of market share we wouldn't be seeing any worms.  
Speaking of which, if we didn't have executable documents, and buggy
browsers and mailers from Redmond, we wouldn't be seeing any wormviruses,
either.

My Linux boxen don't crash. Apps do, now and then, especially the complex
ones. If I will let the Mozilla sit for a week or two with a few 'bad'
sites open, eventually the swap will run full due to memory leaks (thank
you so much for rich content, web monkeys), and the box will grind to a
halt. It's happening as we speak, so I will have to save the state, and
restart Mozilla sometime soon.

I use NT 4.0 SP6 at work as desktop (not willingly), Linux at home (both
desktop and server).

A publication doesn't have code, corrupt, or not. (Unless you mean TeX or
PostScript, which are all code, not data) I presume the Ventura bombed,
and took the OS down along with it.

The user should not have to adapt herself to the machine. It should be the 
other way around.

Your experience is rather atypical, to say the least.

If you're tied to a particular application (you probably have good reasons 
why you let yourself get hooked), you don't really have a choice.

### Dying neurons undergo apoptosis and lysis pretty quickly, although for
some time you see "ghosts" with the remains of undigested highly crosslinked
protein. Since the membranes are fully removed, all of the synaptic
connectivity record is erased.

On the other hand, as long as a part of the network survives, there might a
shadow of a chance left. Since the neural network has some redundancy, it is
not quite impossible that at least a part of the lost functionality could be
deduced from the remains. In many conditions the problems with memory loss
are due not so much to a loss of the engrams but rather to difficulty in
retrieval, which could be perhaps fixed from general principles.

I would say, if you have the money, vitrify even the severely demented. Do
not keep your hopes up. Most likely it will be impossible to produce
anything more than amnestic clones, but as long as there is chance, it might
be worth taking in the case of somebody you love.

Yes of course, but those are legal/cultural problems, not technical
ones.  That's why it's so important to impress upon the public
consciousness that government agents--especially the police--do /not/
have the right to privacy, and any attempt they make to hide their
actions is /per se/ abuse of power.  Juries should start routinely
refusing to accept confessions that aren't videotaped in their
entirety.  Businesses should always keep a copy of their own
surveillance tapes that they don't turn over to police, and judges
and lawmakers must make it clear that private surveillance of one's
own property is a fundamental right.

I was gratified with last week's episode of "Push, Nevada"--once I
got over my initial resistance to seeing an IRS agent as the hero--
when he used the technique of grabbing a few thousand random
addresses on the internet and e-mailing them evidence because there
was no single person or entity he could trust.

A larger state space means that brute force is less successful, so you 
need to be subtler.  So it is harder to do it well.

### I understand you oppose the idea of transparency, and the main arguments
you seem to be raising against it, is that transparency can be countered and
prevented by a massive application of deadly force, torture, control of
media, and other totalitarian techniques. This is indeed true but IMO it is
missing the point.

You realize that a regime capable of using such techniques will also use
universal surveillance to target repression and greatly enhance its
survivability. The application of rubber cryptoanalysis wouldn't even be
necessary - there would be no independent suppliers of computer hardware and
networking supporting encrypted data transmission and storage. Basically,
what you describe is not the fight for transparency - it is the death throes
of liberty crushed by a (high-tech) state monstrosity. By then it is too
late.

There is a window of opportunity for the emergence of the transparent
society, on the basis of a democratic, law-abiding but reasonably free
community, paradoxically, the type of system which seemingly has the least
urgent need to control the abuse of power. If, however, the society starts
evolving towards increased oppression (perhaps as a result of, inevitably,
good intentioned efforts at fighting the "evil"), this window may close for
a long time.

You are not likely to be able to oppose the emergence of the surveillance
state by covert means. I do think that the alternative to transparency,
cryptoanarchy, will be easily crushed a well-organized state controlling the
physical layer. Cryptography will not help you against rubber and steel.

I hope I am not setting up a strawman here. If you are not in favor of
crypto, disregard the above.

The current status quo will not exist for long. Universal (unidirectional)
surveillance is just a question of time. Once that is in place, any
combination of glitches could transform the surveillance democracy into a
surveillance autocracy. I do think that only transparency can prevent that.

So let me ask you the following question: Do you really think that the
alternative to transparency is inherently more stable, superior and more
desirable, or is your opposition to transparency merely an expression of
general pessimism?

If not transparency, then what is the alternative?

Hi!

Some of you may be interested in my latest article, "The One-Man Rule", 
published in the November-December issue of The Futurist. It is about the 
inevitable loss of privacy due to increasing weapons of mass destruction 
such as those resulting from nanotech; it's based on some ideas I posted 
here a few years ago. Although it's not exactly extropian--it's probably 
anti-extropian, to be honest--, it may be of interest to some of you, even 
if only to disagree with me.

All the best.

### I hope you will excuse me for not arguing with the "undebatable", even
tautological facts you were so kind to present. After all, a

Even if one takes the British surveillance system as an example of
"transparency" (when quite obviously it's not), it would only serve
to show that the combination of transparency and strict gun control
doesn't work, and with that I wholeheartedly agree.  What I (and I'm
sure others) advocate is a world where /all/ people are free to use
/all/ technologies available to them for defense--both surveillance
equipment and weapons.  It's about freedom, not crime.

that the
news is of value. Of course I receive my own personal gains in scouring the

well
as the readers. And....don't worry John, no massive write-in campaign

I'll be around for as long as technologically possible!

Eliezer, there are a lot of lonely and/or ambitious people out there who would find brainjack sex acceptable as a single-player game, or even as a pleasure stimulus package to induce higher productivity.  And actually your stance is somewhat similar to the Christian one which states sex should be used to both bond with and pleasure one's partner, instead of simply being a solitary tension reliever.  Of course some people might use such a technology with all the discrimination of an online DOOM player in a tournament!

Are you getting "something something" there in Atlanta?  I sense something different about you. ; )

I suppose if your parents never did warn you about the wanton wickedness residing in Atlanta it's probably far too late now...

very best wishes,

John

Scientific American has a great article in the November issue
on the topic of colliding stars ("When Stars Collide").
Unfortunately it looks like its only available online for $.
(Though the movies might be free).

Previously I had thought the lifetime of Matrioshka Brains
was limited to the lifetime of the smallest stars, i.e. small
red dwarfs (M class).  If I recall correctly thats around a trillion
years or so.  Logically, one would use star-lifting or some other
method to take the sun, which a 10 billion year lifetime G class star,
down to that size to get the greatest longevity.  Ok fine.  But
according to the SciAm article -- two identically sized main sequence
stars that collide will "merge" within an hour.  The result is
a hotter star because some of the surface hydrogen gets driven
into the resulting core so you get a hotter star with about twice
the mass and presumably a stellar atmosphere that may be richer
in metals that were formerly in the cores of the two parent stars.

So, to maximize the longevity (and memory or computational capacity)
of an MBrain here is what you do.

You find the nearest star with a slightly smaller mass than the star the
MBrain normally derives power from (presumably this involves some
consideration of the delta-v you have to apply to put the MBrain on a
collision course with said star). You aim your MBrain at the star.
Someplace far enough away from the target star, the MBrain Uber-lord
instructs all of the MBrain subunits to "Decloak the lifegiver and raise
your radiation shields".  The lifegiving star collides with the
unsuspecting (dumb) target star.  The merge occurs (generating one would
presume some really great fireworks) [at this point you had better have
your fingers crossed that the simulation got it right because some of the
other outcomes of star collisions of various types are *not* so pretty].
After you have finished listening to the 1812 Overture, the MBrain
Uber-lord gives the order to "Recloak the newborn lifegiver". Ok, now you
have a star about with twice the mass of the originals.

This isn't desirable, so you resume star-lifting again (hauling off the
more useful metals) until you get the star down to a size where metal
lifting isn't very productive or you get back to your original
computational capacity.  (Remember the innermost shells of an MBrain have
the fastest computational capacity because they have the smallest
internode distances.) So the "merge" process gained you a lot of material
for increased memory storage but may have cost you some aggregate
"thought" capacity (in real time) because you can't get as close to the
larger star.  You actually do have more material for computational nodes
if you were computationally constrained in the first place -- but these
nodes have to be added on the outside layers of the MBrain so they will
think much slower in real time (due to high internodal delays).

Deciding how much material to strip off your newborn lifegiver
gets very complex -- you don't want to plot a course to
increasingly heavy stars since their lifetimes get progressively
shorter *and* it requires wasting a lot more energy to lift
the material out of the gravity well.  Presumably there may
be some interesting "pollution" problems here if you are using
a star lifting process that requires ion or molecule expulsion.
Throw too much matter around in the inner MBrain orbits and
you will pollute their internode communication beams.
But the Dyson spin-up schemes to throw off material from
the star's equator would seem to require a *really* large
amount of material to spin up a stellar mass.

I previously thought it was going to be fairly difficult to extend the
lifespan of an MBrain but using this approach its remarkably easy.  [He
says tongue in cheek because if the collision changes the direction in
which the newly formed star is headed, the MBrain subunits may have quite
a job of catchup to do.] As smaller stars are more abundant you might take
the strategy of simply making your lifegiver increasingly smaller so you
have to exert less delta-V to aim the MBrain at its next "encounter".
You probably do an analysis of the general direction in which you are
headed and plot out of course that would most rapidly grow you to a
"maximum MBrain size".  ["Maximum" MBrain size does vary with the star
type you "choose" to be -- larger, but shorter lived stars, can support
larger MBrains -- for G class stars the maximum size is several light
years.] Alternatively, you could harvest half of the mass of the star,
target another similarly sized star and recover your misspent youth.

If star lifting turns out to be difficult or slow, then a glancing
collision still results in a merged star but it throws up a lot of
material from the stars out into space. Presumably you might manage this
in such a way that you get back a star approximately the size of the
originals but a lot of matter getting lifted out of the gravity wells and
into space in an hour.  An express star lifting so to speak.

There is another possibility of simply having the MBrain subunits
hop from one M-class star to another as each lifegiver drops below
the minimal power requirements for what it wants to think about.
In this case you wouldn't collide at all but simply aim the stars
very close to each other so hopping to the next energy source takes
a minimal amount of time.

Given hundreds of billions of possible stars to collide with and knowing
that the longest lived are the most abundant it would seem that this ups
the maximum lifetime of MBrains to at least a hundred billion trillion
(10^23) years.

Eliezer, there are many sexually hungry and lonely people out there, who despite the desire for your ideal would go ahead and wire sex into a single-player game.  I certainly do admire you for your take on the matter(if not taken to extremes).  Actually your views are somewhat akin to Christianity which generally desires a person to use sex to develop a pleasure bond with their partner.  I realize if brainjacking is developed we will see some people showing no more discrimination in using it than an online DOOM player looking for some action in a gaming tournament!

You seem different to me somehow.  Are you getting "something something" there in Atlanta?? ; )

I suppose if your parents never warned you about the wanton wickedness of the place you are now residing it is probably far to late for you...

very best wishes,

John

While rebuilding my brakes on an antique motorcycle
yesterday, I cleaned the calipers with compressed
air.  I puffed an enormous choking cloud and got a deep
whiff of the stuff before realizing I had just inhaled
asbestos dust.  Did I just kill myself?  spike

Probably no more so than
any body else out there that takes a big whiff of burning brakes while
on the freeway. Asbestos is still in a lot of brakes out there.

Only a bit; to be a significant health concern, asbestos fibers must be
inhaled at high concentrations over an extended period of time. As 
exposure increases, the risk of disease also increases. 

The latency period of asbestosis is 15-30 years, mesothelioma 30-40
years and lung cancer 20-30 years after exposure. So even if you have
been really unlucky you know what to check for and by the time things
might start going bad you are well into pre-singularity land. 

Probably the greatest health hazard for you right now is worrying about 
it.

Here is something for our gene hackers: a simple way of making transgene
animals: http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99992950

Genetically-modified animals can be created simply by washing sperm, 
swishing it in a centrifuge with an additional gene, and using the 
altered sperm for artificial insemination, say Italian researchers.

Subject: FC: The Echelonization of America: NSA to spy domestically?

The head of the National Security Agency said last week that Congress might 
want to aim the most powerful surveillance system in the world at American 
citizens.

Lt. Gen. Michael Hayden, in a rare public appearance before the Senate 
Intelligence committee, said the ongoing terrorist threat means America 
needs to debate where to draw the line between foreign and domestic 
surveillance. Currently the NSA is prohibited from spying domestically.

Here's an excerpt:

"Where do we draw the line between the government's need for 
(counter-terrorism) information about people in the United States and the 
privacy interests of people located in the United States? This line-drawing 
affects the focus of NSA's activities, foreign versus domestic... the type 
of data NSA is permitted to collect and how, and the rules under which NSA 
retains and disseminates information about U.S. persons."

Until the 1970s, when the Senate's Church Committee revealed what had been 
going on in secret, the CIA and the NSA conducted illegal surveillance on 
American citizens. In response, Congress enacted a series of reforms, 
notably the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.

"These are serious issues that the country addressed, and resolved to
its satisfaction, once before in the mid-1970's," Hayden said. "In light of 
the events of September 11th, it is appropriate that we, as a country, 
readdress them. We need to get it right."

I think there is nothing wrong with that picture and I see nothing wrong
with the unnamed "special relation." In my mind your present-person
clearly has a special relation to your past-person. However the question
here is whether that relation is one of "identity of personality." I
believe it is not. 

As I see it, your present-person should feel responsible for keeping
your past-person's promises for reasons analogous to those for which a
son should feel responsible for keeping a deceased father's promises. 

The degree of obligation of a son to keep his deceased father's promise
is of course usually quite less than that of a present-person to keep
his past-person's promise. However I think the obligations are
qualitatively similar even if quantitatively different.

The son must make his own moral assessment of his deceased father's
promise and decide for himself if it is one worth keeping. If his late
father promised to do something morally repugnant to the son (e.g.,
commit murder) then the son will feel inclined to break the father's
promise. If on the other hand the father promised something morally
acceptable to the son (e.g., to pay back a loan for bus-money) then the
son will feel inclined to keep the father's promise. 

The key point here is that the son's decision to keep or break the
promise will depend on the son's moral assessment of his father's past
promise -- *not* on some false belief that "father equals son." 

Your present identity as conceived in Lee's thought experiment is
analogous to you the son. Your past identity frozen in the ice is
analogous to your deceased father. It's perfectly understandable that
you the son might feel some identification with your father, and some
obligation to keep your father's promises, but it's a mistake I believe
to think you are identical to the father.  

Because personality is always evolving, your frozen duplicate is not
you.

I doubt it.  Most cases of mesothelioma (the cancer that
asbestos generally causes) involve long term chronic
exposure.  Plus Eli Lilly is coming out with a drug
specifically designed to treat mesothelioma in the next
year or two.

Of course inhalation of any type of dust isn't a good
thing.  It might be wise to buy a *good* dust mask
(not one of the flimsy paper ones) to use anytime
you start blowing dust around.

The first step would necessarily be to come to a good definition of what 
is meant by the term.  It seems to be used with a large range of blurry 
definitions.  After it is well defined, then it would be possible to 
test theories as being either consistent or inconsistent with that 
definition, though, of course, this would also require that these 
theories be well defined.  This would allow the construction of a 
logically consistent framework.  Then one would examine the world to 
determine where that framework fit exactly.  (N.B.:  commonly scaling 
transforms are needed during this step, as the theory is rarely as exact 
a fit as a curory examination would suppose.)  At this point one would 
examine the interfaces between where the theory applied exactly, and 
where it didn't.  Attempts could be made to either adapt the model to 
extend over that domain (in evolution theory the first attempt at one 
such area was population scale evolution, but this was later replaced by 
a kin-selection model), or to find a mixed theory.  This is quite common 
in evolutionarily stable strategies.  It is rare that a single strategy 
works well, so usually an animal adopts a mixture of approaches and 
selects between them at "random" (observing from the outside it appears 
to be genuinely random, but if we observe ourselves in similar 
situations it doesn't feel as if we are choosing randomly).   Thus, an 
aggressive act may be met by flight, submission, or fight.  If the 
attacker can predict which will happen in advance, then that is 
something of an advantage.  But if the target adopts a mixed strategy 
the result is unpredictable.  Sometimes the result is suicidal attacks, 
which while (usually) fatal to the target may well damage the attacker 
more than the payoff for a successful attack.  If a population displays 
such a mixed strategy, then aggressive acts will be less common.  By 
mathematically evaluating the costs and benefits to each party of each 
strategy, and each combination, we can come to a predicton of what 
observed behavior will be.  Then we can look at real populations to 
check our answers.  If they don't match, then we try to figure out what 
is wrong with our model.

I'm, as I said, nowhere near to being an expert in this area.  But to 
advance knowledge we need well defined terms, so that we can check our 
models against reality.  If you can't, then you are arguing theology. 
 If you can, then you models will tell you not "You must behave this 
way", but rather "If the behave this way as compared against behaving 
that way, the costs and benefits will be x and y".  And this will be a 
(potentially) testable projection.

P.S.:  Capitalism and Socialism are the same kind of entity.  They have 
both been moral-economic models that have not been sufficiently well 
specified to be tested.  Anyone has always been free to claim "That 
wasn't *real* x" or "Those weren't really xians", but with a well 
specified definition (which implies that it is based upon observable 
phenomena), then one can tell.
P.P.S.:  Models that cannot be tested are basically religious.  You 
could say idealistic, but if you trace it back it means about the same 
thing, it means that you can always make it mean what you want to. 
 There's nothing wrong with this as a first formulation, as this is a 
required step in the human thought process.  But if you leave it there 
it's either because it isn't important enough to find out what it really 
means (it can be [usually is] a lot of work), or you are more interested 
in making it mean what you want it to mean.  Very natural, I do it too. 
 But not very convincing.
P.P.S.:  A lot of this discussion is influenced by my recent reading of 
Robert Anton Wilson's "Natural Law, or don't put a rubber on your 
willy".  The title refers to an argument that he had with, among others, 
some opinons of the Pope.

We shouldn't, however, forget that the kin-selection principles do work. 
 That eusocial animals have evolved.  Etc.  The original Gaia

and temperature was a lot more reasonable than some of the things that 
people derived from a shallow reading of it.

You are drawing a false, or perhaps unclear, connection.  A free society 
can allow enclaves to exist.  A capitalist society, as normally 
understood, is no more a free society than is a socialist society.  A 
pure capitalist society vests all rights in the holders of capital, as a 
pure socialist society vests all rights in the society itself.  If you 
are one of the elite, than a capitalist society may seem free... until 
those kept on the bottom object.

This is why I tend to favor minarchy rather than anarchy. 
 Concentrations of power are dangerous, and antithetical to freedom. 
 I'm more interested in maintaining (encouraging) freedom than I am in 
forwarding any particular economic theory, whether it is "natural" or not.

>fact that socialist societies cannot tolerate capitalist enclaves
>within them demonstrates which should be the plenipotentiary system.
>
I believe that in the past there have been as many socialist states that 
encouraged enclaves of capitalism as there have been capitalist states 
that have encouraged enclaves of socialism.  Specific numbers are hard 
to come by here, as both terms have quite fuzzy definitions.  However, 
almost all tribes are essentially socialist internally, but operate as 
capitalist with the exterior world (as best they understand their 
options).  And indications are that inter-continental trade routes 
existed as far back as the neo-lithic, perhaps even into the 
paleo-lithic.  (Trading, e.g., amber, gold, flint, and likely spices, 
though I don't believe that any have been found [but *would* they be 
found?].)  So it's probably safe to assume that socialist and capitalist 
precursors existed within human society from almost the first.  They 
just weren't separated out as ideologies.  It's not clear to me that 
separating them out has yielded any substantial advantages to make up 
for it's immense disadvantages, but we seem to have done it anyway.

And I still don't have a clear idea of what you mean by capitalist or 
socialist.  At some points you appear to be equating capitalism with 
libertarianism.  Certainly libertarianism must permit capitalism to 
exist, but it would seem equally necessary for it to permit socialism to 
exist.  And if it is to continue to maintain liberties, it's hard to see 
how it could allow either to become dominant.  Now Hobbs did have a 
concept of "Anarchism is the war of all against all" that might be what 
you are espousing, but in that case I find it difficult to understand 
how you could speak favorably of it.

Reflecting back to my signature.  The original free software license was 
the BSD license.  But that allowed latecomers to grab source code that 
someone had worked on, hide it, make a few changes and then publish it 
as their own.  Further the original creator might find that he needed to 
repurchase the code that he had created.  Understandably, there ceased 
to be many people willing to release their source code under the BSD 
license.
Shortly after the BSD license was created, the GPL was created.  This 
put some limits on things.  This said (paraphrasing) "You can use my 
source code, but if you do, and you redistribute the program (as, e.g., 
an executable), then you must allow the purchaser the get the source 
code for free.  Further, you can't make him do any more than I'm making 
you do."   There's a bit more , but that's the heart of it.  People have 
been willing to work and contribute under this license.  They don't tend 
to feel like their work is being stolen.  So they are willing to share.

Some people insist on their software being commercial.  Some people work 
with the GPL.  Some people still work with the BSD license.  And there 
are several minor modified versions to handle special situations.  This 
is freedom.  You get to choose what you want.  And you don't get 
developing monopolies (except within the commercial area).  And of all 
these, the only segment that is a danger to the liberties of others is 
the commercial group.  So I'm not exactly enamored of capitalism as a 
protector of liberties.  It's capitalists that are corrupting the 
legislators.  I don't really care how they got their immense power, I 
care how they are using it.  And they are clear proof that large 
concentrations of power are dangerous to liberties, even of those who 
don't want to go near them.

Is this what you mean by capitalism?

There seems to be a discussion going here regarding the possibilities for 
harvesting energy from stars. Well, someone mentioned more potent energy 
sources. There would seem to be a very potent source of energy that I don't 
think anyone has yet mentioned (while I've been on the list anyway). That 
would be rotating black holes. Most black holes, according to current 
theory, ought to be rotating at a fast pace. Theoretically it should be 
possible to build a structure around the black hole and tap into this 
rotational energy, involving the ergosphere of the hole, which is a general 
relativistic effect created by the rotation of the hole. Too deep into the 
hole, the ergosphere causes it to become impossible to not spin in the 
direction of the hole, that is, eventually the velocity necessary to hold 
stationary with respect to rotation exceeds c. I'm not exactly sure how it 
works, but by building a structure, possibly a ring or torus, around the 
black hole, it ought to be possible to extract extraordinary amounts of 
energy, much more than one can extract through nuclear reactions. In fact, 
there is a even a theory to explain gamma ray bursters which has been 
proposed which makes use of this feature. Apparently this also has something 
to do with electromagnetic fields, they mention it in the links.

http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n0202/22grbtheory/
http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/topstory/20011015blackhole.html

Have you noticed that nobody EVER portrays what a black hole would really 
look like cast against the stellar background? In fact you ought to be able 
to see your ship, too, assuming it is large enough..

Charles,
       In attempting to define how you would go about constructing a 
mathematical theory of capitalism you sort of illustrated one of the problems 
we have had with socialism.
       Most folks don't recognise that we have approaximately a 200 year 
history of socialism.  There is a book called Heaven on Earth that is a book 
place to start on that theory.
       Yet, the facts are fairly simple.  Over the last 200 years socialism 
has had ample time to theorise on every aspect of their system.  They have 
installed that system several hundred times in socialist communities and 
several dozen times in socialist nations.  What have been the results?
       Sometimes the communities or nations have remained in the hand of well 
meaning theorists (I suppose they were) and have ended in failure having 
fleeced the people that were true believers and invested their capital, 
thought, or labor into the system.  Sometimes these failures were long drawn 
out but failures in the end.
       Sometimes the communities or nations have been controlled by thugs.  I 
don't have to explain those to you the examples are numerous -- Stalin, Mao, 
Hitler, Tito, Mussolini, Pol Pot, etc.
       In the case of China they seem to have suffered a dictator but also in 
the end had the dictators release the economic sphere in order to hold onto 
their power.  However the persecution of the populace continues.
       It is a long sorry 200 year record of total failure.  It has gotten to 
a point that if you point to an example of a socialist nation that is not a 
failure then we are justified in replying "wait."  I listen to conditions 
within various nations that tend toward socialism and have never seen one I 
would wish to live in.
       On the other hand, what ever short comings we have had in the 
development of capitalist theory you can't fault our results.  You can try 
but with our shortcomings we still out perform the socialist.
       There is one other dirty little secret about the sorry record of 
socialism.  It isn't as well founded in theory as the proponents would have 
us believe.  Go to von Hayek's Road to Serfdom, he devastates their theory.
       How can this be?  Most folks don't spend a lot of time checking out 
socialist theory so if the the socialist say things that sound good it 
passes.  Von Hayek takes those theories and analyses them.  The theories come 
up short -- very short.

The Linear survey has discovered a new small (100m) asteroid 2002 AA29
that is coorbital with the Earth.

See BBC report: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2347663.stm
(some of it seems a little confused)

Slashdot Discussion:
http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/10/22/0017249&mode=thread&tid=160

A discussion of the orbits of asteroids like this:
Near-Earth asteroid 3753 Cruithne -- Earth's curious companion
http://www.astro.queensu.ca/~wiegert/3753/3753.html

Some theoretical background:
http://www.paias.com/paias/home/Science/Newton/Newt8Fig5Orbits.htm

NASA's page to display the orbit:
http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/db?name=2002AA29&group=all&search=Search
[requires JAVA, doesn't work in Netscape]

This will be interesting because as more NEO surveys are launched
or as larger telescopes are built we will see increasingly smaller
objects.

Spike, would you care to comment on the energy required to put a
5-10 m diameter asteroid into orbit around the Earth (or moon
if you don't want it *too* close)?

Ouch!  I've been working on that for years, and don't have a good clue. 
 I know internally what it feels like (i.e., it feels non-coerced, it 
feels like choices are possible, but not forced).  I don't have many 
examples of what it looks like, because it's a bit difficult to go up to 
someone and say "Excuse me.  Two minutes ago, when you did X, were you 
acting at free choice amoung several possibilities, or did you feel that 
only one choice was plausible?"

Still, as a first shot, and clearly understanding that it needs 
refinement:  
1) A person is free when that person is making a choice among several 
perceived plausible choices, and also feels that not choosing would be a 
valid choice.
2) There are degrees of freedom.  It's not an either / or state.  And 
there are no infinities and no zeros.
3) If only one of the choices perceived as available is also perceived 
as desireable, the amount of freedom present is minor.
4) If none of the choices presented as available are also perceived as 
desireable, the person has less freedom than under condition 3.
5) If no difference in the desirability of the choices available is 
discernable, but the choices are perceived as essentially different, 
then the freedom approaches the maximum possible, and increases in 
direct proportion to the number of perceived choices.
N.B.:  While state 5 is maximally free, this does not equate with 
maximally desireable.  If you don't feel that your choice makes a 
difference, or that there is no difference in the desireability between 
the choices, you may be quite free, but you won't feel enpowered.

Unfortunately, all of these criteria appear to me to be based on 
unobservables.  Possibly one could, in principle, detect the differences 
using PET or MRI, but with currently envisionable technologies, this 
would always be in a state of restraint, and therefore the object of 
investigation would be missing.

There is far more than 200 years in the history of socialism.  Religious 
communities were essentially socialist in nature quite far back in time. 
 Likewise, the essential tribal structure is, internally, basically 
socialist.

There may well have been, as you assert, sufficient time, but neither 
capitalists nor socialists have created a coherrent theory of the 
systems that they are proposing.  Basically because they don't have a 
good well-defined definition based on physical observables.

Some were quite successful for generations, until they were swallowed up 
by encroaching neighbors.  Some may still exist.  I haven't gone 
investigating.  I'm not that interested, and anyway I've never seen a 
complete census of socialist groups.  But it is true that the successful 
ones don't tend to grow very large.  Oneida was about the largest 
successful group that I can think of, until the intolerance of their 
neighbors hampered them.

Do you really feel that those examples (except, possibly, Tito and 
Mussolini), fit even the loose definition of socialist that exists? 
 They were selfish powerful tyrants, and no different from the estemable 
one's that we supported, e.g., Papa Doc, or who what that lunatic in 
Vietnam.

China is merely continuing the imperial tradition under a new name. 
 Nothing to see here.  They are just trying to modernise their system 
without the emperor giving up any power.

If you want to look at our good points, you should also look at our bad 
points.  We have slaughered native peoples, fought bloody wars, 
persecuted our citizens, maintained slaves until europe nearly gave up 
on thinking of us as civilized.  And we have a larger fraction of our 
citizens held as slave-laborers than any other country today.  We call 
them criminals, and that lets us sleep easily.  But why are there so 
many of them?

And the dirty secret of capitalism is that the people in charge make 
slaves of those on the bottom.  Sorry, I'm not a capitalist *OR* a 
socialist.  I'm a libertarian.  If I thought it had a reasonable chance 
of working I'd be an anarchist, but anarchy is unstable.  (Well, so is 
everything, or at best only quasi-stable, but I'd perfer something a 
*little* more stable than anarchy.)

The, matter, that the socialists present is as meaninglessly emotional 
as that presented by the justifiers of capitalism.

If you want to start meaningful development of your arguments, you must 
first use well-defined terms.  And that means that they are based on 
observables.  On what basis, e.g., do you assert that the Nazi's were 
socialists and not capitalists?  Do you take *their* word for it?  Do 
you take their word for anything else?  (If they told me the sky was 
blue, I'd want to check it myself.)

Think about it like this: you've done the rough equivalent
of smoking a carton or two of cigarrettes in one whiff.
You're risk of mortality from that is about 10,000 less
than your risk from the fact that you /own a motorcycle/.

Well it turns out scientists at Los Alaomos are have done an
experiment to work out the critical mass for Neptunium (the
element between Uranium and Plutonium).

Neptunium Goes Critical During Experiment At Los Alamos
http://www.spacedaily.com/news/energy-tech-02s.html

[Watch out for the pop-ups -- they may not work with Netscape]

So I guess part of the answer to my question is that you need
less critical mass if the element is more radioactive.

Half-lives:
U-238: 4.5x10^9 yrs
U-235: 7.0x10^8 yrs
Np-237: 2.1x10^6 yrs
Pu-239: 2.4x10^4 yrs
Am-242: 141 yrs (proposed for nuclear fission rocket engine)
Pu-238: 87.7 yrs (used in RTGs)

So my guess would be that the amount of Np-237 required for
a nuclear weapon would be several kg more than that required
for a Pu-239 based weapon but less than that for a U-235 based
weapon.

"If it is a socialist state it exists, like National Socialist Germany
or Communist Russia to allow a few thugs to lord it over and terrorize the 
rest of the citizenry.  In addition the state serves to allow a few mooches 
to get something for nothing."

Well, I don't think that, assuming a few things, it is really possible to 
talk about a socialist state at all, I don't think that is a concept which 
is self consistent. Because a state, at least in the normal sense of the 
word, implies authoritarian organization, people coercing other people to 
get what they want done (isn't that what the usual meaning is?). Socialism, 
however, is supposedly a classless system of organization, which is in 
contradiction with the idea of a state. Now, is it possible to have a 
capitalist state? Well, I don't know-- capitalists tend to simply define the 
word capitalist as being anti-state, but I don't think that is consistent 
with what capitalism actually means-- I think that the existance of 
capitalism is really synonymous with a state, or a number of small states, 
even if they are at the level of individuals (a system which indicates utter 
and complete destruction, by the way). So, these definitions are things 
which have to be ironed out. Like, you can talk about a word which means 
"Christian athiest", but that may not make sense, you have to find out what 
it really means, how it is used, to understand it. (1)

-----------------------------------------------------------------

"But similiary, Anarchism necessities that you can not
choose to engage in capitalism"

Well, what do you mean by engage in capitalism? If you mean the 
monopolization of resources, that doesn't just affect you, if affects the 
people who need the resources that you are monopolizing by force. Like, if 
in a communal society I decide that a particular plot of land is off limits 
to anyone who does not obey a command of mine, as I could do if that land 
were private property, that doesn't just affect me. (2)

"How about, instead, a system where you can choose to work OR not work?"

Well, I'm not sure what you mean by work-- do you mean work for money, or 
work in the more general sense, like work on a physics project? If you mean 
the former, then I don't see how that is possible (see above). If you mean 
the latter, then I agree. (3)

"There is no such thing as a life without a collar and a leash, as nature 
imposes her own collars and leashes upon us."

That is true, but, as Bakunin said once, I don't see how it makes sense to 
talk about the inherent bonds of nature as some sort of restriction--these 
are rather the essential parts of existance itself. (4)

"If anarchism requires that to be free you must be free of the need to 
'work' but one must 'work' to stay alive, how is an anarchist society even 
logically possible?"

Well, I don't think that anyone supposes that food is going to pop up from 
nowhere-- I think what anarchists are saying about not having to work means 
not having to work in the capitalist sense. I mean, if there is abundant 
food right there in front of you, but you can't have it because someone is 
going to throw you in jail if you take it, and you have to obey some command 
of the owner in order to have it... that's what they mean. If there is no 
food at all, or all the food that exists is needed, that's different. (5)

"What if everyone chooses not to work?"

Then I guess everyone dies, but it is up to them. I mean, if there is no 
food at all, just hypothetically, and you want to get some, so you go out 
and make just enough for yourself, then I don't think anybody has any 
legitimate right to take it away from you. (6)

----------------------------------------------------------------

"Any employer that abuses his workers will soon find the good ones have
left him and been welcomed with open arms elsewhere."

Well, first of all, changing jobs isn't easy-- there is a lot of work you 
have to go through in order to do that, generally, especially if you don't 
have certain credentials. However, what if all the jobs you can find are 
worse, at the same level, or only marginally better than the job you have? 
(7)

I mean, generally, the capitalist system inherently promotes exploitation of 
the weak. That's because the strong, or those whose control of resources is 
backed up by force, have very little to lose if someone decides to leave 
them-- that is why unions are needed, and even then on a personal level, a 
bankruptcy will generally not affect an employer very much, he'll still have 
a well to do living standard. On the other hand, the person working for him 
may be reduced to absolutely horrible conditions or even killed by 
starvation, in the extreme case, if they do not find work. (8)

-----------------------------------------------------------------

"Quite. I wonder how is it that socialist "anarchists" can claim that
true anarchism is socialist when the single common characteristic of
every commune that ever existed is a tendency to become tyrannized by
control freaks."

But then it would no longer be a commune-- I mean, that's inherent to the 
definition of commune, no single person or group has control. See (1). (9)

"I would posit that it is because non-free market based systems of
economic distribution are so unwieldy that they require tyrannical
control mechanisms to strongly dictate rules of distribution to avoid
communal dissolution and strife"

I don't really see why this is. In fact, I think it is precisely because of 
the inherent force and inequalities used to maintain a "free market system" 
that most if not all tyrannical controls exist in our society all. Of 
course, the US is not a "free market system" in any sense of the phrase. 
(10)

"The mere fact that the socialist 'anarchists' had to write a propaganda
piece calling itself "THE anarchist FAQ"

Here, go to www.infoshop.org/faq/intro.html and read the three paragraphs 
which start with this sentence...

"We are sure that many anarchists will not agree 100% with what we have 
written in the FAQ..."

That pretty much states the essence of any reply I could make to this.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

"Since capitalism is based on a chaotic free market"

Assuming I'm interpreting what you're saying correctly about chaos... no 
system which may be said to be successful is based on a such a thing... the 
very definition of chaos implies disorganization, and disorganization 
implies destruction (the levels of each being roughly correlated). 
Organization does not, I think, require force in any normal sense of the 
word, only people who are committed to working together. And of course it is 
possible to cooperate voluntarily, for how else could, say, this 
organization exist? (12)

"Ah, so the ability to avoid work to earn a living is seen as a natural
right."

See (5) and (6).

"The fact that socialist societies cannot tolerate capitalist enclaves
within them demonstrates which should be the plenipotentiary system."

See (1), (2) and (3).

 I'm not aware of any carefull attempts to quantify this. My estimate
is based on casual observations of the degree to which people agree on
who should be classsified as white or black, and that they appear to
base these classifications on features such as skin color which seem
to be strongly correlated with genes.
 If the correlation was not above 0.8, I would consider it somewhat unlikely
that a mere 12.9 percent of Americans would label themselves as black.

 "Should not be trusted" sounds very different from "nonsense".
 I agree that The Bell Curve's conclusions should not be trusted because
there has been inadequate analysis of some alternative hypotheses.
 I don't understand why noise in the data would cause significant doubts
about their conclusions. Could random noise in the racial classifications
cause a persistent pattern of nonzero correlations between race and IQ?
That seems wildly improbable to me. Could the noise involve a large number
of high IQ people classifying themselves as white when they would have
classified themselves as black if they had lower IQ? If the correlation
between genes and racial classification is 0.8, then maybe that is
enough to explain the correlation between race and IQ. But if that 0.8
estimate is way too low, then it seems rather farfetched.

Charles,
       No, no, no.  If you look at General Semantics the definition of 
Capitalism is a higher level of abstraction than to observe a real living 
example of capitalism in action.  If you talk me into going to a higher level 
of abstraction then I am also further from the thing itself and hence less 
accurate.
       For instance a friend that is active in General Semantics just 
informed me that she found one word in the dictionary that had 26 meanings 
attached to it.  Now pretend it took 200 words to define capitalism and that 
in this instance each word of the definition only had 4 seperate meanings.  
Then in that instance my definition could possibly have 800 different 
meanings and we would never get anything settled.
       And, that is how I view socialism.  Scholars, they say they are, have 
written volumes defining socialism, telling us how it will work and 
explaining how "Heaven on Earth" will have arrived.  Then along comes a 
socialist state, a thug takes over, sends the scholars off to the Gulag and 
suddenly the rest of us had hell on Earth.
       As to all those thugs that people object to having called socialist -- 
they said very clearly that they were and it was under the auspices of 
socialism that they came to power.
       Now, I can almost anticipate that you will pull out some counter 
examples of so called capitalists that were really nothing but common 
criminals.  Well, we have sent a lot of them to the penitentiary and look 
forward to sending more of them to the same place.
       As you may know I am a part blood Cherokee.  My understanding is that 
you killed close to 50 million of us counting all indians between the north 
and south poles.  The vast majority died of your diseases and often were many 
miles removed from the nearest white man.  The whites never knew of it and 
for the most part are ignorant of the fact today but the same would have 
happened had you been peaceful traders and missionaries.

<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance a friend that is active in General Semantics just informed me that she found one word in the dictionary that had 26 meanings attached to it. &nbsp;Now pretend it took 200 words to define capitalism and that in this instance each word of the definition only had 4 seperate meanings. &nbsp;Then in that instance my definition could possibly have 800 different meanings and we would never get anything settled.
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, that is how I view socialism. &nbsp;Scholars, they say they are, have written volumes defining socialism, telling us how it will work and explaining how "Heaven on Earth" will have arrived. &nbsp;Then along comes a socialist state, a thug takes over, sends the scholars off to the Gulag and suddenly the rest of us had hell on Earth.
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to all those thugs that people object to having called socialist -- they said very clearly that they were and it was under the auspices of socialism that they came to power.
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I can almost anticipate that you will pull out some counter examples of so called capitalists that were really nothing but common criminals. &nbsp;Well, we have sent a lot of them to the penitentiary and look forward to sending more of them to the same place.
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you may know I am a part blood Cherokee. &nbsp;My understanding is that you killed close to 50 million of us counting all indians between the north and south poles. &nbsp;The vast majority died of your diseases and often were many miles removed from the nearest white man. &nbsp;The whites never knew of it and for the most part are ignorant of the fact today but the same would have happened had you been peaceful traders and missionaries.

Asbestos brakepads?  Crikey, that *is* an antique.

Don't know much about asbestos, but I'd recommend seeing a doctor or doing 
some Googling to be certain.  My take is that you're unlikely to have done 
much harm.  Asbestos is at its worst with prolonged and repeated exposure ISTR.

And for non-entities sake get some Kevlar pads!

Now that alone is one of the more idiotic things said in this
diatribe (not that there's any shortage).  Chaos, disorganization,
and lack of control are not the hallmarks of destruction--they're
the hallmarks of LIFE.  The Earth isn't "controlled" by anything--
it's just a chaotic system that evolved to produce a marvellous
tangled web of life, including intelligent beings capable of
marvelling at it.

This, like so much of leftist rhetoric, shows how much of their
philosophy is one of pessimism, fear, depression, and hopelessness.
Of course there must be control, or human greed and avarice will
starve us all; of course there must be forced sharing, or there
won't be enough to go around; of course we must control dangerous
technologies like weapons and nuclear power and biotech, or else
they will wipe us all out; of course we must plan things to be
stable and sustainable--change is bad.

Let's hear it for chaos!

It might be.  In that case so is a preying mantis trading possible            
suicide for sex.  I don't have a definition of capitalism that is             
precise enough for me to tell.                                                


Similarly, it has been found that one group of apes has used the same two
rocks for generations to pound nuts open (i.e. means of production) and that
a) individuals do not open nuts for others for free, and b) the group treats
this means of production as it's private property, and not that of their
species in general. They object very strongly when other apes trespass and go
near their pounding rocks. Sounds like a natural form of private property.

>>"But similiary, Anarchism necessities that you can not choose to engage in
capitalism"<<

"Well, what do you mean by engage in capitalism?"

I mean am I able to choose to 'work' for someone else, am I able to
voluntarily place myself under the command of another person?  It seems
'socialist anarchy' forbids such an arrangement.  Am I able to trade my
usefullness in some area for someone else's usefullness in another area?  If
that other person does not happen to need or want what I am able to create,
might I be able to trade my usefull output for something that is
representative, in some amount, of the usefull output of any productive
individual, and thus trade that common item?  See below for more.

"If you mean the monopolization of resources, that doesn't just affect you,
if affects the people who need the resources that you are monopolizing by
force."

Can you explain in to me what the daily life inside a socialist anarchy
would be like?  Would we all be poor peasant farmers just doing enough work
to feed and cloth ourselves?  Or can I hope that products that free up my
time from things I have to do to live and enable to use them on things I
WANT to do while alive will become more available at less cost continually?
When no man has the right to 'own' anything, how do I get a piano, or a
computer?  Is it fair, in a socialist anarchy, that one person has a piano
while another does not?  Arent I 'monopolizing the resources' of pianos
then?  So if someone feels they 'need' a piano as well, they are justified
in claiming a right to mine?

"Like, if in a communal society I decide that a particular plot of land is
off limits to anyone who does not obey a command of mine, as I could do if
that land were private property, that doesn't just affect me. (2)"

So if nobody 'owns' anything, where do I live?  Where do I build my house?
where do I drive my car?  where do I grow my crops?  Only where everyone
else agrees I can place it?  Does everyone have to agree to it?  everyone in
my 'commune' or just the majority?  

>>"How about, instead, a system where you can choose to work OR not work?"<<

"Well, I'm not sure what you mean by work-- do you mean work for money, or
work in the more general sense, like work on a physics project? If you mean
the former, then I don't see how that is possible (see above). If you mean
the latter, then I agree. (3)"

If social anarchy requires (as the authors of that FAQ suggest) that to be
free one must be free from the requirement to do work, but merely being
alive requires that we do work, how is anyone truly free?  It is undeniable
that to remain alive, one must do work.  There are three kinds of work
I)work for things you need (to stay alive, minimal requirements) II)things
you do not need III) because someone else forces you to work.  

How will social anarchists provide for work type I, things you need.  Will
everyone be expected to produce whatever his basic needs are?  What if I am
a capable able bodied worker, but my neighor has no legs.  How will my
neighbor produce what his basic needs are (to stay alive).  Because of this,
it is impossible to expect each individual to be first and foremost
responsible for only producing his sustinative needs.  My neighbor may have
no legs, but he may be able to figure out and design cheap abundant solar
cells.  Is his contributation of cheap abundant solar cells equal to my
contribution of producing only my own sustinence?  Or can he trade his
contribution of cheap abundant solar cells for help from me to produce his
basic sustinence?  Or can he claim that I am 'monopolizing resources' of
sustinence and I claim that he is 'monopolizing resources' of solar cells,
thus we are justified in 'robbing' each other of our productive output.  And
this is 'freedom'?  

How do social anarchists account for work type II?  What if I want to
produce extra of whatever I am capable of producing so I can acquire other
things because I want them?  Well, if I produce extra, I am no
'monopolizing' the results of my production, which means, as far as I can
tell according to socialist anarchy, they my neighbors are now justified in
robbing me (otherwise, they would be forced to 'work' for me, which is not
freedom)  Thus, everyone in an anarchal socialist society would have a) the
incentive to produce only what is absolutely necessary for survivial, as
anything else will result in the society robbing them and b) never want to
acquire anything more than the basic necessities for survival.  This is why
Anarachal Socialism, as far as I can tell, is not compatable with allowing
someone to 'choose to engage in capitalism' because whatever they will
acquire, no one else will have, and thus everyone else may justly rob them.
And this is 'freedom'?

Social anarchists will deal quite well with Work type III, being forced to
work for someone else, because that someone else will be nature.  Since
being 'forced to work' and 'needing to work to survive' are not a whole lot
different, and given the incentives to produce nothing beyond what is
absolutely necessary to survive, social anarchists will only be working for
nature to eek out an existence.  Anyone who tries to build a better life for
themselves will be robbed.  And this is 'freedom?'

It seems Ironic that some of the very things that social anarchists despise
(capitalism, markets) are the *only* things capable of creating a world
where men will truly not be required to *work* at all to stay alive, a world
full of intelligent machines, nanobots, and complex autonomous and
non-autonomous systems which are controlled by our mere whim give us
indefinate lives of enjoyment.  How is it possible a peasant commune could
ever bring about such a reality?

>>"There is no such thing as a life without a collar and a leash, as nature
imposes her own collars and leashes upon us."<<

"That is true, but, as Bakunin said once, I don't see how it makes sense to
talk about the inherent bonds of nature as some sort of restriction--these
are rather the essential parts of existance itself. (4)"

The point is, social anarchists were claiming that the objection 'you can
just quit your job' against being a 'slave to capitalism' was invalid
because you would be forced to 'walk the streets' (meaning what?) It seems
to imply that everyone has the right to the basic necessities of life
without having to work to get them.  

Or as Mike Lorrey so eloquently summed up

"Ah, so the ability to avoid work to earn a living is seen as a natural
right. This cuts right to the heart of the socialist fallacy: that the
individual is for some reason entitled to have their needs met without
having a responsibility to work for it. This is inherently a looter
mentality, and inherently fallacious. "

What are the 'essential parts of existence' exactly?  And who decides this?
And who enforces this?

You would be hard pressed to find someone starving to death in the United
states, or any post industrialized nation for that matter, as the excess
production of those who have embraced production as a way of life is more
than enough to feed those who do not want to produce.  Would you say a
social anarchist who feels they have a right to not work to stay alive has
more rights than the right to have a sustinance life if he chooses to not
partake in life?  Do they have a right to a home?  500 square feet or 2500
square feet?  Indoor plumbing? Indoor heating?  Indoor air conditioning?  

If, whatever the socialist anarchist believes they have a right to is not
provided to them, then they are not free.  Because if they have to work for
something they have a right to, they are subordinates to a master somewhere,
and not free.  Being forced to work for nature is still being forced to
work.  

>>"If anarchism requires that to be free you must be free of the need to
'work' but one must 'work' to stay alive, how is an anarchist society even
logically possible?"<<

"Well, I don't think that anyone supposes that food is going to pop up from 
nowhere-- I think what anarchists are saying about not having to work means 
not having to work in the capitalist sense."

Define the difference between 'work in the capitlist sense' and 'work to
stay alive'  I have presented what I feel to be the three reasonable
iterations of 'work'.  That was I-Work because you need to, II-Work because
you want to and III-Work because you are forced to [not a whole lot
different than I really]  Where does 'work in a capitalist sense' fall in
these catagories?

"I mean, if there is abundant food right there in front of you, but you
can't have it because someone is 
going to throw you in jail if you take it, and you have to obey some command

of the owner in order to have it... that's what they mean."


>>"What if everyone chooses not to work?"<<

"Then I guess everyone dies, but it is up to them. I mean, if there is no
food at all, just hypothetically, and you want to get some, so you go out
and make just enough for yourself, then I don't think anybody has any
legitimate right to take it away from you. (6)"

So you serve to emphasize the point, if you produce *anything* more than
what is your absolute basic need, then others are justified in taking it
from you.  And this is 'freedom'?  It is freedom only for the looters and
moochers, and enslaves the productive man.  This is also why one can not
freely choose to engage in capitalism in an anarchist socialist paradise,
because anything they produce will be looted.

Spike,
You should keep in mind that it is only one form of asbestos crystal that
is harmful. There are round crystals and needle-like crystals, and only the
second is harmful, since it is the needle construction that causes lung
damage. Asbestos brake dust is generally formed as round crystals, so you
shouldn't worry too much.

Actually, I explicitly want to bracket that question.  It's my argument
that we can solve the moral problems and questions posed by personal
backups/dupes/xoxes etc *without* settling the question as to whether your
dupe is "really you".  [In fact, I think something stronger: we *must* do
this, because there can be no answer to the identity question, as it is
malformed.]

Ultimately, if we *can* settle the moral question, it will become clear
that the question of "identity" is mere semantics, like the Ship of
Theseus problem, "angels on a pin" and other well-known metaphysical
problems.  If we know what to do, then it doesn't matter what we call it.

This is a perfect example from my point of view, because we often think
that it's morally correct for family members to lay down their lives to
protect each other, despite their relatively limited causal origins.
Arguments from familial relations and common origins underpin a lot of
arguments for laying down your life for your tribe, your race, for members
of the human race, or for other living creatures.

If you think that it's specially more plausible for fathers to lay down
their lives for their own sons, relative to any random person laying down
his/her life for another, well, all the more so for personal duplicates.

That special relationship that connects you with your past-person in the
context of promises holds as well for present personal duplicates;
whatever it is that's motivating us to keep past promises is the same
thing that's going to motivate us to "lay down our lives" for our xoxes.

The point of this is not to argue that this is the way to "really" solve
the problem, but rather to point out that somebody who believes that they
are the same person as their copy will be under the same moral obligations
as somebody who believes that they are a different person from their copy,
and for the same reasons, modulo their differing definitions of
"identity."

The whole argument could be translated using a definition of "identity"
which allows us to say that dupes are the same person...  nothing morally
relevant would be lost in the translation.

A well defined term is one that can be used to refer back to the 
physical instances that it purports to describe, and that can be used as 
a test to determine whether or not those physical instances actually do 
reflect the proposed term.  Yes, it is at a higher order of abstraction, 
and thus does not contain all of the information of the original 
instance.  But if the definition is formally correct, then it will 
contain all of the necessary information to use it as it was intended to 
be used.  This is roughly equivalent to "information hiding" where the 
handle to a routine doesn't tell you everything about it, and certainly 
not it's private state information.  But you can still use it to 
properly perform the operations that it can correctly handle.

This is why I said "well defined".  You are perfectly correct about the 
chaos that can be engendered by sloppy definitions.

The fact that they made predictions does not, in and of itself, cause 
those predictions to be correct.  Again, we have a problem here with 
poorly defined terms.

To the extent that the original state was indeed a socialist state (not 
certain.. clearly depends on what the definition actually is), then it 
becomes obvious that one of the possible descendant states is rather 
different than the original predictions.  This doesn't make those who 
took power either socialists or non-socialists.  In the absence of a 
workable definition they can claim to be socialists if they want to, and 
there's no test to show that they aren't (or are).

Counter example to what?  I don't know what either a capitalist or a 
socialist is.  I have partial definitions, but they don't suffice to 
test a specific example and categorize it one way or the other.  Which 
is my point.

Not denying the result, but again just noticing that a vague definition 
has occured.  Who is this "you"? Does "you" include all of those who 
ever have been or ever will be infected with one of n infectious 
diseases?  Not that you don't have a strong basic case here, I'm not 
disputing your physical world facts.  But your categories are 
dangerously unclear.   For that matter, I'm a part Creek.  It's not my 
cultural identity, but it's one aspect of who I am.  Does this mean that 
I am or am not a part of "you", or of "us"?  Or do we need to start 
counting fractions?  Or, possibly, doing a DNA analysis?

Some things that came to mind while reading this thread:

With regard to crunching tracking data they may want to look into some of
the technology being developed for anti-spam software, for filtering the
gibberish from the real threats?

With regard to tracking down a sniper it seems that we should have the
technology to sniff out some spent gun powder in a specific area maybe some
of our trained animal friends could even help out? 

And this one is just a little something to think about, as Arsenio Hall put
it Hmmmmm.

Sniper VS. Women inappropriately disciplining her child.

Hi all:
I have been getting all sorts of variations on the "Nigerian Scam" letters by
email, about 420 so far.  As well I got one sent via post  from Spain..

I have archived every one with the thought to follow up on the sources if I
ever had nothing better to do.

In my business I work hard every time I create a marketing list.  The scammers
seem to have lots of time to data mine places I may have left personal
details.  They seem to have been pretty good at showing me they know details
that would only come from responses to professional response forms.

I only wish I could divert their effort and hire them for a legit purpose.

Anybody open to reverse data mining  and having some fun with the scammers...
I'll fwd any or all of the emails I have archived.

Very interesting -- there is enough uranium orbiting the Earth to

This article discusses a breakthrough in amplifying the number
of stem cells that can be produced from a sample.

Umbilical cord stem cells multiplied in the lab
http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99992949

I would *strongly* urge any extropians who plan to have children
in the future that they make a point of storing the umbilical
cord blood.

There are a couple of reasons for this.  First, it will likely be useful
if your child comes down with leukemia.  Second, it may be useful to
"renew" the tissues of your child and possibly extend their lifespan using
the methods outlined in the article. Third, it may be useful to renew
*your* own tissues once methods are found to tolerize your immune system
to the partially foreign DNA contained in your children's umbilical cord
blood.  [Creating immunotolerance is discussed extensively in Nanomedicine
v. IIA which I'm currently reviewing.] Finally, women who have yet to
undergo menopause should consider having some eggs harvested and
preserved.  If the cloning technology improves as fast as I expect it
could, you might be able to use the eggs to produce a self-clone that
produces stem-cells that could be multiplied into sufficient quantities
for renewing yourself.  [For men I don't currently have a suggestion
unless you can convince a woman to share her eggs with you or they
find a way to make chimpanzee or monkey eggs work as a substitute.]

[Note, it isn't clear that using self-sourced eggs to produce
a self-clone is any more successful than "normal" cloning which
much of the time has to use non-self-sourced eggs.  It would
be interesting to know if the eggs used to clone Dolly or
any of the other animals were self-sourced.]

Preserving the umbilical cord blood should be relatively cheap (there
should be at least a few firms that do this).  Egg harvesting is
relatively expensive (a few thousand $???). But if you have a really good
insurance policy, you might convince them to pay for it if you indicated
you indicated you wanted to still have the option of having children after
menopause.  There is at least one case of a grandmother giving birth to
her granddaughter I believe but I don't know if she had undergone
menopause.

There is far more than 200 years in the history of socialism.  Religious      
communities were essentially socialist in nature quite far back in time.      
Likewise, the essential tribal structure is, internally, basically            
socialist.                                                                    


Tribal structure is also essentially despotic, where the strongest get
the most/best food, individual expression is repressed by group political
consensus, and there is no individual choice in many life choices, from
vocations to marriage partners to religious/philosophical outlooks, etc.

There may well have been, as you assert, sufficient time, but neither         
capitalists nor socialists have created a coherrent theory of the             
systems that they are proposing.  Basically because they don't have a         
good well-defined definition based on physical observables.                   



Capitalism is very well defined.

Some were quite successful for generations, until they were swallowed up      
by encroaching neighbors.  Some may still exist.  I haven't gone              
investigating.  I'm not that interested, and anyway I've never seen a         
complete census of socialist groups.  But it is true that the successful      
ones don't tend to grow very large.  Oneida was about the largest             
successful group that I can think of, until the intolerance of their          
neighbors hampered them.                                                      


You mean the Oneida indians? They were hardly socialist.

Do you really feel that those examples (except, possibly, Tito and            
Mussolini), fit even the loose definition of socialist that exists?  They     
were selfish powerful tyrants, and no different from the estemable            
one's that we supported, e.g., Papa Doc, or who what that lunatic in          
Vietnam.                                                                      



I see really no difference between the despots of large socialist nations and
the petty despots that always seem to take over small communes. Socialism
attracts bullies, layabouts, and looters.

China is merely continuing the imperial tradition under a new name.  Nothing  
to see here.  They are just trying to modernise their system                  
without the emperor giving up any power.                                      



The chinese have historically been able to separate commerce from politics
very well. Also, calling China capitalist is even worse than calling Europe or
a large share of the US economy such.

If you want to look at our good points, you should also look at our bad       
points.  We have slaughered native peoples, fought bloody wars,               
persecuted our citizens, maintained slaves until europe nearly gave up        
on thinking of us as civilized.  And we have a larger fraction of our         
citizens held as slave-laborers than any other country today.  We call        
them criminals, and that lets us sleep easily.  But why are there so          
many of them?                                                                 



If Europe though our slavery made us uncivilized, a) why did Britain support
the Confederacy during the war, and b) why did Vermont outlaw slavery before
any other nation, state, principality or province in the world?

And the dirty secret of capitalism is that the people in charge make          
slaves of those on the bottom.  Sorry, I'm not a capitalist *OR* a            
socialist.  I'm a libertarian.  If I thought it had a reasonable chance       
of working I'd be an anarchist, but anarchy is unstable.  (Well, so is        
everything, or at best only quasi-stable, but I'd perfer something a          
*little* more stable than anarchy.)                                           



You can't be a libertarian and not be a capitalist (i.e. a believer in the
superior utility of free markets). Despite what is claimed on The Anarchist
FAQ.

The, matter, that the socialists present is as meaninglessly emotional        
as that presented by the justifiers of capitalism.                            

If you want to start meaningful development of your arguments, you must       
first use well-defined terms.  And that means that they are based on          
observables.  On what basis, e.g., do you assert that the Nazi's were         
socialists and not capitalists?  Do you take *their* word for it?  Do         
you take their word for anything else?  (If they told me the sky was          
blue, I'd want to check it myself.)                                           



Speer's postware autobiography (actually written after he got out of prison)
clearly demonstrates that Nazis considered themselves socialists, albiet
hardly of the free love variety.  For example, they rationalized their secret
treaty dividing Poland with the USSR with arguments that it was only rational
for socialists like themselves to ally with communists and other socialists.

When socialists claim that a) Nazis weren't socialists and b) neither are
they to be compared with them, you have to ask some rather basic questions,
especially of those claiming to be socialist anarchists, namely:

a) If you live in anarchy, how are you to enforce communal ownership that is
necessary for socialism to function?

As a previous socialist poster admitted rather revealingly, you HAVE to have
some sort of structure to impose communal ownership of property. They went
on to claim that what is important is what sort of structure it is that is
imposed.

If you think it takes guns, tanks, and stormtroopers to go around confiscating
private property and keeping everyone from using more than their fair share of
communal resources, then you are going to wind up with something that looks a
lot like Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, etc.

If you think that if you can instead destroy everybody's private property in
a world war to such an extent that everyone is equally poor, and taxing what
remains in the Reconstruction, it would be far easier afterward to impose
communal ownership by mere statute and the rule of law by incrementalism
(which is what generally happened to Europe, even Western Europe, post WWII),
also known as 'the lobster treatment'.

Those 'socialist anarchists' who are not merely ComIntern members in sheeps
clothing (i.e. Greens Party) generally have a pie-in-the-sky view that they
oppose the use of force to achieve their 'socialist anarchy' utopia, which
leaves such idealistic states in the realm of religious fantasy as has been
previously noted.

My only opposition to people voluntarily belonging to communal organizations
(corporations being merely one form organized by statutory authority of the
state) is that they generally act in ways inimical to free markets in the long
term, either by using manipulation of instruments of the state to gain market
advantage, obtain exclusive access, or raising barriers to competition, as
well as utilizing economies of scale to manipulate pricing.

Charles,
       As an intelligent and educated person you have probably heard of the 
saying that if you hear the thunder of pounding hooves and it is North 
America then you should expect horses not zebra.
       Now if we are talking about the deaths of American Indians and we say 
"you" killed them most folks know we are talking about people of European 
descent not the  Asians nor the Africans.  As we are not trying to demand 
reparations nor asking any one person to feel guilt a general term is all 
that is demanded.
       But I had a tactical reason for suggesting that we stay at lower 
levels of abstraction.  The socialists have been past masters at sounding 
wonderful when taken at the highly abstract level -- it is the concrete level 
where they get into trouble.  On the other hand I believe that capitalism has 
proven just the opposite.
       At the abstract level they are humanitarians that love all mankind and 
wish to create a "Heaven on Earth."  At the concrete level they all too often 
have difficulty conducting a two car funeral and ruin the lives of the people 
that are trapped in the societies they run.  In fact they have a tendency to 
let a thug to get in charge and to stuff the Gulags with prisoners to the 
point they have to conduct executions just to clear out space for the 
newcomers.
       I am well aware there are possibly hundreds of rabbit paths in this 
briar patch of a discussion we are having but my chief concern is any 
contention that socialism is a respectable political theory.  Two hundred 
years of history has shown over and over that socialism is not respectable.

There's at least one exception I can think of--the Oneida community,
originally formed as a collective-marriage commune supporting itself
with collectively-owned farms and by selling crafts.  After their
charismatic founder left his incompetent son in charge, they simply
ignored him and many of his father's original teachings and became
Oneida Community, Limited, now Oneida corporation, the largest
manufacturer of stainless steel flatware in the country.

That's certainly one way to make a commune successful--turn it
into a useful enterprize.

[quote from: ags on 2002-10-22 at 11:56:57]


\"If it is a socialist state it exists, like National Socialist Germany       
or Communist Russia to allow a few thugs to lord it over and terrorize the    
rest of the citizenry.  In addition the state serves to allow a few mooches   
to get something for nothing.\"                                               

Well, I don't think that, assuming a few things, it is really possible to     
talk about a socialist state at all, I don't think that is a concept which    
is self consistent. Because a state, at least in the normal sense of the      
word, implies authoritarian organization, people coercing other people to     
get what they want done (isn't that what the usual meaning is?).              



If everyone is free to work or not work, your entire 'socialist' society
is going to have to choose between famine and tyranny (as every socialist
society to date has had to choose). Given this choice it is mandatory for
any socialist system to function for any length of time that there is no
individual freedom to not work, just as in any free market system.




Socialism,                                                                    
however, is supposedly a classless system of organization, which is in        
contradiction with the idea of a state.                                       



On the contrary, socialism enforces a minimum of two classes on any society:
either a) thugs that make others work, and b) workers, or else a) workers and
b) non-workers. Demonstrate any socialist society where this is not true.




Now, is it possible to have a                                                 
capitalist state?                                                             



The original US government, if you ignore the special case of slavery of
africans, which was a preexisting burden of the British feudal system and not
created by the US government, treated the economy in a very hands-off fashion,
letting the free market operate pretty much on its own, while the various
states and the Continental government all set their own monetary policies that
influenced the markets to some extent.

The medieval Icelandic culture is a well known example of an
anarcho-capitalist state, where the economy was free market, and
government was rather minimalist/consensual (the AllThing) which used
preist/umpires/judges to ajudicate disagreements.




-----------------------------------------------------------------

"But similiary, Anarchism necessities that you can not                        
choose to engage in capitalism"                                               

Well, what do you mean by engage in capitalism? If you mean the               
monopolization of resources, that doesn't just affect you, if affects the     
people who need the resources that you are monopolizing by force. Like, if    
in a communal society I decide that a particular plot of land is off limits   
to anyone who does not obey a command of mine, as I could do if that land     
were private property, that doesn't just affect me. (2)                       



It is a reather common socialist claim that owning property is 'monopolizing
by force', but in typical socialist fashion, it uses a demogogic twisting of
the definition of 'monopoly'. A monopoly means that one entity has near total
control of a market for a specific product or resource. If one person owned
almost ALL of the land, that would be a monopoly. If one person owns several
acres of land, and millions of other people also own various amounts of land,
there is no 'monopoly' on the market for land. While if I own a specific plot
of land may exclude someone else from using that particular plot, it does not
exclude them from using some other, unclaimed plot. It also does not exclude
them from offering me fair market value in exchange for a) exclusive use of
that plot of land (i.e. deeded sale), or b) temporary partial use of the land
(i.e. rent/lease).

Socialists who claim that 'property is theft' are generally of the sort who
seem to think that a) they don't need to work for their own living, b) others
owe them the resources they need to survive, and c) it's not okay for others
to prevent, with force, them from taking it, but d) it is okay for them to
take it by force because they are just reestablishing an equal distribution of
goods.





"How about, instead, a system where you can choose to work OR not work?"

Well, I'm not sure what you mean by work-- do you mean work for money, or     
work in the more general sense, like work on a physics project? If you mean   
the former, then I don't see how that is possible (see above). If you mean    
the latter, then I agree. (3)                                                 



That you can't see that the two are identical speaks volumes.





"There is no such thing as a life without a collar and a leash, as nature     
imposes her own collars and leashes upon us."                                 

That is true, but, as Bakunin said once, I don't see how it makes sense to    
talk about the inherent bonds of nature as some sort of restriction--these    
are rather the essential parts of existance itself. (4)                       



Even when the restrictions that nature places upon you result in free market
mechanisms being more Objectively True than non-free markets?





"If anarchism requires that to be free you must be free of the need to        
'work' but one must 'work' to stay alive, how is an anarchist society even    
logically possible?"                                                          

Well, I don't think that anyone supposes that food is going to pop up from    
nowhere-- I think what anarchists are saying about not having to work means   
not having to work in the capitalist sense. I mean, if there is abundant      
food right there in front of you, but you can't have it because someone is    
going to throw you in jail if you take it, and you have to obey some command  
of the owner in order to have it... that's what they mean. If there is no     
food at all, or all the food that exists is needed, that's different. (5)     



There is no difference between having to work in the capitalist sense and
having to work in the socialist sense. To claim otherwise is pure lunacy.

If I have abundant food that you are standing right in front of, you have
no idea or appreciation for the fact that a) I may need all of that food to
survive, b) my selling that food for a profit is the only means for me to
aquire goods produced by others and to save for old age when I am unable to
work. You think that just because there is a pile of food in front of me that
I could not possibly eat at one sitting that I therefore have 'more than my
fair share'.



"What if everyone chooses not to work?"

Then I guess everyone dies, but it is up to them. I mean, if there is no      
food at all, just hypothetically, and you want to get some, so you go out     
and make just enough for yourself, then I don't think anybody has any         
legitimate right to take it away from you. (6)                                



Except that under your socialism, they do have that right.





----------------------------------------------------------------

"Any employer that abuses his workers will soon find the good ones have       
left him and been welcomed with open arms elsewhere."                         

Well, first of all, changing jobs isn't easy-- there is a lot of work you     
have to go through in order to do that, generally, especially if you don't    
have certain credentials. However, what if all the jobs you can find are      
worse, at the same level, or only marginally better than the job you have?    
(7)                                                                           



What if the sky turns yellow? So what? We should all hope to get jobs that
are only marginally better than the ones we have now, because that means that
later on down the road, we get another one that is marginally better than that
one, and so on, and we move up the socioeconomic ladder. If you don't keep up
with maintaining and improving your skills, and your current job decreases
in demand among employers, do you think you should still get paid the same
amount?





I mean, generally, the capitalist system inherently promotes exploitation of  
the weak. That's because the strong, or those whose control of resources is   
backed up by force, have very little to lose if someone decides to leave      
them-- that is why unions are needed, and even then on a personal level, a    
bankruptcy will generally not affect an employer very much, he'll still have  
a well to do living standard. On the other hand, the person working for him   
may be reduced to absolutely horrible conditions or even killed by            
starvation, in the extreme case, if they do not find work. (8)                



neither capitalism, libertarianism, nor anarcho-capitalism are inherently
against unions. There are libertarian union members here on this list, who
also happen to be capitalists in that they own stock in various companies
they are not employed by. I expect to become a union member myself in a
couple months, and I'm a libertarian and a capitalist.  Your understanding of
capitalism is very poor.



"Quite. I wonder how is it that socialist "anarchists" can claim that         
true anarchism is socialist when the single common characteristic of          
every commune that ever existed is a tendency to become tyrannized by         
control freaks."                                                              

But then it would no longer be a commune-- I mean, that's inherent to the     
definition of commune, no single person or group has control. See (1). (9)    



On the contrary, as I have participated in temporary communes myself in the
past, I can clearly state that in even the most consensual commune, there will
ALWAYS be one or more individuals who are master manipulators and control
freaks who wind up dominating things. They generally take on roles such as
'facilitator' etc who claim to help foster consensus, but generally are
experts at manipulating groups into doing what the 'facilitators' want while
thinking it's their own ideas.



"I would posit that it is because non-free market based systems of            
economic distribution are so unwieldy that they require tyrannical            
control mechanisms to strongly dictate rules of distribution to avoid         
communal dissolution and strife"                                              

I don't really see why this is. In fact, I think it is precisely because of   
the inherent force and inequalities used to maintain a "free market system"   
that most if not all tyrannical controls exist in our society all. Of         
course, the US is not a "free market system" in any sense of the phrase.      
(10)                                                                          



There are no force and inequalities needed to maintain a free market system,
unless you seem to think that because I, a shoe cobbler, have ten pairs of
shoes, but no corn, while you, a farmer, have none, while you do have a
thousand bushels of corn, that we are living in an 'unequal' society. While
the US is not a pure free market today, it is the most free of any major
nation, and it was in its past far more of a free market.

The fact is that 95% of businesses in the US are small businesses, generally
are unincoporated, and employ over half the workforce. These small busineses
range from sole proprietorships with one owner/employee up to as many as 50
employees.



"The mere fact that the socialist 'anarchists' had to write a propaganda      
piece calling itself "THE anarchist FAQ"                                      

Here, go to www.infoshop.org/faq/intro.html and read the three paragraphs     
which start with this sentence...                                             

"We are sure that many anarchists will not agree 100% with what we have       
written in the FAQ..."                                                        

That pretty much states the essence of any reply I could make to this.



No, it isn't, because I, as an anarchist, disagree with the claim in the faq
that 'anarchism is socialist'. You disagree with me, and therefore the faq is
wrong.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

"Since capitalism is based on a chaotic free market"

Assuming I'm interpreting what you're saying correctly about chaos... no      
system which may be said to be successful is based on a such a thing... the   
very definition of chaos implies disorganization, and disorganization         
implies destruction (the levels of each being roughly correlated).            


No, chaos does NOT imply disorganization, nor does disorganization imply
destruction. Like your conflation of capitalism concepts with corporation
concepts, you are inherently WRONG here.

Chaos mathematics, which rule chaotic systems, demonstrates that chaos
operates by relatively simple rules, and therefore chaos has organization,
however difficult it is to discern from mere observation of seemingly random
noise.

Disorganization is a lack of structure, ergo, if we use latin,
an-archy. Therefore, a free market is anarchy. Chaos seems disorganized to the
uninitiated and unobservant, to the blind man trying to describe the elephant.

In fact, free markets arise as a form of 'spontaneous order'.







Organization does not, I think, require force in any normal sense of the      
word, only people who are committed to working together. And of course it is  
possible to cooperate voluntarily, for how else could, say, this              
organization exist? (12)                                                      



Free markets cannot exist without people who are committed to working
together, voluntarily.

The amount of vulnerabilities for open source *nixen is maybe one half to     
one third of Redmond's offerings, by benchmark of bugtraq listings (of        
course, one doesn't count the same vulnerability in different                 
distributions multiply, unless one is a FUD monger). Most reasons for this    
is because Redmond subscribes to security by obscurity, whereas the open      
source community exposes its soft white underbelly and throat completely      
to straight razor wielding street rabble. There is not much open source       
wormviruses around because the admins are more or less competent, and keep    
the system well patched, virulence is much attenuated by high dilution        
(there's value of diversity vividly illustrated). Plus, average *nix has a    
clear distinction between user and admin, whereas the canonical way to get    
anything done under Redmondware is a user with full admin rights.

Coding crossplatform worms is a lot of work. Way more work than your          
average h4x0r d00d is willing to invest. If we had 10 independent-codebase    
platforms with each 10% of market share we wouldn't be seeing any worms.      
Speaking of which, if we didn't have executable documents, and buggy          
browsers and mailers from Redmond, we wouldn't be seeing any wormviruses,     
either.

My Linux boxen don't crash. Apps do, now and then, especially the complex     
ones. If I will let the Mozilla sit for a week or two with a few 'bad'        
sites open, eventually the swap will run full due to memory leaks (thank      
you so much for rich content, web monkeys), and the box will grind to a       
halt. It's happening as we speak, so I will have to save the state, and       
restart Mozilla sometime soon.

I use NT 4.0 SP6 at work as desktop (not willingly), Linux at home (both      
desktop and server).

A publication doesn't have code, corrupt, or not. (Unless you mean TeX or     
PostScript, which are all code, not data) I presume the Ventura bombed,       
and took the OS down along with it.                                           



A publication of any kind, other than ascii text, will have markup code in
it to define how text is formatted, how graphics within the publication are
presented, etc. HTML is markup code. XML is markup code, etc. Ventura8's
publication files used a proprietary derivation of XML. V10 should be using
pure XML by now.

The user should not have to adapt herself to the machine. It should be the
other way around.



That wasn't adapting myself to the machine, it was cleaning up the mistakes
and kluges of the previous occupiers of my position, as well as cleaning
out the corruption introduced by poorly programmed application file upgrade
tools. It had nothing to do with the OS.

Your experience is rather atypical, to say the least.



A customer tries to email you a 100 meg compressed attachment, or your ISP
forwards mail to you with chopped message headers, causing your mail browser
to make the local mail server to hang.

If you're tied to a particular application (you probably have good reasons    
why you let yourself get hooked), you don't really have a choice.             




Yes, Ventura is the best application for long structured documents, bar
none. The closest to it is Adobe Framemaker. I've written five software
manuals and dealt with books written by others on many different applications
on different OS's, so I think my opinion on this can be considered expert.

Maybe so.

I don't see it as malformed. What is needed here is, I think, a
generalized answer to the question "Who are you?" When asked this
question, people will typically respond first with name, serial number,
occupation, social security number, driver's license number, etc.
Pressed for a more detailed answer, they will begin to say such things
as "I am a supporter of the xyz political party," "I am a member of the
xyz religious faith," "I am a lover of rock and roll," "I am someone who
opposes/supports abortion rights," "I am a quiet person who likes to
read," "I am a tall fat person," etc, etc, etc. The person will be
listing the attributes of his body and personality that together make
him a person distinct from other persons. It is to those attributes that
he refers when he refers to himself as "I" or "me." *Those* things are
who he *is*. 

So then to determine if a dupe is equal to his original, we need only
compare the list of attributes. Given that our personality changes
through time in response to events in our lives, and given that the life
experiences of duplicates differ from their original's, it seems quite
obvious to me that the dupe's personal attributes will be different from
the original's personal attributes, even if only slightly. Thus we can
answer the question of identity in the negative. A dupe is not the
original. The original and the dupe begin to diverge immediately after
the moment of duplication.

Lee's argument for the equivalency of dupes (which leads him to make
nonsensical statements such as "A person can be in two places at the
same time") fails to account for changes in personality. He focuses only
on the duplication of memories, forgetting that personalities change
through time.

Yes. 

I used this father-son analogy because it also has some reality in
society in terms of estate law. If a father dies before he keeps his
promise to pay back a loan then his son (as executor and heir) will be
compelled by law to keep his father's promise. However he will fight to
break the promise if he can prove it to be illegal. The analogy is
appropriate to the extent that law attempts to mimic morality.

I think brother-brother might be the best analogy for our relationship
to our xoxes when both us and they are alive. They are not us, but it
would be natural to feel fond of them and morally obligated to them in
the same way that siblings usually feel toward one another. 

For that matter, there is no important difference in my mind between an
xox and an identical twin sibling. Fortunately identical twins have
enough sense to know they are not the same person in two places at one
time.

Well, the most obvious thing that I think gts and Dan are
missing is that one keeps to one's promises *because* one
is thereby rewarded for doing so.  In our society, it is
not practical to go about breaking one's word all the time.

The reason for this is very pertinent to the identity 
argument.  The reason is, of course, that to all outward
appearances (and I would add for inside particulars as
well) one is seen as the same person over a very long
period of time.  Law sometimes goes overboard on that IMO
and prosecutes a very old man for crimes committed while
extremely young.  (Yes, true, there is the deterrence
angle.)

Yes, one's duplicate's attributes *do* vary from one's, but
to a ridiculously small degree.  One is far more similar to
one's duplicate made a few hours ago than one is to oneself
of a month ago.

Of course they do, but the question has hardly been answered,
since you are arguing that a list of attributes is key.  Just
as you are the same person you were a second ago, so I say
you are also the same person as a duplicate created a second
ago but happens to be in the next room.

I have not forgotten that!! ;-)  OF course one's personality *slowly*
changes over time, and one *slowly* becomes someone else.  Memories
are crucial, but I gave up decades ago on the requirement that identity
is preserved only through memory supersets.  We forget things all the
time, but with little impact on our identities.

Well, they're *really* not the same person, you know!  ;-)
Parents and close friends readily sense the difference.
But no one would sense the difference between you and
your duplicate.  You and your duplicate could trade
places every day, and (except for occasionally thinking
you a bit absent-minded) your spouse would never know
the difference.

There is a reason that he or she would never know the
difference:  it's because you have the same attributes
and are thereby the same person.  Take that *list*
of attributes quite literally.  Were 10^12 or so
statements regarding you written down, we would find
a tremendous overlap between them and those that would
describe you last month.  Or next month.  But those
would pale in comparison to how close the descriptions
would be for you and your very recently created duplicate
in the next room.

There is definitely a reference in an older Paul Davies Book I read - maybe 
Beyond the Black Hole - to energy extraction from 2 rotating black holes, 
and to using gravity extraction platforms of some sort to mechanically 
extract energy from a body with massive gravitational attraction. Sorry to 
be so vague but I gave the book away a while ago.

Sure but I need to get out there and finish my
brake project.  Remember it is momentum that is
the conserved quantity, not energy.  Assume you
decide to grind up part of the asteroid to use
as reaction mass to accelerate the remaining part.

If you think of a tricky way to change to velocity
of an asteroid by hyper-accelerating small amounts
of the material, the energy requirement goes way
up.  If you use less energy, you would use up more
of the asteroid in reaction mass.  It is a tradeoff,
depending on how much energy is available and how
much mass you decide to throw away.

Even people who differ by "ridiculously small" degrees are different
people, Lee. There is no equivalency between them, which means they are
not "one person in two places at the same time."

Furthermore the degree of difference between the original and his dupe
will graduate from "ridiculously small" to "ridiculously large" with the
passage of time and events. 

You never replied to my answer to your cryonic backup argument. I will
repost it here because it is relevant to the question at hand:

I replied:

 I would regard it as survival of someone very similar to me, but not
me.
 I am the person who died -- not the person who was frozen two weeks ago
 and later restored. 

 To illustrate, I may have experienced some major changes in my
 personality after my last backup. Perhaps as a result of some traumatic
 experience in the last week before I died, I experienced a religious
 conversion and decided with firm resolve to commit my life to the god
 Thor. Would my non-religious backup be a true copy of me, the devoted
 servant of Thor? Hardly. We would be two entirely different people with
 different beliefs, values, hopes and dreams. 

How do you answer this?

Shhhhhh!!!  I'm currently learning how this is successfully done to others!  Please remember those people with some intelligence and ambition will have opportunities in a capitalistic society to move up, or at least move on to something else which they might do better at.  I certainly realize health problems, advancing age, family responsibilities, etc., can make moving up the socio-economic ladder very hard.  The social/financial "caste system" in Arizona seems much more defined and hardened than the one in Alaska.  Only in Louisiana did I see worse.

Mike, did you hear how researchers later discovered a group of apes which came along and "for the good of all apes everywhere" seized the two rocks and made them public property??  Of course this involved the alpha ape(first among alphas) having "total stewardship" over the rocks for the good of the tribe.  We can just imagine how the apes fell into a pattern of severe apathy and were soon totally outperformed by the neighboring ape groups which had not fallen into this faulty way of doing things. ; )   

best wishes,

Here you have ignored the differences in the experiences of the two
individuals being compared. 

As you'll agree, it is true that:

1) The sensed differences between me and my duplicate immediately after
duplication would be small and roughly the same as the sensed
differences between two identical twins immediately after conception. 

But you fail to recognize that the following is also true:

2) The sensed differences between me and my duplicate 10 years after
duplication would be large and roughly the same as the sensed
differences between two identical twins at age 10. 

If you recognize 2) as true then you'll understand that the comparative
differences between dupes and originals is for all practical purposes no
different from the comparative differences between identical siblings.
You imagine a distinction between dupes and twins that does not exist,
(apparently because you have a vested interest in supporting your
nonsensical theory that one person can exist in two places
simultaneously).

Goodness!  There has to be a way to stop these endless
itterations.

Buy a good reference.  This is not a new subject.  It
has been argued in detail for a long time both on list
and off.  Even the academic encyclopeadias of
political ideas now get it right more often than not.

Anarchy is like atheism.  It doesn't define a
positive.  It just says what you don't accept as being
true, good or valid.  Atheist: "without a God." 
Anarchist: "without a ruler (the ancient Greek
"Archon").  The word has survived unchanged for over
2,000 years.

Some anarchist societies work - or appear to have the
potential to work as we haven't tried them yet, such
as the case of the more modern versions of
anarcho-capitalism.  Ancient Ireland seems to have
been a working anarchy which was very successful and
stable for hundreds of years, and is often cited,
especially by anarcho-capitalists, as much of its
functionality is similar or parallel to their
concepts.  The Hunza valley is another reputed
example, altho I haven't seen real verification on
that yet.  

I suspect that the anti-property communal anarchies
will not work for many reasons, including the fact
that they have always failed disasterously when they
have been tried, as property is a necessary component
of any working society.  A good century of
anthropology has shown that even when property is
overtly outlawed, it springs up again in another form.
 See Margaret Mead's "Sex and Temperment in 3
Primitive Societies."  Or, check out some of the
Russian economics websites where they explicitly
analyze how property emerges even under socialism.

The best single source that I'm aware of for the basic
exposition of anarcho-capitalism is "The Market for
Liberty" by Morris and Linda Tannehill.  This used to
be available from Laissez Faire books.  Later editions
included "Social Services Under Laissez Faire" by
Jarret Wollstein, which I also recommend.

After you guys who want to attack anarcho-capitalism
actually know what you're talking about, THEN talk
about it.  OK?

To see how successful anarchists can be, check out the
Mondragon cooperative.  $8 billion dollars
capitalization now, entirely owned and run by the
workers for half a century with NO state money or even
any outside funding at all.  They were upset because
they only grew 14% last year - blamed it on the global
recession....

The answer to that question is to reply with the most important, relevant

Sure, but I take a different moral from this than you do.

Allow me to make a similar point.  Suppose I indicate a barn in which
you'll find only a horse.  How many objects are there in the barn?  Well,
there's a horse.  But a horse's head is also an object, and so is any
other part of the horse.  But there's no adequate way to count how many
"parts" a horse has in any formally rigorous way.  And that's not even
considering the air!  So instead, we count the number of things which have
relevant properties that happen to interest us; when they agree in terms
of those properties, we count them as one thing.  Thus you may be
permitted to say that there is only one thing in the barn, so long as we
share a context in which that makes sense.  You might still say that even
if the horse had a saddle on its back, in some contexts.

You might think of this as an alternate version of Leibniz' Identity of
Indiscernables law, which is often dragged out in conversations about
xoxes.  The "law" is: x = y iff for any property P, if P is relevant and
P(x), then P(y).  [I believe Geach holds a similar view: that counting is
always done in terms of a property (which here may be the conjunction of a
variety of relevant properties).  You don't count the number of "things"
or "objects"; rather, you can count the number of horses, or the number of
limbs, or the number of displaced partitions, or whatever.]

Of course, immediately we notice that "relevance" is vague and
context-sensitive.  Couldn't we get more technical?  Yes, we can, if we
formalize which properties are relevant to us.

But I think that's impossible in the case of xoxes.  Some of us think that
the fact that the xoxes are in different locations is enough to show that
they're different people, but some people *just don't find that relevant*.
I say that they're counting in two entirely different terms; they're both
right, modulo their interests and situation.

[Before any of the Objective Truth folks get uppity, I do concede that we
can get very technical indeed most of the time, but I think you also have
to concede that we let "objective truths" fly about willy nilly which are
vague at best, if not wrong from a technical perspective.  Another example
from the philosophy of counting.  How many hands have you got?  Assuming
you haven't lost any, the answer is two, right?  Well, consider your right
hand minus one molecule on the right hand side.  If you removed that
molecule, you'd still have a hand, right?  But it wouldn't be the same as
the hand you have now...  So you've got three thingies which count as
hands: left hand, right hand, and right hand minus a molecule.  Of course,
obviously you have many many more thingies than 3 which might count as
hands; at least as many as there are skin molecules, plus a number of
plausible combinations of molecular subtractions.  We can get very
technical as to what kinds of thingies we're interested in, but most of
the time, we're vague.  "I've got two hands" we each say, and that's one
of the most objective truths there can be!  And I agree, that is
objectively true, but it wouldn't be true in another language in which
more thingies counted as "hands".  Objective truth is "out there," but our
sentences about them are always in a language; the truth values of our
sentences don't generally survive redefinitions and other language
switches.]

Ah, but the question is whether they diverge in a relevant way.  Again,
how many overlapping people are you when I could start plucking off
trivial molecular combinations and get a different thingy?  You don't
generally concede to the idea of identity persistence through time, but
most of us find such points along a time line and even drastic long-term
revisions in personality (within a "normal" scope) to be insufficient to
count two people.  We don't sweat the small stuff.

Eh.  Personalities do change, but a millisecond after duplication, I
hardly think that the personalities are different in any interesting way.
Maybe it's interesting to you, but you seem to find a lot of odd things
interesting for counting; for example, you find even trivial differences
over time to be important enough to count as two things.  I don't, and
neither does most anyone else.  But some do, especially when they're
trying to be "technical."


Why all this talk of relevance and identity, when I've already sworn off
the problem by bracketing it?  Because, in my view, the only properties I
care about here are those properties which are practically/morally
relevant.  As I've attempted to show, whether you call xoxes the same
person or not *isn't morally relevant*.  You'll make much the same choices
regardless.

I think that the relationship is much stronger than the relationship
shared by identical twins, but also that the relationship grows weaker
over time.  A few years after xoxing, yes, I think your analogy to twins
would hold.  But *immediately* afterwards?  Not really relevant to me.
In fact, I could probably go a month or, if need be, even a year before
I'd treat one of my xoxes as "merely" an identical twin.

I am very relieved to hear you are going to be alright!  It still might be nice to know exactly what type of asbestos you were exposed to.  

Have you considered only driving a dirt bike offroad to get your "motorcycle riding fix" which seems so important to you?  I think that might be much safer than zipping around a big city full of crazy drivers while you are painfully vulnerable to the two-ton or more machines surrounding you.

In my extended family when my mother was in her twenties, a cousin was killed in a horrific motorcycle accident.  Since that time there is a sort of "unofficial family ban" on riding them.

Spike, I just don't want us to lose you!  I really mean that my friend.  As strange as it seems "the good do seem to die young!"  If you can just live safely for the next two or three decades, you will probably be out of the danger zone for a nightmarish accident(due to our current technology) which could break Shelley's heart forever.

I know I went for the heartstrings with the last remark, but I do REALLY care.

your friend,

John

Thanks for an interesting list discussion as to M-brains

M-brains as at:
http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/MatrioshkaBrains/

I had a read again through material on this subject, which lies somewhere 
between Dyson (and Sanders) and Tipler.

To an extent, the idea might be used to create a virtuality generator 
substrate.

Because I don't believe in uploading, only upgrading, and see broadcast 
linkage as a sensory/informational tool (i.e. I see each individual or 
node-while-in-continuous-broadcast-linkage as a sentient entity) I can't see 
M-brains or the like as sensible unless the architecture was appropriate to 
liberty and respect for sentient life (such as us). After all, currently we 
could have had absolute control in society (Orwell style) but we choose not 
to (most of us anyhow).

Talk in M-brain circles of human dumbness in comparison to an M-brain being 
equivalent to billions of times that of a nematode to a human is purely 
computational "stacking" theory, which reduces experience to bits. This is 
not to say bits are not relevant, only that context is also relevant and is 
certainly not irrelevant. Self-awareness appears to kick in in a 2-3 year 
old human child. At that point moral worth is definitely established along 
with articulated identity.

The contrary argument to fullscale necessary-M-brain theory is that whatever 
mode is in operation when the Singularity occurs is the base-template for 
some time to come, and in some cases for ever (because motivational 
hard-wiring leaving aside the issue of free will may be very difficult to 
consciously unplug or alter at the emotional level). Thus in this scenario 
any virtualities generated might generally reflect the human Earth 
experience in c.12 billion ABB (or 15 billion or whatever). Ditto for 
emotions. There would be extreme divergences but these would probably be a 
minority. Most people might opt for variations on the theme - at least for 
the first 100 billion years!

For example, you might find that most people become amortal 
cell/nanotech/computronium androids (with lifespans of at the very least 
many billions of years) with some computronium virtuality stations and 
centres within broadcast distance (whether directly or through information 
circulation). Their rate of overtual reproduction might slow down from 
current levels and their energy needs might be low because they prefer small 
scale bodies and (current) Earthlike or analogous existence. Computronium 
systems may only be add-ons for memory storage or virtuality.

Neurological substrates and virtuality environments are highly complex 
areas. Intelligence and sentiency are two extremes of a spectrum. Culture 
and personal identity, individual and group minds, consent and systems 
operation (non-force and protective shielding) are all interlinked. If there 
are any overriding principles for me, they are maximum choice and minimum 
force and respect for all sentient life (whatever their computational 
ability, whether human or AI or boosted dog or a mixture). If growth is 
achieved at the cost of these principles it is morally and ethically 
pointless. If growth is achieved while preserving these values it is 
positive.

What does superintelligence think about? What do we think about with our 
individual and communication-linkage-produced (cultural) superintelligence? 
Exploration. Evocation. The other. Beauty. Love. Pleasure. Visions of other 
spiritual systems and cosmologies. And once we find some area we like, 
perhaps we stay (roughly) there for long periods of time.

To an extent, of course, we will have to factor in the necessities of 
cosmological change into extropy, and this (cosmological destiny as it 
relates to the substructural "Theory of Everthing", the information of the 
"laws" of physics) is something we will discover as the Singularity 
continues to unfold and we experience Cyberia.

LONDON, England -- A woman injured while squeezed next to an obese 
passenger on a trans-Atlantic flight has been given 13,000 ($20,000) by 
the airline.

Barbara Hewson, 63, was offered damages by Virgin Atlantic after 
suffering a blood clot, torn leg muscles and sciatica following a flight 
to Los Angeles in January 2001, the UK's Press Association reported.

She said the woman passenger was so large she had to sit with the arm 
rests up, but when she complained, the crew said there was nothing they 
could do as the plane was full.

Hewson, of Swansea, Wales, who still has medical treatment, was quoted 
by PA on Monday as saying: "It was never about the money. No money would 
pay for you having sleepless nights with the pain."

The freelance writer, who travelled with her husband Roy, 67, said she 
spent most of her holiday in bed. "It ruined the holiday. We went out 
very little."

Hewson added that half-way through the flight the woman asked if she was 
okay, saying to her: "I'm sitting on your lap."

"I had three sessions of sitting in the hostess seat and I stood for a 
little while," added Hewson.

Virgin Atlantic said in a statement: "This was an unprecedented set of 
extremely unfortunate circumstances.

"We have apologised to Mrs Hewson and offered her compensation, which 
she has accepted, and we are pleased that this has now reached a 
conclusion."

There is no problem with levels of abstraction if the levels are 
reasonable well-defined and grounded.  Perfect definition and 
grounding is not practical in many cases though and 
over-insistence on such leaves too many important areas 
undiscussable.  There is a balance.

Many things are barely understandable at all, or at least not

perhap one level up.

That is worth about as much as most over-generalizations.

Personally I have a problem with still arguing capitalism vs. 
socialism as if those were particular valid categories or all 
that exclusive or that the two exhaust the possibilities.

More will happen in terms of human capabilities and degrees of 
freedom in the next 10-20 years than in the last 200 years. 
Don't you think it might be a little limiting to reason as if 
the last 200 years are a valid guide to a radically different 
time and set of capabilities and possibilities?   Rehashing the 
same old debates strikes me as less than useful.

Well, while I think there is some truth in what I just said I 
also think some of it is darn foolish.  The "debate" was never 
properly aired in the first place.  Large measures of socialist 
agenda have become accepted norm to the detriment of all of us. 
  Many of "our" government offices treat their clients not much 
better than a Soviet ration line used to treat citizens. 
Literally trillions of dollars of our money, yours and mine, are 
mishandled and/or unauditable in the jungles of government 
bureaucracy.  Hundreds of billions in cash and goods simply 
disappear into unexplained "budget adjustments".  What we have 
today sure as heck ain't capitalism or a free country.

It seems to me that you keep ducking *my* question,
or my insinuations, at least:  isn't it true that
you *are* the same person that you were yesterday
despite the fact that there are small differences
between you?  And if you agree to that, then you
can see why logically I can consider myself to
be the same person as a close duplicate.

Yes, in *that* case you might very well be considered
to be, and rightly so, two different people.  You
ought properly be considered two different people
precisely because gts has attempted to illustrate
a difference so profound that it does constitute a
very large difference.

However, these are *extremely* rare cases.  I would
consider, in fact, that *never* during the course
of even a single decade have I become a different
person than I was.  (It takes a couple of decades
at very least.)  Therefore I would always be the
same (or, of course, as we say, very nearly the
same) person as I was last week.  The situation
is clear:  you think of your car today as the same
car that you had yesterday.  But is it *REALLY* the
same?  Blah, blah, blah.  We know all the relevant
facts.  I think that you agree with me that in 
almost every way it should be considered the same
car.

I am *so nearly* the same as I was last year that
were I to die and be replaced by a backup from 
last year, then I would agree with all my friends:
Lee was still the same Lee, a little less stout
perhaps, and a little less gray hair, but the
same guy nonetheless.

I am so nearly the same as I was yesterday, that
again everyone would agree that Lee had survived
having been replaced by a backup from yesterday.
And if my duplicate is in the next room, having
been copied from me ten minutes ago, then the
person who is typing this---namely, Lee Corbin
---will rightly be considered to have survived,
should only the duplicate live through the
night.

So suppose that you have to take a dangerous
3-minute helicopter ride to the opposite side
of the canyon, and a backup of you was made
ten seconds ago.  Since due to the vagaries
of the winds you might die at any second now,
is that backup of any value to you?

On the contrary!  By duplicate---especially "close duplicate"---
I mean one made very, very recently.  Recall my thought experiment
where a duplicate of you was made a few minutes ago and lays
encased in ice.

;-)  Your resort to quasi-name calling (e.g., repeated references
to "nonsensical") only serve to illustrate that I'm getting to you!
I actually have a logical point of view here that cannot be
dismissed out of hand.  A number of philosophers including
Derek Parfit, Mike Perry, Robin Hanson, and many others, probably
including Max More, agree with me here.  If there is a flaw in
our view or views, it will take some work to unearth it.

Again, let me be blunt:  the difference between dupes and
twins is a matter of *time*:  the differences between twins
took *years* to create; the differences between the duplicates
that I'm talking about are on the order---in some of the most
interesting cases---of *seconds*.

Well, there is a lot of energy in a rotating black hole, but it is not 
close to the mass-energy of the hole. Extracting energy from the 
rotating Kerr metric is a popular textbook example, but it is limited by 
the total angular momentum the hole formed with.

According to http://cxc.harvard.edu/fellows/viewgraphs/li/li.ps one
could simply put a disk or coil around a charged rotating hole and get a
transfer of angular momentum through electromotive forces. This way you
can get 0.15 of the mass-energy if the original hole was extremal
(http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0002004). The Blandford-Znajek mechanism
only gives 0.09
(http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Blandford-ZnajekProcess.html), 
and I think the Penrose process even less.

While this is nice, non-rotating holes would be useless. But they can be
used as energy sources if they are small enough to radiate significant
Hawking radiation. If you top off the mass loss with new matter to keep
the hole stable, you get a very efficient mass-energy converter. You
could also improve the efficiency by attaching cosmic strings to the
hole; according to http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/0012260 you can get
significant improvements in efficiency this way.

Big black holes are useful for cooling instead.

I think most people have a hard time even thinking in terms of bent 
light;  renderings like http://www.photon.at/~werner/bh/ usually just 
confuse people.

It doesn't matter of it's years or seconds, as it's above the 
biological chronone duration. They're all different, albeit similiar
people.

I haven't followed that thread, but why do we discuss
forking on this list? Again?

### And then you also have to pay attention to the way your reaction mass is
imparting acceleration to the asteroid - since many large asteroids are
loose assemblages of smaller fragments, exerting a large pressure on a small
patch on the surface will only cause displacement of a fragment, and a lot
of the energy will be dissipated as heat by friction within the asteroid.
Instead of moving it, you will only heat it up. This is the reason why the
use of nuclear explosions to vaporize a superficial layer for reaction mass
will be much less effective than initially assumed, too.

### The moment you became a servant of Thor, the old you died. What remains
is a poor facsimile of the rational human being which existed before.
Cryonic backup restores you to life, to fight against Thor, in revenge for
taking possession of one of your bodies (of course you want to call all of
your other bodies to help you - all of you have to stick together to beat up
guys who try to take over one of you).

Is it coherent? :-)

Samantha,
       Did you originally write that -- in any case I agree.  However, the 
various socialists have been allowed too often to take the discussion to too 
high a level of discussion IMHO.  The problem with the highly abstract and 
the concrete in the case of socialism is that when socialism gets to the 
concrete it has a two hundred year history of total failure and worse of 
human tragedy & repression.  Taken to the concrete it has a long history of 
not even being a respectable approach to government.  We cannot not pay lip 
service to respecting a way of governing that has repeatedly murdered tens of 
millions of its own citizenry.

But it's useful to consider what portions of the socialist agenda were 
adopted, and why.  Most of the time at least one of the effects was to 
increas the power of whoever was in charge of making the decision.  It 
didn't always happen that way, but that usually appeared to be an 
expectable consequence.

E.g., "The Great Society" was one of Lyndon Johnson's attempts to 
increase his popularity.  It worked pretty well until he squandered it 
by bogging down in Vietnam.  Johnson wasn't a particularly likeable 
person, but he knew the value of pork-barrel.  He just ran afoul of the 
fact that people don't like to be drafted.  (Nobody was ever, to my 
knowledge, able to explain sensibly why we ended up in that Vietnam 
imbroglio.  And you can't sell a war if you can't explain it in vivid 
emotional terms.)

Exactly. My backup then became a record of someone other than me. 

I maintain that more subtle changes in personality occur at each moment,
such that the "old you" dies with each passing moment.

Yes. :) 

And if my backup were to be restored prior to my death then I might
actually find myself in mortal combat with him, in Thor's name of
course.

"It seems to me that you keep ducking *my* question, or my insinuations, at
least:  isn't it true that you *are* the same person that you were yesterday
despite the fact that there are small differences between you?  And if you
agree to that, then you
can see why logically I can consider myself to be the same person as a close
duplicate."

Ahh, it has been a couple months since we had this discussion.  I still find
it difficult to understand how people can assert that a copy of you is you.
gts may at the same time consider himself the same person as he was a few
minutes ago while considering himself a different person than a copy made a
few minutes ago and still be logically consistent.  You said "And if you
agree to that, then you can see why logically I can consider myself to be
the same person as a close duplicate"  But gts is made up of the same atoms,
molecules, and nuerons in the same pattern performing the same functions as
gts t-10s was.  However, a duplicate of gts is made up of entirely different
atoms, molecules, and nuerons, even though they are in the same pattern.  

Imagine this thought experiment.  You walk into a room, a non-destructive
scanner copies you and creates a duplicate, now you and your duplicate are
isolated.  Can you see, feel, hear, taste anything that your duplicate can?
If you think you can, then you are indeed the same person in two different
places, but this hardly seems logical.  If you think you cant, then you are
two seperate persons in seperate places, albiet persons that are identical.
However, since everything you experience is now seperate, the you in the
other room is a different person.  If it is a kept a secret who is the
original and who is the copy, then no test can tell them apart.  But just
because no one can tell who the original is, does not mean there wasnt an
original in the first place.

I consdier there to be three parts to a person

1) the pattern of his molecules / atoms

If we took our brain and put it into a blender, we still have the same
atoms, but no person, so the pattern is important

2) the molecules / atoms that make up his pattern

If we took different molecules / atoms and put them into the same pattern
(copying) then the person behaves identical to the original, but can not
sense, feel, what the original feels when sensorly isolated.  Therefore they
are different persons, and the atoms that we are made up of are important.
Destroying the original does not change this.

3) the rate of change of those molecules / atoms in that part are orders of
magnitude smaller than the total atoms / molecules that make up the pattern,
so at any given time the vast majority of the molecules and atoms that make
up your pattern are the same as the ones at the instant before. 

If none of our atoms are replaced, we remain the same person (same pattern,
same atoms) if all are replaced, we are a different person (same pattern,
different atoms, different subjective experience).  If only one atom were
changed per second, then the vast majority of our atoms in our pattern are
the same as the second before.  It seems reasonable that if the rate of
replacement is kept significantly low (whatever the existing natural rate
is, say .001% of nuerons are replaced each day) than at any given instant
the vast majority of you (99.999%) is the same atoms and pattern as you were
the instant before.  

Our brains are in a constant state of change, we are not made up of the same
atoms today that we were made up of 1 year ago, yet we still consider
ourselves to be the same person as we were a year ago (albiet with some new
bits).  Does this mean that we are justified in saying that a copy is me,
because just as the atoms in our brains change over time to eventually all
be replaced, a copy merely replaces all of those atoms at once.  I think
logically the significant difference is that in one case all of the atoms
are replaced, thus none of the molecules and atoms that make up your pattern
were the same ones that made up your pattern the instant before.  It is
clear from case 2) that the molecules are important to the subjective you,
to your continual perception of concioussness, because in a different group
of molecules with the same atoms seperated sensory experiences occur.
Replaceing All of your atoms in your pattern is a far different effect than
replacing less than all, or less than 1 millionth of them.  As in ANY case
other then replacing them all, that vast majority of atoms that make up your
pattern are the same ones that were making up your pattern the instant
before.

I, for one, will not ever walk into a destructive copying or uploading
mechamism, as this will surely lead to my demise.  If I were to persue
uploading, I would prefer a few nuerons be replaced at a time, at a rate
near or less the normal background replacement rate of the atoms that make
up my pattern.  If I were to persue distributed backups, I would create
other nuerons that are linked to mine at the same or slower rate than they
are naturally replaced.  If my pattern were distributed amongst multiple
groups of atoms in that particular pattern at any given time, then the
destruction of one (as long as it were a minority of the overall group)
would not lead me to consider myself a different person.  Thus uploading and
distributed backups are both possible while retaining a continuity of
conscioussness with logically sound perception that you are still the same
you.

GTS, I believe Harvey, myself, and a few others seem to be the rare
defenders of this position (that a copy is not me and were I destroyed and
copied, I would still be dead)  Last time it came up it was even mentioned
that being destroyed and copied is no different from going to sleep and
waking up.  I would hardly considers these similiar, as one involves a
complete destruction of you, and the other does not.  'How do you know you
are the same person when you wake up that you were when you went to sleep'
was the question I believe.  Such questioning seems to ignore basic
principles in science such as parsimony and occam's razor.  I am reasonable
in assuming I am the same person because a) my atoms are the same b) my
pattern is the same C) there is no destructive scanner copying machine in my
room that I wake up out of

Charles,
       Let me wander out in left field for a moment and I promise to come 
back to home plate.  <G>
       Admiral James Stockdale was the Navy fighter pilot that responded when 
our destroyer was attacked in the Bay of Tonkin.
       In addition to later being a long term prisoner of war of the North 
Vietnamese, Admiral Stockdale ran for Vice President of the United States and 
authored at least two books.
       In one of those books Admiral Stockdale recounts his missions in 
support of our ship when the report of the attack came in.
       To put it briefly there was never a report of an actual attack, there 
were no ships in the area except ours, he also says the night was perfect for 
spotting ships or patrol boats and that Johnson put up the whole deal.
       I suggest you read Admiral Stockdale's account it is very enlightening.

### As a person friendly to you, I'd see Thor's servant as merely a case of
demonic possession, a creature formed by the destruction of your personality
and inhabiting your body, most likely using nanotechnological brain rewiring
techniques, because I cannot imagine how you, gts/2002, could ever become a
servant of Thor by non-invasive or spontaneous change. I'd assist in
defrosting your backup, and together we'd teach Thor a lesson.

Yeah, once the Stormfronters start uploading we'll see a lot of them running
about with funny Nordic names, but they won't last long if they mess with
the wrong folks.

No it is not true. And I did not duck your question. I answered your
question directly in a previous message, with words something like
"Strictly speaking, I am not the person I was last week." (You were
arguing that such a position would allow me to break promises by
attributing them to past selves, which spawned an interesting discussion
of promises between Dan and me. Have you not been reading this thread?)

In any case I consider the notion of "fixed personality" false.
Furthermore I consider this belief to be a source of much misery. As a
result of this false belief people tend to live too much in the past. 

While it is convenient for us to speak as though we are each the same
person on each passing day, this is I believe only a social convention
and a convenience of language. A person who believes he *really* is the
same person who made his past mistakes will tend to ruminate about those
mistakes and feel inadequate because of them. Similarly, a person who
dwells on his past successes will tend to become egocentric and
narcissistic. It is much healthier, psychologically, to live in the
present with an eye toward the future. Forget the past. The past is dead
along with your past selves.

Well, I don't agree with that.

The difference between me becoming a devoted servant of Thor and me
changing my favorite flavor of ice cream is only one of degree. In both
cases the old me died after making my last backup. 

Subtle changes in personality happen every day in response to daily
events. For example I am right now rethinking my views on gun control as
a result of the sniper shootings in the Washington area. Regardless of
how I might decide to interpret these events, my attitude about gun
control laws will be likely be affected at least slightly. And tomorrow
there will no doubt be other events that result in more changes to my
personality. Personality grows and changes with each passing moment. In
fact it probably changes even in response to the events in our nightly
dreams.

"of value"? Yes, I suppose that backup is "of value" to me in a
philosophical sense. I would like to know that if I die, someone similar
to me will live on.  I would value that backup in a manner analogous to
the way in which a father values his son, though with greater intensity
due to the closer relation. I would consider my restored backup to be my
progeny.

But will that restored backup really be me, the person who experienced
the thrill and terror of the helicopter ride? No.

2002 AA29 has a somewhat troublesome inclination; while the orbit is 
close to the Earth's in period and eccentricity, it is tilted by ten 
degrees. To shift the angular momentum vector by ten degrees is likely 
messy. We would have to add a torque, and it would likely be harder to 
do than get a coplanar asteroid to get into a capture orbit. On the 
positive side it would likely be fairly easy to get it into a 
quasi-satellite orbit, which is nearly as good as the real thing. The 
delta-vee to get there would be practically the same as to get to the 
Moon and there would be no risk for collision. It would just be a tad 
too distant for weekend access.

The test for equivalence is to exchange the objects (or people) and see if
there is any change. If external observers can not tell if the exchange
actually happened and if the people directly involved can not tell either
then they are equivalent and although there are two bodies there is only one
person at that instant.

I'm looking for a roommate to share a room for the conference in
November.  I am staying on Friday, Sat and Sunday nights at the
conference hotel, and I will make the arrangements, all I need is a
name.

Preference will be given to anyone who can share all three days, to those
who prefer to party in *other* peoples rooms (which is where *I* plan to
party), and to those who don't snore.  It is a non-smoking room.  I have a
possible for just Friday and Saturday, but I really need someone who can
share Sunday as well, since I am trying to do this on the cheap.

I'm glad to see I'm not the only one. :)

The closest I can come to believing anything remotely similar would
involve an instantaneous destructive teleportation, as mentioned here
previously (by Jef Allbright, I think). 

It would not be necessary that my actual atoms be transported to another
location. There is an equivalency principle of physics that states that
subatomic particles of the same type are identical, e.g., one electron
is identical to any other electron. (In fact, according to one theory
there is only one electron in the entire universe, but I digress.) 

If subatomic particles at the destination location could be assembled in
the exact states as those that comprise me at the origin location,
instantaneously and destructively such that I vanish here and appear
there in the same instant, then I see at least a faint possibility that
my sense of self might live on in that teleported duplicate. I think the
teleportation process would need to take place in less than the shortest
meaningful division of time, which is the time it takes for a photon to
traverse one Planck length -- a very, very short time interval. 

The above assumes of course the truth of my materialist view of
consciousness as an entirely physical phenomenon. If materialism is
wrong then we're ghostly spirits potentially capable of all manner of
weirdness.

But in this case there are changes if we exchange the objects, even if
they are very small changes. The differences can be detected objectively
by those who might make very accurate measurements, and subjectively by
the persons themselves who might make very accurate self-assessments.

That is not the only test for equivalence.  If you claim that they are only
one person, then by necessity they should share the same sensory input.  If
we were to separate the two bodies we would find they experience different
sensory input.  E.g., one can not see what the other sees.  Thus the only
possible explanation is that they are two bodies and two people.  How can
you assert that they are only one person when they clearly do not share the
same simultaneous subjective consciousness.

Friends,

I will be sending the standard Getty Announcement this weekend, but I
wanted to get information off to you all soonest.

The sky is getting darker sooner, as seems to be the yearly habit of the
sun, the moon, and the earth's twirl.  Last month, we kibitzed in the dark
while some of you headed off to the concert.  As always, it was enjoyable
conversation, but in order to make it more personal - so that we can
actually see each other - I thought it would be better to meet earlier
during the fall and winter months.

There will be no Getty Salon in October. The November Getty will on
Saturday, November 2nd at 4:00.  (This gives us 2 hours of light.)

Getty new calendar mantra is:

Be flexible.  Put it in pencil and then in pen.
Be creative.  Imagine it in dreams and then in the head.

>!

Best,
Natasha

A perfectly synched copy of you is you. Because there is no measurable

If there was no bifurcation both copies think exactly the same thing at 
the same time. If they don't, they're obviously not copies.

I thought we were talking about in machina models. There is no way to make
perfect copies of life animals, and to keep them synched without
trajectory forcing via heavy instrumentation with nanoware.
 
I'm not going to read and reply to the rest of it. Read The Fine Manual.

While I heard similiar claims (never substantiated) I don't think
asymmetric ablation by barraging the rubble pile with tens thousands of
micronukes detonated at some ~100 m height will be ineffective. Especially
if this is a dirty snowball.

If it isn't, you can just enmesh the rubble pile into a carbon fiber net,
and let it be pulled off-course by an ion drive array.

The problem is not propulsion. The problem is detecting the damn things 
sufficiently early, and to get your hardware there on time to deflect. It 
may well require a nuke drive to get there on time.

To be really pedantic (but also precise) for a moment - I think the original
poster should have had "why anarcho-capitalism is a contradiction in terms"
. *Not* the same thing as an oxymoron! Thinking of it that way also makes it
easier to see what the argument is about, i.e. it's about the definition of
the two constituent terms "anarchy" and "capitalism". Either or both of
these can be defined in a way that makes their conjunction  a CIT but if so
you should be explicit and honest that that's what you're doing. Steve

"A perfectly synched copy of you is you. Because there is no measurable 
difference between them, by definition."

If a perfectly synched copy of me is me, then how come my copy would not
experience the same sensory information that I experience?  Dont I
experience all the sensory input that I experience?  Would I then see, hear,
and feel what my copy feels?  If not, then that copy is not me, it is
someone else who thinks they are me.  

Just because there is no measurable difference between two sub atomic
particles, does not mean they are the *same* sub-atomic particle, does it?
What if two electrons have the same mass, same spin, same momentum, etc.
etc. etc.  Are they the 'same' electrons, or do they have an existence
independant of one another, and are merely identical?

No measurable difference does not mean that two entities are one, only that
they are identical.

Michael

Okay, in that case we might say that a coffee cup is a garbage truck, if
"the ability to contain" is the only property we deem relevant. I can
see how such thinking might be useful for some purposes, but
unfortunately it does not change the fact that a coffee cup is not a
garbage truck.

Exactly.

If we do decide to go down that road then we would need to agree that
personal beliefs and attitudes are relevant in defining a person. I
think we can agree on that much. But that takes us back to my personal
inventory method of checking for identity. If while describing himself A
says he likes the Beatles best while B says he likes the Stones best,
then A is not B even if they are in every other respect identical. And
that is exactly the sort of personality difference that can arise as a

I don't think so. A true duplicate would describe himself in exactly the
same way as his original and have exactly the same idea of what is
relevant to his identity. To use Eugene's word, they would be "synched"
in every way. But complete synchronization is not possible due to the
different sensory inputs of the original and his xox. 

If Lee wants to be (almost) in two places at one time then he needs to
project his sensory apparatus while maintaining his one original
brain/mind as the instrument that cognizes his perceptions. He needs
something analogous to a periscope.

Rules for a Complex Quantum World

An exciting new fundamental discipline of research combines information science 
and quantum mechanics

By Michael A. Nielsen

Over the past few decades, scientists have learned that simple rules can give 
rise to very rich behavior. A good example is chess. Imagine you're an 
experienced chess player introduced to someone claiming to know the game. You 
play a few times and realize that although this person knows the rules of chess, 
he has no idea how to play well. He makes absurd moves, sacrificing his queen 
for a pawn and losing a rook for no reason at all. He does not truly understand 
chess: he is ignorant of the high-level principles and heuristics familiar to 
any knowledgeable player. These principles are collective or emergent properties 
of chess, features not immediately evident from the rules but arising from 
interactions among the pieces on the chessboard.

Scientists' current understanding of quantum mechanics is like that of a 
slow-learning student of chess. We've known the rules for more than 70 years, 
and we have a few clever moves that work in some special situations, but we're 
only gradually learning the high-level principles needed to play a skillful 
overall game.

The discovery of these principles is the goal of quantum information science, a 
fundamental field that is opening up in response to a new way of comprehending 
the world. Many articles about quantum information science focus on 
technological applications: research groups "teleport" quantum states from one 
location to another. Other physicists use quantum states to create cryptographic 
keys that are absolutely secure from eavesdropping. Information scientists 
devise algorithms for hypothetical quantum-mechanical computers, much faster 
than the best known algorithms for conventional, or classical, computers [see 
www.sciam.com for past Scientific American articles related to these developments].

These technologies are fascinating, but they obscure the fact that they are a 
by-product of investigations into deep new scientific questions. Applications 
such as quantum teleportation play a role similar to the steam engines and other 
machines that spurred the development of thermodynamics in the 18th and 19th 
centuries. Thermodynamics was motivated by profound, basic questions about how 
energy, heat and temperature are related, the transformations among these 
quantities in physical processes, and the key role of entropy. Similarly, 
quantum information scientists are fathoming the relation between classical and 
quantum units of information, the novel ways that quantum information can be 
processed, and the pivotal importance of a quantum feature called entanglement, 
which entails peculiar connections between different objects.

Popular accounts often present entanglement as an all-or-nothing property in 
which quantum particles are either entangled or not. Quantum information science 
has revealed that entanglement is a quantifiable physical resource, like energy, 
that enables information-processing tasks: some systems have a little 
entanglement; others have a lot. The more entanglement available, the better 
suited a system is to quantum information processing. Furthermore, researchers 
have begun to develop powerful quantitative laws of entanglement (analogous to 
the laws of thermodynamics governing energy), which provide a set of high-level 
principles for understanding the behavior of entanglement and describing how we 
can use it to do information processing.

Quantum information science is new enough that researchers are still coming to 
grips with its very nature, and they disagree about which questions lie at its 
heart. This article presents my personal view that the central goal of quantum 
information science is to develop general principles, like the laws of 
entanglement, that will enable us to understand complexity in quantum systems.

Complexity and Quanta
Numerous studies in complexity concentrate on systems such as the weather or 
piles of sand that are described by classical physics rather than quantum 
physics. That focus is natural because complex systems are usually macroscopic, 
containing many constituent parts, and most systems lose their quantum nature as 
their size is increased. This quantum-to-classical transition occurs because 
large quantum systems generally interact strongly with their environment, 
causing a process of decoherence, which destroys the system's quantum properties 
[see "100 Years of Quantum Mysteries," by Max Tegmark and John A. Wheeler; 
Scientific American, February 2001].

As an example of decoherence, think of Erwin Schroedinger's famous cat inside a 
box. In principle, the cat ends up in a weird quantum state, somewhere between 
dead and alive; it makes no sense to describe it as either one or the other. In 
a real experiment, however, the cat interacts with the box by exchange of light, 
heat and sound, and the box similarly interacts with the rest of the world. In 
nanoseconds, these processes destroy the delicate quantum states inside the box 
and replace them with states describable, to a good approximation, by the laws 
of classical physics. The cat inside really is either alive or dead, not in some 
mysterious nonclassical state that combines the two.

The key to seeing truly quantum behavior in a complex system is to isolate the 
system extremely well from the rest of the world, preventing decoherence and 
preserving fragile quantum states. This isolation is relatively easy to achieve 
with small systems, such as atoms suspended in a magnetic trap in a vacuum, but 
is much more difficult with the larger ones in which complex behavior may be 
found. Accidental laboratory discoveries of remarkable phenomena such as 
superconductivity and the quantum Hall effect are examples in which physicists 
have achieved large, well-isolated quantum systems. These phenomena demonstrate 
that the simple rules of quantum mechanics can give rise to emergent principles 
governing complex behaviors.

Resources and Tasks
We attempt to understand the high-level principles that govern in those rare 
instances when the quantum and the complex meet by abstracting, adapting and 
extending tools from classical information theory. Last year Benjamin W. 
Schumacher of Kenyon College proposed that the essential elements of information 
science, both classical and quantum, can be summarized as a three-step procedure:

1. Identify a physical resource. A familiar classical example is a string of 
bits. Although bits are often thought of as abstract entities--0's and 1's--all 
information is inevitably encoded in real physical objects, and thus a string of 
bits should be regarded as a physical resource.

2. Identify an information-processing task that can be performed using the 
physical resource of step 1. A classical example is the two-part task of 
compressing the output from an information source (for example, the text in a 
book) into a bit string and then decompressing it--that is, recovering the 
original information from the compressed bit string.

3. Identify a criterion for successful completion of the task of step 2. In our 
example, the criterion could be that the output from the decompression stage 
perfectly matches the input to the compression stage.

The fundamental question of information science is then "What is the minimal 
quantity of the physical resource (1) we need to perform the 
information-processing task (2) in compliance with the success criterion (3)?" 
Although this question does not quite capture all of information science, it 
provides a powerful lens through which to view much research in the field [see box].

The data-compression example corresponds to a basic question of classical 
information science--namely, what is the minimum number of bits needed to store 
the information produced by some source? This problem was solved by Claude E. 
Shannon in his famous 1948 papers founding information theory. In so doing, 
Shannon quantified the information content produced by an information source, 
defining it to be the minimum number of bits needed to reliably store the output 
of the source. His mathematical expression for the information content is now 
known as the Shannon entropy.

Shannon's entropy arises as the answer to a simple, fundamental question about 
classical information processing. It is perhaps not surprising, then, that 
studying the properties of the Shannon entropy has proved fruitful in analyzing 
processes far more complex than data compression. For example, it plays a 
central role in calculating how much information can be transmitted reliably 
through a noisy communications channel and even in understanding phenomena such 
as gambling and the behavior of the stock market. A general theme in information 
science is that questions about elementary processes lead to unifying concepts 
that stimulate insight into more complex processes.

In quantum information science, all three elements of Schumacher's list take on 
new richness. What novel physical resources are available in quantum mechanics? 
What information-processing tasks can we hope to perform? What are appropriate 
criteria for success? The resources now include superposition states, like the 
idealized alive and dead cat of Schroedinger. The processes can involve 
manipulations of entanglement (mysterious quantum correlations) between widely 
separated objects. The criteria of success become more subtle than in the 
classical case, because to extract the result of a quantum 
information-processing task we must observe, or measure, the system--which 
almost inevitably changes it, destroying the special superposition states that 
are unique to quantum physics.

Qubits
Quantum information science begins by generalizing the fundamental resource of 
classical information--bits--to quantum bits, or qubits. Just as bits are ideal 
objects abstracted from the principles of classical physics, qubits are ideal 
quantum objects abstracted from the principles of quantum mechanics. Bits can be 
represented by magnetic regions on disks, voltages in circuitry, or graphite 
marks made by a pencil on paper. The functioning of these classical physical 
states as bits does not depend on the details of how they are realized. 
Similarly, the properties of a qubit are independent of its specific physical 
representation as the spin of an atomic nucleus, say, or the polarization of a 
photon of light.

A bit is described by its state, 0 or 1. Likewise, a qubit is described by its 
quantum state. Two possible quantum states for a qubit correspond to the 0 and 1 
of a classical bit. In quantum mechanics, however, any object that has two 
different states necessarily has a range of other possible states, called 
superpositions, which entail both states to varying degrees. The allowed states 
of a qubit are precisely all those states that must be available, in principle, 
to a classical bit that is transplanted into a quantum world. Qubit states 
correspond to points on the surface of a sphere, with the 0 and 1 being the 
south and north poles [see box]. The continuum of states between 0 and 1 fosters 
many of the extraordinary properties of quantum information.

How much classical information can we store in a qubit? One line of reasoning 
suggests the amount is infinite: To specify a quantum state we need to specify 
the latitude and longitude of the corresponding point on the sphere, and in 
principle each may be given to arbitrary precision. These numbers can encode a 
long string of bits. For example, 011101101... could be encoded as a state with 
latitude 01 degrees, 11 minutes and 01.101... seconds.

This reasoning, though plausible, is incorrect. One can encode an infinite 
amount of classical information in a single qubit, but one can never retrieve 
that information from the qubit. The simplest attempt to read the qubit's state, 
a standard direct measurement of it, will give a result of either 0 or 1, south 
pole or north pole, with the probability of each outcome determined by the 
latitude of the original state. You could have chosen a different measurement, 
perhaps using the "Melbourne-Azores Islands" axis instead of north-south, but 
again only one bit of information would have been extracted, albeit one governed 
by probabilities with a different dependence on the state's latitude and 
longitude. Whichever measurement you choose erases all the information in the 
qubit except for the single bit that the measurement uncovers.

The principles of quantum mechanics prevent us from ever extracting more than a 
single bit of information, no matter how cleverly we encode the qubit or how 
ingeniously we measure it afterward. This surprising result was proved in 1973 
by Alexander S. Holevo of the Steklov Mathematical Institute in Moscow, 
following a 1964 conjecture by J. P. Gordon of AT&T Bell Laboratories. It is as 
though the qubit contains hidden information that we can manipulate but not 
access directly. A better viewpoint, however, is to regard this hidden 
information as being a unit of quantum information rather than an infinite 
number of inaccessible classical bits.

Notice how this example follows Schumacher's paradigm for information science. 
Gordon and Holevo asked how many qubits (the physical resource) are required to 
store a given amount of classical information (the task) in such a way that the 
information can be reliably recovered (the criterion for success). Furthermore, 
to answer this question, they introduced a mathematical concept, now known as 
the Holevo chi (represented by the Greek letter chi), that has since been used 
to simplify the analysis of more complex phenomena, similar to the 
simplifications enabled by Shannon's entropy. For example, Michal Horodecki of 
the University of Gdansk in Poland has shown that the Holevo chi can be used to 
analyze the problem of compressing quantum states produced by a quantum 
information source, which is analogous to the classical data compression 
considered by Shannon.

Entangled States
Single qubits are interesting, but more fascinating behavior arises when several 
qubits are brought together. A key feature of quantum information science is the 
understanding that groups of two or more quantum objects can have states that 
are entangled. These entangled states have properties fundamentally unlike 
anything in classical physics and are coming to be thought of as an essentially 
new type of physical resource that can be used to perform interesting tasks.

Schroedinger was so impressed by entanglement that in a seminal 1935 paper (the 
same year that he introduced his cat to the world) he called it "not one but 
rather the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics, the one that enforces its 
entire departure from classical lines of thought." The members of an entangled 
collection of objects do not have their own individual quantum states. Only the 
group as a whole has a well-defined state [see box]. This phenomenon is much 
more peculiar than a superposition state of a single particle. Such a particle 
does have a well-defined quantum state even though that state may superpose 
different classical states.
Entangled quantum systems behave in ways impossible in any classical world.

Entangled objects behave as if they were connected with one another no matter 
how far apart they are--distance does not attenuate entanglement in the 
slightest. If something is entangled with other objects, a measurement of it 
simultaneously provides information about its partners. It is easy to be misled 
into thinking that one could use entanglement to send signals faster than the 
speed of light, in violation of Einstein's special relativity, but the 
probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics stymies such efforts.

Despite its strangeness, for a long time entanglement was regarded as a 
curiosity and was mostly ignored by physicists. This changed in the 1960s, when 
John S. Bell of CERN, the European laboratory for particle physics near Geneva, 
predicted that entangled quantum states allow crucial experimental tests that 
distinguish between quantum mechanics and classical physics. Bell predicted, and 
experimenters have confirmed, that entangled quantum systems exhibit behavior 
that is impossible in a classical world--impossible even if one could change the 
laws of physics to try to emulate the quantum predictions within a classical 
framework of any sort! Entanglement represents such an essentially novel feature 
of our world that even experts find it very difficult to think about. Although 
one can use the mathematics of quantum theory to reason about entanglement, as 
soon as one falls back on analogies, there is a great danger that the classical 
basis of our analogies will mislead us.

In the early 1990s the idea that entanglement falls wholly outside the scope of 
classical physics prompted researchers to ask whether entanglement might be 
useful as a resource for solving information-processing problems in new ways. 
The answer was yes. The flood of examples began in 1991, when Artur K. Ekert of 
the University of Cambridge showed how to use entanglement to distribute 
cryptographic keys impervious to eavesdropping. In 1992 Charles H. Bennett of 
IBM and Stephen Wiesner of Tel Aviv University showed that entanglement can 
assist the sending of classical information from one location to another (a 
process called superdense coding, in which two bits are transferred on a 
particle that seems to have room to carry only one). In 1993 an international 
team of six collaborators explained how to teleport a quantum state from one 
location to another using entanglement. An explosion of further applications 
followed.

Weighing Entanglement
As with individual qubits, which can be represented by many different physical 
objects, entanglement also has properties independent of its physical 
representation. For practical purposes, it may be more convenient to work with 
one system or another, but in principle it does not matter. For example, one 
could perform quantum cryptography with an entangled photon pair or an entangled 
pair of atomic nuclei or even a photon and a nucleus entangled together.

Representation independence suggests a thought-provoking analogy between 
entanglement and energy. Energy obeys the laws of thermodynamics regardless of 
whether it is chemical energy, nuclear energy or any other form. Could a general 
theory of entanglement be developed along similar lines to the laws of 
thermodynamics?

This hope was greatly bolstered in the second half of the 1990s, when 
researchers showed that different forms of entanglement are qualitatively 
equivalent--the entanglement of one state could be transferred to another, 
similar to energy flowing from, say, a battery charger to a battery. Building on 
these qualitative relations, researchers have begun introducing quantitative 
measures of entanglement. These developments are ongoing, and researchers have 
not yet agreed as to the best way of quantifying entanglement. The most 
successful scheme thus far is based on the notion of a standard unit of 
entanglement, akin to a standard unit of mass or energy [see box].

This approach works analogously to measuring masses by using a balance. The mass 
of an object is defined by how many copies of the standard mass are needed to 
balance it on a set of scales. Quantum information scientists have developed a 
theoretical "entanglement balance" to compare the entanglement in two different 
states. The amount of entanglement in a state is defined by seeing how many 
copies of some fixed standard unit of entanglement are needed to balance it. 
Notice that this method of quantifying entanglement is another example of the 
fundamental question of information science. We have identified a physical 
resource (copies of our entangled state) and a task with a criterion for 
success. We define our measure of entanglement by asking how much of our 
physical resource we need to do our task successfully.

The quantitative measures of entanglement developed by following this program 
are proving enormously useful as unifying concepts in the description of a wide 
range of phenomena. Entanglement measures improve how researchers can analyze 
tasks such as quantum teleportation and algorithms on quantum-mechanical 
computers. The analogy with energy helps again: to understand processes such as 
chemical reactions or the operation of an engine, we study the flow of energy 
between different parts of the system and determine how the energy must be 
constrained at various locations and times. In a similar way, we can analyze the 
flow of entanglement from one subsystem to another required to perform a quantum 
information-processing task and so obtain constraints on the resources needed to 
perform the task.

The development of the theory of entanglement is an example of a bottom-up 
approach--starting from simple questions about balancing entanglement, we 
gradually gain insight into more complex phenomena. In contrast, in a few cases, 
people have divined extremely complex phenomena through a great leap of insight, 
allowing quantum information science to proceed from the top down. The most 
celebrated example is an algorithm for quickly finding the prime factors of a 
composite integer on a quantum computer, formulated in 1994 by Peter W. Shor of 
AT&T Bell Labs. On a classical computer, the best algorithms known take 
exponentially more resources to factor larger numbers. A 500-digit number needs 
100 million times as many computational steps as a 250-digit number. The cost of 
Shor's algorithm rises only polynomially--a 500-digit number takes only eight 
times as many steps as a 250-digit number.

Shor's algorithm is a further example of the basic paradigm (how much 
computational time is needed to find the factors of an n-bit integer?), but the 
algorithm appears isolated from most other results of quantum information 
science [see box]. At first glance, it looks like merely a clever programming 
trick with little fundamental significance. That appearance is deceptive; 
researchers have shown that Shor's algorithm can be interpreted as an instance 
of a procedure for determining the energy levels of a quantum system, a process 
that is more obviously fundamental. As time goes on and we fill in more of the 
map, it should become easier to grasp the principles underlying Shor's and other 
quantum algorithms and, one hopes, to develop new algorithms.

One final application, quantum error correction, provides the best evidence to 
date that quantum information science is a useful framework for studying the 
world. Quantum states are delicate, easily destroyed by stray interactions, or 
noise, so schemes to counteract these disturbances are essential.

Classical computation and communications have a well-developed assortment of 
error-correcting codes to protect information against the depredations of noise. 
A simple example is the repetition code [see box]. This scheme represents the 
bit 0 as a string of three bits, 000, and the bit 1 as a string of three bits, 
111. If the noise is relatively weak, it may sometimes flip one of the bits in a 
triplet, changing, for instance, 000 to 010, but it will flip two bits in a 
triplet far less often. Whenever we encounter 010 (or 100 or 001), we can be 
almost certain the correct value is 000, or 0. More complex generalizations of 
this idea provide very good error-correcting codes to protect classical information.

Quantum Error Correction
Initially it appeared to be impossible to develop codes for quantum error 
correction because quantum mechanics forbids us from learning with certainty the 
unknown state of a quantum object--the obstacle, again, of trying to extract 
more than one bit from a qubit. The simple classical triplet code therefore 
fails because one cannot examine each copy of a qubit and see that one copy must 
be discarded without ruining each and every copy in the process. Worse still, 
making the copies in the first place is nontrivial: quantum mechanics forbids 
taking an unknown qubit and reliably making a duplicate, a result known as the 
no-cloning theorem.
Quantum error correction might improve the precision of the world's best clocks.

The situation looked bleak in the mid-1990s, when prominent physicists such as 
the late Rolf Landauer of IBM wrote skeptical articles pointing out that quantum 
error correction would be necessary for quantum computation but that the 
standard classical techniques could not be used in the quantum world. The field 
owes a great debt to Landauer's skepticism for pointing out problems of this 
type that had to be overcome [see "Riding the Back of Electrons," by Gary Stix; 
Profile, Scientific American, September 1998].

Happily, clever ideas developed independently by Shor and Andrew M. Steane of 
the University of Oxford in 1995 showed how to do quantum error correction 
without ever learning the states of the qubits or needing to clone them. As with 
the triplet code, each value is represented by a set of qubits. These qubits are 
passed through a circuit (the quantum analogue of logic gates) that will 
successfully fix an error in any one of the qubits without actually "reading" 
what all the individual states are. It is as if one ran the triplet 010 through 
a circuit that could spot that the middle bit was different and flip it, all 
without determining the identity of any of the three bits.

Quantum error-correcting codes are a triumph of science. Something that 
brilliant people thought could not be done--protecting quantum states against 
the effects of noise--was accomplished using a combination of concepts from 
information science and basic quantum mechanics. These techniques have now 
received preliminary confirmation in experiments conducted at Los Alamos 
National Laboratory, IBM and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and more 
extensive experiments are planned.

Quantum error correction has also stimulated many exciting new ideas. For 
example, the world's best clocks are currently limited by quantum-mechanical 
noise; researchers are asking whether the precision of those clocks can be 
improved by using quantum error correction. Another idea, proposed by Alexei 
Kitaev of the California Institute of Technology, is that some physical systems 
might possess a type of natural noise tolerance. Those systems would in effect 
use quantum error correction without human intervention and might show 
extraordinary inherent resilience against decoherence.

We have explored how quantum information science progresses from fundamental 
questions to build up an understanding of more complex systems. What does the 
future hold? By following Schumacher's program, we will surely obtain novel 
insights into the information-processing capabilities of the universe. Perhaps 
the methods of quantum information science will even yield insights into systems 
not traditionally thought of as information-processing systems. For instance, 
condensed matter exhibits complex phenomena such as high-temperature 
superconductivity and the fractional quantum Hall effect. Quantum properties 
such as entanglement are involved, but their role is currently unclear. By 
applying what we have learned from quantum information science, we may greatly 
enhance our skills in the ongoing chess match with the complex quantum universe.

The Identity of Indiscernibles is a principle of analytic ontology first
explicitly formulated by Wilhelm Gottfried Leibniz in his Discourse on
Metaphysics, Section 9 (Loemker 1969: 308). It states that no two distinct
substances exactly resemble each other. This is often referred to as
'Leibniz's Law' and is typically understood to mean that no two objects have
exactly the same properties. The Identity of Indiscernibles is of interest
because it raises questions about the factors which individuate
qualitatively identical objects. Recent work on the interpretation of
quantum mechanics suggests that the principle fails in the quantum domain.

'To see a world in a grain of sand'

In this essay, I argue that solid state physics --
historically the study of silicon, semiconductors 
and sand grains -- can give surprisingly deep insights 
into the big questions of the world.

Two physical objects in the same quantum state are provably 
indistinguishable. Okay? If they weren't, e.g. the equilibrium equation 
wouldn't be true.

Please stop speculating. You cannot win, as we're talking definitions 
here. If your two personae are distinguishable, they're distinct. By 
definition.

It's seems I may have heard somewhere that there are no two subatomic
particles that are the same? So it seems that any copy of yourself would
theoretically be different, but I'm not sure how that would apply to your

I'd find a context in which "being a container" is the only relevant
property positively perverse! :)

Nonetheless, I can think of a variety of circumstances in which we might
say that a garbage truck is a coffee cup, and vice versa.  I might have a
very small garbage truck (more of a toy, really) that I could use for
drinking coffee.  (I'd wash it first.)  Alternately, if the coffee cup had
wheels and an engine of some kind, we might use it for transporting
garbage.

The point of this is just in certain situations we can ignore rather
significant differences.  If my counterexamples seem unintuitive, it's
because it follows from a completely unintuitive premise: that all that we
should care to examine is the existence of instantiations of "being a
container."

This is a double-use of the word "relevant."  We have to differentiate
between the personal beliefs and attitudes which inform the context of our
language, and personal beliefs and attitudes that we might talk *about*
within our language.  The former, I agree, will always have some bearing,
but the latter may not be relevant at all for the purposes of counting.

We can draw the distinction out more clearly with an example.  You don't
believe in personal continuity over time, so we'll speak in your language
for a moment.  Consider Lee, who *does* believe that he's the same guy he
was yesterday.  Is his belief relevant in figuring out whether he really
IS the same guy he was yesterday?  No; at least, not in a language in
which persons are defined to be different people across time (due to a
metaphysical commitment to temporal parts or whatever).  Just because he
thinks he persists doesn't mean he really does.

Now consider the scenario from within a language more like Lee's, in which
people *do* persist over time (at least under ordinary circumstances).
You believe that you don't.  But is that relevant in figuring out whether
you really do persist over time?  Again, no, not in this language; in this
language, it's the "same person" at different times, as a point of
definition, regardless of what you think about the matter.

Of course, on a meta-level, *our* personal beliefs and attributes
determine which language we'll choose, but within the language, facts
about personal beliefs and attributes generally have considerably less
bearing on the situation.

Hence, an individual's personal beliefs and attitudes might *not* be
relevant for the purposes of counting in many cases.  Not to harp on the
time example, but most people find drastic changes in personality over
time compatible with the idea of a constant identity.  Some of them might
accept the claim "he's a different person now" as a "mere" metaphor, but
that's about as far as they'll go with it.  It isn't automatically the
case that a person's attitudes are relevant for counting simply because
languages are informed by contexts.

All this says is that the duplicates would agree as to whether they were
the same person; they'd find the same properties relevant, whatever those
properties might be.  This is obvious.  :)

What makes it impossible to formalize isn't the fact that there's more
than one xox and therefore more than one standard of relevance, but the
obvious fact that people disagree about what's relevant in this picture.
John Clark thinks that only scientific indiscernability is relevant;
that's fine, but it's a mere stake in the ground.  Relevance could be
staked out another way, and still be very plausible to many (most?) of us.

> But complete synchronization is not possible due to the different

Synchronization doesn't need to be "complete" if it's incomplete in
irrelevant ways.

<don't answer these questions>
You may charge that the synchronization would be incomplete in some
*important* way, but why should I take that seriously?  I'm perfectly
happy to say in Lee's terms [but only in that context] that trivial
*mis*synchronizations would even be possible, and personal identity could
*still* be maintained across duplicates.

Why should I care about trivial synch failures if I don't care about
trivial changes to my own person over time?
</don't answer these questions>

The questions have answers within your context, but the puzzle is
presenting them in a way that makes them compelling in a context in which
your criteria don't matter.  It's a Sisyphean task that I don't encourage
you to follow up on.

Some people in some contexts will call duplicates the same person.  In a
manner of speaking, they are.  In another manner of speaking, they aren't.
We can formalize on a language, but we have no special reason to pick one
over the other, and we can do all required moral reasoning without making
such a leap, so I suggest that we not do so at all.

What one must first do, however, is dispense with the idea
that the *particular* atoms have anything to do with one's
identity.  Namely, if during the next nanosecond it were
somehow possible to remove atom1 from your body and replace
it with an identical atom---and QM assures us that all atoms
of a given element excluding different isotopes are equivalent
---then I don't think that you would notice the difference.
If one does agree with me, then, that the *particular* atoms
have nothing to do with your personal identity, then the
objection you make in your last paragraph falls to the ground.

No, I certainly can not!  But then here it is assumed that
you are addressing *one* of the two, and that is what that
*one* will say.

So say you.  I contend that we are actually the same
*person*, though clearly what is to be contended is
what is meant by that construction.  (This is, of
course, the entire basis of the discussion.)

What evidence would you ever have that this is the case?
Is there any way that you can know that this is not being
done to you each millisecond in an operation that requires
only one nanosecond?  If you talked to someone who was,
in your terms, a thousand different people each second
you'd still have a very normal conversation with him.
It begins to devolve into unstable concepts to imagine
that you, or he, are a thousand different people during
an ordinary second.

But I still think that you are incorrect for the reasons I gave above.

Yet as I have said many times before, you would soon 
be in the small minority as more practical people
used teleportation to get about quickly and cheaply.
Finally, you'd be seen to be an old fogey from the
last century who had some strange hang-up about atoms.

Fine.  Even if I reduce a 5m asteroid to a 2m asteroid
if I can capture it in a controlled orbit it has
transformed itself from a hazardous mass in space
to a useful mass in space.

Yes, I understand this and clearly at the current time you
have perhaps 3 choices (a) our existing ion thrusters;
(b) our existing LH2 LOX engines; (c)  our existing LOX
and kerosene engines.  I believe the Zubrin Mars refueling
scheme was based on an as yet untested (or at least not
commonly used) fuel.

If its a hazard you don't care how much mass you have to
consume to deflect it (witness the Rafal/Eugene discussions
on whether nuclear weapons would be effective in deflection).
I'm interested in using semi-hazardous masses as a test suite
to produce useful deflection strategies and at the same time
turn the semi-hazardous masses into something useful for
space development.

What I am interested in here is whether we currently have
the means to turn hazardous mass into useful mass?  As far
as I can tell that requires knowing how much delta-v needs
to be applied to the object (including derotating it if
that is currently the situation in which it is in) and
then getting it into an orbit that allows the Earth-Moon
to capture it.

It shouldn't be too difficult to apply our current
capabilities (of ion/rocket engines) to determine the
limits of the mass of objects in relatively similar
objects that we can put into useful orbits.

Its fine to be concerned with the brakes on your motorcycle
Spike.  But you have to balance that with the possible fate
of humanity.  We are currently still Earth-bound.  The sooner
we permanently eliminate that situation the more secure the
future of humanity will be.

Hey folks, this discussion keeps twisting and turning without any apparent
increase in understanding.  There are some useful concepts in the mix, but
it has become a seemingly endless debate on definitions of what we mean by a
copy of a person. I think people can actually agree on the various concepts,
but there's confusion arising because people are choosing to use a word
differently depending on their values and the point they're trying to make.

Lee is saying that for all practical purposes, a copy of someone should be
considered to be effectively the same person. He is saying that, in general,
differences are not significant, since we routinely think of ourselves as
the same person even after many years of differences have accumulated.  This
viewpoint has interesting implications.

gts is saying that even the slightest difference between the original and
the copy means they're not the same, by definition, and the bigger the
difference, the greater the significance. This viewpoint has interesting
implications.

Please correct me if I'm wrong in my simplified assesment of the two views
but if basically correct, it might be very useful for the various parties to
agree on a common understanding of what the other means, and then proceed to
discuss the ramifications and value judgements that arise from the two
viewpoints.

It helps to acknowlede the other person's understanding, agree on some
common understanding, and then move on the differences where things get
truly interesting.

Doubtless;  but it's also news to me that the claim is imprecise.

Now dictionary.com supplies

oxymoron   Pronunciation Key  (ks-mrn, -mr-)
n. pl. oxymora (-mr, -mr) or oxymorons
A rhetorical figure in which incongruous or
contradictory terms are combined, as in a
"deafening silence" and a "mournful optimist".

[Greek oxumron, from neuter of oxumros, pointedly
foolish: oxus, sharp; see oxygen + mros, foolish, dull.]

Would you mind explaining exactly why "anarcho-capitalism"
is *not* an oxymoron given that the original poster believed
it to be a contradiction in terms?

Yes, but perhaps a little progress has been made.  And you sum
it up quite nicely:

Yes.

I too think that this is what gts believes.

My own guess is that we won't really be getting anywhere even
then.  I believe that most of philosophy, to be of any use,
must be prescriptive.  It must tell us what to do, not only
in familiar terrain, but in unexplored future possibilities
as well.

> It helps to acknowledge the other person's understanding, agree on some

> truly interesting.

Maybe.  But I propose that only by analyzing a huge number
of potential situations (thought experiments), and carefully
considering just what one would do and how one would value
each possible decision, can one approach consistency.  In
other words, inconsistencies in the other person's position
can only be uncovered by the submission of hypothetical
situations.

All one can achieve IMO is *consistency*, and a hopefully
minimum awkwardness.  It is quite awkward, for example,
to maintain that you are not the same person you were
five minutes ago, and as you say, leads to many interesting
implications (to put it mildly).  For one thing, why bother
to even try for *consistency*, if you're not even the same
person from second to second?

Thanks,
Lee

I can't speak for Steve (nobody can), but anarcho-capitalism's status
as an oxymoron or not is immaterial to the original posters
demonstrated lack of ability to comprehend commonly accepted defintions
of commonly used words.

2 meters worth has. The rest of the asteroid is now a stream of high
speed gravel and/or ions. So long as this stream is traveling faster
than solar escape velocity, this is copacetic (and so long as this
stream is not in line with Earths orbit around the sun.)

The Zubrin Mars refueling scheme entails, AFAICR, using Martian water,
CO2, and energy (nuke or solar) to manufacture hydrocarbons and either
LOX or H2O2. In the absence of water resources on Mars, which to date
are now thought to be far greater than when Zubrin first wrote his
book, the mission was going to settle on something less energetic,
which, given an, I think, .35 g gradient, should still do the trick (if
you consider how puny the rockets for the lunar lander were to get back
in orbit, and they had a 1/6th g gradient to deal with).

In addition to the three you listed, there is also the mass driver
option, which has been in development going back to O'Niel's
colonization research projects in the 70's. Use a mass driver as a
propulsion method, tossing away pieces of gravel at high velocity. No
complex chemistry, no need for chemical purity for ion engines.

That 100m pseudo-moon just discovered isn't a hazard, according to the
orbital mechanics. Every time it gets close, our own gravity sends it
spinning away again. Nor is it's eccentricity a problem, energy wise.
If you plan on using asteroid material as reaction fuel, and solar/nuke
power to electrify a mass driver propulsion system, the only earthly
energy demand is that to get this system out to this asteroid. How long
do you want to take to do this? If you put most of the equipment on a
slow gravity assist trajectory, you can send an Artemis style manned
scooter up later for fast trajectory transfer of the human crew of the
asteroid.

We do. What is lacking is the political will to use it.

Imagine a cosmic 9/11: A 100 meter asteroid, heretofore unknown by
astronomers, strikes the earth and wipes out Kennebunk, Maine, killing
thousands of the most well connected people in the country, whose
families and friends control a majority of the economic clout in the
country. How quickly do you think it will take Bush to pony up $100
billion annually for the sort of program you envision?

Natasha, I used to be in electronics manufacturing.
We breathed all manner of solvents back in the 80s,
most commonly tri-chloro-ethane.  Lots of that stuff.
We washed our hands in carbon tetrachloride more times
that I want to recall.

How do you know your cancer was caused by fumes?

What kind of efficiency rates can you get by using a small black hole for 
conversion into Hawking radiation? You ought to get half matter and half 
antimatter, right? So shouldn't be possible, theoretically (now, not 
practically) to combine them and get 100% conversion?

According to Ian Wilmut and Keith Campbell's book, "The Second Creation"

Hello everyone,

I just wanted to give a reminder about the cryonics gathering this coming Saturday and Sunday at the Creekside Preserve lodge which is located in Mayer, Arizona.  The head of Alcor, Dr. Jerry Lemler, will be the distinguished speaker.  We are giving out room discounts to those who come, and don't forget about the buffet we will be serving!

It will be a great time.  All the information you need to get here(and encourage you to come!) is below in David Pizer's Cryonet post.

best wishes,

John Grigg 

P.S. Some extropians are seen by first generation cryonicists as being overly rambunctious! lol!  At Extro-5 the craziness I heard was taking place at Spike's house was largely over by the time I got there(after the conference, dang!). : )

To all cryonicists:

The Creekside Preserve is planning an open house on Sunday, October 26th to show off our new facility.   All cryonicists are invited to a tour and complimentary buffet luncheon on Sunday afternoon.

We are hoping that in the future the Creekside Preserve will become a place of frequent cryonics and life extension meetings, conferences, celebrations, weddings, memorial services and more.  It is also our hope that the Creekside Preserve and its amenities will become part of a larger cryonics community someday, one that will include a retirement village and other opportunities for cryonics and life extension advancements.

For those of you that might want to come up Saturday evening, we will be having a fireside get-together at the firepit by the creek and a walk to our observatory.  Rooms or cabins for cryonicists will be 25% off.

                OUR FEATURED SPEAKER ON SUNDAY WILL BE DR. JERRY LEMLER,                                                 ALCOR'S CEO AND DISTINGUISHED LEADER. 

Here is an agenda:
Saturday evening = fireside discussion and social get-together.
Saturday evening = walk up to our observatory and we all look at the heavens above.

Sunday
Morning nature walk for about an hour's exercise.  
Then a tour of the property and a visit to the barn to pet and feed the horses.  
Noon to 1:00 = buffet 
1:00 Dr. Lemler will address the audience.

This is an informal event for all cryonicists of every persuasion, come up for fun and meet other cryonicists.  Perhaps, Dr. Lemler will even give us a preview of what to expect at the coming Alcor Conference in November?

                       ============================================

How to get to the Creekside Preserve, which is about an hour's drive from north Phoenix.

1.    Drive north from Phoenix on Interstate-17 (as if you were going to Flagstaff).
2.    About 40 miles or so, you come to the town of Cordes Junction.  Exit.
3.    Then go west (or northwest) on State Highway 69 (towards Prescott - but not all the way). 4.    Six miles from Cordes Junction is the Creekside Preserve on the north side of the highway.


Our phone number is 928  632-0777  (But we are not manning the phone until around October 12th).  In the meantime, please e-mail me any questions or let me know if you are expecting to come.  

Below is a list of what we have so far.
15 individual cabins that have porches that hang over the creek area.
A 9,000 square foot lodge with 4 rooms upstairs (these rooms are kinda plain).
Some cabins have Jacuzzi tubs
All cabins have fireplaces
A barn where you can bring your horse or you can pet ours
An observatory
Lots of hiking trails
Meeting rooms

The following may be open by then, or soon thereafter:
Exercise room
Conference room = holds 60 to 80 people
Restaurant for our guests
Volleyball court
horseshoe pits

Later
More cabins
Swimming pool
library of life extension
museum of cryonics and life extension
retirement center

Please send me, or post, your thoughts, ideas, suggestions.

For some reason I don't understand people always look at things from the
point of view of "The Original", but do you have any reason for thinking
that
right now, at this very instant, you are "The Copy" and was made only one
hour ago?

The latest episode of Scientific American Frontiers had a fascinating segment about the blending of MIT labs technical know-how with Hollywood special effects wizardry(Stan Winston) to create a highly interactive robot any young child would want to take home!  I admit to being very curious to know where the project will be a year or two from now.

The age of the supertoy is beginning...

http://www.pbs.org/saf/1303/segments/1303-4.htm

My question to the entire list is this, where do you think interactive "stuffed animal" technology will be five, ten, and even twenty years from now?  

thank you,

John

Both are made of atoms and both contain the same information so if an exact
copy of me is not me then just what is it that the one has and the other
does not? I can't think of a damn thing unless it turns out that religious
people were correct after all and everybody possesses a non material soul
that can only be made by God. I'm not holding my breath.

Each has a different history.  One is "the original". 
It is unique.  It is the first of its kind.  It is
'unprecedented'.  It's history runs from its moment of
origin, up to the present.  

The other is the nth copy of "the original".  Its
history begins from the moment of its production. 
Part of that history is the origin of its 'design'. 
For any copy of something, by the very definition of
copy (duplicate, xox, etc), its pattern, its form and
function, its design, its specifications require, and
are completely dependent upon, an original (in the
general case, or "the" original, in a specific case)
(with the exception of a copy of an (n-x)th copy;
n>x).

Extropes,

Thanks, Anders.

I'm astonished that no one has commented on this
development.  This is huge.  Doesn't this make
germline engineering 'easy'?  Doesn't this sudden
quantum leap to 'easiness' at least ***suggest*** that
all the fuss about the problems with cloning is more
myopic arrogance and cultural prejudices (from the
political establishment, the scientific establishment,
the technophobic, and religious ooga booga crowd) and
first-try-technological clumsiness/primitiveness, than
technical infeasibility, or even difficulty?

As my boy Ray says: "Everything's hard till you know
how to do it."

After which it becomes easy, not to mention obvious.

The following---that I posted a year or two ago on Cryonet (and I
think on Extropians---is pertinent to the identity question, and
I know several of the present debaters have not seen it:

In over thirty years of lively disputes about identity, I have found
that people fall, along one particular scale, into seven categories:

1.  Will travel by space warp, but won't permit disassembly of atoms.

    He or she objects to disintegration and reassembly of the atoms
    constituting his or her own person (given, of course, that this
    has become technologically reliable).  This is the most skeptical
    position of the seven.

2.  Will permit teleportation, but only if the same atoms are used.

    Subject agrees (as always, for suitable reward) to be disintegrated
    here and later reassembled at a remote location .  However the
    subject forbids disassembly here and reconstitution at a distant
    location using different atoms.

3.  Will teleport, unless there is a delay.

    Suppose the original at the point of departure is scanned and the
    information is used to construct the remote duplicate, but then there
    is a delay before the original is destroyed.  This is not acceptable.
    The subject anticipates that he or she will experience seeing his or
    her duplicate emerge from the distant teleporter station, and that
    this will void the transferal of identity to the remote.  The local
    will then experience disintegration, and that this will mark the
    actual death of the subject.

4.  Will teleport, but finds backups to be useless.

    Subject finds it a waste of money to get "scanned" for the purpose
    of getting himself or herself restored in the event of catastrophe.
    Not long after the scan is complete, the subject exclaims, "That
    information is me the way I used to be!  Were I to die, and that
    person brought back to life, it wouldn't really be me."

5.  Finds backups acceptable, provided that they've had no run time.

    Subject finds it desirable to keep frozen physical duplicates in
    storage (in case anything happens to him or her), but only provided
    that the duplicate, whether physically instantiated or merely kept
    safe as information, is completely identical to him or her at a
    particular past instant.  In this case, he or she expects to survive
    physical destruction of the present body, but not if that body has
    already been reanimated and is having experiences elsewhere.

6.  Anticipates future experiences of duplicates, but only one in 
    particular.

    This is the nearly incoherent "closest continuer" theory.  If you
    must die, but N duplicates of you were made at several points in
    the past, then you "really are" whichever one of them survives
    and is the most similar to you.  Somehow your soul, or identity,
    is transferred by hidden celestial machinery into this particular
    one, but not into any of the others.

7.  Logically, but not necessarily emotionally, anticipates all
    experiences of all duplicates past or future, near or far.

    By subscribing to "the faith of a physicist", the subject believes
    that any physical object at any coordinates whatsoever is the same
    person that he or she is, provided only that the physical process
    running in the object resembles him or her closely enough.

The extreme difficulty of sitting across a table, watching
your physical duplicate, and honestly being able to exclaim,
"There goes I, by the grace of God", or of being able to say
with a straight face, "Logically, I anticipate the dinner that
I had last night as much as I anticipate tonight's repast",
prevents almost everyone from accepting level seven.

My own belief is that nonetheless, one is lead inexorably
through countless thought experiments to level seven, and to
the realization that the other concepts of personal identity
are outmoded legacies of evolution which cannot sustain
careful scrutiny.

Thermodynamics makes things troublesome. While you can convert matter to
energy, there will always be entropic losses and efficiency is never
100% even if the conversion is. As a first approximation a black hole
housed in a Dyson shell that captures the Hawking radiation is a heat
engine, using the rest of the universe as a heat sink and the black hole
as the heat source. The Carnot efficiency of this device is (1-T_cold /
T_hot), where T_hot is the temperature of the black hole and T_cold the
temperature of space (~3 Kelvin). So if the black hole is 10^6 K, then
the efficiency is 0.999997 - quite good. But this does not take material
properties into account - the Dyson shell would not stand more than a
few thousand Kelvins if it is made of molecular matter. So T_hot might
actually be the hottest part of the shell, and for a 7000 K shell the
efficiency is just 0.99957. OK, that was still rather perfect :-) The 
big efficiency loss would be energy capture by the shell - the neutrino 
part of the radiation would escape (are there any estimates of the 
composition of the radiation?).

"Seeds for the Next Renaissance"   Commentary 24 October 2002
http://www.italydaily.concento.it/canali/main_italydaily.jhtml

PDF: http://www.iht.com/global.htm , click on "Italy Daily",
Page 1.

About Italy Daily: Italy Daily is the four-page insert inside of
International Herald Tribune (http://iht.com), if you buy the IHT in
Italy. These four pages are translated 'local' news from Italy's
Corriere Della Sera (http://www.corriere.it/) plus extra comments
(such as mine on this day) and other local Italian news for
English-speaking people.

Because they don't archive articles (as far as I've been able to
determine), and they change that web page irregularly (every 1-3
days), I attach it here.

(this is my first editorial for a big newspaper!)

==============

Seeds for the Next Renaissance
by Amara Graps


As a result of Riccardo Giacconi's well-deserved Nobel prize award for
his astrophysics research that led to the discovery of cosmic X-ray
sources, an unusual discussion has emerged in Italian public life of
the phenomena of Italian scientists who emigrate out of Italy to
pursue their research. As a foreign (American) astronomer in the
process of immigrating into Italy to continue my work, I don't have
enough deep background information of this phenomenon.

Currently to my unexperienced eye, the brain drain shouldn't surprise
casual observers, as government-supported scholarships are very low,
salaries to scientific researchers are barely higher than for bus
drivers, large research networks are being told they must close, so
then some Italian scientists eventually become too discouraged and
vote with their feet. The word 'discouraged' is an understatement.
Scientists generally have mild and forgiving characters and do what
they do for the love of their work, much more than for fortune and
fame. Therefore, the conditions leading to their departure was likely
extreme.

However, any situation can change, and if one adopts the stance: 'Yes,
we've done that, now how can we make it better?', I think I can offer
perspectives to consider during your reflection on the role of science
in Italian cultural life.

Italians have much to be proud in their past scientific and cultural
accomplishments. Their long cultural history displays a vast range of
experiences lending to a 'done it all' attitude and, hence, a daily
focus of living well (eternally) in the present, according to the
wisdom of what it has learned. With this as one's environment, one
might think that looking towards the future and making novel changes
could be difficult. Is change difficult for Italians? One needs only
to stand on a Roma streetside during peak traffic times, becoming
dizzy with the whirl of mosquito-scooters, to know that Italy is a
society in motion. To where does the society move? To where _can_ the
society move? What guideposts can the culture use from its past?

Italy had and currently has many scientists one can imagine as role
models, however, I can think of no better scientific and cultural
guideposts for Italy's future than Galileo Galilei, Leonardo da Vinci
and the Italian Renaissance.

Friends and colleagues have told me that Italians seem curiously
nonchalant about the scientist Galileo. In our opinion, however,
Galileo was one of the most important figures of the last one thousand
years. He introduced mathematics into physics and hastened the
separation of physical science from philosophy. Many U.S. high school
and first-year university science students perform duplicates of
Galileo's laboratory experiments. Galileo's house arrest and Pisa
Tower exploits, either exaggerated or real, are prominent in the
classroom stories. The NASA/ESA space mission to Jupiter and now
orbiting Jupiter since late-1995, was named after Galileo. For my
eight hundred planetary science colleagues at a 1999 science meeting
hosted by our kind Italian colleagues, one of the most memorable
events in our scientific careers was sitting in Universita di Padova's
"The Galileo Galilei Great Hall" and seeing Galileo's pulpit, from
where the great man lectured to his students.

Galileo Galilei was an astronomer, mathematician, physical scientist,
and budding entrepreneur who advocated experimental evidence and
individual experience over authoritarian elements. Two of my favorite
quotations by Galileo Galilei are "You cannot teach a man anything,
you can only help him to find it for himself,"  and "In questions of
science, the authority of a thousand is not worth the humble reasoning
of a single individual." As a guidepost for the future, Galileo
Galilei's achievements could remind Italians of the value of dogged
determination and scientific rigor, of listening to one's own heart
and mind, and of observing technical progress and supporting new
opportunities.

Leonardo da Vinci shared Galileo's enthusiastic love of observation,
investigation and discovery. His genius was that he excelled in an
astonishing variety of fields that are now considered artistic and
scientific specialities. For both his wide-ranging accomplishments and
the period of his achievements, the description of him as a
"Renaissance Man" uniquely suits his large stature in our history
books.

How can Leonardo and the Italian Renaissance be a guidepost to Italy's
future? The Renaissance was triggered, in part, by a revival of Greek
ideas. The Renaissance do-ers didn't want to just recreate again, what
the Greeks accomplished, instead, the creative individuals in the
Renaissance wanted to build on those ancient ideas and then take those
ideas further into new directions, permeating all aspects of society.
The conditions in Italian civilization seemed to be primed for the
first Renaissance seeds to germinate and flower, then those ideas
spread to the rest of Europe like a breath of fresh air.

In our present complex times, increasing technological advancements
swirl around us demanding more of our attention. Scientific education,
research and awareness is essential, not only to keep pace with our
fast-paced world, but also to provide a psychological comfort zone for
all people in society, showing that humans are linked with the
delightful discovery traditions from our past. We are all children at
heart, perhaps Italians even more so, eternally seeking answers to
age-old questions, and playing in the stream of time. I suggest to use
the current discussion of the role of science in Italian culture, not
as a way to lament past actions, but, instead, to embrace your past
and present accomplishments and channel your endless energy to create
seeds for the next Renaissance to germinate and flower.

If you can build me a soul detector, you have a case.

Would you really want to have a bug hulking spaceship with nuke drive
packaged with 10 k tac nukes + launcher floating over your head?

Since you can't really go with nuke drive to orbit without hot isotopes
raining into your morning shredded wheat breakfast all over the planet,
you have to assemble that in orbit. Lots of heavy lift launches, and a lot
of them carrying nukes.

Uh, what has cloning to do with germline engineering? You know, the
old-fashioned sperm/ova business vs. taking a random differentiated adult
cell? Given that we can't reset the genome (the microarray activity shows
wrong activity pattern, most clones get spontaneously aborted, have high
mortality, multiple aberrancies and die early) properly yet.

You get blackbody EM radiation, I thought. No one has seen blackbody from 
the event horizont, because the big stuff is too cold. Given that there 
now seem to be singularities even in globular star clusters, perhaps it's 
time to start looking for very faint but close sources which fit a perfect 
blackbody.

Please show you how you can tell which is the original, without resorting
to external storage. (Space is unlabeled. Trajectory tracking requires
external storage of information).

Analogy: Two CDs from the same master containing OpenBSD contain the same
software.  If the bit pattern would flip synchronously on both of them it
would be still the same pattern.

This is meaningless, as long as you can't provide a measurement procedure 
allowing you to tell two copies apart.

Why do we keep having the same discussion, year, after year, after year?

Notice that this applies to fully deterministic synchronized uploads with
fully identical input, or nondeterministic and/or not the same input with
trajectory forcing, or heavily instrumented flesh people with trajectory
forcing by invasive nanoware (which basically forces them to see the same
stuff and think in unison, nixing system noise and nonidentical input).

In other words, it's a highly construed example. Useful for gedanken, but 
not much else. The fork is default. As soon as there's a fork longer than 
specific chronon of the system, you've got two different systems. You can 
fuse the fork with trajectory forcing (assuming, the two people agree to 
it), and remove one copy once they're perfectly synched. Anything else 
would be murder.

Many people would oppose to fuse once they've forked, even briefly. I'm 
undecided on a few-second fork, but I would certainly oppose fusing after 
a hour fork.

Sure. However it is not possible for two objects to exist in the same

I'm reminded of the old saying: "Almost" only counts with horse-shoes

Right, by definition.

However the problem also goes deeper than the question of absolute
copies: it is about the continuity of the sense of self. Even assuming a
perfect copy of me can exist, how can I be in two places at one time as
you say is possible? 

If I am tasting wine in Napa Valley while my allegedly perfect duplicate
is guzzling beer in Tijuana, then does my wine taste like beer? Or does
my duplicate's beer taste like wine? Or do we both complain that our
drinks have been adulterated with wine or beer as the case may be? 

The idea that a person can be in two places at one time, Lee, is to my
way of thinking sheer and utter nonsense. 

As I wrote in a previous message: 

"If Lee wants to be (almost) in two places at one time then he needs to
project his sensory apparatus while maintaining his one original
brain/mind as the instrument that cognizes his perceptions. He needs
something analogous to a periscope." 

I think you should reformulate your arguments and your published essay
to advance a theory of how me might someday manufacture what might be
called "clairvoyance tools." It is after all clairvoyance that you seek
-- not the ability to be in two places at one time. Such robotic
clairvoyance tools would be something like mindless xoxes. You could
make these tools appear as you and behave according to your demand. They
would not be true copies of you but they would be true *representations*
of you. From that representation angle you might then be able to
structure an argument for the possibility of something very similar to
"being in two places at one time" that does not insult the intelligence
of your readers.

"What one must first do, however, is dispense with the idea
that the *particular* atoms have anything to do with one's
identity."

I disagree, the 'particular' atoms do have something to do with ones
identity, and I have attempted to show this logically, please point out any
fallacious aspects to my argument, as I would be eager to hear them.  The
particular atoms have no special attributes, no magical properties, the only
significance to them is that they happen to be the atoms that make up that
pattern at that time.

If the particular atoms had nothing to do with ones identity, then if we
transferred the pattern, then subjective experience would be retained, would
it not?  This is obviously not the case, because if we transfer the pattern
into another group of atoms (make a copy) then the other group of atoms,
which now share the same pattern as the original, do not have the same
sensory experience as the original pattern / group of atoms.  

claim - the pattern is important to identity, the atoms are not
hypothesis - copy the pattern but is different atoms, see if they share the
same sensory experience
result - copy made, copy and original, although difficult to distinguish, do
not share same sensory experience
conclusion - identity can be copied, but does not retain subjective
continuity

claim - the atoms are important, the pattern is not
hypothesis - use the same atoms, but change the pattern, see if identity is
still recognizable
result - mushed pattern up in blender, does not answer when asked 'who are
you'
conclusion - pattern is an integral part to identity.

claim - the atoms AND the pattern are important to indentity

hypothesis 1 - change atoms, retain pattern
result 1 - accomplished by transfering pattern to new atoms, entity two does
experience the same subjective sensations that reference pattern does (see
above).  Conclusion, changeing atoms but retaining pattern must be new
identity.

hypothesis 2 - change atoms, change pattern
result 2 - mushed pattern in blender, then copied new pattern, entity does
not exhibit any identity

hypothesis 3 - retain atoms, change pattern
result 3 - mushed pattern in blender, same atoms.  No identity recognizable

hypothesis 4 - retain atoms, retain pattern
control reference, no changes made, entity has recognizable identity
matching that of previous state in time.

Through these though experiements, it is clear that a copy, which is made of
new atoms with the same pattern, will not experience the same subjective
events that the reference or original does, even if we can not determine who
is the reference and who is the original, one of them was.  And they are two
distint identities.  If a copy is made the retains the original pattern but
is using new atoms, and comparing it with the original reveals seperate
sensory experiences, and they must be two distinct seperate entities, then
copying the pattern to new atoms and destroying the original will result in
a new entity that would not have shared a subjective continuity of
experience with the original.  The original was destroyed.

"Namely, if during the next nanosecond it were somehow possible to remove
atom1 from your body and replace it with an identical atom---and QM assures
us that all atoms of a given element excluding different isotopes are
equivalent ---then I don't think that you would notice the difference. If
one does agree with me, then, that the *particular* atoms have nothing to do
with your personal identity, then the objection you make in your last
paragraph falls to the ground."

You assert, if I can correctly interpret this, that if we replaced one atom
and you appeared to be the same person, then this is identical to replacing
ALL atoms and then assuming that you are the same person?  If you read
through your statement, your logical conclusion 'If one agrees with me, the
particular atoms have nothing do to' should more accurately be said 'if one
agrees with me, than THAT particular atom has nothing do do with your
personal identity'  You jumped from one atom having no significance to ALL
atoms having no significane.  Presenting this as a simple logical argument
shows why I would disagree with it, as the conlclusion does not follow
logically from the premise.

premise -  replacing one atom in your brain does not significantly affect
your personality
conclusion - Therefore replacaing all atoms in your brain does not
significantly affect your personality

I would agree with you that the particular atom you are referencing has
nothing to do with your personality if it is replaced with an identical
atom.  But give the fact that if we replace recreate the pattern in all new
atoms and the copy does not share its sensory experience with the original,
then it is reasonable to assume that replacing all atoms without keeping the
original means that the copy does not share continuity of sensory experience
with the original either.  Replacing 1 atom is far different than replacing
all atoms.

"So say you.  I contend that we are actually the same *person*, though
clearly what is to be contended is what is meant by that construction.
(This is, of course, the entire basis of the discussion.)"

Agreed, there seems to be some confusion as to what 'the same person' means.
People seem to be confusing 'those two people are the same (identical)' with
'That is the same person'  If we copied an apple, one could point at both
apples and claim they are identical, but one can not (logically) point at
both apples and claim that are the *same* (i.e. only one) apple, as they
obviously exist seperately spatially.  I do not disagree that one can point
at an original and a copy and state a) I can not tell which is which (unless
referencing the copying process) and b) their personalities are identical,
they are similiar people, if not entirely the same.  But I would disagree if
one claims that they are 'one' person, as they are obviously two, abliet
identical, people, each with their own distinct existence and sensory
experience.

"What evidence would you ever have that this is the case?"

Would you like to present evidence that if none of your atoms are replaced
or your pattern does not change then you are a different person?  My
evidence is the fact that no other evidence exist suggesting otherwise and
it is the simplest explanation for observed phenomena.  Just because we can
imagine other possibilites that are outside the realm of the testable does
not mean they are all equally valid as explanations.  If you are referring
to 'if all atoms are replaced we are a different person' see the above
thought expirements for the evidence.

"Is there any way that you can know that this is not being done to you each
millisecond in an operation that requires
only one nanosecond?"

No, is there anyway I can know true knowledge?  Is there anyway I can know
that the entire universe was not created just a microsecond ago with all our
atoms arranged in a manner to trick us into thinking that it has been around
a while?  But just because I can not KNOW that this is not the case does not
mean it isnt reasonable to assume that is not the case.  If someone should
present evidence that I am being destroyed and re-copied every microsecond
in operations that only require nanoseconds then I would take that into
account and make a judgement accordingly, however just because we can
imagine that this is a possible scenario does not make it a plausible one.
How would you know that you ARE being copied and destroyed each microsecond?
What test would show it?  This is similiar to the 'how do you know you are
not destroyed and copied every time you go to sleep' argument.  I know it
because I do not wake up in a destructive scanner in a large labratory, I
wake up in my bedroom in my house.

"If you talked to someone who was, in your terms, a thousand different
people each second"

I do not believe I ever implied that.

"Yet as I have said many times before, you would soon be in the small
minority as more practical people used teleportation to get about quickly
and cheaply. Finally, you'd be seen to be an old fogey from the last century
who had some strange hang-up about atoms."

That strange hang up being based on science and reason.  Oh well, to bad for
the rest of them.  I'll wait for wormholes (which may come about before
destructive copier / teleporters anyway)

Aside from the unusual special case you noted above, if you accept that to
be one person one must share sensory input with oneself, then noting and
accepting that a copy and an original *do not* share sensory input would
acknowledge that they are two, separate, distinct individuals.  If a copy
does not experience the same sensory information that an original does, then
it is obvious that they (the two of them) are not one person.  If the
original were destroyed in the process, it is still just as logical to
assume that the copy would not share sensory experience with the original
had he not been destroyed.  Thus they are not the same people (i.e., the
original does not experience the sensory input of the copy) 

To assert that this new copy is sharing subjective experience with the
original even if the original were destroyed is no different than asserting
it would have some magical telepathic link with the original were it not
destroyed.  If that turned out to be the case if this thought experiment
were actually performed, I would definitely rethink my position.  But
somehow I doubt that would be the result of the experiment.  

"Both are made of atoms and both contain the same information so if an exact
copy of me is not me then just what is it that the one has and the other
does not? I can't think of a damn thing unless it turns out that religious
people were correct after all and everybody possesses a non material soul
that can only be made by God. I'm not holding my breath."

But both are not made up of the *same* atoms.  Reference the though
experiments mentioned previously, but in short, if I copied your pattern to
new atoms, but kept you around.  You would not share sensory experience,
thus the copy and the original you are two separate individuals (although
identical) To assert that a copy is you implies a telepathic magical
connection that transcends both the patterns and the atoms.  It is clear the
subjective experience of the original you ends with the destruction of the
original you, because if the original was still hanging around after a copy,
the copy and the original you would not share sensory input.  If you did,
*that* would imply some kind of religious magical soul.

Seems to me that that the supposed paradox is explained much more easily
by noting the simple fact that the similarity of their visual
experiences is due only to an optical illusion. The paradox is illusory,
literally. Let them each have access to a compass and then compare their
experiences.

Probably because of the unsolvable nature of the bifurcation paradox. There
will always be newbies who will ask the same questions over and over again
and even "old hares" will drop in from occasionally and catch fire one more
time. I bet anything that we will still discuss this in 2040. There's no
hope, Eugen :-)

Browsing through this long thread I get the impression that a term like
"continuity of consciousness" might be helpful. To put it simple: how can a
perfect copy ever be me as long as I still exist. Only if I, being the copy,
remember that I was scanned and saw me, as the carbon original, being
eliminated, there might be something like a continuity of consciousnes. As
soon as I still see him waving at me from the input side of the scanner, I
as the output product must acknowledge him as a different entity. And so,
continuity as we know it, as ONE single stream of consciousness flowing from
the original to the copy, might not be possible, apart from the fact that an
alienation takes places after the bifurcation point.

Maybe what we need in the first place is a completey new notion of
continuity of consciousness. Maybe we must develop a new generosity about
copies and originals unless we agree to get eliminated in the uploading
process for the sake of an old fashioned model of consciousness continuity.

> No measurable difference does not mean that two entities are one, only

"The Identity of Indiscernible ...states that no two distinct substances
exactly resemble each other. Recent work on the interpretation of quantum
mechanics suggests that the principle fails in the quantum domain. "

Thanks, this serves to re-inforce the point (and it is quite interesting
additionaly)  If the principle fails in the quantum domain then two distinct
particles may have idenatical quantifiable descriptions, but they must, by
defination, be at two different places.  Thus they are still spatially
seperated, and still unique in some aspect.  Even if all of their properties
are identical, they can not exist in the same palce at the same time.

"Two physical objects in the same quantum state are provably
indistinguishable. Okay? If they weren't, e.g. the equilibrium equation
wouldn't be true."

They are distinguishalbe because they are not in the same place at the same
time.

"Two systems in the same quantum state are indistinguishable. It's not just 
a good idea, it's the law."

But to be in the same quantum state, they must occupy the same space, which
is impossible.  That is also the law.  Thus one can not look at a copy and
an original and claim they are the same because there atoms and molecules
are each individually identical, they are different because one is on the
right of you and one is on the left.

"If you can build me a soul detector, you have a case."

Its not necessary, just keep the original and the copy around and ask one if
he sees what the other sees, if not, there is no soul.

"Please show you how you can tell which is the original, without resorting
to external storage."

It is not necessary to prove which one is the original to acknowledge that
one of them must be.  

"This is meaningless, as long as you can't provide a measurement procedure
allowing you to tell two copies apart."

You can, they do not occupy the same time and space, thus they are different
from one another.

"Why do we keep having the same discussion, year, after year, after year?"

Because all of our lives and existence depend on this subject.

My take on this:
A lot of the "fuss" about cloning is because currently there are *lots* 
of technical problems that need to be worked out before we proceed. 
 Part of the problem is silly laws being passed assuming that "the way 
things are" is the way they'll remain.  But historically that was a 
reasonable response.

However, though this may be a big breakthrough, one shouldn't 
overestimate it's immediate effects.  You can't tailor your results. 
 Genes add themselves where they feel like doing so.  So you need to 
screen your results for the ones that implement the changes that you 
want, and be sure to get rid of any of the rest.  This is as much like a 
highly speeded up way of getting mutations (in a particular area) as it 
is a way of designing your result.

Still, if you are willing to pay for the trial and error, this should 
make things a *lot* cheaper.

Later, of course, we can expect to develope a finer control over things.

No. PEP says that no two electrons in an atom (that is, the _same_ atom)  
can have identical quantum numbers. This has nothing to do that two or N
different atoms in the same quantum state are indistinguishable.

This is useless for macroscale objects because you can't put them into the
same quantum state. However, we don't think using single quantum states.  
Here it is perfectly possible to put discrete systems (say, a computer
simulating a virtual robot arm in a blocks world) in a synchronized state
(state as in information processing state, not quantum state).

Similiarly, you can theoretically synch two recently copied meat people
into same state in regards to cognition (the spatiotemporal pattern of
molecular activity called life), and keep them that way.

It's a tour de force, and hence only useful as a gedanken. It is 
considerably easier with discrete deterministic systems, but it's still 
mostly useful as a gedanken. I can't see any possible uses for this off 
hand.

An interesting collection, but not complete.  I, e.g., find copying to 
be quite accpetable, even desireable, but desire that all of  the copies 
be allowed to be conscious.  In fact, one of the desireable aspects 
would be the creation of a synthetic upload which merged the experiences 
of the various bodies (as well as having it's own experiences).  Of 
course, over time I would expect this synthetic version to become the 
primary version, and as technology expands I would expect that it would 
initial partial downloads immediately after each upload/backup.  Sort of 
like a very restricted form of telepathy, with delay loops.  (I doubt 
that it would ever be practical to eliminate those delay loops.)

In QM no information can be cloned (xoxed)if 
the number of states is equal or greater than 3
[Wootters, Zurek, 1982]. 

Or, in other terms, a cloning (xoxing) of 2 non
orthogonal states violates the unitarity of evolution 
[D'Ariano, Yuen, 1996].

Or, in other terms, the linearity in QM (linear 
superposition of quantum states) forbids the
perfect xoxing. Fortunately! Leibniz principle!

It is not similiarity, and no illusion. It's the boundary condition
asserting conservation of identity. As soon as you deviate from them, you
get two (or N) people.

They can't. Trajectory forcing causes selective agnosia. Depending how it
is implemented, they both would see what A would have seen, or what B
would have seen, or something inbetween. You can tell them that there are
several of instances of them in perfect sync. It wouldn't matter, they
couldn't consciously diverge. The perfect mirror man routine (didn't the
Stooges use to do that?).

As soon as they would see something different their input would have to
deviate. They would have become distinguishable. You can still cause the
fork to fuse by brute force. After the prongs fuse again they will all
remember seeing the same thing when questioned about the event which
caused the temporary bifurcation.

### All of the above might be right and it would illustrate my point -
moving asteroids about is more complicated than initially thought. Instead
of one large nuke giving a big boost, you need to fiddle with tens of
thousands of small ones, or play with carbon fiber networks.

It seems to me that gts and Lee are still not connecting in the sense of
understanding what the other person is saying.

<referee>

I see Lee saying that while there are two separate physical bodies (copies),
doing separate things in separate places, that it makes the most sense to
say that it is the same *person/identity* doing all these things at the same
time.  It comes down to whether or not you accept this radical definition of
identity as useful.

I see gts arguing something else, that it's silly to say that the same
person can be in two places at once, and in the context that he's talking
about, of course he's right.

</referee>

Right now we have a lot of discussion about the meaning of "identical" with
offshoots into quantum physics and philosophy of Identity of Indiscernibles,
which is in itself an interesting topic -- but all this debate is apart from
the concept Lee is championing.

I observe the same thing that bothered me during an earlier discussion about
altruism.  I see endless debate swirling about definitions, but completely
missing the key point. I observe Lee energetically stirring the pot, and it
often seems that he is intentionally being obtuse, but perhaps this is
because he believes this is the best way for people to come to their own
conclusions.

It would be nice to get to the stage in the discussion where each
understands the other's viewpoint, and then move on to the more interesting
implications of various concepts of identity.

I can agree with that. It makes sense from a pragmatic viewpoint.
However I am no pragmatist; I must insist that the differences between
the objects remain real even if we decide they are not relevant to
whatever purpose we have in mind. 

For example if for pragmatic reasons you find it useful to drink coffee
from a real garbage truck then I won't object, but please don't expect
me to keep a straight face when you tell me the garbage truck is
actually a coffee cup. :)

All I see above are two valid arguments that neither Lee nor I should
beg the question of identity. My assertion that personality changes
constantly through time is certainly not evidence that it changes
constantly, nor is his assertion that personality persists evidence that
it persists. In terms of my personal inventory method of checking for
identity, any such statements we or our alleged dupes might make would
not be evidence for either case. However if for example Lee stated that
his personality persists and his copy stated that his does not persist
then we would have clear evidence that Lee is not his copy. This would
be so not because either assertion is true. It would be so simply
because the beliefs conflict.

Right, it is perfectly obvious. It is also perfectly obvious that two
individuals who did *not* give the same account of themselves and who
did *not* offer the same ideas of what is relevant would *not* be the
same person. And there we have a simple and obvious test for the
equivalency of identity. 

And as you know it is my contention that given enough time to discuss
and compare notes, the original and his alleged dupe would eventually
find some area of disagreement. The disagreement might be large and very
significant to them or it might be small and insignificant to them, but
it would be a disagreement nonetheless. That disagreement would be
evidence of their inequality *even if they agreed it was insignificant
to them*. 

To use the simplest kind of example, the original might say "I am
looking up at the sky" while the other says "I am looking down at my
shoes." That difference in their self-descriptions is sufficient reason
to call them different people, even if they are friendly to Lee's way of
thinking and so prefer to sweep their differences under the rug for the
purpose of making a dubious argument. :)

In one of Greg Egan's books (possibly Diasphora?) people are duplicated and
sent out traveling in separate spaceships.  It is understood that some of
the copies will die, some will contact other copies and share experiences,
some will simply branch out on their own path with no expectation of future
contact.

I think this idea is very extropic, because it is broadening and expanding
the range of consciousness in the universe.  I think ideas like this, while
purely hypothetical today, will have practical application in our future and
are worth thinking about.

Personally, I think it's most useful to consider each of these copies a
separate individual/person/identity, with individual rights and
responsibilities, at the same time acknowledging that the copies have much
in common with each other.  However, I haven't yet studies Lee's "Seven
Levels of Identity", so I may change my minds.

Doubtless;  but it's also news to me that the claim is imprecise.

Now dictionary.com supplies

oxymoron   Pronunciation Key  (ks-mrn, -mr-)
n. pl. oxymora (-mr, -mr) or oxymorons
A rhetorical figure in which incongruous or
contradictory terms are combined, as in a
"deafening silence" and a "mournful optimist".

[Greek oxumron, from neuter of oxumros, pointedly
foolish: oxus, sharp; see oxygen + mros, foolish, dull.]

Would you mind explaining exactly why "anarcho-capitalism"
is *not* an oxymoron given that the original poster believed
it to be a contradiction in terms?

Thanks,
Lee

Sure. By my understanding "anarcho-capitalism *is* an oxymoron today because
the two terms are generally seen as incongruous. As the definition states an
oxymoron is a figure of speech (trope) which combines incongruous terms, one
of which at least is usually a quality as opposed to an entity. The point is
this is done for effect, the incongruity is used to make the idea arresting
(and hence persuasive). There is no implication that the entity the oxymoron
refers to is impossible. A contradiction in terms is an argument or
definition where the terms of the definition/argument are mutually exclusive
e.g "a wet dryness". It's clear this is what people like the original poster
mean since they define market relations as inherently oppressive or
domination generating by their nature, hence if anarchy is defined as being
the absence of such relations it and capitalism are mutually exclusive. I
agree with Mike Lorrey that this is a specious form of special pleading
since it involves ignoring the well known and accepted definitions of the
terms. Steve Davies

Yes. In most cases the two would start to diverge almost immediately and the
differences would only increase as time went by. That's why the prospect of
getting vaporized would make me rather unhappy if my backup was older than a
second or two.

> But both are not made up of the *same* atoms.

The way to tell if two objects are the *same* is to exchange them and note
the changes; if you do this for atoms absolutely nothing changes.
Atoms have no individuality, if they can't even give this interesting
property to themselves how can they give it to us? I'll give you an example.

In my right hand I'm holding a hydrogen atom, his name is Ed. In my left
hand I'm holding another hydrogen atom and his name is Ted. As you closely
watch I bring the two together and cool them down (slow them down in other
words) until it's almost absolute zero. They form an object called a
"Bose Einstein Condensate", something with one quantum state not two as
there were before. I now heat it back up to room temperature, the condensate
is destroyed and you see two hydrogen atoms just as you did before, but
according to the laws of physics it is imposable to tell even in theory who
is Ed and who is Ted, both now have the same history. Stuff like that
happens all the time at the quantum level.

Guys,
       Let me take a crack at this term Anarcho-capitalism its supposedly 
being an oxymoron.
       If I understand you correctly anarchy and capitalism can be mutually 
contradictory only if capitalism can only exist with a government -- is that 
correct.
       Let us pretend I accept your premise.  Then two savages that run into 
each other in the wilderness cannot swap goods without a government present.  
That seems a little far fetched?

Yes indeed that is what he is saying. However his idea that his view
"makes the most sense" certainly does not alone make his view the most
sensible. As I see it either I am in Napa or else I am in Tijuana, and
either I am drinking wine or else I am drinking beer. 

Please Jef, if you think you can see things as Lee sees them, try to
answer my questions above in his terms in a way that "makes the most

That's not a property of the objects. Translation is featureless for
unlabeled space. That's a property of the observer. *You* are labelling
them. The composite system of you and first object and you and second

Bzzzzt. You just resorted to external storage. Try again.

Translation in a flat potential box does not change the quantum state of a
system (nonflat potential is equal to labelling space along the gradient).
If it did, equilibrium constant would break, and the world as we know it
would cease to exist. We all would die instantly.

Because we're alive you're wrong.

Stuff and nonsense. CR, or morphing to a healthy lifestyle, or relocating
to safe neighbourhood is far more important, yet I notice a remarkable
absence of such discussions on this list.

The identity discussion is irrational in face of the fact that you daily
do and fail to do decisions influencing your life, yet are highly
inconsistent in assigning relevance (emotion is metric for resource
assigment).

I'm equally inconsistent, yet I'm aware of the fact. I'm trying to change
my evaluation function. Speaking of which, I'm out of this thread.

Well, if its a dirty iceball or a loosely compacted asteroid
it represents a much smaller threat.  As soon as atmospheric
entry puts any stress on it its going to fragment which makes
it much less dangerous.  So we could withstand a strike of a
much larger (and therefore rarer) body of these types.

The worst thing is something which is compact enough to hold
itself together (e.g. iron-nickel asteroids) that will make
it through the atmosphere largely intact.  If I recall, the
nickel mines in Sudbury/Ontario(?) are actually harvesting
the remnants of such a body.

Are the differences between a horse and a horse's head "non-real" when we
say that there's only one thing in the barn?  Are the differences between
your whole right hand and your right hand minus a molecule (which is still
a hand) "non-real" when we say that you have just one right hand?

The point came at the end: the fact that our language necessarily has a
context informed by our beliefs and attitudes doesn't imply that
individual beliefs and attitudes are automatically relevant in counting.

The example shows this: by switching contexts, the answer changes, but
within a context, differences of opinion may not be relevant.

Conflicting beliefs aren't necessarily relevant...  Of course, you've
picked a pretty big change, given what we know about Lee, but despite
that, we still might not find such differences of belief relevant for the
purposes of counting, any more than Lee finds it relevant that the copies
have different locations.

Again, I remind you that most of us don't find even drastic psychological
changes relevant to counting in the case of changes over time.  Most of us
are happy to say that there's just one person, even when her opinion
changes over the years as to whether her identity persists over time.

Conflicting beliefs are just one of a variety of tests, some of which may
pass while others fail; we pick and choose what counts for "identity",
which is what makes the whole argument mere semantics.

It's simple alright, but if we aren't interested in its results, then we
won't use that test for counting.  [We've got to focus merely on *choices*
instead.]

It would prove *some* kind of inequality, but it wouldn't prove that we
should count two people, any more than the inequality of your hand with an
overlapping hand minus a molecule "proves" that you have two right hands.

Everyone admits that there's two thingies in question when we talk about
xoxes, but the question is whether that makes for two different *people*
or not.  Slight differences can make for different objects of some kind or
other, but sometimes they just don't count.

Actually PEP was later generalized to all fermions -- not only electrons
as originally conceived by Pauli.

According to the modern version of PEP, fermions cannot have the same
quantum numbers when contained in a "closed system" but I'm not aware of
any rule that limits the definition of "closed system" to atoms only.
Certainly a molecule is a closed system describable in terms of quantum
mechanics. And if molecules then why not also larger macroscopic
systems? 

Position is, after all, one of the four quantum numbers that cannot be
duplicated by two fermions within a system. I note that regardless of
spin, momentum and mass, two electrons cannot occupy the same position
even if they are traveling apparently free through empty space.

Amara - as an Italian who left the country some 20 years ago, for the
reasons you describe, and never went back, I appreciated your article very
much.
Italy had a great past, the present is not so good, and the future looks
much worse.

<<<One needs only to stand on a Rome street during rush hour, becoming dizzy
with the whirl of mosquito-scooters, to know that Italy is a society in
motion.>>>
This is very true (try Napoli it is worse), too bad you can feel this motion
only on the street.

<<<I suggest making use of the current discussion of the role of science in
Italian culture, not as a way of lamenting past actions, but instead as a
way of embracing the past and present accomplishments and of channeling
Italy's endless energy to create seeds for the next Renaissance to germinate

This sentence is so beautiful but where is this discussion of the role of
science in Italian culture??? To me it seems that it is going to remain what
it has always been in the second half of the 20th century: nil.

So you are moving to Italy?

To all Italians: yes I love our country very much (btw I really do).

As I see it, and I really don't like speaking for others, but I'll try here
with the hope of cutting it short, is that Lee is asking you to consider
broadening your definition of self to see that the other person, for most
practical purposes, can be effectively considered to have the same
self-identity as you.

Once you accept that the copy can be considered to be effectively you,
recognized by your friends as you, and for most practical purposes, is the
same as you, with the exception of some different memories, then you can
logically say that "you" (as your identity can be defined) can exist in two
places at once.  It's not implying some new interpretation of physics.  It's
just a different understanding or definition of self identity.

In many ways this can be a useful way of looking at things, but personally,
I think this broadening of the definition of self obscures important
details.  I think I understand Lee's key point, but it seems to me that it
would be more accurate and useful to refer to "that branch of me" over
there, than to IMO oversimplify it by saying that it's precisely me.

Sorry, I failed to make clear my sense of the
connection.  

Both germline engineering and cloning are
biotechnology.  Genetic engineering.  When one branch
of this technology suddenly and unexpectedly becomes
'easy', why may not a similar thing happen in a
related branch?  And, in fact, the science is so new
that just such major discoveries leading to major
technological capabilities are ***to be expected***.  

The genes-inserted-easily-into-sperm development seems
to me yet another announcement of this situation, a
lesson in perspective on the larger process.  Right
now, advanced degrees and fancy high tech tools
notwithstanding, we don't know squat all about this
stuff. But, at the same time, we're in the steep area
of the learning curve, and on course to develop a
whole honkin' huge lot of know how in a very short
period of time.  

The ease or difficulty, safety or danger, of cloning
lies, I predict, not in the cloning, but in the state
of human know how.  Shortly, the precise set of
factors that make an embryonic cell embryonic will be
specified.  This amounts to knowing where you want to
go, and knowing where you want to go is a big help in
plotting a course to get you there.  Shortly
thereafter, I expect, resetting an adult cell will
become 'easy', and therapeutic and reproductive
cloning will become both routine and safer than the
old 'natural'/conventional therapy/reproduction
techniques.  Then in (relatively) short order, expect
therapeutic correction, improvement/upgrade, radical
enhancement, and complete (?) morphological freedom.

This view is partly technophilic enthusiasm and partly
my sense that genetic materials are INHERENTLY EASY TO
MANIPULATE.

Of course, I could be wrong.  It could be even easier
than that.

Best, Jeff Davis

I can't speak for Steve (nobody can), but anarcho-capitalism's status
as an oxymoron or not is immaterial to the original posters
demonstrated lack of ability to comprehend commonly accepted defintions
of commonly used words.

Well, I'm the original poster, my name is Alex. Anyway, I think you are 
right, actually-- I have demonstrated a lack of ability, or at least a lack 
of will, to use commonly accepted definitions of commonly used words. 
Actually, I have done this intentionally-- why? Because I do not believe 
that the commonly accepted definitions of, say, socialism, actually are self 
consistent. So you can see in one of my messages, you can talk about a word 
that means a Christian Athiest, but that may not make any sense, you have to 
examine the usage of the word in various circles to understand what it 
means, if indeed it does mean anything. And I think that yes, you can say 
that socialism means something, but only if you drop certain contradictory 
ideas which have been attached to the word over the decades by various 
people, especially people in the upper echelons of the currently existing 
hierarchy who would have quite a lot to loose if the masses decided that 
socialism was a good thing.

So, what is the commonly accepted definition of socialism? Well, when most 
people talk about socialism today, they seem to be talking about societies 
which are reminiscent of, say, Stalinist USSR, or Maoist China, or North 
Korea today, or Cuba. In short, when talking about socialism, people seem to 
choose the most brutal sort of tyrannies ever to exist, and then label that 
socialism. This is unfortunate because these horrible social systems bear no 
resemblance to the type of socialism that was advocated (and is advocated) 
before the word became what is, as far as I can see, a tool of propaganda. 
Now, some people do try to attach some selective meaning to the word, and I 
think one person here mentioned that China was simply a continuation of the 
old imperial system, not anything new. And that, I think, is a positive 
development, it is certainly better than the other, but still unfortunately 
it assumes that it is possible to have such a thing as a socialist 
dictatorship. I don't think that makes any sense, I think that is a bit like 
talking about a Christian Atheist.

Economic and political hierarchies are always, without exception, related 
and intertwined. Why? Because politics affects economics. You couldn't have 
a Congress without having a Congressional ability to influence the economy, 
it wouldn't have any meaning. You couldn't have a corporate hierarchy 
without having some other organization to enforce the dictates of that 
hierarchy. If that particular enforcing organization was merely a subset of 
the corporation, the corporation would effectively be a government in 
itself, complete with military and civil wings. In our current system, 
however, all the economic hierarchies have merged their military wings into 
one enforcer organization, which is called the State. Note that if the State 
was dissolved and replaced with individual military wings in the 
corporations or whatever economic organizations then existed, you would 
essentially have not gotten rid of the idea of State, but rather you would 
only have succeeded in creating many little states. And, because of the 
tyrannical nature of the corporate hierarchy, they would all be tyrannical. 
As far as I can see, what would probably then happen is that they would all 
begin warring amoung themselves, bringing down industrial civilization in 
the process, until one or more triumped and the situation was stable. Thus, 
the result would simply be total destruction and a subsequent emergence of 
Stalinism in many places. As far as I can see, that is the likely result of 
any serious attempt to institute "anarcho"-capitalism by way of 
corporations. There are other ways, to be sure... but I think that the 
results will probably be similiar, or even worse.

Of course, the possibility of this result becomes increasing evident, I 
think, when the process of any move toward "anarcho"-capitalism proceeds. 
That is why I do not believe it has any serious chance of happening.

What does this have to do with socialism? Well, if economic and political 
hierarchies are intertwined, then it doesn't make any sense to talk about an 
economically classless society in the midst of a complete political tyranny: 
that's just self contradictory as far as I can see. Rather you must 
eliminate both. You've got to get rid of political tyranny and economic 
tyranny, you can't get rid of one or the other, and in fact if you attempt 
to do so, it seems like pretty nasty stuff can emerge (war, Stalinism, etc).

So, if we want to retain any definition to this word 'socialism' at all, the 
only way to do so, that I have been able to recognize anyway, is to make it 
synonymous with anarcho-socialism, or anarchism.

Gee Alexander,
       It seems to me that you said a lot of stuff but I notice two features 
of your writing.
       First it seems you attempted to define yourself away from the leading 
bad examples of Socialism.  Given that they were established and operated by 
people that were pushing their idea of what socialism is I am not at all sure 
you have played within the rules.
       Second, while you were defining yourself away from the bad you did not 
give any specific examples of any bright and shining models of how great 
socialism can be.
       I think that after 200 years of experience with several dozen 
socialist countries and tens of millions of citizens of those countries 
having been murdered by their own socialist governments it is up to you to 
prove that socialist countries aren't simply mass methods for screwing up a 
country and its people by providing us with concrete examples of glorious 
progress under socialism.

Matter-antimatter reactions are *in principle* 100% efficient at
converting matter to energy, but this efficiency is different from the
thermodynamic efficiency of a process to extract useful work (which has
to be less than 100% efficient). The first is a statement about how much
matter would remain, the second a statement about how much entropy costs
you have to pay. 

Actually, banging matter and antimatter together is not going to convert
them into energy in a neat way. Individual particles annihilate each
other, producing pairs of gamma photons (that is the 100% part). But
these photons can both create new particle-antiparticle pairs and bounce
off other particles, shooting them away. So the result is more like a
hot plasma than a perfect conversion.

I would simply ask you to clarify your meaning. Do you really mean to
imply there is no horse body attached to that horse head? If so then the
difference in the barns is very real. If not then there is no
difference.

Here you are describing a real difference. My right hand minus one
molecule would not be my right hand. The difference may be small and you
might judge it insignificant in deciding which hand you will claim as
yours, but the difference is nevertheless real.

I see beliefs as extremely relevant for purposes of distinguishing
between two people who appear on the surface to be identical. Beliefs,
attitudes, opinions, etc... this is the stuff of which personalities are
made. Even Lee has agreed that my person changed when I experienced a
religious conversion and became a devoted disciple of Thor. Yet
apparently he disagrees that smaller personality changes should also
matter. He (and perhaps you also) might say that large changes in
personality such as religious conversions "count" but that small changes
in personality "don't count." You and he are certainly entitled to feel
that way but your subjective judgments about what degree of change
should count does not affect the hard objective fact that even small
changes in personality are real. The decision to ignore small
differences does not make them unreal.


> Most of us are happy to say that there's just one person, even

As am I, for most purposes. However we are here getting at the very
nature of identity and personality. It is wise here I think to use more
exact language. 

I mentioned in another message to you, one to which I don't think you
replied, that in my view we persist through time only in a manner
analogous to that by which a whirlpool persists through time as it moves
down a river. We refer to these whirling patterns as "I" or "me" and
speak of them as though they are fixed objects. This is very convenient
for purposes of communication and social development of the species --
it helps to get the bills paid -- but upon closer examination we see
that the whirlpools to which we are referring change with each passing
moment. The "I" idea is merely a useful label used for describing the
general whirling patterns that comprise our ever-changing personalities.


I believe it a mistake, both psychologically and philosophically, to
consider "I" as a reference to a fixed object. Unfortunately this belief
is prevalent in the West (but not so much in the East -- Buddha knew
better). This false belief in "I" as a fixed object leads some people to
feel guilty and depressed for the bad choices they believe their
present-persons made in the past and it leads other people to become
egotistical and narcissistic for the good choices they believe their
present-persons made in the past. Much wiser I say to attribute those
successes and failures to our past-persons, and to learn from them in
the same way that we learn from the successes and failures of others.

This is one of those logical 'problems' that I see
repeated again and again on this topic.  Just because
someone/everyone is unable to distinguish between two
items doesn't mean they aren't an original and a copy.
 Observer ignorance/inability is a separate matter
from the facts of identity.  If a tree falls in the
forest and no one is there to hear it, it still makes
the same huge crashing sound.  Unless you can
establish that the laws of nature are observer
dependent, you need to retire this 'argument'.

Just because you don't know, or can't know, the
difference, doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  What's
more, the argument seems to me not just disingenuous,
but even a bit ridiculous.  To make a copy, you have
to have an original from which to make it.  It is
impossible then to have the two without
creating/having, in the process of making the copy,
the means of distinguishing the two.  Destroying the
evidence, or losing it, or whatever, and then claiming
in full view of everyone, some fanciful state of
affairs, is, well, pure stubbornness.

The problem is that saying "Socialism is a system like that of country 
X" isn't a well-defined definition.  It "sort of " points you in the 
right area, but if I abstract feature A, while you are abstracting 
feature B, we will be thinking very different things, and when we try to 
decide whether another country is, or is not, socialist we will come to 
different answers.  It's that kind of definition that's "probably better 
than nothing", but is really more useful for advertising and propaganda 
than it is for serious analysis of political/economic systems. 
 Unfortunately, it seems to be as good a definition as is available.  If 
we were to say something like "It's a social system based on 'from each 
according to his abilities, to each according to his needs'." we would 
have neatly eliminated all social systems that have ever existed.  Some 
claimed to operate on a theory like that, but no one that I have 
examined reports of actually did so.

I will propose a general law of human (and probably other) societies: 
 "Those who have the power, make decisions that they believe will 
further their own ends."
I hope that isn't seen as too cynical, but it seems to be true of every 
social group that I've examined.

Not sure if anyone's been following this story over the last couple of months;

Nice to see the ECOJ showing some teeth, such as it is.

Unfortunately, they are investigating it not on the grounds of the gamers 
"rights", but from a commercial perspective.

One challenge to this new law is currently going through the courts with 
the law having been branded as unconstitutional.  Here's hoping the Greek 
Govt. sees sense in the end.

It is fascinating to me that more than a day into one of the
worst hostage taking situations the world has ever witnessed
(~700 people involved =~ 2 747s) [at least to my knowledge],
including two Americans, there hasn't been any notice at all
by the Extropian list.

This has the possibility of presenting a death toll which is
~25% that of the WTC collapse.  Unlike natural disasters,
where the death toll may be higher, this is a crime of humans
against humans and one that might be prevented by human actions.
And here we have an example of terrorists using civilians as
tools to achieve their goals rather than simply using them
to send a message.

There is also an aspect of how dangerous people who have no
hope may be to all of us.

mindset are able to assemble themselves in one location.

There are 700 of us who cannot do that and may never again.

Charles,
       Is that really important?  No one has ever pointed to a country B and

Umnh ... without a good definition, how do you know?  Were any of these countries "socialist" in any way that the people who believe themselves to be socialists would accept?  Do you believe that the US is capitalist?  Why?  I can point to many (small) social groups that might have been socialist, depending on what one means.  The groups that I am thinking of were all small and peaceful, generally too much so, as they were generally overwhelmed by agressive neighbors.  Who, then, is the one with the lethal system?  The ones who did the killing, or the ones who were killed?  (And which did you mean in the prior paragraph.  I may have read that incorrectly.)

Interestingly, many of these "socialist" groups also had strong beliefs about private property.  In some areas they were quite competive, and perhaps more properly described by the term "capitalist", but again, without a good definition, it's hard to know.

Charles,
       Of course the answer to your question is yes.  For practically the 
entire history of the socialist countries the world has been full of 
apologists that explained the socialism of those countries and patiently 
explained to the rest of us how superior these socialist countries were 
despite the fact that they were highly lethal for their citizens.

       Then you added, "Interestingly, many of these "socialist" groups also

       Charles, you keep wanting to go off into the mists of abstraction.  
You came down to Earth enough to tell me that "many of these "socialist" 
groups also had strong beliefs about private property" then you wander off 
into abstraction to say "but again, without a good definition, it's hard to 
know."  Well, which way is it?  Are they socialist or not?  How do you know?  
When you are with friends or mentors that espouse socialism how do you know 
if they know what they are talking about?
       Charles, all is abstraction.  We wander through every path in the 
briar path but I for one don't know what you are talking about.  I guess I do 
know one thing, if ever we point at a socialist country that was a hell on 
Earth for its inhabitants you want to define it out of the socialist camp.
       I suggest you read von Hayek's Road to Serfdom and learn how all these 
socialist countries are led inevitably to becoming lethal.  According to him 
it is all well intentioned for the most part and it is inevitable.

It's *BOTH* ways!  There aren't any easy boundaries here.  If you look at 
things from a distance, it's easy to say that from this angle they look like 
that.  But this doesn't mean it captures anywhere near the entirity of it.

Consider a typical pre-industrial english village.  For the moment we'll 
ignore that castle on the hill.  Neighbors share with neighbors.  People try 
to share fairly.  But when it comes time to sell a cow, just watch the 
negotiations!  How am I to decide which parts of this are "socialist"?  
Clearly they aren't all socialist.  How am I to decide which parts are 
capitalist?  Clearly they aren't all all capitalist.  And I don't have decent 
definitions that will allow me to classify things.

Is that solid enough?  I could talk about families, too.  We all know how a 
family works.  Except that each one works slightly differently.

OK.  Families.  My sister was off in Canada, working for the health 
department.  She had guaranteed medical care, a good job, etc.  My father 
became terminally sick, and she gave up he job to come home and help my 
mother watch him.  (He needed watching 24 hours per day.  A totally 
impossible task, even for two people.)  So.  He dies, she goes back to work 
in the US.  Now, before she's worked 6 months there was an accident, and she 
catches a patient slipping out of bed.  Now he has strained tendons in both 
arms.  It's years later and the medical consensus is that she never will 
recover.  But after fighting with worker's comp for over a year, she's given 
retraining for a job that she will be able to do.  Now she's employed again 
as an ergonomic specialist for a city.  Currently she's studying the 
collection of money from parking meters, in an attempt to keep the meter 
collectors from developing RSI.

How do I pick that apart into the pieces that are socialist, the pieces that 
are capitalist, and the rest?  Is that grounded and specific enough for you?

Lee -

I was happy to see your posting on the Seven Levels since it should help =
move the discussion beyond the interminable debate running on about =
whether the same object can be in two places at once.

My response to your 7 levels is as follows:

The first four strike me as representing naive understandings held by =
some and not useful to discuss further here.

This is where, for me, it begins to get interesting.  The key point is =
how we understand our self-identity. =20

I define my self-identity as a particular pattern, continuously =
changing, of thoughts, memories, drives, etc. moving through time and =
space.  This pattern evolves as it interacts with its environment, and =
as determined by its own structure and the laws of physics.  In =
accordance with current convention, and instinct, I limit my working =
concept of self to just those thoughts, memories, drives, etc. that =
appear to be contained within a particular human organism, and extending =
along a timeline from birth to death of that organism.  Although my =
identity is associated with a human organism, it is perceived as =
essentially independent of that organism, since virtually any physical =
change in the organism is not perceived as a change in identity.

If another instantiation of myself were to be created, then clearly that =
new entity would begin as equivalent to me but then the two entities =
would proceed to diverge increasingly with time.

Here's where it seems to get messy for some people.  It depends on how =
we choose to define self under these unfamiliar conditions.

Argument A
  a.. We could say that the two entities are effectively the same =
person, pointing out that the differences between them are less than the =
differences the original entity went through during his lifetime, and =
such differences over time were never cause for an identity dispute =
before so why should they be now?
  b.. We could point out that to his friends, and even to his mother, it =
would be obvious that he's the same person, so why dispute it?
  c.. We could point out that he pursues the same interests and passions =
as before, so even intangibles such as values are the same, and this is =
an important measure of a person.

Or,

Argument B
  a.. We could point out that we now have two entities operating =
independently of each other in our society, and that for society to =
function properly we must have individual rights and responsibilities.  =
For example, entering into contracts.
  b.. We could point out that after a while, significant enough =
differences will develop that if the two entities were brought together =
they would have disagreements and even compete with each other.  This is =
overwhelmingly consistent with our understanding of separate =
individuals.
  c.. We could argue that just as genes evolve and propagate themselves =
through time without any identity paradox, so can replicated humans, =
each branching off on his own path through the universe.
In the end it's all semantics.  The facts stand on their own, and how we =
choose to describe them depends on the scope and context we use.

I agree this appears quite incoherent.  I question why you chose to =
place this so near the top of your list, but I suspect it has to with =
the "anticipation" to which you refer.  I've run into something like =
this in discussions with others, and I think its roots are in the =
mind/body dichotomy.  To me this is cleared up by realizing that "you" =
are not your body, nor are "you" in your body.  Rather, your =
consciousness is a result of processes conducted by your body.=20

To me, the position stated in #7 is based on following the logic in =
Argument A past its point of usefulness, beyond the point where that =
subjective definition of what constitutes a personal identity makes =
sense.  It's a cool idea, and it tickles the brain in the way novel =
ideas do, but it seems to me to be much less practical than Argument B.

I believe I'm open to the possibility of being convinced, and I'm =
curious what may be learned in the process.=20

It's funny you bring up motorcycles, because last week in Mayer they had a big biker's rally which was sponsored by the Harley-Davidson dealership here(yes, this tiny town has a Harley-Davidson dealership!).  

I had been invited to attend by one of the promoters, but because there was so much work to do at the lodge I had to miss it.  So I will have to wait another six months to see the rough-looking bikers, live bands, free food, and supposedly scantily clad women which abound!

If a band of extropian bikers pulled into our parking lot I could see my employer hitting the no vacancy switch unless Max and Natasha were in the lead!  And if I see Spike in the group I will know right off we're in for trouble! lol : )  I won't even get started about the "Singularity Hardtakeoff-riders," lead by the notorious "hell for leather" Yudkowsky and his friend "Mad dog" Goetzel!

Now, should the "Extropian Angels" and the "Rifkinite Devils" both show up at the same time, I can only hope our insurance will cover the damage from the resulting rumble!!  

Today David Pizer and I put up absolutely beautiful display boxes on the great room walls, which showcase different people and tools of the old west.  You can learn about Geronimo, Billy the Kid, and Wyatt Earp, among others!  The art combined with our stained, peeled log furniture and staircase makes the main building really feel welcoming and a place to relax.   

We finally arranged the wooden tables and chairs out on the terrace, where most of our guests will be eating.  This will be the place to visit for fine "western cafe" style dining.  It looks wonderful!

Oh, and I almost forgot our new little pets, the rattlesnakes!  But don't worry, because they are very freezedried! lol  These twin predators are coiled and ready to strike on our reservations desk.  They are even better than a sign which might read "don't tread on the manager in training(because he's still learning)!" LOL

My mom used to say it takes something special to make a house a home, and I feel the lodge is crossing over to the latter.  Soon all we will need are guests to make the place fully come alive.

I really hope everyone who can make it here this Saturday does so.  It will be worth your time, and you will return home with some great memories.

Already, many of the local townspeople have told me they feel great pride regarding this place.  It makes them feel something wonderful and enriching has arrived within their little town.   

best wishes,

John

Charles,
       I think we are at about the right level.  Ayn Rand in some of her 
non-fiction writing covered this territory pretty well.  However I will 
recommend her for your consideration never expecting you to totally adopt her 
viewpoint -- I don't know what viewpoint you will adopt after consideration.
       Robert A. Heinlein expressed a riddle once in a book of his.  If a 
small village had a Spanish barber and that barber shaved every man in the 
village that did not shave himself then who shaved the Spanish barber.
       The answer of course to make a distinction between those things we do 
in our private and public capacities.
       Similarly, we have to remember that capitalism and socialism are 
political theorys and exist within a political system.  I am not sure it 
makes any sense at all to try to introduce those terms into totally private 
areas of conduct.
       Within families and with workmates or close neighbors I see people do 
things all the time that seem almost unclassifiable and most of the time it 
doesn't bother me at all.  What do you call it when your sister does 
something for you and later unbidden you see something she needs so you step 
up to the plate and do for her?  What do you call it if you see your sister 
has gotten the short end of the stick in life and you step up to help her get 
ahead.  In one sense you were balancing the scales between you, in another 
sense you were selfishly helping yourself by strengthening the family and in 
the end strengthening your own position.
       But, in the end you are going to have to come up with new terms 
because neither capitalism nor socialism seem to even fit that area of life 
much less do they explain that conduct.  
       It is certain that I don't have any strict explanation or those 
circumstances.  I only know that those things go on between members of 
families, neighborhoods and workplaces.  It seems to depend upon the 
intelligence, love and concern existing between the people involved.

Here we have a case where the laws of Physics say it is imposable to ever
tell the difference between two things and you say nevertheless there is a
huge difference between the two. You could state exactly the same thing more
concisely and honestly simply by saying they are different because they have
a different soul. You could say it, but I don't care to.

All I can say is such an attitude has proven itself to be notoriously
unproductive in the past and I see no reason that will change anytime soon.
I think I'll stick to the scientific method.

> Michael M. Butler replied: 
>>And they haven't seen us all on *MOTORCYCLES*!

Since you may hear this story eventually thru some
other channel, I will spill it here first.

Seventeen years ago I bought a Suzuki Cavalcade, a
full up touring bike which you never heard of, for
reasons you will soon learn if you keep reading.
This site shows some photos.  Mine is on the top right.

http://www.shermanpool.com/Cade/which%20cade/whichcade.html

This model never did sell much.  Only about 9000 of
them were ever built, about 7000 of which ended up
in the states.  Suzuki Motor Company discontinued
this series after only 3 years, at a huge loss.
I really like mine, and would consider it the
favorite of the 4 bikes I currently own.

About two years ago, I noticed a strange noise coming
from just behind the engine.  I struggled to ignore
it, but it wouldn't quit, so I pulled the back end off.
Nothing appeared to be wrong with it, so I took off the
secondary gear case and discovered that it had no oil.
The secondary gear case on this bike is unusual in that
it has its own lubrication, as opposed to others that
are lubricated by engine oil.

I then discovered that there was a rubber coated metal
oil plug that had evidently fallen out of its seat, into
the secondary gear case.  I replaced the plug, and noticed
it was not a good tight fit, so I gooped on a bunch of
Loctite and glued the thing in place and put it all back
together.  On a shakedown run the next day, it occurred
to me that had I kept riding the bike much longer, the
drive shaft bearing would have failed for lack of
lubrication.

About a year went by with this piece of info rattling
around in my brain.  I discovered a web based owners
group for this bike.  I read a few posts and noticed
occasionally someone would mention the same kind of
failure I experience on my bike.  I started posting
there and soon people started thinking of me as one
of the leaders.  Im always cutting up on that list,
worse than I do on extropians.

December 2001, I suggested riders send me their vehicle
identification numbers (VIN) and a list of mechanical
problems they had experienced with their bikes.
Eventually nearly 300 riders did so.  I put the
information into a spreadsheet, then cross correlated
the dates of manufacture to the VIN.  Then I sorted by
date of manufacture and found that there is a definite
cluster of these types of failures early in the series.

Furthermore, there were a *lot* of this kind of
failure, 35 that we know of.  This oil plug turned out
to be the most failure prone part on the bike.

Upon further investigation, I learned that my speculations
were correct: that if the bevel plug fails and one does
not fix the problem, the shaft bearing can indeed fail.
What I learned next was quite unsettling.  If that
shaft bearing fails, it does so catastrophically: the
rear wheel suddenly locks.

For those who do not ride, I will explain that if a
rear wheel suddenly locks, the result is most likely
a crash.  Unless it happens on a straight level road,
there is almost no chance of saving it.  I commed
offlist with a rider who had experienced a rear wheel
lockup on a cavalcade, but he managed to slow down
a lot before he fell off.

Many emails later, I and several of the other owners
agreed to meet in some central location to discuss
strategies.  My main goal was to warn other owners
of this bike that there was a significant risk
associated with this secondary gearbox failure.

Fifty of us met in Branson Missouri last month, which
is why the extrolist was regaled with stories of
finding a second cousin in a brain-drained little
town out in the Ozarks, and throwed rolls, etc.

At that meeting, I presented a lecture on the problem.
There were various strategies suggested.  I found
myself urging more radical measures to find and
warn owners, such as contacting the NHTSA or all the
state DMVs to try to track all the registered owners.

Some of those present urged we not get to enthusiastic
about this, for the insurance companies might hear and
react by Naderizing the bike: declaring it unsafe at
any speed, and refusing to write policies, effectively
banning the bike from the roads.

We debated, ended up drafting a letter which was in
the polishing stages on 14 October, a week ago Monday
night, when I got an email from an investigator from
Britain.  A 23 year old girl had been riding on the
back of a Cavalcade when the rear wheel suddenly locked.
She died in the resulting crash.

Now, of course I was disheartened.  He asked what I
knew, and I gave him everything.  I held nothing back.
That exchange took place a week ago this evening.  I
expect this whole thing to break loose any time now.
I don't know what is going to happen.  Im sitting here
on this database that clearly shows there are riders
all over this country and many in Europe and Australia
that are astride a rolling time bomb.

This is why I haven't been posting as much to
Extropians the last couple months.

Suggestions welcome.

On the other hand, should we debate every such disaster in
particular? That would likely be more relevant for a news list. As
I see it, we should discuss it in the terms that can only occur
here: from its transhumanist relevance, how it fits in with the big
picture of human development. The specifics of events like this are
lamentable and touch our hearts, but that is not in itself a reason
(beyond social community) to make it an extropian debate subject.

Yes. It also shows that the threat of supertech terrorism might be 
smaller than the threat of lowtech but well organised terrorism. If 
there are any technological enablers here it is likely better 
communications, which makes coordination easier.

In the past I have argued that the "problem of destruction" is that 
the destructive ability of individuals increase with technology, 
making the total risk from relatively rare but irrational 
people increase. However, it seems that the risk associated with 
irrational *groups* might be higher, and have a stronger technology 
multiplier: beside the increase in destructive power, the 
coordination ability might also grow. Even if the destructive power 
is constant a slight increase in coordination increases the total 
destructiveness enormously. 

On the other hand the issue of counteracting these threats appears 
to have a technology multiplier that largely depends on improved 
coordination from law enforcement agencies; while new tech in 
itself might help the actual enforcement the main issue is 
detecting these threats before they cause damage, and this is an 
area where clearly there is a big gap. It seems likely that 
improvements are possible, and in the long run much of the 
advantage to terrorist coordination might vanish due to 
transparency or monitoring - if the probability of revealing an 
attack plan per person involved becomes large enough the only 
effective terrorist cells would be extremely small and isolated, 
bringing the problem back to the irrational individual problem 
mentioned earlier.

Well, regarding socialism, it really doesn't matter what we call it. For 
example, if you want to insist on calling any sort of brutal tyranny 
socialism, I don't think that is a definition which really makes sense--but 
it doesn't really matter. What matters is that we have a concept at all 
which embodies a stateless, propertyless society. Now, you can say, well, is 
that an oxymoron? I don't think it is, but the important thing is that we 
have the concept at all. It's like in 1984, when they invent Newspeak, they 
don't do it just to give you another word for freedom, they get rid of the 
word entirely.

Alexander,
       Could you please document that?  I am not aware of anyone lumping 
tyrannies into socialism.  The only tyrannies I have ever heard referred to 
as socialist where ones that were claimed to be socialist by their adherents 
and admirers.
       Usually things work just the opposite direction -- as soon as a 
socialist government fails its admirers try to define it out of the socialist 
camp -- witness Hitler's Germany and Mussolini's Italy where many socialists 
today try to claim those two were capitalists.

"Yes. In most cases the two would start to diverge almost immediately and
the
differences would only increase as time went by. That's why the prospect of
getting vaporized would make me rather unhappy if my backup was older than a
second or two."

> But both are not made up of the *same* atoms.

"The way to tell if two objects are the *same* is to exchange them and note
the changes; if you do this for atoms absolutely nothing changes. Atoms have
no individuality, if they can't even give this interesting property to
themselves how can they give it to us? I'll give you an example."

That is one way to tell if objects are the 'same'.  If I change one atom in
my pattern, you are right, there are no discernable changes.  But if I
change *all* atoms in my pattern, there is a discernable change.  Because if
I did the equivalent of recreating my pattern with a new group of atoms, the
original pattern with the original atoms will not experience the same
subjective events that the new pattern with the new group of atoms
experiences, thus they are different beings.  This is the core of my
argument.  If you copy and original, the original and the copy do not share
the same sensory experience, so they *must not* be the same person (that is,
*one* entity)  They may be the same as in they are both identical to one
another (as the change in time approaches zero) but they are two distinct
separate entities.  Similarly, if you copy an original and destroy the
original, there is no reason to suspect that this new copy is a continuation
of the subjective experience of the original.  To presume as much would
imply that the original and the copy are telepathically linked in some way,
this is quite unscientific.  It would be easy to prove they are not by just
not destroying the original, and then asking them both if they are sensing
the same events.  If they are not, then a copy is not the continuation of
the consciousness of the original.  I have asserted through these logical
arguments that to maintain a continuation of consciousness or subjective
experience one must retain the same pattern in the same atoms (that is, in
the atoms that make up that pattern)  

To use your example of vaporization, if you backed yourself up, and then
were vaporized, your backup would not remember being vaporized.  *you* were
the one who was vaporized.  If your backup does not remember that, then it
is not *you*, it is a copy of you from a few seconds before.  You would not
feel as though you woke up after being vaporized.

"In my right hand I'm holding a hydrogen atom,... but according to the laws
of physics it is imposable to tell even in theory who
is Ed and who is Ted, both now have the same history. Stuff like that
happens all the time at the quantum level. "

It does not happen at the macroscopic level, so the analogy is flawed.  A
better analogy would be to assume that you were to take to hydrogen atoms
and mix them up and then ask which was the one in your left hand before you
mixed them up.  I could not tell, of course, but that does not mean that at
one point in time one of them was in your left hand and it does not mean
that they are actually 'one' hydrogen atom, as I can clearly see one in each
hand.

"Here we have a case where the laws of Physics say it is imposable to ever
tell the difference between two things and you say nevertheless there is a
huge difference between the two."

The huge difference is that they are two distinct separate entities.  In the
case of sub-atomic particles, one is at point xyz in space and the other is
at point x+1,y+1,z+1 in space.  They exist in two separate spaces, thus they
are two different entities.  I can point at them, one with each finger, and
say 'see, they are two different particles, they may be the 'same', but they
are two distinct particles'  In the case of an original and a copy, they may
also not have any test to tell them apart, but one of them came out of the
copy end of the scanner copier and the other came out of the scanner end.
Also, the most significant factor telling them apart is that there are *two*
of them, one on my right side on my left.  Again, I can point at them and
say 'see, they are two distinct separate entities that exist independently
from one another'  To assert that there is 'no difference' between them is
to not acknowledge that there are two of them.  

"You could state exactly the same thing more concisely and honestly simply
by saying they are different because they have a different soul. You could
say it, but I don't care to."

A soul is not necessary to invoke, it is only necessary to look and see two
distinct separate entities to realize that there are two of them.  

> Just because you don't know, or can't know, the
> difference, doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

"I think I'll stick to the scientific method."

If so, them demonstrate to us, logically and scientifically, that it is
reasonable to assume a copy of me shares the same subjective experience as I
do.

No, given their weekly to daily frequency at this point
that would tend to clutter the list more than it already is.
I would prefer to focus on the significant events.  I think the
situation in Russia currently qualifies in that respect.

While the debate of ongoing and seemingly irresolvable conflicts
seems pointless (the Israeli-Palestinian situation comes to mind),
the debate of a resolvable conflict seems worthy of discussion.
The resolution in this situation could range from deporting all
Chechnyans, as Stalin did, to simply freeing Chechnya from Russia.

It begs a number of extropic issues that go back at least to the
U.S. civil war -- when does one let "your" people go?

There isn't better communications here.  That has existed for decades.
What is here seems to be an increasing core concept that it is
reasonable to sacrifice ones life for a concept.  Even if the
Russians pull out of Chechnya -- do you think they will let the
terrorists go free/unpunished?  That doesn't fit the Russian mindset
IMO.  The terrorists have already killed at least one person.

I can't believe that the coordination is significantly greater now
than a Roman legion had 2000 years ago.  I don't see the Chechnyans
running around like secret service agents with two way communication
capabilities.

If anything the coordination advantages seem to be on the side
of those enforcing the law.  What seems to be taking place on
the terrorist side is an increasing willingness to sacrifice oneself.

Yes, but the same transparency and monitoring that can defeat
terrorist organizations seem likely to defeat organizations that
would (legitimately) seek to overthrow an oppressive regime.

It would seem that to preserve our safety and security we may
have to give up our ability to overthrow a government that has
"cooked the books" so to speak.  [In the U.S. the memories of
the Nixon era have not completely faded.]

I think that was an *excellent* message from you, Jef. I cannot find in
it even a single objectionable thought. We seem to be entirely on the

Comment and question to Lee:

Comment: 

Your paper "The Seven Levels of Identity" is I think misnamed. A better
title would be "Seven Opinions about Identity." 

Question:

You write that "one is lead inexorably through countless thought
experiments to level seven." Level seven is described by you as "the
subject believes that any physical object at any coordinates whatsoever
is the same person that he or she is, provided only that the physical
process running in the object resembles him or her closely enough."

My question is this: 

Given that current conceptions and emotions arise largely in response to
current perceptions, how can a person/object be identical to the subject
now if that person/object is located at distant coordinates such that he
does not share the subject's perceptions?

To put it another way...

If that guy over there who looks like Lee Corbin isn't thinking and
feeling and experiencing everything you are thinking, feeling and
experiencing, then how is that guy over there any different from your
identical twin brother?

There is also the issue of low-trust societies. This is a case of two
extremely low-trust societies (or one, depending on one's view) coming
into conflict. In a high-trust society the Chechnya issue would have
been dealt with using political methods more or less accepted by the
people involved, in a low-trust society there is no trust in any other
process than coercion. The problem could be reformulated as "how do we
help develop more high-trust societies?" (which is good from a purely
selfish point of view too, since we can trade more profitably with
high-trust societies and don't have to worry about terrorists from
them).

This may become significantly troublesome if mankind starts to clade in 
interesting ways. But even before then there are issues of people 
wanting to set up societies with different granularity. There does not 
seem to be any workable protocol for it at present (even in extreme 
high-trust societies "national interests" are allowed to dominate such 
processes, e.g. in the land island question between Sweden, Finland and 
the people of land).

Hmm, time for some thinking caps. Ideally we should have a way of 
overthrow governments in a democratic way. An imaginary box with the 
sign "In case of national emergency, break glass" that could only be 
activated if a sufficient number of citizens pushed, but could not be 
removed or blocked by the government (and it could not tell who had been 
pushing the glass either). 

In democratic nations much of this system is implemented as
constitutional mechanisms, relying on the difficulty of corrupting
systems with distributed power. The above "box" could after all be
implemented as an automatic impeachment order if a sufficient number of
crypto-validated signatures were received. But it would be more elegant
if it could be implemented on a deeper level, including being tacked on 
to unwilling governments.

I agree wholeheartedly that copies made in different locations are
suspect due to different sensory experience. However imagine a situation
in which we instantaneously destroy and replace your original person
with an exact copy in the exact same position, but made from entirely
different atoms. If I understand you correctly, you are arguing that the
use of different atoms would mean that you would die and that your copy
would not be you. If so then I disagree.

In the special case I describe above I think you would continue as the
same person with same sense of self. In fact you would have no way to
know that anything had actually occurred. The only requirement for this
continuity of self would be that the replacement process take place in
the blink of an eye -- in a time interval shorter than the quantum
interval of time -- such that the duplicated atoms and particles would
appear in exactly the same states as your original atoms and particles.

This observation above is what leads to me ponder the possibility of
instantaneous destructive teleportation. If what I say in the above
paragraph is true then instant destructive teleportation might also work
if the original quantum states (with adjustments for position) could be
duplicated instantaneously by an assemblage of particles at the
destination location.

In the case of instantaneous non-destructive teleportation, in which
your original survives, the two versions of you would diverge in the
first moment such that two distinct people would exist. Those two
distinct people would be like identical twins who share some memories in
common. They would be intimately related, but neither would consider
himself to be the other.

 (You're right.  I can tell from her fiction that I wouldn't adopt her

quite uncommon.  But she might well still have good definitions.)

Yeah.  Bertrand Russell's paradox.  Heinlein's answer was she wasn't a 
man.  My answer was he lived outside of town.  Same kind of answer.  But 
the important thing to notice was that this was a fiction being accepted 
as-if it were a fact.  When you run into this kind of paradox, that's 
the first thing to look for.  There are other logically possible 
answers, but most commonly there is a fiction involved in the statement 
of the case.

No.  That is an invalid answer.  A public executioner kills people for a 
living.  If killing people is bad, per se, then he is a bad person, 
regardless of whether he is doing it for the state or not.  Et 
multitudinous cetera.

There are several ways out of this.  One is to discard the blanket rule 
that killing people is bad.  Then we need to very carefully craft a rule 
that says just exactly what we mean.  Is it permissible to use deadly 
force to defend yourself?  What about to defend someone else?  What 
evidence is required to show that this was reasonable, etc.

Another way out is just to declare that killing people is bad.  And then 
to decide that there won't be any publically sponsored killers.  Then 
you have the problem of the army, of defending yourself against 
invaders, and things get complicated again.

Or you could decide that killing people is ok.  This leads to 
complications which are worked out physically rather than 
legalistically.  Lots of people get severely hurt this way.

But saying that it's ok as long as you do it as a job is just 
unacceptable (to me).

If they only have theoretical meanings, and can't be recognized as a 
physical appearance, then they are merely spooks.  Theological whimsies 
left over from the middle ages.  I suspect that they actually have more 
meaning that that, though I will admit that formulating it is a bit of

What you say may be true.  Without a good definition I can't tell.  I do 
know that many people who have attempted to tell me what socialism or 
capitalism meant have pointed at examples drawn from personal life.  The 
kid's lemonaide stand (subsidized by the parents), is held as an example 
of capitalism, though it seems to me that it could equally be used as an 
example of socialism.  (And I haven't seen one in the last four decades. 
 Are business licenses capitalist or socialist?  And when did they start 
being enforced against kids?  Or is there some other reason?  [Chain 
stores, perhaps?])

I think we should focus more on trends than singe events. The current
event is not specifically oversignificant for that specific location and
time, it's just less than order of magnitude bigger (I've got used to
Chechen bombings while being in Moscow; the current bodycount of victims
is what? 300? Otoh while I was looking for a place to do PhD I
specifically rejected Israel for climate and personal safety reasons).  
Qualitative changes (such as use of weapons of mass destruction by
whoever) are clearly discussable on their own.

This conflict is luckily localized. It poses no hazards to those not
having ties to that area. Ties to that area are clearly a liability, and
something which should be minimized. This involves both political and
economical ties. We've wasted three decades not developing alternatives to
fossil energy at a high priority. Luckily, we are at the threshold where
the natural course of events will cause a slow change. Perhaps this is the 
time to use federal funding to boost such research, and offer tax 
incitements to promote its use.

It is pretty useless discussing this conflict on this list, because the
bulk of participants do not know the history of the conflict, and have no
personal stake in the matter (or so I hope). Our opinions are thus rather
worthless, frankly.

Of course, terrorism works. People are notoriously lousy at risk

Shouldn't we rather look at the trend, which seems to be emergence of a
new axis of conflict between very different adversaries, which impact it
has on us personally, and how this might impact the trend in technology
development?

This is not new. What is interesting how this will influence our rights,
and the degree of surveillance this is going to result in. I am personally
not interested in living in a dystopic version of Brinworld just because a
few people show an increasing willingness to sacrifice themselves, while
still sticking to low-tech means.

Exactly. This is the core issue. Blood and shredded meat gets all the

This would seem to be an error in judgement. Right now the personal risk
is negligible, and could be further considerably reduced by changing the
behaviour of people while minimizing the usual security snake oil approach
that applies to the voters and selects for blind activism (if not a hidden
agenda, as there's large personal profits to be made in the turmoil).

It is of course completely impossible to imagine quantum systems in the

yet are indistinguishable (I repeat my usual recommendation to reread the
appendices for "The Physics of Immortality" for a sketch of a proof why
you would die instantly if this was not the case). I wonder why I keep

As usually, physics (which I claim no specific understanding in, despite
having survived PCIII) is either being played fast and loose with, or sees
a highly selective interpretation. If you iterate this, you'll a mechanism
by which people with a clue are being silenced, or driven off the list.

Nevermind the fact that systems in the same quantum state are a gedanken
to illustrate a concept, while synchronizing large scale evolution of
deterministic systems is practically possible, and in fact trivial, albeit 
done rarely as there is not much need for it in practice.

What I would really welcome to hear is a succinct explanation of evolution
of (macroscopic or nanoscopic) deterministic discrete systems given in
terms of quantum energy levels (rather, groups thereof) and transitions. I
have some very faint idea which I would like to put some meat on.

Yes, I also hope to learn something from this thread.

Strangely, or perhaps not so strangely, I find myself pondering
political philosophy in the context of this discussion. 

That I should share my personal identity with another person who cannot
fully share my personal experience of life seems, well, downright
un-American. :)

If that's the core then I don't see what were arguing about. I've said many
times that usually (but not always) the two would not share the same sensory
experience and yes that would soon make them non identical and yes that
would soon make them different people. All I'm saying is that as long as
they remain the same (and that won't be long in most cases) there is only
one person.

Oh I think there is an excellent reason to suspect a continuation of
consciousness, just ask the fellow if he had any subjective experience
yesterday or last month or last year and I'll bet he'll say "yes". In fact
you will probably have an extremely difficult time convincing him that he's
the copy made just last night and not the original. I'll just say that if I
am the copy and the original John Clark was vaporized last night an instant
after I was made then I don't care in the least if the same thing happens
again tonight because I feel fine.

    > It does not happen at the macroscopic level, so the analogy is flawed.

Macroscopic objects are made of atoms, you say atoms are what give us a
unique subjective experience but science says atoms are identical and I just
don't see how something without individuality can give us individuality.
Besides your atoms are in flux, you are literally not the man you were a
year ago.

Are they? How do you know they are not constantly exchanging positions? It's
not as silly a question as it may sound at first because that thought
experiment is at the core of one of the most important ideas in modern
physics, exchange forces. The general idea is that you describe two
electrons mathematically in two different way and then (mathematically)
instantly exchange them, now although the equations at first seem very
different you know that all electrons are the same so the system has not
changed and by knowing that two completely different looking equations
are really the same all sorts of interesting things can be found.

    > A soul is not necessary to invoke,

The laws of Physics say the two atoms are identical and a difference in
their history can never be found even in theory but you say the two are
nevertheless somehow very different. The laws of Physics say it's bread and
wine but a Catholic says it's the body and blood of Jesus Christ. Six of
one, half a dozen for the other.

Well, I wasn't aiming for agreement, just clarity of both sides of the

"Concentrations of power are dangerous, and antithetical to freedom. I'm 
more interested in maintaining (encouraging) freedom than I am in
forwarding any particular economic theory, whether it is "natural" or not."

I agree. Dogmatic political theories are arbitrary and don't really make a 
whole of sense as far as I can see. Marxism would be an example. There is no 
particular reason to even treat the collection of ideas which we call 
Marxism as a coherent body of concepts, I tend to think in fact that some 
are conductive to libery and some aren't. So, you have to pick and choose. 
Nobody has "the answers", they evolve as society evolves, and it is often 
necessary to experiment.

>From another message,

Interesting enough to mention him-- Mussolini once said "Fascism may as well 
be called corporatism because it represents the merger of state and 
corporate power".

>From still another message,

"Now that alone is one of the more idiotic things said in this
diatribe (not that there's any shortage)"

I think mabye you should try to interpret the context in which that was 
meant. I don't really have much idea of what you mean by chaos... what do 
you mean? I assumed when you said chaos that you meant people not having any 
knolwedge of what other people were doing around them, and hence not 
participating in the collective affairs of large groups of people. If you 
just mean that central authority is bad, that decentralization is good-- 
then I certainly agree. There are a lot of terms here where we can just jump 
on eachother and start shouting about how stupid the other side is, or we 
can try to find out how we're defining terms, and what our underlying 
assumptions on both sides are, and reach some sort of common conclusion.

In fact, I once met a person who said that all the political problems of the 
world were essentially a communication problem. Perhaps, at least in a 
certain sense, that is the case.

"I agree wholeheartedly that copies made in different locations are
suspect due to different sensory experience. However imagine a situation
in which we instantaneously destroy and replace your original person
with an exact copy in the exact same position, but made from entirely
different atoms. If I understand you correctly, you are arguing that the
use of different atoms would mean that you would die and that your copy
would not be you. If so then I disagree."

AND 

"This observation above is what leads to me ponder the possibility of
instantaneous destructive teleportation. If what I say in the above
paragraph is true then instant destructive teleportation might also work
if the original quantum states (with adjustments for position) could be
duplicated instantaneously by an assemblage of particles at the
destination location."

That would indeed be the implications of my argument.  In its simplest form,
that fact that the copy appears in the same place as the original in the
same state removes the only differentiating factor available before, that of
position.  This falls inline with the same argument of whether or not we are
continually destroyed and recreated as we move through time.  As I
understand it, there is no interval of time shorter than the plank length,
thus any sub atomic particles that exist through time do not have a smooth
continuous existence, but instead of many brief existences that are tied
only by their average similarity in space and time.  (the same could be said
of moving through space) The implications of this can destroy my theory or
support it, here are the two scenarios I can think of.

As all matter travels through time, it exists in many short finite intervals
of time, not as a continuous smooth timeline.  

(bare with me here as my wording my not be up to par with current lingo)

1) does all matter share the same intervals, that is, if we re to view the
existence through time of subatomic particles through some hypothetical
unaffected observer, would particles be in synch with one another in the
process of being destroyed and recreated at every planck length interval of
time?  OR..

2) does each sub atomic particle have its own unique timing through the
quanta of time.  That is, if we were observing multiple sub atomic
particles, would all of their destructions and recreations occur at
different times when compared with one another?

As I noted above, I believe the same concern exists when moving through
space, as space does not exist in any smaller intervals than the Planck
length, and the same two scenarios would apply when moving through space.

I have no idea which of these is the accurate description of reality, or if
we even know (or can know) or even if I explained it clear enough to make
any sense to anyone else!

But assuming that one of these is an accurate description of reality, then
the implications are significantly different in regards to copying.  In case
one, essentially, the entire universe pops into and out of existence at
every Planck length interval of time at the same time.  This necessarily
means that any being in it, composed of a pattern of matter, also pops into
and out of existence at this small interval of time.  If this is the case,
then it matters not if I were destroyed and teleported somewhere else
instantly, because the only difference between that and what happens all the
time is the position, which I do not feel it is reasonable to presume has
any bearing on continual subjective consciousness.  This requires,
obviously, that the scanning / copying / teleporting process takes place at
the plank length of time, in any interval longer the situation changes as
the two scenarios are no longer identical.   If this is the way the universe
works, then I agree with you in your objection.

Assuming that case 2 is the accurate description of reality, then this
satisfies one of my previously mentioned requirements, that at any one
instant in time the vast majority of the stuff that makes up your pattern is
the same that it was an instant of time before.  If that were the case then
destructive scanning copying transporting would violate that, and make none
of the things that made up my pattern part of the things that made up my
pattern the instant before.  In this case I would not agree with your
objection, and would not consider myself the same person if all of my
particles were instantly destroyed and recreated by others at the very next
instant in time.

I have the sneeking suspicion that case 2 is the more accurate description
of reality, but that may be mere wishfull thinking.

Michael

I agree. In fact I think the words "original" and "copy" have no real
meaning in any discussion of perfect copying. It makes as much sense to
say there are two copies of the original after the copy event as it does
to say there is one copy and one original after the copy event. For the
sake of clarity I think these terms really ought not be used. Better to
use the term I've seen Eugene use here: "forking"

In a perfect emulation, the person "forks," diverging immediately into
two distinct persons with two distinct experiences and two distinct
cognitive processes and thus also two distinct personalities.

Yes. It is very possible that the universe ultimately contains only a
single electron, only a single proton, only a single neutron, etc.
(Kinda' reminds me of Platonism.)

The point of the arguments from quantum synchronization (which, as Eugene
pointed out, does not have to be done via "cloning" necessarily) is MERELY
to show that identity doesn't inhere in the atoms you happen to occupy at
this second.

The proof goes like this: IF the two xoxes A and B are synchronized in
their quantum properties (perhaps by chance!), then they could be
interchanged without changing the physical state *or the logical state* of
the system.  There could be no logical way to distinguish the "switched
state" from the "unswitched state", *not even by reference to the history
of A and B.*

To answer Michael/Jef's objections, *even the history gets obscured in
this example*.  If mere history was enough to distingush particles with
perfectly similar quantum properties, *even logically* [by name], a
variety of important proofs in physics would fall apart.  (I recall Tipler
mentions the law of mass action as another example, aside from the
well-known argument for the Pauli Exclusion Principle.)  They rely on the
assumption that the physical state is the *same* post switch; if it was
different, even logically, even with reference to its history, then the
arguments for these important physical principles would fail, and we'd
have no understanding of modern chemistry.

It's just a funny fact about our world that when you jigger things up in
just the right way, switched particles become formally indistinguishable
from unswitched particles, even by name or by history.

But all this shows, all it's even TRYING to show, is that identity doesn't
inhere in the atoms.  (The more trivial proof of this is that we consider
ourselves to persist over many years, even though we cycle through all of
our atoms in that time.  Atoms just aren't where it's at.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

But if identity doesn't inhere in the atoms *or* in the history of those
atoms, then in what does it inhere?  How can you tell whether something
counts as "you" or not?  The answer, as I've argued, is "whatever we
decide is relevant."

Functionalists will be happy to announce "the same person" so long as they
have the same function.  Mentalists might announce "the same person" only
as long as they have the same "mental states" (which had better supervene
on the physical states somehow, or else you're talking about souls).

But you'll need to give up on the idea that it's [the history of] your
atoms that keeps xoxes unique from each other.  The atoms just aren't
where it's at.

"If that's the core then I don't see what were arguing about. I've said many
times that usually (but not always) the two would not share the same sensory
experience and yes that would soon make them non identical and yes that
would soon make them different people. All I'm saying is that as long as
they remain the same (and that won't be long in most cases) there is only
one person."

Then this is where we disagree.  There is not 'one person' because there are
obviously two of them standing in front of me, even if they are in boxes and
sharing the same sensory input.  Unless they share the same exact subjective
experience at the same exact time (that is, they are two manifestations of
one consciousness) then they are logically not one person.  You can say that
the appear to be if there external conditions are manipulated to make them
appear to share the same experiences (e.g. put them both in black boxes, for
instance) but the second they are outside of identical subjective
experience, it is clear that they do not share the same subjective
experience.  If they do not share it outside their box, why do you propose
that the nature of the universe alters the second they step into that box?
At no point in time are they 'one' person as A) they are not two
manifestations of one consciousness and b) are obviously two people.  Please
point out the flaw in this logic.

"Oh I think there is an excellent reason to suspect a continuation of
consciousness, just ask the fellow if he had any subjective experience
yesterday or last month or last year and I'll bet he'll say "yes"."

So because he thinks he had continually subjective experience then he did?
I was not aware that our thoughts formed the structure of the universe.
What if we copied the pattern and reproduced as a computer program and that
computer program insisted that it had its own subjective history.  Would you
consider that a continuation of the subjective history of the original, who
stands outside the computer looking amused at the computer program?  It is
quite obvious that even though this program (i.e., a different manifestation
of this pattern) believes itself to be the continuation of the consciousness
of the original, it does not make it so, and it is not a continuation, as
this is clearly impossible with the original still around and watching the
even.  If we kill off the original, this does not make the problem
disappear, the copy is still not a continuation of the original conscious
subjective experience.

   > It does not happen at the macroscopic level, so the analogy is flawed.

"Macroscopic objects are made of atoms, you say atoms are what give us a
unique subjective experience but science says atoms are identical and I just
don't see how something without individuality can give us individuality."

That is not what I said, please stop mischaracterizing my arguments.  At no
point in time did I imply that any particular atom has any property
different from any other of the same type.  In fact I explicitly stated that
this is not the case.  The only significance to these atoms is that 1) they
are the atoms that the pattern is made of (all other atoms in the universe
are not part of the atoms that make up this pattern) and 2) that vast
majority of the atoms that make up this pattern at any particular instant in
time is the same ones that made up the pattern at the instant before.

"Besides your atoms are in flux, you are literally not the man you were a
year ago."

Again, at any particular instant in time the atoms that make up your pattern
are the same ones that made up your pattern the instant before.  If all of
them change over a great deal of time, it matters not, because from one
instant of time to the next, that vast majority of them are identical.  If
your pattern was comprised of 100 atoms, and atom 01 was replaced at one
instant in time, then at the next instant in time your pattern is now also
comprised of 100 atoms, but atom 01 is now atom 01a.  This does not change
the fact that NOW at this instant, your pattern is comprised of 100 atoms,
at the next instant, atom 74 may be replaced by 74a.  But at any one
particular instant in time, 99 of your atoms that comprise your pattern were
the same as the instant before.  It matters not that ALL of your atoms are
replaced over a great deal of time at one at a time, it matters if ALL of
your atoms are replaced AT ONCE.  There is a significant difference between
these two scenarios, in one of them almost every single atom that made up
your patter was present at the instant before.  In the other NONE of your
atoms that made up your pattern before are present.  We can clearly show
that in the second case, when NONE of your atoms are the ones that made up
your pattern before, that the new pattern made of new atoms is a different
person, because it does not share the same subjective experience as the
original group of atoms.  You seem to assert that replacing one atom at a
time is no different then replacing all atoms.  This does not seem
logically, given the circumstance described above.

"Are they? How do you know they are not constantly exchanging positions?
It's not as silly a question as it may sound at first because that thought
experiment is at the core of one of the most important ideas in modern
physics, exchange forces."

Is there any evidence to suggest that they are as the simplest explanation?
If not, then it is more reasonable to assume that they are not then it is to
assume that they are.  You have mentioned using the scientific methodology
before, the scientific methodology does not place all possible explanations
as equally likely. 

    > A soul is not necessary to invoke,

"The laws of Physics say the two atoms are identical and a difference in
their history can never be found even in theory but you say the two are
nevertheless somehow very different."

I say they are different because one is in one place and the other is in a
different place.  Actually, every atom is different because they are all in
different places.  Do you dispute this?  If you do, then you must be
insisting that all atoms are in the same place simultaneously, have any
experimental evidence that suggests this as the simplest explanation?  They
are even more significantly different in this scenario because of ones
location it may be part of a pattern that creates a sentient being, while
another may be part of a pattern of a rock.  Is this not a significant
difference?

I agree. In fact I think the words "original" and "copy" have no real
meaning in any discussion of perfect copying. 

This must be where your and my opinions diverge then.  If one of these
entities steps out of the scanning side of the machine, he is obviously the
'original'  If one of these entities atoms that comprised his pattern were
at the moment before scanning also part of the groups of atoms that made up
his pattern, then this is clearly different from the 'copy'.  The copies
atoms that make up his pattern at the previous instant in time were
obviously part of a different structure, perhaps a pile of stock atoms ready
to be assembled.  In these cases, the atoms of the original are 'different'
from those of the copy in a recognizable manner.  

Similarly, as mentioned above, if the vast majority of the atoms that are
present in the original were present in the original at the previous instant
in time then it is reasonable to assume he has had a subjective continuation
of consciousness.  It is reasonable to assume this since the opposite of
almost all atoms being present at the instant before is no atoms being
present at the instant before but sharing the same pattern can be clearly
shown to NOT produce a continuation of consciousness (ask a copy and an
original if they see the same thing) in only two logical scenarios one can
be proven not true, then the other must be true.

"Indeed you are not even the same man you were a moment ago."

Which is something I have never disputed.  We are all different as we travel
through time, but as the above example about atoms making up the pattern
attempts to show is that there is a significant difference between very few
atoms being replaced at one instant to the next verses every atom being
replaced at one instant to the next.  one (the later) clearly does not
include a subjective continuity of consciousness.

This statement and objection also implies that ALL ATOMS must remain the
same for continuity to continue, thus if all atoms are eventually replaced,
continuity is destroyed, thus, so this argument seems to go, it does not
matter if they are replaced all at once or one at time.  The above thought
experiment clearly shows, however, why replacing all of the atoms at once is
different then replacing one at a time, as replacing all creates a new
entity with its own subjective consciousness.  I only argue that the vast
majority of atoms need to be the same as the ones that were present the
previous instant.  The fact that all atoms are otherwise identical is what
makes it possible for you to both 'not be the same man you were a moment
ago' (made of all the same atoms) while simultaneously still being the same
man you were a moment ago (pattern) the key difference is the RATE of
replacement.

"Yes. It is very possible that the universe ultimately contains only a
single electron, only a single proton, only a single neutron, etc. (Kinda'
reminds me of Platonism.)"

It is possible, but it is not likely.  Would you bet your life on the
'possibility' that the universe is made up of only one proton, one nuetron,
and one electron?  Or would you bet your life on the 'possibility' that the
universe is made up of the number of electrons, protons, and nuetrons that
seem to be present by counting.

"To answer Michael/Jef's objections, *even the history gets obscured in
this example*.  If mere history was enough to distingush particles with
perfectly similar quantum properties, *even logically* [by name], a
variety of important proofs in physics would fall apart."

Those are the same innacurate representations of my argument that John seems
to subscribe to.  I have never asserted that any particular atom has some
magical signature that makes us able to tell it apart from all others.  The
driving factor of this argument is that if two sub atomic particles, other
indistinguishable, are indeed recognizable as 'two' seperate particles, then
they must, be definition, be different in some way.  As GTS pointed out,
position is part of the quantum description of a particle that is also
described by the Pauli Exclusion principle, which means no two fermions can
take up the same space at the same time.  If it is acceptable to agree that
two atoms exist, and not just one, then, if they are otherwise identical, we
must be able to tell them apart by where they are.  We can easily see that
one is part of a pattern that makes up a consciouss entity, while the other
is part of a homogenous pile of atoms that is ready to be assembled into a
copy of another pattern.  At this state in time, these atoms are clearly
different from one another.  

"But if identity doesn't inhere in the atoms *or* in the history of those
atoms, then in what does it inhere?  How can you tell whether something
counts as "you" or not?  The answer, as I've argued, is "whatever we
decide is relevant.""

I of course disagree, it is not a case of whatever we believe is fine.  It
is quite clear that a copy and an original do not share the SAME subjective
experience, if they do not, then the copy can not be considered a
continuation of the subjective conscious experience of the original, but
instead must be considered a separate unique being.  

   ----------------------

Ok, whats the problem here?  Do other posters find me grossly incapable of
clearly expressing my ideas?  This seems like I keep saying these same
things over and over again and are not seeing what I consider to be valid
objections or, it seems, even accurate representations of what I am saying?


Please point out the faults in my originally represented thought experiments
and I will concede defeat on any point that is show to be logically invalid,
I am not in the business of merely ideologically defending my ideas, I truly
see this as the simplest explanation for the way the world is, if someone
can point to me why this is not the simplest explanation, please inform me!

1) - the pattern is important to subjective continuity of consciousness

if we destroy the pattern, but keep the atoms, continuity appears to be
destroyed.  e.g. mashed up an originals brain in a blender, same atoms,
different pattern, no response to question 'who are you?'

2) - the atoms are important to subjective continuity of consciousness

if we keep the pattern, but use different atoms, continuity appears to be
destroyed.  e.g. arranged new group of atoms into pattern identical to
original, copy can not experience any subjective sensations that original
does, therefore the subjective experience of original and copy are isolated
and separate.

(note, it is not the particular atoms that have a magic property, it only
matters that some were member of a pattern of a conscious entity, while
other did not make up that particular pattern)

3 - the rate of atom replacement is critical

if too many atoms are replaced at once, subjective consciousness continuity
is not present.  e.g. we replace all atoms, use the same pattern, copy does
not experience the same subjective sensations that the original does.  If
very few atoms are replaced, subjective continuity of conscious appears to
be retained.  At any given moment the vast majority of the atoms are the
same ones that were present in the previous moment.

Michael

I do not know if the quantum cloning is relevant,
or not, in the present discussion. Maybe not (as
Eugene et al. pointed out).

Anyway, from the philosophical point of view, it might be
interesting to say there are, in theory, two kinds of quantum 
cloning machines.

A deterministic quantum cloning machine, which performs 
unitary operations (unitary evolution is deterministic).

A probabilistic quantum cloning machine, which performs 
measurements and also unitary operations, with a 
'postselection' of the measurement results (and copies 
are produced with certain probabilities).

Now there are two quantum no-cloning theorems. 
1. An arbitrary unknown state can not be cloned, deterministically 
or probabilistically, since the linearity of quantum mechanics 
forbids xoxing; 
2. Deterministic cloning of non-orthogonal states is impossible 
because of the unitarity of the evolution).

But these theorems do not rule out the possibility of *probabilistic* 
cloning of non-orthogonal states. In example the states secretly 
chosen (from a certain set) can be probabilistically cloned if 
they are linearly independent. The probabilistic quantum cloning 
machine yields perfect copies of the original states, but with 
certain probabilities of success.

Due to the existing links between quantum no-cloning, no-ftl-signaling,
Heisenberg's principle (quantum cloning breaks this principle,
because you could measure position of a particle and momentum of
its clone!) it is interesting to check if a *probabilistic* quantum
cloning machine might ....

Ha-ha. Btw, reading the proceedings of the 1927 Solvay Conference
I realized that W. Pauli (you know, very close to Jung!) sketched
a model (for the so called reduction of the probability wavepacket)
which was ... (hold your breath) ... the Many-Worlds Interpretation.
Of course Pauli was a much more professional physicist (and also
philosopher) and called his model the Many Dimensions Interpretation.
(Unfortunately M. Born stopped Pauli using the old argument of mr.

Networking is a good idea.  A year or two ago there were those small 
toys that could "learn" from each other - I forget what they're 
called.... furbies?

When I think of "stuffed animal" and "technology" I think of the 
following components:

- exterior cover/skin/fur
- chassis
- low-power electrical components (LEDs)
- higher-powered electrical components (voice-box, data bank, motors)
- battery

As each of these areas improve over time, so do the possibilities of 
their application in stuffed animals.  More skin-like skin, more 
fur-like fur.  Lighter chassis.  Perhaps the use of OLEDs?  Greater 
data storage density.  Batteries with longer life - maybe a fuel cell?

As PDAs and digital assistant software are becoming more prevalent in 
the marketplace, I wouldn't be surprised to see some of this 
functionality ported to an Aibo-like device.  As personal assistants 
get more personal, are consumers going to want them embodied?

For those on this list that are really forward-thinking, that sort of 
device would probably be old-hat.  If the functionality can live in 
your computer, why externalize it?  It might help slow tech-adopters to 
have a "plastic pal that's fun to be with" -- as long as it's not too 
paranoid.

I can offer two working definitions for socialist society.

One, the government controls the means of production.  Under this sort
of situation, individuals might still have private property and make
some economic decisions for themselves, such as what to buy, but they
cannot start or run private businesses.

Two, a society where private property has been forbidden.  (I use
"forbidden" here because in a socialist society it can't just be by
default, else private property might arise -- or re-arise -- and that
must be prevented for it to be this kind of socialism.)  Under this
condition, all economic decisions are made by the government.

I offer up these up as working definitions.  If there are any people
proclaiming themselves to be socialists on this list, it might be better
to ask them what they mean by the term -- i.e., for them to define it.
(I haven't been closely following the discussion, so I don't know if any
have.)

My two cents worth!

#Extropy Chat - Oct 26, 2002 - Door-prize, Schedule

On Sat 26 Oct 2002, at 2:00 PM EDT (GMT-5; see the official US clock
at http://www.time.gov/timezone.cgi?Eastern/d/-5/java for the current
EDT time), all interested entities (extropians and other
transhumanists, cryonicists, immortalists, etc.) are invited to
participate in the Extropy Institute chat. (You do not have to be an
ExI member to attend.) Logs of previous chats are available at
http://www.extropy.org/forums/

Jay Dugger has generously agreed to provide a door-prize for this
chat session: Wolfram's "A New Kind of Science".

Extropians chat takes place on ExI's own IRC server, at
irc.extropy.org:6667, channel #extropy . If you don't already have
an IRC client program, you can either download one from
http://www.irchelp.org/ (which also has good introductions for new
users), or use a Java chat applet at http://www.extropy.org/bbs/

Schedule FYI: Chats are held at 2:00 PM EDT on the last Saturday of
each month.

This means next month's will be on November 30.

Well, I *do* understand what he is saying, but bow to your

Quite so.

Yes, thank you.  But it's common for this to happen in 
threads, and of course I don't mind.  But those tangents
are not about *my* point (not that those other points
are less important, of course).

About what?  You haven't said anything about where you
find what I'm saying to be ridiculous.  In fact, you
very fairly summed it up above as "It comes down to
whether or not you accept this radical definition of
identity as useful."

Well, I say it *is* useful, and proclaim that my notion
of identity---which dictates acceptance of level 7 in
my hierarchy---is what naturally evolves in SF scenarios
and that the "pattern theory of identity", as most fully
explained in Mike Perry's "Forever for All", is what will
one day be commonplace as programs rule.

Quite seriously, people should read "Forever for All"
if you are interested in seeing the future and saving
your life.  Not only are there great and definitive
discussions about identity (with which I wholeheartedly
agree, by the way), but it's a gold mine for *all* the
issues tangential to cryonics.  Order it today from
Amazon.  It's the one by "R. Michael Perry".

Jesus H. Christ.  Believe it or not, I *never* do this.
What an absurd waste of time.  Moreover, I have been
accused of *not* letting people come to their own
conclusions!  If I am to be defamed, I demand to be
consistently defamed!

ON the subject of the meanings of the terms---one doesn't
wish to show one's ignorance of course---Steve explains
how the class of *oxymorons* differs from the class of
items which are *contradictions in terms*.

Okay, then I was wrong.  Anarcho-capitalism technically is
an oxymoron, but...

A very common error, evidently.  When the joke
is executed whereby it's claimed "Military
Intelligence is an oxymoron", people usually
take that to imply that "MI" is a contradiction
in terms.  Do you have *good* examples of 
oxymorons?

Also, it's not clear to me whether the class of
oxymorons is a subset of the class of CITs, or
vice versa---or if indeed either is a subset of
the other.

I realize that I'm pushing the bounds of what
can be talked about even on Extropians, but
you may wish to consider the following thought-
experiment involving the unfortunate death of
Minnesota's senator Paul Wellstone along with
four others.

How much money would you personally privately
pay (were wishes horses) that this event had
not occurred?

How much money would you *have to be paid*
so that this event would *not* be retracted?

Is the ratio of the above answers at all 
close to one?

I draw several interesting inferences from my
own answers, but shall refrain from announcing
them at this time in order, as requested, to
avoid manipulating or exerting mind-control
over other posters.

Lee

P.S.  I have dispensation to ask such a
question in terms of money because I am
an American.

I once wrote a dialog called "Waiting for Zed" , it rambles on about a lot
of stuff but the part about The Identity of Indiscernibles is below and
shows how you can use it to work out exchange force and deduce the
laws of Chemistry.
=========

Bob:  Ever hear of The Identity Of Indiscernibles? The philosopher who
discovered it was Leibniz about 1690.

Alf:  Didn't he co-invent The Calculus along with Newton?

Bob:  Yea, same fellow. He said that things that you can measure are what's
important, and if there is no way to find a difference between two
things then they are identical and switching the position of the objects
does  not change the physical state of the system.

Alf: Big deal. I'm not talking about some un-provable idea in pure
Philosophy,  I'm talking about practical questions, like if it's worth
paying   extra for an original, or even more practical if a copy of you is
really you. Maybe Religion can help us with questions like that, but not
Science.

Bob: Actually Science can help us, and Leibniz's idea turned out to be very
practical, although until the 20th century nobody realized it, before  that
his idea had no observable consequences because nobody could find two things
that were exactly alike. Things changed dramatically when it was discovered
that atoms have no scratches on them to tell them apart. By using The
Identity Of Indiscernibles you can deduce one of the foundations of modern
physics the fact that there must be two classes of particles, bosons like
photons and fermions like electrons, and from there you can deduce The Pauli
Exclusion Principle, and that is the basis of the periodic table of
elements, and that is the basis of chemistry, and that is the basis of life.
If The Identity Of Indiscernibles is wrong  then this entire chain breaks
down and you can throw Science into the trash can.

Alf: That's an awful long chain of reasoning, if it has one weak link
perhaps you should put it in the trash can, how can you base it all on
The Identity Of Indiscernibles?

Bob: I wish Zed was here, he knows a lot more about this than I do, but
let's start with one of the first and greatest discoveries in Quantum
Mechanics, The Schrodinger Wave Equation. It proved to be enormously useful
in accurately predicting the results of experiments, and as the name implies
it's an equation describing the movement of a wave, but embarrassingly it
was not at all clear what it was talking about. Exactly what was waving?
Schrodinger thought it was a matter wave, but that didn't seem right
to Max Born. Born reasoned that matter is not  smeared around, only the
probability of finding it is. Born was correct, whenever an electron is
detected it always acts like a particle, it makes a dot when it hit's a
phosphorus screen not a smudge, however the probability of finding that
electron does act like a wave so you can't be certain exactly where that dot
will be. Born showed that it's the square of the wave equation that
describes the probability, the wave  equation itself is sort of a useful
mathematical fiction, like lines of longitude and latitude, because
experimentally we can't measure the quantum wave function  F(x) of a
particle, we can only measure the intensity (square) of the wave function
[F(x)]^2 because that's a probability and probability we can measure.

Let's consider a very simple system with lots of space but only 2 particles
in it.  P(x) is the probability of finding two particles x  distance apart,
and we know that probability is the square of the wave  function, so P(x)
=[F(x)]^2. Now let's exchange the position of the particles in the system,
the distance between them was x1 - x2 = x but is now x2 - x1 = -x.  The
Identity Of Indiscernibles tells us that because the two particles are the
same, no measurable change has been made, no change in probability, so P(x)
= P(-x). Probability is just the square of the wave function so
[ F(x) ]^2 = [F(-x)]^2 . From this we can tell that the
Quantum wave function can be  either an even function, F(x) = +F(-x),
or an odd function, F(x) = -F(-x). Either type of function would work in our
probability equation because the square of minus 1 is equal to the square of
plus 1. It turns out both solutions have physical significance,  particles
with integer spin, bosons, have even wave functions,
particles with half integer spin, fermions, have odd wave functions.


Alf: Wait a minute. Are you saying that an electron, something that can not
be pinned down and doesn't even have a diameter in the usual sense of the
word, is spinning around like a child's top?

Bob: No, not really. It's called "spin" for historical reasons and it's true
you can make an analogy with the everyday meaning of "spin", but the
analogy is no better than mediocre. For example, it is possible to tip the
axis of spin of an electron with a magnetic field, you might think      that
if you turn an electron by 360 degrees it would end up just as it was
before, after all, if you make one complete turn you end up looking  in the
same direction, but that's not true for an electron. Turn an electron once
and it's different, you need to turn it twice, 720 degrees,  before
it's the same as it was before.

Alf: So if I spin around twice, the world would look exactly the same to me
after one revolution or two, but for an electron it would look
different. Do you think that means we can only see half the universe that an
electron can see?

Bob: I don't know, when Zed gets here why don't you ask him, but I was
trying to show that we must assume that atoms are interchangeable or modern
Physics becomes incomprehensible. If we put two fermions like electrons in
the same place then the distance between them, x , is zero and because they
must follow the laws of odd wave functions,   F(0)  = -F(0), but the only
number that is it's own negative is zero so   F(0)  = 0 . What this means
is that the wave function F(x) goes to zero so of course  [F(x)]^2 goes to
zero, thus the probability of finding two electrons in the same spot is
zero, and that is The Pauli Exclusion Principle.

Two identical bosons, like photons of light, can sit on top of each other
but not so for fermions, The Pauli Exclusion Principle tells
us that 2 identical electrons can not be in the same orbit in an atom.
If we didn't know that then we wouldn't understand Chemistry, we wouldn't
know why matter is rigid and not infinitely compressible,
and if we didn't know that atoms are interchangeable we wouldn't understand
any of that. Atoms have no individuality, If they can't even give
themselves this property  I don't see how they can give it to us.

Indeed, in many imaginary scenarios involving you and your
duplicate it becomes necessary to distinguish them.  Just
imagine what it would be like;  when I have, they continue
to speak using the words "I" and "me".

"After you, Stanley."  "No. After you, Ollie"   ;-)

When the two duplicates discuss the peculiar state of their
identity, remarks are made by them (say their name is Ken
Smith) that go like this:

"Ken (this)" [pinches cheek] "sees the clock on the wall.

"Ken (over here) [pinches cheek] does *not* see the clock
on the wall."

"Whether Ken sees the clock depends on which version
of Ken someone is referring to!", they both agree.

I say that they are only the same person with respect to
the issue of personal identity, which is to say personal
*survival*.  If one of the two Ken's must die, then it's
not a big deal to them because each understands that he
really doesn't die.  The physical form that remains after
one dies is *exactly* like the other if the other

    (a) lost a very few memories
    (b) was teleported a few feet
    (c) gained a few memories

Since none of these operations threaten (or *should*
threaten) one's personal identity, for one of the Ken's
to die does not threaten his existence.  It is merely
a tremendously *lamentable* waste of resources and 
diminution of run time.

I mean this literally for him.  Suppose he is a Most
Selfish Individual and he and his duplicate can even
watch with glee other people being tortured because
they only care about themselves.  Even if he is such
an MSI and really cares *only* about his own survival
and about his own pleasures and pains:

1.  He should regard pain inflicted on his duplicate
    as pain inflicted on him to the greatest degree
    that he is intellectually capable.  "I (over here)
    may not be feeling the pain, but that *doesn't*
    mean it isn't happening to me!"

2.  He should regard memory acquisition as a local
    process in some ways and a global process in
    other ways.  "Just because I, Ken, am not
    accumulating additional memories at this end
    of the room *does not* mean that I am not
    collecting them somewhere else in this room."

Always before in human history, memory accumulation
has been synonymous with experience.  This need not be
the case in the future, (but continuing this chain of
thought digresses into other thought-experiments).

3.  He *needs* to regard the survival of his duplicate
    as survival of himself because the aforementioned
    three operations a, b, and c pose no real threat
    to him.

Although one's common sense strenuously objects to the
idea of being in two places at the same time, the more
we learn of the nature of time, the less problematical
this will become.  I heartily endorse Julian Balbour's
book "The End of Time" which is, I think, the most
difficult but the most rewarding physics book that
I have ever read that does not contain a single 
equation.

That's correct, if you are a philosophical realist.
We believe in a truth that stands outside any one
person's (or many people's) attempts to know it.
We believe that it has prior existence, and we 
humans can strive to learn it, and can often estimate
the probability (never 1) that we have found it.
For example, we know that the planets orbit the
sun in ellipses.

I agree.  Interestingly, I learned that in Turkish
it's impossible to posit that old riddle.  In that
language, there is a grammatically clear distinction
between "sound" as in what one hears and "sound" as
in what results from a physical process.  We say
(Jaynes' example) that "the room is noisy" and "there
is noise in the room", and can become confused about
how those phrases differ (they do).  But such confusion
is absolutely impossible in Turkish.

I agree with you.  But I agree with Eugen that the
historical path of a system is not an element of
its identity and should not be used to distinguish
it.  If two systems are completely identical (thanks
to Eugen now I don't need to discuss position), then
their history is irrelevant for *all* purposes that
I can think of.

I think that you are over-reacting to his point.
Clearly the experiment could be changed so that
the original is destroyed and we have two 
duplicates, one in the original position and
one in the remote position.  Eugen firmly 
believes that each one---considered in isolation
is identical to the original---it's just that if
they are to have even one second's difference in
experiences, he goes ballistic:  "NO FORKS!!!!"

No.  We keep bringing this up because

   (i) New people come onto the list who haven't
       talked about it for years
  (ii) people gradually change their minds about
       such difficult issues
 (iii) it's a real problem in the sense that at
       some point in the future uploaded duplicated
       selves will have to have policies on *what
       to do*!

Always the irrepressible optimist, eh?  Actually, on
its own terms that's a good discussion, just not to

Some posters of ancient pedigree and high standing on
the Extropian list embrace even level #1, so I don't
think it appropriate to dismiss their views as "naive",
though, from our perspective it does indeed feel as
though we've "moved on" from that.  But that's *often*
exactly how it feels when people disagree.  The phrase
I especially hate hearing is "I used to believe that
too..."   ;-)

Yes.  Our goal should be two-fold:  (1) to obtain a *consistent*
viewpoint that attains the least awkwardness in terms of our
ordinary daily concepts  (2) anticipate how people like us will
actually evolve psychologically and conceptually when such things
as uploading and xox's become available.

It should be noted that SF writers play a vital role in (2).
Greg Egan's work was mentioned, and an even better Greg Egan
reference is in his stories in the collection "Axiomatic".
These are by far the *most* advanced stories ever written
on personal identity (IMO), and so far as you and I are
concerned, Greg Egan is fully "up to speed" on personal
identity (i.e., he agrees with us, or at least appears to).

> etc. moving through time and space.

Yes.  See Mike Perry's book "Forever For All" for the
most complete description of our theory; it's called
the "State" theory, or the "Information" theory, or
the "Pattern" theory of personal identity.  Derek Parfit
in the book "Reasons and Persons" gave the first widely
known account of it in 1986 or so.

Yes, all the current contributors agree.

Quite right.  I imagine that legally one would be divorced
from one's duplicate, though I'm far from sure.  But it does
not seem relevant to personal *survival*.

As Korzybski used to demur, never say "that's all just
semantics".  Semantics is extremely crucial.  Actually,
in cases like this, it's just shorthand.  If we argue
over whether abortion is murder, we are debating whether
all the semantic links that go out from *murder* to all
our other concepts are valid.  That is, just as murder
is abhorrent and illegal, to define abortion as a species
of murder carries those semantic links.  (Or even to
accede to such usage.)

I think that arguing whether your duplicate is yourself
is just shorthand in the same way for what you would do
in countless thought experiments.  We can predict your
behavior and you can understand your own behavior if you
know whether or not your duplicate is your self.  So just
think of it as shorthand, but I don't think that it should
be dismissed.

Yes, it is connected to what I call the "anticipation dilemma",
but I have known people who believed in 1-6 but didn't go on to
7.  Ten or twelve years ago Mike Perry even believed in #6 and
perhaps even now does, though I don't think so.

The horrible idea is well-documented in Nosick's terrible 
"Philosophical Investigations", about which I agree with Barrow
and Tipler's remark on page 121 of "The Anthropic Cosmological
Principle":  "The interested reader is advised to avoid 
"Philosophical Investigations".  Nozick sets up all the right
answers and then JUST FAILS TO ANSWER THEM.  Most annoying.
He believes in the closest continuer theory.

Exactly so.  And it's key to point out that there are 
a *whole lot of processes* that would qualify to be
you that your body (or a computer) could be running.

The key here is what you would do in terms of personal
survival, assuming that you relish future experiences
enough for them to dominate your decision making
process.  Assume then, that they do:  to *survive*
the 21st century, or even to *survive* tomorrow so that
you can personally ENJOY a certain wonderful encounter
is, let us posit, at the very top of your priorities.

Then, would you (A) drink a potion that has a 90%
chance of being deadly poison or (B) kill yourself
so that a duplicate created five minutes ago can
continue to live?

Yes, perhaps for you this is being between a hard
place and a rock, but for me (A) means that there
is only a 10% chance I get to have the wonderful
encounter (say) while (B) guarantees that I will
(sans about five minutes' worth of memories).

[playing with the identity problem ...]

You have two spheres of identical dimension, mass,
colour, surface, sound, fragrance, etc. etc. 

One is solid throughout, with a uniform mass distribution, 
while the other has a hollow center.

Is it possible to determine (in a non destructive
manner!)which is which? How?

I believe the two spheres would behave differently in some real world cases
involving collisions and rotations(slightly different distribution of
stresses etc.). Anyway the spirit of the game is I believe: "suppose there
is no way to find out the difference, what is the difference"? The answer is
quite evident if the question is stated in these terms.

You roll them downhill.  The hollow one has a far greater angular inertia
than the other... the solid one will get to the bottom first.

My two cents worth:

A computer hard drive turned off might have a clock ticking over but 
otherwise is asleep and turn it on and it is a bit awake and run its 
software and it is awake. Sort of anyhow.

Wipe the hard drive clean and reinstall the software from a map you've made 
previously and it's a different dog.

You aren't going to find me uploading myself a la Greg Egan. No way. Call me 
a materialist. Definitely certainly not with atomic level duplicates. 
Quantum level splitting a la Tipler I can cope with, as he describes it.

Atomic level duplicates from maps strike me as continous ritual suicide and 
will create a lot of work later on with any quantum duplication/splitting 
process a la Tipler. But that's okay!

Nor will you find me using any teleport tech involving dissassembling my 
molecules or atoms and assembling an atomic or molecular level body based on 
my map elsewhere. I'll jump into a wormhole anytime, by contrast, or the 
equivalent.

Direct physical continuity and section-by-section replacement and a 
recognition that the three dimensionality of a human brain may need to lie 
as a kernel for a more complex brain are all things I adhere to. I also 
believe that there are real distinctions between neural nodes and sensory 
lines of input and communication lines (whether overtual or virtual). I also 
believe that any discussion of these issues have to bear in mind that 
so-called software ALWAYS resides on a so-called hardware substrate. Every 
copy of a Jane Austin novel is different at the atomic level - and indeed, 
the molecular. Every word spoken vibrates different arrangements of air 
molecules. Etc..

Also, pesonally, on an area relating to all this - using every spare atom to 
form a giant supercomputing substratum and thus (perhaps?) requiring us all 
to accept moveable neural nodes (a version of uploading) (presuming we are 
all crammed into said supercomputer) ... I can see Tipler's argument, 
because it is one proposal to avoid the Big Crunch as a negative event and 
ultimately results in a multiverse of choice, however as a generic statment 
I myself am quite happy to live at some like my present level immortally but 
would prefer a hundred or thousandfold increase in some abilities if 
possible, but I wouldn't want to achieve anything that meant people had to 
lose their non-brain bodies or accept viruality without choice - nor indeed 
that they would have to lose their planets and star, if they're attached to 
it. So much lies ahead of course that it's hard to tell what's going to 
happen, but for me the focus is on immortality (or amortality) and control 
of form and choice (and sysop). Rather than maximum "Uploading" and 
computational growth at the expense of the choice of others. Besides which, 
to me Robert Heinelin is ALREADY a Matrioshka Brain - at least in principle 
- that's why he didn't freeze himself (wink).

Thus my two bits.

So? Same atoms, different bits.

We can extend the analogy. You can be described in terms of the atoms you
are made of, and the bits that describe their structural relationship with
each other.

I could [warning: gedankenexperiment] kill you and use your body as
feedstock to a hydroponic system for growing food. Then, using a couple
of stem cells from your body and somewhat advanced jiggery-pokery with
someone else's genetic map _and_ an as-yet-not-very-existent artificial
uterus I could create a new foetus and grow it to adulthood using the 
atoms from your body.

Same atoms, different bits.

The point of this metaphor is to make clear that what is important is not
the atoms, but the bits: they're what define you. 

If it isn't clear enough already, consider this: every red blood cell in
your body today will be dead, gone, and replaced by November 30th 2002.
Most of your muscle tissue will have been completely replaced by November
30th, 2003. Our tissues are not permanent, they turn over regularly; and
the metabolic by-products aren't reused -- the replacements are made of
wholly new atoms, ingested or inhaled. Even your brain cells have a notable
rate of turnover, with some new development occuring -- and the long-term
memory tracks in your brain are laid down by physical, structural changes
in your neurons, and the intracellular components within your neurons are
replaced and remanufactured using fresh atoms over a period of days to 
years.

Bluntly, you are to the same Avatar Polymorph that you were ten years ago.
About all you've got in common is some parts of your skeleton and brain --
and even then, if we could magically tag the individual atoms that have
stayed and visualise the map of them you'd resemble a swiss cheese.

Bits define you. Physical continuity is an illusion.

Hmmm.  A difficult definiton in a society that doesn't at all 
fit with any notion of "means of production" which are ownable. 
  That view was far too static when it was first tossed about by 
Marx.  In our day and age the "means of production" are not 
particularly ownable as the most realistic means is the human 
mind.  By its nature it can only be "owned" by the individual. 
Is private property really that big an issue?   The classic 
definition is that the state owns the means of production.  But 
does that really mean anything?

This has never been attempted or seriously proposed.  It would 
amount to making all decisions for individuals as there are very 
few individual decisions that do not have some economic (trade) 
component or impact.  I know of no accepted definition of 
socialism that includes such.

Neither of them satisfy basic criteria for a definition although 
the first is a bit closer.  Everyone who is throwing the word 
about should be able to say what they mean by it.  It is not 
simply up to those who might label themselves socialist.  If we 
can't agree about what we are talking about then we should drop 
this conversation and go on to something else.

Bravo Dan (and Eugene too)!
The hollow one (which has the larger moment of inertia) 
will roll slower than the solid one.

I'll try.

According to online news from Russia and elsewhere the bodycount has
turned out to be relatively moderate (over 100 total, 34 terrorists and 67
hostages are dead). The explosive seems to have been a fake, as not a
single charge exploded (had metal-spiked plastique been detonated within
the theatre the situation would have been very different). If we want to
believe some accounts there's a tit for tat campaign going on in Chechnya.
Chechens in Moscow and elsewhere have offered to donate blood for the
victims. It is unknown how many casualties if any are due the gas which
had been used (official claim that out of 104 of which 9 had died none was
due to gas, which doesn't say much as most of dead remained in the
building). Claims are that 30 high explosive charges have been found
(maybe not fakes, after all, though I'd like to see a confirmation from
another source). Official claims have been made that most terrorists were
under influence of injection drugs. Sedatives and syringes are claimed to
be found, including multiple injection marks (I'm rather dubious of this
claim, as long as it is not being confirmed by an independent source).

Putin got lucky this time, as debacle would have generated considerable
fallout. I would presume he now basically has been issued a card blanche,
albeit one with an expiration date. It is interesting how much of the
subsequent hard line will be for show, and what will be done to defuse the
problem. There are of course financial interests involved because of safe
passage rights for oil and gas pipelines which are highly vulnerable to 
guerilla strikes.

The recent terror series is bound to have a global impact on homeland
security, immigration and deportation policy as well as religious and
racial tolerance. Somehow I doubt we'll like most of these coming
changes...

No, as you may have surmised already, I don't mean
for any telepathy to be in force.  Since childhood
one customarily believes that one's identity ends
with the extent of one's body.  Later on, one revises
this inward to just the brain.  I'm just revising this
outward to include very similar duplicates.

Well, now that you understand that it is proposed to
change the *concept* of self---to more readily fit
the physical possibilities sure to occur in one way
or another in the future---then this isn't really
insulting anyone's intelligence (though perhaps at
first it did come across this way).

Because from the outset, in the formal argument
the burden has always been on someone to explain
why two people could be in the same place at two
different times but not at the same time in two
different places.  You solve that by asserting 
that we are not the same person from second to
second, which has IMO much more awkwardness than
does my proposal.

In particular, one has to question the wisdom of
any sacrifice made for one's future self.  Why go
to the dentist if it's someone else who'll
eventually get the toothache?  Our *deepest*
programming provided by evolution urges us to
identify with future selves.

Now it is also true that our deepest programming
urges us *not* to identify with contemporary 
duplicates (because nature never encountered
any before).  If I and my duplicate are tied down
and tortured, very soon each says "Please stop and
to it to him!".

But since I contend that one *survives* if one's
duplicate does (for reasons gone heavily into in
other posts), then one's quick defection under
torture against one's duplicate is seen as the
reaction of animalistic machinery (namely the
pain circuits) getting to the primitive parts of
our brain which are trained to avoid pain to the
present body regardless of intellectual knowledge.

In other words, we have a hard choice here, and I
think that in the future, the choice will be made
to regard one's duplicate as one's self.

Yes, the human mind is, in a sense, a means of production -- as are
human bodies.  However, I believe what is meant is "capital" -- goods
used to make other goods.  Granted, capital itself is defined with
reference to human plans and not independently, but, in any situation,
most physical capital is something someone can have control over.  E.g.,
if there's a plant that makes cars, someone or some group can control
that plant.  (Note:  I did not use "ownership" in my first working
definition.  It really does not matter.  If the government controls it,
that's enough.  In this situation, what's essential is the government
being able to control how capital used, including what sorts of plans it
fits into -- central planning, usually -- and how he outputs are
distributed.)

Granted, also, in a real world situation, capital is bound to be a
complex structure -- as opposed to the classical, Marxist, and even
Keynesian view of it as homogenenous input into production.  (See
"Macroeconomics for the Real World" at
http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/Macro.html  and the references
therein.)

Getting back to minds, if you consider them as capital -- which I'm not
going to debate -- I don't see any reason why they can't be controlled
by the government.  The government could demand certain plans and
enforce control over how outputs from minds are used.  It can also
forbid certain uses.  Yes, in the strict Randian sense, the government
_probably_ can't (not yet at least) absolutely force people to think --
but it can punish people for not doing certain things and prohibit
others.  Does it matter, e.g., if you can dream of being free, yet a
socialist state forces you to work ten hours a day digging ditches and
punishes you severely -- maybe by not feeding you or have you beat --
when your ditches are not dug according to the plan?

Wrong on both counts.  It has been attempted in certain small
communities, especially religious ones, such as some of the utopian
communities in America in the 19th century and communes elsewhere.  It
was attempted because it was "seriously proposed" -- at least by any
measure of "seriousness" that makes sense.

Hmm.  Looking in my dictionary, _Webster's_, definition 1.a. is "a
system of society or group living in which there is no private
property."  That seems very close to my definition.

Do you mean the logical form of a definition?  Stuff like having clear
differentia, a clear genus, being noncircular, not using negative terms
unnecessarily, and fitting with the referents?  If so, then the first
defintion would class socialism as a form of social system in which the
means of production are government controlled.  There's your species --
how are the means of production controlled -- and your genus -- form of
society.  Seems pretty clear to me.  The classic use of this is that the
government would control businesses, especially factories where goods
are made, but also things like the rail systems, communication networks,
wharehouses, shipping, etc.  Real world examples of this range from
small communes to large scale economies, such as the Soviet Union's
under War Communism and Stalin and Cambodia's under the Khmer Rouge.
(Granted, even these might have been mixed examples, but they came as
close to the socialist ideal as is probably possible.)

I didn't mean it was up to them to define it, but it would help in
understanding self-proclaimed socialists if they told us what they
meant.  This would be a starting point, since they might still not
define it adequately and might fail to grasp essential features.  It
would, however, clear up some things.  If someone said, "By 'socialism'
I mean X" -- where X is reasonably clear -- then one could either agree
or disagree with that meaning and know what one is talking about.

Some others have already provided some arguments that
I consider valid, but perhaps this is a slightly 
different angle.  Suppose that the science of making
duplicates was vastly more advanced than you thought,
and that before 1940 it had been possible, albeit
very expensive to teleport physical objects and make
duplicates of them, but this had been successfully
kept from the public until now.  Moreover, after the
age of micro-electronics, it became possible to 
replace all of one's atoms with other atoms many times
per second with no apparent change in behavior of any
mammal on whom this operation was performed.

Finally in the 1990's it became possible to replace all
of one's atoms with entirely different atoms each 
nanosecond.  While yes, you have no reason to believe
(nor do I) that this has in fact happened, it's
not impossible.

Now an extremely perceptive layman learning these "facts"
would have to conclude that his identity didn't depend
on atoms.  After all, suppose that he found that during
some of the hours of his day, he was undergoing replacement
at a furious rate, and during other hours of the day he
was not; yet it was not possible for him to tell the 
"bad" hours from the "good" ones.  He would face the
fact that life was equally good all the time, atomic
replacement or not.

Thus cries during some of those hours that he was not
the same person from second to second would be found
persuasive either by him or the people who knew him.
It would be of no consequence in his daily agendas,
and he would quickly conclude that it made no sense
at all to pay serious money for "good" hours as 
opposed to "bad" hours.  The changes would be invisible
to him and it's this very *him* with which we are
concerned.

That is what *we* are saying, yes.

Yes.

But it's like moving into another room, or having someone
suddenly turn on a light:  you suddenly do not have the
same experience as before, yet your identity is untouched.

And of course as I think John said, your result does not
necessarily follow from the claim and hypothesis.  You
might be teleported to a different but identical hotel
room and obtain not the same yet an identical sensory
experience.  Or you might be "teleported in place", i.e.,
just have your atoms exchanged.  As I argued above, this
would soon become seen as no threat to your person.

We agree there.

This is where I don't follow, and I think that several other
people don't either.  If the original is in the plainest and
most severe soundless cell in the Lubyanka, then after having
his atoms swapped he experiences exactly what he did before
the swap.

And if you are talking about teleporting, I can easily
imagine my surrounding transforming instantaneously,
and I wouldn't be able to tell whether I had teleported
or nanotech had just quickly altered my surroundings
an I had stayed put.

Here you have company.  While as a realist I concede that
if an apple is copied, one is the original and one is only
a copy, they are identical for all practical purposes, and
this includes (for people) survival (and the "personal
identity" which tracks survival).

Good gracious no!  *That* certainly is not controversial,
unless certain parties wish to claim that even a nanosecond
inflicts so much change that we aren't the same person from
instant to instant.  But not most of your correspondents!

Well, a good SF writer can lead you into such a scenario
where you'd have little choice but to accept that as the
case.  Why, with an open mind, it would take God only
15 minutes or so to convince me of His existence, were He
to charge down here to Earth in a big enough Holy Chariot
and commence to impress me with miracles and plausible
explanations concerning his absence lately!  Sure, any
sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable
from magic, but since I'm a reasonable guy, I'd soon 
come to believe in God were that to happen.  Likewise
you must consider your reaction were the aforesaid
secret government project that accomplished duplication
revealed to you now.

No, you wouldn't.  Suppose that you were forced (by the way, have
you ever read much SF?) to teleport the first few times---friends
grab you and throw you in to the teleporter terminal just as the
Thought Police are about to capture you all.  And then, to avoid
an incredibly taxing mile-high climb each morning, you just 
eventually relent and agree to teleport.  The social effect on
you of seeing your friends and loved ones teleport over and over
again with no bad effects would get to you.  You would yield to
their exhortations to avoid the grinding climb each day that
was injurious to your health.  It would be easier to revise
your beliefs about atoms and identity than to scale that wall
every morning.

Now I agree that this latter argument is not air-tight; sometimes
logic for the sake of consistency must override such social and
psychological inducements.  But take it as another indication 
that you might view teleportation as less threatening if you
did it a lot.  You perhaps do have to go back and question on
what your strong conviction that atoms matter is based.

Mach would presumably teleport because he didn't even believe
in atoms, and yet was a leading scientist and profoundly 
knowledgable scientist with great common sense.

It is?  Can you imagine a difference that exists but happens
to be beyond our ability to detect, or did you mean a difference
that *in principle* cannot be detected?  

In the former case, I would say, it's clear that there is (or
could be) a difference.  For example, physicists aren't entirely
*certain* that the exponent is exactly 2 in Newton's gravitation
law, at least not so sure as they are that planets move in ellipses.

But in the latter case, we must inquire deeply into the 
propositions and context of the phenomenon, and quickly
entertain the likelihood that a difference undetectable
*in principle* is probably best considered to be no
difference at all.

We've been discussing clocks in the past, but I'll sum up: it seems to be
possible to create monotonous counters driven by high-precision
oscillators compensated for spacetime curvature and complete rest (there
seems to be a global frame of reference if we look at the Doppler shift of
the microwave background of both hemispheres). It is possible to represent
the time passed since begin of this spacetime with a comparatively short
binary (with a suitable encoding making bitflips local) counter counting
in smallest possible time units. One can subsequently refine the
resolution as faster and more accurate clocks and counters become
available. Similiar to overlapping tree rings one can backdate clocks from
different sources by referring to large-scale events recorded by issuers
of each time system. Assuming there's a trend towards higher clock 
accuracy backdating events will be associated with higher errors.

Two fully compensated clocks should have no deviation after having been
synchonized, each passed a different trajectory through time, and compared
afterwards. (Anybody seeing a reason why they shouldn't? Please speak up).

It is possible to label each clock with an unique identifying bitstring
(UID) without prior communication by choosing a random (entropy distilled
from a nondeterministic physical system) UID sufficiently large it's
exceedingly improbable to collide. The UID can also double as public key.
The clock can telecommunicate its state by sending the counter state along
with the ID. It is not possible to figure out the distance reliably,
without using a relativistic time of flight ping (the clock must
immediately send back your signal, which better have an a time field and
an UID on it, so you can compute the delay and halve it) or reference to
distant beakons encoded into the signal the clock sends out. If you know
the clock's public key (UID) and the signature of the message is good you 
know that time signal came from that source, and no other (unless somebody 
stole the secret from the clock or broke the cryptosystem).

So we can create a time standard and distribute it over large distances, 
possibly cooperating with remote parties who're willing to play along. 
Cloning a clock and taking the clone along with you offers less hassle and 
more precision, however.

Monotonous counters are designed to be simple, you can guess the encoding
and predict what the next state will be from a very small sample of
values. We can also define a more complex transformation acting on a
state, and distribute that along with the seed (initial state), a time
stamp at which the evolution of the system is to start. That way we can
synchronize remote discrete deterministic systems. Typically we don't
bother with that, and let the incoming signal directly drive the system
transformation, e.g. in cryptography, when encrypting traffic to a remote
machine (in this case the initial state being a closely guarded secret,
distributed via a secure channel or via a public key cryptography
infrastructure, which is vulnerable if there's an undetected malicious
relay manipulating traffic routed through it).

Most current discrete deterministic system evolution is driven by a
system-local clock. Because of power dissipation and relativistic latency
issues this approach doesn't scale. Even precisely machined asynchronous
systems will show drift due to system noise. How can we reliably halt the
state of an evolving asynchronous discrete deterministic system? I can't
see any which wouldn't sacrifice performance (by slowing the system down
somewhat, and by diluting the circuitry concentration in the volume, which
also has a relativistic delay penalty). I'm open to suggestions here. It
would be interesting to hear how to exactly implement locally
synchronizing assemblies of cells in computronium, and read out the state
from evolving computronium via waves carrying information propagating
through the bulk (thus sacrificing capability otherwise used for holding
more state and/or making existing state evolve faster). Fortunately,
globally asynchronous but locally synchronous computronium allows
deterministic processing on the pattern scale, so one doesn't have to
stick clocks into every cell (which would considerably bloat them).

It seems that maintaining identity of evolution of N distributed
deterministic uploads is hard work, and is associated with performance
penalties (and maintaining synchronization of distributed clocks, shallow
FIFO of trajectory, checksumming, periodic halts for maintenance and 
checksum validation, and the like).

To incrementally backup a running upload (fortunately, here we can use
ACKless protocol, and let the vacuum be our FIFO for storing serialized
state) we obviously need to read out bulk state which can only happen
through interface (first bottleneck) and serialize it (second, and
narrowest bottleneck). This is a very large and very dead albatross around
our necks. It is much better to periodically halt execution (as we're the
master, and our evolution code is self-correncting and self-synching we
can just use a special relativistically-constrained wave to issue halt
while tolerating a few cell flips occuring before the rest of the volume
sees it (this can be ameliorated by synchronized clocks spread over the
volume, as here the average signalling paths are much shorter), and then
use the same infrastructure to read the state out and copy it into dumb
memory, which we can serialize and fire as tracer bullets into the medium
to be picked up by archive).

Computronium is pretty close to the storage density of molecular memory,
so we're clearly running into problems as soon as resource scarcity runs
the scene. Similiarly to today, not many people are running a remote
mirror if resources are not free (this state should persist).

That's all for today. Please feel free to point out mistakes, offer 
dis/agreement, etc.

Your definition is broken. Go away, and don't come back until you've 
done some reading.

Clue: I can assert that a "libertarian government" is one that thinks
its citizens should be allowed to engage in free trade until I turn
blue in the face, but that won't make Singapore a libertarian state.
Definitions exist for a reason, and if you abuse words like "socialist"
until they bear no relation to the meaning everyone else ascribes to
them, don't be surprised if nobody wants to talk to you.

Dan,
       I think you have just hit the definition.  A socialist government is 
one that thinks it owns its citizens lives including the right to end those 
lives.  The definition may require other essentials but this is certainly the 
chief one.
       This is why the details of socialist rule can change.  If the dictator 
wishes for the people to make economic decisions they can -- if he doesn't 
they can't.

Well, as an anarchist, I'll try to offer up a working definition of 
socialism. It has been said by many a person that all anarchists are first 
socialists. It has also been said, actually, by others, that all socialists 
are first anarchists. I tend to agree in a loose way with both concepts.

Socialism, as far as I can see, was supposedly a classless society. 
Descisions were to be made, in some specific ideas, by an elected council. 
This was not an attempt at creating tyranny from the council, rather it was 
seen as the only way that decisions could be made. But is it? I don't think 
so, and I think that if they were, then what would happen is indeed tyranny 
by council-- that much centralized power should simply not exist. But that 
would mean that the council would turn into a high class--and the system 
would not be socialistic, because it would not be classless.

Rather, in any sort of real socialism, as far as I can see, decisions must 
be made at the bottom, by individuals, who may organize or not organize as 
they wish, in a free, uncoerced manner. There would be no monstrous, inhuman 
bureaucracy surrounding a council of great power.

Just because a society calls itself a name, that does not mean that its 
character actually fit the name. Remember, China and the USSR called 
themselves republics. Is republicanism really that bad?

Charles,
       I am truly sorry if I have hurt your feelings. But, what am I to read, 
the infinity of beautiful words describing what socialism should be or the 
monstrous 200 year record of what it always turn out to be?  I have read the 
record and it is enough to gag a cat.
       It is truly a monstrous theology.  It is a system that justifies you 
sacrificing my life to attain your goals -- a position of dictatorship & 
terror while you parade as a blessing to humanity.
       Surely as educated men and women in the 21st century we can aspire to 
something more than that.

Yes. Silicon or meat, it makes no difference.

No, not ANY instant in time, not if the particular instant of time=20

Pretty silly argument don't you think.

For those of you who missed it, a team from MIT led by Richard Young
and David Gifford has just effectively "read" the yeast genomic
"program".  [This is precisely 6 years after the raw sequence for
the genome was published.]

Lee TI, et al
Transcriptional Regulatory Networks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
Science. 2002 Oct 25;298(5594):799-804.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=12399584&dopt=Abstract

MIT Press release:
http://www.wi.mit.edu/nap/features/nap_feature_young.html

Turns out that 106 out of 141 transcription factors in yeast
seem to regulate ~2300 genes.  About an average of 20 genes
being regulated per transcription factor.  What is interesting
is that they have developed the technology such that they
have decreased the time for working out what a single transcription
factor regulates from 300 researcher-years to 1 week (a
speedup of more than 15,000x).  It allows them to tackle
the human genome which has ~1700 transcription factors.

This nicely complements the work of Cellzone on the yeast proteome
in which they have developed the methods for working out large
numbers of protein-protein interactions.

http://www.embl-heidelberg.de/ExternalInfo/oipa/pr2002/pr070102.pdf

This suggests (to me) that by 2005ish we are going to have a fairly
good understanding of how simple eukaryotic cells actually work.

It's not a matter of hurting my feelings; it's a matter of using 
terms in accordance with dictionary definitions so that we can agree
on their meaning.

Saying that "socialism is any form of government that asserts that the
state has control over the individual's life" is actively damaging to
any attempt to discuss government -- or liberty -- effectively, because
it so distorts the meaning of the term "socialism" as to render it
meaningless. The more common definitions include "a state wherein the
workers own the means of production" -- what, in your comment about
the power of arbitrary life or death, bears on the ownership of the
means of production?

>        It is truly a monstrous theology.  

No, it's a utopian idealistic one.

Whether utopian idealism is ever justifiable is, however, another matter.

You also need to bear in mind the divergence between theory and practice.
In theory, the free market should be the most equitable and ideal way of
reconciling the production of wealth and the requirements of individual
liberty. In practice, the "free market" system we've got today kills
thousands of children each day by starvation and disease. It's as big a
split as the split between the theories of socialism and its implementation
in, say, the Soviet Union under Stalin.

What we can aspire to is a very interesting question, and one that deserves
consideration. But I don't think we can discuss it effectively if we can't
agree to use the language and terminology so that words mean the same things
each time we use them. "Words mean what I want them to mean" may have been
fine for Humpty-Dumpty, but it's a lousy foundation for scholarship.

What about 140s and 150s?  That gives you enough time to become wealthy.
[The stupid path to wealth is to invest $1000 in an index fund and forget
 about it for 70-80 years.]  Should any child be born into a situation
where there are insufficient resources to give them an optimal set of
opportunities?

have a Plan B here?  What if for some reason "intelligence" and/or

turns out to be easy?  I.e. there is *no* singularity within the
next 200 years.  Wouldn't we all like to be sitting around sipping
our margaritas on the GAIA cruise ship in 2150?

Also, due to exoradiation induced double strand breaks, there is an
expiration date on any frozen eggs unless you go to extreme lengths
(e.g. putting your eggs in a LN2 dewar in the Homestake Mine).
I'm not sure precisely when the DSB problem would become significant
but I am sure that it isn't something that you should ignore.

It is a common error. When people use the term "oxymoron" it's almost always
clear (as in the case above) that a "contradiction in terms" is what they
are actually talking about. One of the examples you gave (a mournful
optimist) is a good one. A cruel kindness would be another one.

Neither is a subset of the other since they are terms from different
disciplines. "Oxymoron" is a term from rhetoric and is the name for a
specific trope i.e. a way of using or combining words to create an effect in
the mind of the listener (in this case to get their attention and make them
think). "Contradiction in terms" comes from logic and the theory of
definitions. In pure form it's "An a not a" where A and Not A are combined
in a single definition or premiss.  To argue that a concept such as
"anarcho-capitalism" is a CIT is a lazy way out since it depends on
definitions to work rather than empirical evidence or deduction. It also
enables you to avoid empirical responses by simply reiterating your
definitional argument. In this case there is ample empirical evidence that
property can exist as an institution in the absence of what we would
normally call a state.

Yes, it would be nice to know precisely *what* the "gas" was.

If they went in with fake charges then that is a *really* stupid

their threats seriously.

Right.  That is why I can't imagine anyone building serious infrastructure
(such as pipelines) would consider going anywhere near Chechnya.
It just doesn't make sense to me.  Which is why I've never understood
the Russian insistence on keeping the province.  As I understand it
they have a whole bunch of semi-autonomous regions.  Why not make
Chechnya one of those and get out of that swamp?

Gene pioneer urges dream of human perfection

By CAROLYN ABRAHAM
>From Saturday's Globe and Mail

James D. Watson, the grand duke of DNA, described one of his greatest fears 
yesterday to a packed auditorium: that society will be too scared to use 
genetics to make people as perfect as they can be.

Dr. Watson is one of the founding fathers of modern genetics. He was in 
Toronto for the respected Gairdner Foundation awards, which this year 
honoured the scientists who unravelled the human genome. He said the 
information will allow society to eradicate and prevent not only diseases 
but any other traits that might be deemed undesirable.

"Going for perfection was something I always thought you should do," said 
the 74-year-old Dr. Watson, peppering his radical perspectives with 
trademark humour. "You always want the perfect girl."

Would it be wonderful to turn the shy into extroverts? Calm down the 
hotheaded? Turn cold fish into warm human beings? As Dr. Watson sees it, the 
genetic revolution puts all these issues on the table.

"We'll be able to make correlations between genes and certain professions, 
genes for the undertaker  they really don't cry very much," he said, "or 
the sprinter.

"It will be an absolute flood that will start to explain everything ... even 
the cold fish."

Dr. Watson was younger than many of the students who came to hear him when, 
in 1953, he and Francis Crick discovered the molecular shape of 
deoxyribonucleic acid, known for short as DNA, at the famed Cavendish 
Laboratory at Cambridge University.

The double helix soon defined modern medicine, opened the field of molecular 
biology and transformed criminal justice with DNA fingerprinting that has 
convicted the guilty and exonerated the innocent, and that remains one of 
Dr. Watson's greatest prides.

But those are the field's obvious merits. The gangly, white-haired Dr. 
Watson, Nobel laureate, past Gairdner winner, author of seven books and 
recipient of 32 honorary degrees, was not at the University of Toronto's 
MacLeod Auditorium to rehash highlights or to reminisce.

He had come to talk about the future and the thorny issues facing society 
now that it has the human-genome map, which contains the precious 
instructions to build and operate us all: the fruit fly, the family pet, and 
even, Aunt Mary.

Dr. Watson took aim at scientists for not openly discussing where genetic 
progress may carry us.

"It's my impression that none of the genome-project leaders have gotten up 
and said, 'What we are going to do with this information; I think we should 
use it,'" he said. "Maybe they're afraid of offending people."

Never veering from controversy, Dr. Watson believes that women and their 
right to make reproductive choices could create the ideal future, where 
prenatal genetic screening keeps the sick or handicapped from ever being 
born and disease from being a serial killer.

In an interview earlier in the week, Dr. Watson mused that hang-gliding 
accidents might one day be the leading cause of death.

He is also a proponent of so-called human-germline engineering, in which 
doctors could add or delete elements from egg and sperm cells that will be 
passed down to future generations.

Perhaps adding genes that will turn slow learners into whiz kids, he said, 
or those to prevent smokers from ever developing lung cancer, or genes 
making people HIV-resistant, might be part of the future.

"But laws all over prevent DNA additives to the germlines," Dr. Watson 
lamented. "I'm sort of distressed when people say enhancement is bad -- the 
question, they wonder, is 'Who will we enhance?'"

Some of Dr. Watson's comments are unlikely to calm anyone with those 
thoughts, particularly when it comes to people's appearance. The 
Chicago-born scientist  a well-known admirer of attractive women (he titled 
one of his books Genes, Girls and Gamow) who keeps a 2002 calendar of tennis 
bombshell Anna Kournikova in his New York office  said nature can be cruel: 
"Who wants an ugly baby?"

Yet he admits people accuse him of wanting to use genetics "to produce 
pretty babies or perfect people.

"What's wrong with that?" he countered. "It's as if there's something wrong 
with enhancements."

Dr. Watson stressed his vision is not a bleak one. He too was haunted by the 
world portrayed in the 1997 film Gattaca, where genetically perfect members 
of an elite, conceived in labs, reign over the genetically "invalid," 
created naturally and condemned to society's lowest jobs.

The movie theme echoes concern that genetic enhancements will be available 
only to the wealthy, widening the gap between haves and have-nots. But Dr. 
Watson has more faith in the species: "Most humans are programmed by their 
genes to have compassion for their fellow man."

Dr. Watson's speech thrilled students in the audience: "It was the best 
lecture of the series," Seema Nagaraj, a biomedical-engineering student, 
said. "I appreciated his candour, that he was not afraid to state his 
views."

In that case we live in an essentially socialist society.  The govenment has 
the right to levy arbitrary taxes on any kind of business it wants, and 
effectively has the power to enforce it on a sub-group of those businesses.  
Thus the government and at it's will control any business.

The fallacy here is presuming that both "the government" and "the business" 
are unitary entities.  There are continual inter-group contests over just 
what should be done.  Over the long term this is always won by the 
bureaucrats, through the effective use of "power at the point", but in any 
single encounter, the outcome is uncertain.

If you mean all private property, even Sparta wasn't that thoroughgoing, and 
they were a lot more complete than any modern group.  So there isn't, and 
hasn't been any such group.

Hey, it's some kind of definition, which is better than I've gotten before.  
At least it's a place to start from, even if the conclusions aren't exactly 
what we want the definition to provide.

Worse.  It depends on a shared definition of a term that doesn't seem to have 
a well-formed definition.  It's always being defined by exemplar (frequently 
a lousy one).  The times that I have gotten close to getting a definition, it 
has always seemed to imply things that we wouldn't really want the definition 
of capitalism to imply.  (Or of socialism.  You can say exactly the same 
about it.)

This is too strong a statement, John.  *Your
understanding* of the laws of physics, perhaps. 
Feynman said something like no one on the planet truly
understands quantum mechanics, so I'm inclined to be
somewhat circumspect.  I wish you well with your
confidence on the subject.

Dissing me with the religious thing is uncalled for
and unfounded, but no great matter.  

While I'm on the subject of uncalled for stuff, I
think I owe Gene an apology for characterizing his
view on this topic as "disingenuous".   I take it
back. I've been studying some of the back and forth
and I find lots of room for different underlying and
unvoiced assumptions, definitional variations, and
good old-fashioned errors.  

Concerning errors: I wrote, regarding distinguishing
features of an "original" and a perfect copy, that,
"Each has a different history."  Upon further
reflection--I decided to give it a try to see it from
the other point of view--I noticed that the history of
a thing is not inherent in the thing itself.  The
history is an abstract notion, a neurological pattern,
a memory record, which exists in each observer,
(including the thing itself, if it has memory
capability), BUT OUTSIDE OF THE THING ITSELF, and
which varies from observer to observer. The events
which make up the history of a thing have had a
formative effect on the thing, but that is no matter. 
An observer with a notion of continuity, a notion of
'a history', which he understands to be LOGICALLY
assignable to some thing for identification purposes,
clearly stands outside of the thing itself.  The
memory of a thing and the logical connection of past
events to the present reality, are separate from the
thing in the here and now.  Thus, it would seem, that
things which have distinguishable histories, may
themselves be indistinguishable.

>From this I get closer to understanding Gene's
emphasis on a thing's history not having any value as
a means to tell them apart.

But I'm still not happy.  I'm starting to wonder what
is real and what isn't.  The here and now is real (or
is it?). The past and the future are not real.(!?) 
They're just 'ideas'.  Is the concept of continuity
real, and/or true, or a fantasy?  Is logic valid? 
Always?  Only sometimes?  Is it enough to
*know*--based on logic--that something is true, or is
something *not true* unless and until proven? Can
something that was authentically true at one time
become not true at a later time as a result of
subsequent events (the creation of indistinguishable
copies)?  

I'm still inclined to think that the truth of identity
remains a truth despite unknowability.  And, as to
distinguishing between the two identical things(but
not as to which is the original and which the copy), I
fall back on Michael Dickey's point that, as long as
there are two of them, and you can grab one in each
hand, in the here and now, and pin a label on each,
then, unless we're in some kind of simulation and
NOTHING'S REAL, then they are separate, distinct, and
easily distinguishable.   

Beyond that I have only one thing to say:  
 
Quack, quack, quackk, quaak, quack, quacckkk,
quaaaakkk, quack, quack, QUACK, QUACK, quack, quackk,
quaak, quack, quacckkk, quaaaakkk, quack, Quack,
quack, quackk, quaak, quack, quacckkk, quaaaakkk,
quack, quack, QUACK, QUACK, quack, quackk, quaak,
quack, QUACK, QUACK, QUACK, QUACK, QUACK, QUACK,
QUACK, QUACK, QUAAAAAAAAAAAAK, quaaaaaaaaackkkkk. 

I've been wanting to do that ever since this thread
started.  Have a ducky day, and thank you for your
support.

Best, Jeff Davis

Isn't that syndicalist anarchism?  I'm not sure, but it sounds like it to me.  
Socialism always seems to assume that there is some large government to take 
care of things.  I *think* that both sides agree on that.

I have a problem with this.  To me if theory and practice don't match, then 
the theory doesn't apply to the situation, and you need a different one to 
cover that area.  That said, I'm not convinced that the "free market" ever 
yields optimal results, though in many circumstances it's better than most 
other methods.  The problem is that the only place one ever sees a free 
market is in unregulated areas of commerce.  Neighbors exchanging favors for 
a cup of sugar, etc.  Once significant amounts of money get involved, the 
monopoly powers take steps to ensure that it ceases being free.  This applies 
to drug lords as well as national governments.  They get their rake-off by 
favoring certain parties at the expense of others, and taking a share from 
each transaction.

Education and capital don't affect the essential desires and goals of a 
person.  It primarily affects the tools that are available to achieve them.  
Attila was quite successful with only a slight technical advantage (and a 
huge morale advantage).  But that doesn't stop certain modern leaders from 
endeavoring to achieve similar goals.  (I.e., to turn the world into a 
pasture for their horses to graze on ... updated appropriately.)

That's glory for you.  Actually, I don't believe that you should take the 
surface meaning here.  Glory is cognate to gory, and when he translate 
"That's glory for you" as "That's a nice knock-down argument" he was perhaps 
being more cynical than arbitrary.

Yes, Charles,
       That is my problem.  Socialism or what I hear called socialism has a 
200 year history of failure usually turned deadly.  However I can't find any 
socialist willing to either recognise their long history of miserable failure 
or to offer a solution explaining why they won't have another murderous 
failure upon the next attempt.  So how do you handle this without simply 
trying to deny that it happened?
       You (socialists plural) are attempting to convince me that you have a 
good idea that I should buy into.  All I see is various totalitarian 
governments resulting from your past attempts.  I don't want to sacrifice my 
life and work to your pipe dreams.
       Please explain exactly what you are going to do to correct your 
problem and please put some teeth into the solution.

At the beginings of the original thread this spawned I
saw arguments as to the origins of capatalism in
pre-industrial and even pre-hominid times.  Then
comments were made on either side as to every society
being capatalist or every society being socialist. 
This drifted into really obscure examples, none which
really seem to apply to the current geo-political
atmospheres.

So, my question, is there any consensus on whether any
current successful societies exist with no elements of
socialism?  And likewise, were any of these 200 years
worth of failed socialist regimes without elements of
capatalism?  I hope the implications of the answers to
these questions are faily clear, although
unfortunately offering no assistance to the original
question of anarchists being socialists or
capitalists.

Recherchete,
       Is that close to your name?  I think anarchism, capitalism and 
socialism might be viewed as existing along a line of totalitarianism.  As 
such none is ever pure. IMHO.
       As such there is a difference between them all. One of the movements 
going on in the world today even in countries that are supposedly capitalist 
is the degree of freedom the citizen has in buying and getting title to 
property.  The proponents of that movement are say that the freedom to own 
land is mostly a first world phenomenena -- or so I understand.  You can look 
up Dr. Hernando de Soto of Peru and his book The Mystery of Capital for more 
on this.

This discussion is starting to sound more and more
like those silly programs on the local Pacifica
Station in which black activists would make the most
utterly absurd and racist claims - like that
caucasians were inherently incapable of living
peacefully because they had a deficiency of melanin in
their brains (confusing melanin and melatonin, I
suspect).  Or the deal with young black boys in
Atlanta being kidnapped so that their foreskins could
be excised for some kind of diabolical experiments by
the CDC.  Of the plot by whites to destroy the black
race by sterilizing young black women.  Ect.  Ect. 
There were worse examples, but I've managed to forget
them, finally.

And then, however, if someone finally got fed up
enough with this nonsense and called in to the program
to accuse these black racists of being black racists,
immediately some black Marxist/Leninist would call in
to refute them by class analysis.  Racism was of
course merely a tool of the capitalist class to
subjugate the proletariat.  Using the claim of class
subjugation as a defining characteristic of racism, it
then followed that whites, as part of that class, were
all inherently racist by nature.  Blacks as part of
the subjugated class could not possibly be racist, no
matter what they said or did.

Capitalism as a term has many meanings, but the basic
economic principle by that name simply refers to any
system in which the accumulation of capital is
employed to enable the doing of projects that no
individual could possibly afford.  This is true of any
society above the subsistance level.  As a more
general term, it refers to societies in which the
private - non-state - accumulation of capital is
permitted.  The accumulation of capital, of course, is
only possible if you have enforceable property rights.
 Otherwise, it will simply be siezed by the first
opportunist to come along.

Anarchy, as I have pointed out and as is easilly
discovered in any decent political encyclopedia, is
not a system at all, but simply the rejection of
rulers - meaning the monopoly state or any similar
establishment of coercive power.  So, the question
arrises then: is property dependent upon the existence
of a ruler or state to force people to recognize it? 
If so, then anarchy and capitalism are incompatible. 
If not, then anarcho-capitalism is not any oxymoron.

No, it is not too strong a statement. One can always invoke new laws of
physics but that is unwise unless there are experimental results
incompatible with known laws and in this case there are no such results.
You'd really be invoking magic. As of now science says there is no way to
recover the history of individual atoms once they have formed a Bose
Einstein Condensate and we don't have the slightest reason to think that
will ever change.

I wasn't trying to be rude but it is a fact in both cases a huge change
in something is claimed when science can detect no change at all.

The book I described earlier this month, Tales of the Equator
http://www.extropy.org/exi-lists/extropians/2290.html , also
has a riviting chapter on the efforts of English and Egyptian
authorities to eliminate slavery in the Sudan in the late
19th century.

Here is a paragraph from the book.  Contrast it with the
report below of what's happening one hundred and twenty-
nine years later in the same place!

"Chapter 15: The Calamities of Equatoria

"In 1873, when Sir Samuel Baker [quite the amazing adventurer!]
left the court of the khedive Ismail [ruler of Egypt], covered
with great honors and pocketing the considerable sum of 40,000
pounds sterling, he sailed from the port of Alexandria back to
England, feeling pretty pleased with the work he had done, and
certain that he had dealt a mortal blow to the slave trade in
the Egyptian Sudan.  Things were quire different in reality.
According to numerous witnesses, the effects of that sudden
crusade against slavery, the foundation of the Sudanese economy,
were much worse than the evil the crusade had been meant to cure.

"First of all, the Koran continued to sanction the right to own
slaves, and to the ears of any good Muslim, the abolition of
slavery sounded like heresy.  Moreover, none of those who had
made small fortunes out of the slave trade were willing to give
up a chance to add to those fortunes, and certainly not in the
name of some abstract principle imposed by European infidels,
in glaring contrast with profound religious convictions and ways
of life that stretched back for centuries.

"The slave trade was not likely to vanish all at once, and indeed
it did not vanish at all: it only went into hiding, abandoning the
easier and more convenient water routes that had been used until
then with the approval and participation of the Egyptian authorities.
The trade found new routes to use.

"From Khartoum, where boats loaded with "black ivory" no longer
descended the Nile, European consuls wrote back to their capitals
that the traffic had been stopped.  In truth, when river transport
was eliminated, the torments of black Africans captured by slavers
became much, much worse.  Previously, some 10 percent of the human
merchandise crammed into the holds of the slave ships---deprived of
water or air---had died.  Now the death rate climbed to 30 percent,
and in some cases 50 percent, as the captives were obliged to march
for hundreds of miles, leaving the Nile behind and heading for
Kordofan, across the Sahara Desert, and finally reaching distant
Tripoli, where they were sold into slavery.

"The slavers cared little about the dizzying increases in losses
because one the slave trade became illegal prices for slaves
increased more than tenfold.  The lot of the surviving slave
improved with his or her sale; the precepts of the Koran ensured
that slaves were treated win a reasonably humane manner in Islamic
countries, like a sort of second-class family member with some
limited rights.  The horrors described in Uncle Tom's Cabin were
specialties of Christian masters.

Well!  From this we see many interesting things that
complicate any simple picture:  (1) the Koran endorses
slavery, but on the other hand makes the life of a
slave not so bad as in other traditions.  (2) you just
can't fight deep tendencies---economic and cultural---
with surface "solutions" imposed
from the outside, because since you haven't the power
to address the underlying forces, your "solutions"
often just make things worse, despite the temporary
self-righteousness you derive.  (3) Check out the
article here and note that 2002-1873 = 129 years later
things haven't improved as much as one might think:

An account of slavery in "modern" Sudan:, from
http://www.africana.com/DailyArticles/index_20000925.htm

"The team went first to Kenya and then traveled by road to locations in southern Sudan, where thousands of slaves labor in
captivity. According to Williams, the mostly Arab Islamic government in the north of the country has declared a "Jihad" on the
southern Sudanese, who are darker-skinned and predominantly Christian or adherents of traditional African religions. Williams and
his counterparts used a network of concerned southern Sudanese and Arab retrievers to purchase the slaves for $33 per person.

"However, much to Williams' dismay, most of the former slaves did not show much excitement after they were freed. He attributed
their lack of enthusiasm to the ever-present uncertainty and dependency they have faced in their lives. Some of the rescued thought
they had only been resold to new masters, while others remained skeptical about their fate or the validity of their newly purchased
freedom. According to CSI, while slaves are in bondage their masters routinely beat them, cut off their fingers and other body parts
as forms of punishment, and rape the women and young girls."

Amazing.

Lee

P.S.  Here's a nice article from Pravda, of all places, on slavery:

http://english.pravda.ru/main/2001/08/06/11890.html

18:31 2001-08-06
PRESENT-DAY SLAVERY. SLAVER CONVICTED, SLAVES WHEREABOUTS STILL UNKNOWN

Mr. Suleimanov, resident of the Republic of Daghestan (Russias administrative district in North Caucasus), has been indicted in the
city of Zlatoust, Chelyabinsk Region. His crime is being qualified by the articles of kidnapping and fraud of the Russian
Federations Criminal Code. Unfortunately, the victim was missing in the court room

In March 2000, a certain Mr. S., driver with one of Zlatoust transportation companies, set out to the city of Volgograd for a
business trip in a KamAZ truck. The automobile was ordered for cargo transportation by Mr. Suleimanov. In April 2000, an application
was lodged with the Zlatoust city police saying that Mr. Suleimanov disappeared. The investigators found that Mr. Suleimanov
deceived Mr. S. and talked him into travelling to Daghestan, according to the Vyorsty newspaper. There, Mr. Suleimanov got hold of a
truck, while Mr. S. was sold into slavery.

Criminal proceedings were launched on June 22nd, 2000. Mr. Suleimanove was searched for and finally detained on the Daghestani
territory. The court found him guilty and sentenced him to 15 years in prison, his property being confiscated. In the meantime, the
whereabouts of the victim have not been pinpointed so far.

Er, no. Firstly, you missed the deadly side-effects of its predecessor,
the ideology of the divine right of kings. If you want to criticise 200
year old events, you can't ignore the context in which they took place,
a context in which the standard form of government was "l'estat, c'est 
moi". Secondly, the phrase "what I hear called socialism" -- emanating
from your direction -- smells somewhat. "Hear called socialism" -- by
whom? Rush Limbaugh? You need to analyse your sources cricially.

Then you haven't looked very far. Nor have you looked at those socialist
states that are successful. (Like, say, the UK. Where the workers -- or
their pension funds -- own about 80% of the assets on the stock market.
Or like Finland, rated *way* above your own country on metrics such as
freedom of speech. Or Canada, for example.)

I'm not, because I'm not a socialist. What I *am* is trying to get you
to open your eyes, do some basic research, and use the same language as
the rest of us for discussing phenomena.

Having missed the UK, France, Germany, Canada, Finland, Norway, Sweden,
the Netherlands, Japan ...

Basically, all developed nations today (including the USA, to a lesser
extent than most) are "socialist" nations by the standards of the mid-
nineteenth century, let alone the mid-eighteenth. To that extent, the
socialist agenda needs to be deemed a success. (The same cannot be said
of the communist agenda, and especially the Leninist totalitarian
tendency.)

No, they don't. The core of socialism is about the worker's ownership of
the means of production, not about big government.

I *think* the big government meme crept in during the 1950's in the USA,
specifically during the McCarthy hearings. "Godless communism" had fellow-
travellers, and those fellow travellers were the socialists, so socialism
was ipso facto tarred with the brush of Stalinism. Which is a bit like
tarring the Republican party with the brush of Nazism.

We're in violent agreement; that's why I'm not a free-market capitalist
(*or* a socialist, you should note).

Which is why the system that works best in practice seems to be a mixture;
free market opportunities to generate wealth, regulatory oversight to 
prevent incumbents in the market from abusing positions of strength to
lock out newcomers and competitors, and non-free-market systems to deal
with those externalities which don't have a fiscal stimulus attached to
them.

What do ribosomes produce? What is apoptosis?  What are stem cells,
and why do we have them?

Get back to me when you can answer these questions.

That should be "deemed a relative success." By some metrics not dependant on
the advance of technology (e.g. confiscation and destruction of wealth by
the state, violence per capita, that sort of thing), the nations above look
pretty sucky compared to the hoary old example of Iceland circa 900-1200AD.

We do ourselves a disservice when we judge our progress in black and white
in relation to the wino on the street. Whaever happened to grading ourselves
in shades of grey against our own best potentiality? We should not be
judging the success of current nation states in black and white against
clearly failed, horrible systems. Yes, we live in systems that are better
than the dark communist USSR. Is this "success?" Only if you have low
standards. Why settle for mere avoidance of living in terror, ignorance and
threat of death, when there is so much more beyond that? After all, you're
still a slave to the State in every country on that list up there. Your
freedom is restricted, your property confiscated, your body is not your own
to do with as you wish, and your very ability to live to the age you desire
is dictated by others.

Feh to "success." We're nowhere near it yet.

telepresence proxies it is provably impossible to completely hide all
unique fingerprints of a human, or even a complex mass-produced artifact.
Such a composite fingerprint will be impossible to fake and is impossible
to change without completely remaking the object of measurement. (Try
changing your body odor (MHC is genome-encoded and is the target of the
immunosystem), or rewire parts of CNS in control of your motorics).

While all current technologies are extremely limited in their capabilities
and have a high error rate this is not intrinsic to the principle. Such
systems can be eventually made to work sufficiently well for practice.

This is being made possible by further falling technology costs in regards
to mass fabbing, crunch and cheap ubiquitous wireless. Where's light, 
there's shadow.

Unfortunately, brinistas welcome this development because they idiotically
assume that the technology enables symmetrically, or even assymentrically
in favour of the governed vs. the government. Their arguments sound
superficially convincing to those unfamiliar with the political process
and the logics of power flow. This is the reason they're doing the wrong
thing for the right reasons. Supply the missing part of the argument
whenever you see Brinworld meme propagating.

Your best angle to delay this is to circulate this information widely, and
explain its potential impact to technologically naive. Write (personalized
dead tree, no electronic communication) to your political representatives.

No technical solution will work in absence of laws making it legal. Once
countermeasures are made illegal the development is basically
irreversible. Catch it before it's too late.

Privacy Villain of the Week:
DARPA's HumanID at a Distance

The Defense Advance Research Projects Agency <http://www.darpa.mil/> has 
been one of the more fruitful government agenies in the past, its DARPAnet 
computer network being the foundation for what would become the Internet 
some years later. That is why reading about what this outfit is up to now 
can at times be disheartening. One such project is the HumanID at a 
Distance program, which aims to move beyond face-recognition technology and 
purportedly identify people by the way the walk.

The idea here is that by measuring with video or (clothes-penetrating) 
radar the distance between, say, 17 different points on the body 
<http://gtresearchnews.gatech.edu/images/gait1.jpg> and measuring how these 
points move in relation to one another, a person can be positively and 
uniquely identified.

This "gait technology" by itself is neutral of course, just as technologies 
such as a gun or a needle or or the banging of flint against stone. The 
problem here arises in that by funding such research, the government is 
pushing a technology on society that it has not freely accepted through the 
voluntary choices made in the market. A patina of legitimacy is 
unfortunately added to such technologies when they have the imprimatur of 
the state behind them.
Even when the lead researchers on the project issue a press release 
<http://gtresearchnews.gatech.edu/newsrelease/GAIT.htm> with conflictuing 
estimations of accuracy ranging from .0001% to 95%.

These selfsame researchers go on to tout the tech for use "around federal 
buildings" and in airports (which have now had their security systems 
completely taken over by the federal government). The airport situation is 
particularly troubling, in that it would be installed after the new 
Transportation Security Agency has complete control of all US airports. 
Adding the full-body radar scans that are part of a gait-biometric system 
to their CAPPS database incorporating name, Social Security number, credit 
history, travel history, etc., is a small step. This would be another peice 
of information in a federal database left wide open to abuse by not only 
those with official and unofficial clearance but anyone who bribes or hacks 
their way in.

In addition, the potential for false positives seems to be overwhelming. 
Even if the number is closer to 95% than .001%, what happens when a heavy 
piece of luggage and lack of sleep slumps the shoulders enough to peg a 
weary traveler as a dangerous terrorist? Is he or she strip-searched and 
detained by armed federal employees while the plane to his mother's funeral 
leaves for the other coast? This kind of technological forcing, especially 
in situations controlled by the state, puts individuals in a position 
where, due to lack of adequate societal knowledge, individuals are unable 
to control the kind of information being disseminated about themselves.

Identification technology has its uses. But when government forces it on 
everyone, from a Social Security number onward, the long-term effects are 
net negative -- oversurveillance , undersecurity, identity theft, etc. 
DARPA scientists and their colleagues at places like Carnegie Mellon 
<http://hid.ri.cmu.edu/> and Georgia Tech may be taking great strides 
forward -- but do they recignize where to, or why this may earn them the 
title of Privacy Villain of the Week?

This is also something where the theory doesn't appear to match the practice.  
Currently the regulators of the market are "0wn3d" by those they are supposed 
to regulate.  I don't know whether it has been this extreme before, or not, 
but currently if you have enough money, and deploy it with even moderate 
skill, you seem to be able to ignore practically any regulation that's 
intended to protect people.  The penalty for getting caught is less than the 
increase in profit.  OTOH, if you are small, just getting started, or 
operating on shoestring, then you had better toe the line on a list of 
regulations that's too long for ANYONE to understand.

Charlie,
       Modern day socialism seems to have its origins in the French 
Revolution.  By the late 19th Century it had enough of a track record for 
failure and human repression,  per von Hayek, that it was necessary to rework 
its image.  For that reason they began adopting the term liberal.
       Even today you will note their tendency to use every means possible to 
disguise their true nature.  In addition there is a constant effort to move 
from the concrete of their past records to the abstraction of theory in 
advancing their ideas.
       Guys, in the end socialism is only an attempt to restore the old 
absolute monarchs and usurp the power of the total dictator.  It really seems 
to appeal to the inadequate to have the power to terrorize their fellow man.
       As Ayn Rand said they don't want your obedience they want you to 
crawl.

This is somewhat inconsistent with the data since the casualty rate of the
terrorists is much higher than that of the hostages. Either they applied
the gas selectively (possible, since the distribution of terrorists vs.  
hostages was different), or let the terrorists die deliberately.  
According to the reports the hostages lived on chocolate and water. I
doubt they had much appetite. Not much to vomit on...

I agree that it's impossible to reliably knock out people with gas and not
cause at least a few casualties. It might work if you go in quickly,
remove people, administer antidote, and put people on life support. It's 
hard to do that with several 100 people, however.

In any case, the alternatives can be worse. We still don't know whether
the charges and the intent stated were for real.

Current guesses are that it was BZ (QNB): Quinuclidinebenzillate.
But Google and Vivisimo only get one hit on that name.  Looks like
its really:
  3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate (6581-06-2)

Interestingly, this gas was supposed to have been used by the Serbs
in Bosnia.  According to one report the U.S. produced over 100,000
pounds of BZ for use in Vietnam.

Of course one would have to wonder why the Russian's who are
supposed to be in the process of destroying their chemical
weapons would happen to have enough BZ on hand to flood an entire
building with it...

You're going to die anyway. Kill yourself now.

Non sequitur. If the development doesn't happen you don't have a case. If
hardware gets cheaper but is not deployed because voters value their
privacy you have no case. If countermeasures are legal you have no case.

The same technology driving global surveillance also offers advent of
countermeasures. I mentioned anonymous telepresence hardware proxies, and
sooner or later telepresence is going to become the preferred means of
interaction, and much later complete redesign of our hardware platform at
molecular scale will become possible. This will take time to develop. We
don't need power-crazy maniacs ruining it for everybody, really.

Governments are not complete juggernauts. They're somewhat controllable. 
It's surveillance that gives them the ultimate power to squash opposition. 
You included. Don't give them the means voluntarily. Fight.

Dream on. Here's the point where Brin's assumptions break down. I can give
you a long list why this won't work.

You can delay both development and deployment. If you delay it long enough 
it will no longer have the bite it would currently have.

Political decisions could kill the demand driving development. Cheapest 
way for the fringe is to inform and develop countermeasures. Since 
cypherpunks no longer code, spreading information should have priority.

It looks like Google is getting into the information source
business.   (Wasn't Northern Lights doing this for a while???).

At any rate cruise on over to http://answers.google.com/

I've looked at a few of the questions and answers.  In some
cases we seem to be talking pretty deep material and pretty
deep answers as well.  The answers in many cases would appear
to be in greater depth than the payment seems to justify
(at least to me), so we may be getting into a "gift economy"
structure here.  [People like to show off their knowledge.]

Now of course this raises all sorts of interesting entertainment
possibilities.  What kind of "interesting" questions could
extropians or transhumanists ask to bait the answer persons?
Of course you have to put your money on the line here, but
given the amount of time some individuals devote to the ExI
list, they should certainly be willing to pay for a higher
level of entertainment...

It looks like you have to pony up some serious money $10-$50
to get really good responses.  So that equates to what -- 2-10
movies or 3-15 hours of entertainment?

My first question: "What causes aging and how do we prevent it?".

Now of course if Spike was willing to spend $XXX to travel
halfway across the country to explain an engine problem
to a bunch of motorheads then he must be willing to pay
$YYY in a public forum to get an ill-informed answer and
be able to comment on it (yes?).

My second question: "Why doesn't Max More have a faster car than
Greg Burch?"

Come on folks, put your thinking caps on...

Robert

Hmm...I must admit that it is an interesting concept, but I wonder how 
Google chooses their "carefully screened Researchers."  For example, in the 
"recently answered questions" section, one of the questions is "Why do 
music CDs get released on Tuesdays."  The answer that person was given is 
just plain wrong.  It is *not* because of Billboard magazine's weekly 
release date is on Wednesdays...perhaps a better question would be "Why is 
Billboard magazine released on Wednesdays?"

So who is to bar false or misinformed answers?

I haven't been following this discussion, but it is reasonably
accurate to say that "most" tissues turnover at a rate varying
from days to several hundred days.

> What do ribosomes produce?

Proteins.

> What is apoptosis?

Programmed cell death that results in the elimination of cells
with a minimal amount of inflamation.

> What are stem cells,

Cells that have a limited ability to repair and replace other
tissues (at least in adults).  In contrast, embryonic stem
cells are totipotent and probably have the ability to generate
any tissue if they receive the proper signals.

> and why do we have them?

Because without them, significant injuries (presumably common
when one is hunting mammoths or saber toothed tigers) would be
fatal.  Also because many tissues from blood to the brain need to
have a constant supply of new cells to function properly.

While Charlie's numbers are probably likely accurate for material *within*
muscle cells, I question whether they are accurate with regard
to the extracellular matrix (which has a much lower turnover rate).
The slow turnover rate of the extracellular matrix is probably
one of the reasons we become "stiffer" with age.

One "factoid" which is very well supported from the scientific
literature is that protein turnover rates *do* decrease with age.
See: http://www.deamidation.org and papers by N. E. Robinson
in PubMed.  The recycling rate for proteins may be "optimal" for
young individuals, but it suboptimal for older individuals.
In short -- the genetic program does not adapt well to "aging".

Lee, I am quite certain that you usually DO understand what others are
saying, but it has been my experience and observation that you often do not
acknowledge that you understand the other person's points.  This often leads
the other person to feel disconnected,  repeat their same points, and grow
frustrated with you.

Personally, my intitial frustration with you has been replaced by
appreciation of a sense of playfulness, and I benefit from your eruditeness.

Thanks for the pointer.  I ordered the book today from Amazon.

In your posts later today, two points of your points have become clearer, at
least to me:  (1) You are talking about "survival of identify", and (2) you
are saying that in the future, as the technical means become available, it
makes sense for us to value the survival of our identity with importance
equal to our current concept of "survival of self."

If you agree with my statements of understanding above, then I think you and
I are in essentialy complete agreement as to the logical and rational way of
looking at "survival of identity."  The challenge will be to overcome our
human nature that evolved with the more limited concept of "survival of
physical self."

Lee raises an interesting question:

Paraphrasing to verify my understanding:
Lee is talking about "survival of identity", and is suggesting that we make
a
couple of changes in our thinking.  (1) He is saying we should broaden
our concept of self-identity to include copies of ourselves, even if they
have branched from the original and have somewhat different experiences.
This concept of identify can be justified by pointing out that we currently
claim
a constant identity despite many changes to our selves over the years.
(2) He is suggesting we overcome our human nature, evolved to think of
ourselves
as constrained within a single body, and begin to value "survival of our
identity"
(as defined above) equally with our current concept of "survival of self".

I think I clearly see Lee's logic, and his statements have value, but I
disagree with what seems to be a value judgment at the end of his reasoning.
I don't see
any reason why I should value other branches of myself equally with myself.
I think it's more useful to consider them as separate individuals who have
the special relationship of being branches of myself.

Stated another way, I can see why we currently value "survival of self",
even if only
because of very strong evolutionary programming.  It appears there is an
implied
assumption here that if we agree that "survival of self" is important to us
now, then we must also
agree that the broader "survival of identity" will be similarly important to
us with the broader
technical capabilities we will have in the future.  I would argue that we
will have
broader choices to go with the broader capabilities, and that it would be
more
advantageous to consider all copies to be separate individuals with special
relationships to each other due to branching.

Well, Robert, its like this.  With my bike problem,
I cheerfully spent the cash because I already know
*exactly* what bolts to turn and which parts to
replace, exactly what to do in order to allow my
fellow riders to age naturally and die of old age
in their beds with weeping family members gathered
around.  I do not know how to save them from dying
of old age.  I haven't a single insight, not one
clue, on how to prevent or delay aging, other than
to eat sparingly.  So I do that, and encourage others
to do likewise.

Nowthen, a couple weeks ago we were discussing forming
a kind of mini-borg, or a highly interconnected group
of people that pool their wisdom to some extent.  That
discussion was sidetracked by someone asking how we
can insure equality, etc.  I now have a better answer
to that question: I can confidently insure inequality.
If a good mini-borg were to form, it would dominate
less connected companies and corporations, I can assure
you.  This will motivate individuals to form bigger and
more interconnected borgs, to compete with the other.
And so it goes.

With a number of competing borgs, we have a new
toolkit to work on such vexing problems as aging and
its effects on individual humans.  We need a new and
better toolkit.  This problem is kicking our collective
fanny so far.  spike

Sounds reasonable to me.  If you make reference to someone as an authority, 
you should be willing to identify them.  (Well, the comment about Russ 
Limbaugh was snide, but for all we know true.)

That said, I must acknowledge that it's frequently impossible to specify 
particular sources.  In that case, one should just do the best one can.  
E.G.:
In (a or several) conversations that I overhear (on a bus/ at a train 
station/in a fancy resturant/at a lecutre on sociology).  <== select a 
choice, or create your own sentence.  But that's the kind of information that 
I understood was being requested.

The reason that you're decrying socialism seems to be, from your posts, 
coming from your definition of socialism. The reason most socialists will 
not acknolwedge the 200 year failed history of socialism (or at least, I 
hope they won't) is because the countries you are talking about were simply 
not socialistic. The workers didn't control industry in Russia. Or China. Or 
any other of these "socialist" countries. I think about the nearest to real 
workers control is--interestingly enough--the Nordic countries. In my 
opinion, most anything which impedes direct worker control-- whether it be 
called "socialist" or "capitalist" or "totalitarian" is simply 
authoritarianism and is something that we should try to fight. Now, that 
isn't completely absolute, but in general I'd stick to it.

You still haven't identified any sources.  I'm not even saying sources that we 
could check on, just *SOMETHING*.  If you don't, and won't, then don't be 
surprised if people suspect the worst.

Alex,
       You are only doing the thing socialist have done for the past two 
hundred years is to try to move toward the abstract and change the 
definitions to give yourself another shot at gaining control over another 
group of victims.
       Of course all those countries you have tried to define away were 
socialists.  They not only defined themselves as socialist at the time but 
all over the world socialist in every country defined them as socialist and 
apologized, lied or explained away their failures until they (usually) 
collapsed of their own weight from lack of support by their own citizenry.  
When the record of those countries became an open secret and a scandal to the 
blue jays then a fresh crop of socialist started defining them away as you 
are attempting to do now -- it won't work.
       I say this to you -- those miserable excuses for a human government 
are yours.  If you wish to do something acknowledge your failures and tell us 
how you are going to guarantee not to repeat the same mistakes in the future. 
 Right now, the rest of us know how we are going to avoid a repetition, we 
are going to avoid socialists.

A state has a monopoly on making laws, or at least that's what it claims, so
I'm all in favor of getting rid of the state but I don't see why you would
want that if you like socialism. If my house is bigger than your house and
my family is smaller than your family you are going to need a law saying
I must give my house to you and the enforcement power to back it up
because I certainly won't do it voluntarily.

And true Catholics don't kill Protestants and true Hindus don't kill

This is a false statement. A cheap shot, in fact. I will stack the code 
written by attendees of the recent CP meetings against your code, 
Eugene, any day. (No offense, Eugene,  but I despise these 
"fashionable" cheap shots which miss the mark so...cheaply.)

At the last Cypherpunks meeting, which happened to be at my house, we 
saw excellent examples of coding on several important fronts: BitStorm, 
Software-Defined Radio, the new release of PGP, and Mixmaster. Major 
new examples of coding on all three main fronts: crypto, remailers, 
peer-to-peer, and the recent addition of SDR, which promises to blow 
the roof off of attempts by governments to ban listening at certain 
frequencies.

I realize it has become fashionable in this post-fin-de-siecle era of 
ennui to jabber about how boring things have become, but people are 
still coding. Granted, there are fewer "new and surprising" apps, but 
this is completely to be expected. We had a very good idea of the 
classes of apps as long ago as 1990, and the first half of the 1990s 
saw several very good realizations of most of them.

CodeCon, earlier this year, was a smashing success.

I just want to let everyone know the cryonics gathering we had at the Creekside was a big success! : )  A good-sized group of people showed up who got to enjoy a good buffet, a detailed tour of the lodge, and a milestone talk by Dr. Jerry Lemler.  

Another great moment was during the walking tour when David Pizer had taken us to a hilltop, and he shared his vision of Ventureville.  I could see it in my mind's eye.

It was a pleasure for me to see Mike Perry again.  Also, it was nice to get to know better the other staff members of Alcor(along with everyone else).  

We got some very needed networking done.

I am helping to write an article for "Cryonics" magazine about the event.  I hope everyone on this list has or will get a subscription to this excellent publication.  It may be the best way to get the inside scoop on the events here over the weekend!

I wish you all could have attended.  This was a cryonics gathering which was one for the history books(really).    

best wishes,

John

Not only is your view most useful, but I think a
little rational thought shows it to be perfectly true
and obvious.

Lee has failed to offer any reason that any possible
copied versions of ourselves should not be considered
in the same way that we would consider identical twin
siblings with whom we happened also to share some
common memories. 

Clearly we would be intimately related to such people
-- I agree with Lee that it would be very odd to meet
someone who looked like me and who remembered some of
the same things I remembered. Due to the common
memories that person would be more closely related to
me than a twin-sibling. However in other respects he
would be no different from a twin-sibling.

Despite those common memories, my other version's
personality would have diverged from mine in the first
moment after the branching, such that he would have
his own independent thoughts and emotions and
experiences. He would have his own cares and
considerations. He would experience his own joys and
pains according to his own personal experiences and
expectations. If he committed a crime then only he
would be responsible. If he succeeded in life then
only he would reap the benefits of those successes. If
he fell in love then only he would feel the closeness
of that bond. 

It would be a crime against reason to assume that
other person to be me. And yet here we have Lee
Corbin, who claims with apparent sincerity that after
"thirty years" of research he has concluded that such
branched versions of ourselves should be considered
identical to self. Such rot.

Italian author slams Islam's 'hate' for West

By Tom Carter
THE WASHINGTON TIMES

The Islamic world is engaged in a cultural war with the West and the worst
is still to come, Italian author Oriana Fallaci told a receptive Washington
audience last night.

Spinning off a long list of Islamic countries, she told a group of about 80
people: "The hate for the West swells like a fire fed by the wind. "The
clash between us and them is not a military one. It is a cultural one, a
religious one, and the worst is still to come," she continued in what she
said was her first public address in more than a decade. Tight security was
in place for the speech at the American Enterprise Institute after death
threats were issued against her and her attorney as a result of her latest
book, "The Rage and the Pride," which contains harsh criticism of Muslims.
The book, which she called a "sermon" to Europe, was written in New York in
the two weeks after September 11 as the smoke and dust from the destruction
of the World Trade Center blanketed the city. Miss Fallaci contends in the
angry polemic that the only difference between "moderate Islam" and "radical
Islam" is the length of their beards. She said last night that critics have
attempted to ban the book or have her arrested in France, Belgium,
Switzerland and Italy. The 72-year-old author described these efforts as
"intellectual terrorism." Miss Fallaci, who lives in New York and is
afflicted with cancer, also criticizes Western culture for its loose morals
and licentiousness. "Freedom cannot exist without discipline,
self-discipline, and rights cannot exist without duties. Those who do not
observe their duties do not deserve their rights," she said. In her prime,
Miss Fallaci was famed as a belligerent journalist and argumentative
interviewer, who had unprecedented access to the world's most reclusive and
wary leaders. A partisan in the Italian resistance in World War II and a
lifelong leftist, she once became so disgusted while interviewing Iran's
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini that she ripped off her head scarf and threw it
in his face. The act of defiance was considered an unpardonable sin in the
ayatollah's Iran. "The Rage and the Pride," originally published in an
Italian newspaper and then as a book, has sold more than 1 million copies in
Italy and has been popular in Germany and France as well. All three nations
have large Muslim immigrant populations. Variously praised as the painful
truth or decried as a "bigoted, anti-Muslim screed," Miss Fallaci's book is
under threat of judicial action in France for inciting racial hatred.
A lawsuit brought by the Movement Against Racism and for Friendship Between
People, a Muslim human rights group, is demanding that the book be banned in
France. In a ruling yesterday that may affect her case, a French court
acquitted best-selling French author Michel Houellebecq of charges of racial
insult and inciting racial hatred for calling Islam the "dumbest religion."
The Paris court threw out the case brought by officials from the main
mosques in Paris and the central-eastern city of Lyon and other Muslim
groups after an interview Mr. Houellebecq gave to the French literary
magazine Lire. "The dumbest religion, after all, is Islam," he told the
magazine. "When you read the Koran, you're shattered. The Bible at least is
beautifully written because the Jews have a heck of a literary talent."
While the court ruled that the 44-year-old author's comments were "without a
doubt characterized by neither a particularly noble outlook nor by the
subtlety of their phrasing," they did not constitute a punishable offense.
While Mr. Houellebecq indeed had expressed hatred for Islam as a religion,
the court said, he had not expressed hatred for Muslims, nor did he
encourage others to share his views or discriminate against Muslims. Miss
Fallaci, in her first book in more than 10 years, said she was prompted to
write by demonstrations throughout the Muslim world and in pockets of Europe
celebrating the September 11 attacks on the United States. Her anger, based
on years of reporting in Muslim countries, is evident. Her detractors call
the work an incitement to kill Muslims. Unrepentant, Miss Fallaci calls the
downing of the Twin Towers an act of cultural war and says the superior
Western civilization must stand up and defeat Islam. "War you wanted, war
you want? Good. As far as I am concerned, war it is and war it will be.
Until the last breath," she writes.

French Author Acquitted of Charges for Anti-Islam Comment
By ALAN RIDING
(New York Times)

PARIS, Oct. 22 - The French novelist Michel Houellebecq, who often seems to
delight in shocking his readers, was acquitted by a Paris court today of
charges of inciting racial hatred when he declared in an interview last year
that Islam was "the most stupid religion."

The verdict by a three-member bench had been expected after the public
prosecutor recommended during a court hearing last month that all charges be
dropped. The case was brought by three Muslim associations and the Human
Rights League in Paris.

Mr. Houellebecq (pronounced WELL-beck), 45, who lives in Ireland and was not
present in court today, made his comment about Islam during an interview
last year with the literary magazine Lire. "When you read the Koran, you
give up," he said at the time. "At least the Bible is very beautiful because
Jews have an extraordinary literary talent."

The writer, best known in the United States for his second novel, "The
Elementary Particles," was being interviewed by Lire to publicize his third
novel, "Plateforme." As with his other works, "Plateforme" is an acid
commentary on modern Western society told largely through sexual encounters
and frustration. But it ends with a Muslim extremist attack on a tourist
resort in Thailand, which prompts the narrator to wish for the death of
Palestinians.

Mr. Houellebecq's lawyers argued that his commentary fell within the bounds
of free speech. When the public prosecutor endorsed that position, the
lawyer for the Muslim and rights groups, Jean-Marc Varaut, expressed
astonishment. "To call Islam `the most stupid religion' is a provocation,"
he said.

Still, while the case has drawn attention in the news media here, it has not
brought on a crisis in France's oft-troubled relations with its large Muslim
population. Rather, it appears to have been viewed more as another example
of Mr. Houellebecq's talent in drawing attention to himself by being
outrageously politically incorrect.

Mr. Houellebecq nonetheless won support from from the British writer Salman
Rushdie, who lived under a death fatwa after Iranian clerics said they found
blasphemy in his 1988 novel, "The Satanic Verses." This week another British
novelist, Martin Amis, was quoted as telling The Times of London that "it
seems to me that the key to radical Islam is that it is quivering with male
insecurity." And he added, "There's a huge injection of sexuality - men's
sexuality - in radical Islam."

In a case parallel to Mr. Houellebecq's, also currently before French
courts, the Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci is facing charges of inciting
racial hatred for the assertion in her post-Sept. 11 book, "The Rage And The
Pride," that Muslims "multiply like rats."

In its ruling today, the Paris court acknowledged that Mr. Houellebecq's
remark about Islam was "without a doubt characterized by neither a
particularly noble outlook nor by the subtlety of its phrasing." But the
court said it was not a punishable offense. "This remark does not contain
any intent to abuse verbally, show contempt for or insult the followers of
the religion in question," it said.

Mr. Houellebecq's lawyer, Emmanuel Pierrat, said he noted with "great
satisfaction" that the crime of blasphemy had not been reinstated in French
law.

Speaking for the Muslim groups, Mr. Varaut told reporters that he intended
to appeal the verdict.

Reliable and blanket biometrics takes large resources to develop and
deply. It's being paid from your taxes. Feds are creating the demand,
being the singlest large customer by far. Do you think that's a good use
of your taxes? Do you think we need that particular market?

I don't trust government to be reformable. I trust it to be somewhat
controllable through the political process. The juggernaut tries to remove
the safeguards (you've been reading the news, right?) or route around them
in its effort to start rolling downhill, crushing everything in its path.  
Global realtime surveillance is a much too powerful tool to be given.

Even if we and the feds were given the same information, they would do oh 
so much more with it, and most of it not to your liking. I honestly do not 
see how you can't see something so obvious.

Many of those hostages are probably innocent.  So are probably the many, 
many more Chechnyan civilians killed by Russians.  Innocence abounds.

Some people were claiming that the Muscovite apartment bombings were 
internal to coalesce a united front against the Chechens, Putin and his 
predecessors' war effort there was increasingly unpopular at the time.

Russia's military campaign in Chechnya is largely ignored here in the 
United States.  So was their campaign in Afghanistan, except to the 
extent American-funded mujahadeen, including one Osama bin Laden, worked 
to counter the "red menace".

http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=Chechnya+%22seven+dead%22

http://www.google.com/search?q=%22dead+Chechens%22&hl=en&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1

I figured they'd use sleeping gas, some form of gas, in that kind of 
action.  The Chechens seem surprisingly ineffective if they didn't have 
something on a deadman switch, or if they had no bombs.

The Russians are probably guilty of killing more Chechens than Chechens 
Russians.

Sweden ain't too bad.  Every country has problems.

The United States has plenty of socialism.  There are many 
"entitlements", probably the most well-known being "Social Security" 
retirement allotments.  Canada and the United Kingdom have socialized 
medicine.  Those are facets of a socialized polity.

Those countries you mention are or were arguably fascist, totalitarian, 
or lawless and not socialist.

There are few or no totally capitalist or totally socialist societies.  
Government itself is a form of socialism.

Did you know that income taxes in the United States are about a third of 
personal income for low income workers?  Is that not ridiculous?  On top 
of that are plentiful regressive sales and fuel taxes.  Property taxes 
vary.  That money goes to fund many arguably socialist programs.  
Umpteen of them are arguably too inefficient to be justified in their 
existence, or their inefficiency is unjustified.  For example, the 
Bureau of Indian Affairs had hundreds of millions stolen from the 
Indians that is not being adequately investigated, HUD apparently 
misplaced several hundred million dollars, and the Pentagon can't 
account for, according to some figures, 25% of its budget, which is 25% 
of tax proceeds.

http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=%22can%27t+account+
for%22

Those kinds of incompetencies, some arguably crimes, hurt the economy a 
lot more than anything else that comes to mind.

The means of production are in private hands because there haven't been 
any governments efficient enough to survive, or rather, thrive in a 
competitive global economy, after taking over the means of production.  
That's a point open to wide interpretation and debate, I'm a firm 
believer in equitably private property, and often against statism.

"No confidence, none of the above."

Back in the fifties or whatever, there was a wav of what was called 
McCarthyism, dark ugly days in the American history, where socialism was 
lambasted as being evil and even criminal.  That kind of polemic logic 
ignores political and economic realities.

According to the Constitution, the federal government is to raise its 
proceeds through tariffs on international trade, and that is all.

Right. That soulcatcher chip is an interesting idea but even if it became
reality it would not allow for survival of death.

"Survival of identity," separate from survival of self, is something we
humans have been procuring for many centuries. We ensure the survival of our
identities in the form of tombstones with epitaphs, published
autobiographies, foundations in our name, etc.  I don't think anyone here is
gullible enough to think such things are really a means by which our persons
survive death.

Imagine a tombstone that contained a very high-tech epitaph. Instead of a
sentence or two from you, it would contain a holographic image of your face
and programming that encapsulated your entire personality at the time the
program was coded. That tombstone would be able to interact with your
descendants who might come by to visit you and "mourn your death." Instead
of reading your epitaph, they would strike up a conversation with you...

"Hi Uncle Albert! We sure wish you had never died! We really miss you!"

"Hello there dear ones! Good to see you! I miss you too!"

"Do you remember the time you took Bobbie and me to the circus?"

"Why yes of course I do! How could I ever forget how you got cotton candy
all over your face!"

"Tell me, Uncle Albert, what's it like after we die? What is the after-life
like?"

"Well, let's see. I guess I would have to say it's very, umm, binary..."

Holographic tombstones could even interact with other holographic tombstones
in some transhuman future in which only the holographic tombstones survive.
We could even enable our tombstones to walk and behave as we did during our
lives.

Such things make for great sci-fi imagery but in the end we're still only
talking about a graveyard full of rotting dead people with high-tech
tombstones.

That's what it originally said, yup. Sixteenth amendment put paid to that.

If you can phase out the two or three instances of Judao-Christian
preachifying and assumption of natural rights on the part of the author,
this long article is quite educational on the history of US taxation. As
taxation grows, so freedom lessens.

http://www.mises.org/etexts/rootofevil.asp

Tariffs are not all that good themselves; they lead to protectionism. A
better model for funding a minarchy (or an outsourced foreign office, as was
the scope of the original federal government) would be government services
provided by many competing corporation-like entities. Providing service X to
Y% of the populace gives your corporation some fractional voting rights in
the outsourced foreign office committee.

Thanks, but this still is not quite correct. The "coding" has in fact  
been discussed here on this list, or pointers given to it.

1. BitTorrent has been discussed several times. For example,

http://www.inet-one.com/cypherpunks/dir.2002.03.18-2002.03.24/msg00285.html

Bram Cohen gave an update at a meeting last winter, then at CodeCon,  
then at the meeting last month.

2. PGP and the new release of PGP 8.0 by PGP Corporation have been  
discussed a few times. Jon Callas, Chief SomethingIForget at PGP  
Corporation, gave a presentation at the meeting on PGP directions and  
some details of PGP 8. There have also been discussions on the list.

3. Eric Blossom talked about the Software Defined Radio he and others,  
including Steve Schear, are working on. He also gave a demo of the  
radio at a Cypherpunks meeting last spring (also in Santa Cruz,  
coincidentally). This was discussed on the mailing list (someone even  
forwarded some announcements from a leading shortwave radio maker about  
their own version of a SDR).

4. Len Sassaman, who now is the main keeper of the MixMaster code,  
described the status of the code and features being added. I'm not sure  
how much of this gets currently discussed on the CP list, given that  
there's a separate remailer operators list which interested folks  
subscribe to. But remailers still get mentioned, and of course used, by  
folks on the list.

So, in these four areas real code is being generated. These get  
mentioned on the list...one just has to notice them, and remember.

My main point is to refute the defeatism that often is clothed in the  
language of cynicism and ennui. Much is still being done. It isn't  
getting the attention of the press, which is probably a good thing.  
(They have moved on to other topics. And nobody is being threatened  
with jail, so crypto is no longer as edgy as it was when PRZ was facing  
prosecution, when crypto exports were illegal, when Clipper was in the  
news.)

There was some other good code talked about. Mike Korns has a truly  
massive "agent" program running, doing data mining with live stock  
market data. While not strictly related to the main themes of  
Cypherpunks, he's a friend of mine and I invited him and his wife to  
the meeting, and then I invited him to give a brief talk (all of the  
talks were brief...all were held to a maximum of 15 minutes, to reduce  
droning and PowerPoint bullshit marketing slides). His system is a  
programming tour de force, IMO, based in a mix of C, LISP, and  
Javascript.

The role of agents and of complex systems in general in cypherpunkish  
digital economies is a fertile area. Logic, belief, and Bayesian  
reasoning are all candidates. (I gave a 10-minute talk on nonstandard  
logic, specifically some formalisms from Brouwer and Heyting, and  
connected it to propagation of belief. As in reputation systems, with  
some degree of transitivity in belief propagation.

As someone said to me later in the evening, he's been waiting for 10  
years for crypto to turn to mathematical logic for ideas. Too soon to  
know if this is happening, but it's exciting.

(Regrettably, Dave Molnar could not be at the meeting, being that he  
was back at Harvard by the time of the meeting. He and Steve Schear had  
come out to my house a few weeks earlier and we'd had a good discussion  
of these topics. Dave also showed up at one of our informal Math Group  
evening meetings near Stanford, where several of us meet to talk about  
things like category theory.)

Anyway, the mantra "Cypherpunks write code" is more than just about  
writing Python scripts or C++ library modules. It is really about  
_building_ things. Sometimes with soldering irons, sometimes with  
compilers, sometimes even with words. People have different skills.  
Expecting them all to be C language experts is silly. Most of the best  
number theorists are not programmers at all...they have grad students  
and the like for that. And many of the best cryptographers are not  
number theorists. (I could go on about this for hours, about the  
absurdity of people who want to do crypto thinking they need to learn  
number theory! Even Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman knew essentially no  
number theory. One of them got the idea that maybe the difficulty of  
factoring could be used as the core for what they were doing...I have  
also heard that the idea came from another on the staff at MIT, but I  
won't get into that right now. Then they "crammed" and learned what  
they needed to learn about stuff like Euler's totient function, methods  
for finding primes, etc. It was enough.

Sorry for the digression. The point is that newcomers to crypto think  
they must learn number theory...nonsense. And they think they need to  
be a C++ expert...also nonsense.

Careful thought is what is needed most of all, especially now.

That's the best form of writing code.

It is my feeling that we should first get rid of the notion of
consciousness as a *thing*, instead adopting the notion of
consciousness as a *process*. Then the question of identity looks
quite different ...

Not as far as I know. Reading up on the Levellers and Diggers of the
early 17th century, in the run-up to the English civil war, shows up
a lot of the same ideas. That those ideas then hybridized with the
philosophical themes of the enlightenment and, in some cases, surfaced
during the French Revolution is inarguable. But there was a continuous
strain of development that didn't stop there.

Incidentally, the ideas those groups were pushing _also_ included:
freedom of religion, a universal franchise, votes for all adults (not
just male landowners), abolition of slavery, and equality before the
law. It's chastening to think just how long it's taken for that radical
17th century platform to become the political orthodoxy.

Er, I don't think so. Liberals existed in the UK as a distinct political
tradition going back to the restoration. Nor was there a history of
socialist repression in the 19th century ... other than the bloody-
handed suppression *of* socialism. Remember, until 1917 no government 
anywhere had adopted a clear socialist platform; the nearest were probably
the revolutions of 1848 (bloodily put down by the monarchist absolutists
of the old regimes) and the Paris Commune of 1871 (bloodily put down
by the etcetera). The French Directorate wasn't really a socialist
regime: it was a prototype for the modern nationalist system, but that's
an entirely different kettle of fish.

I'm going to let this stand for itself because it's so wonderfully wrong-
headed it exemplifies everything I find funny and frightening about the
propaganda that passes for political enlightenment in the USA.

Luckily, it's an extreme instance.

You're asking for us to prove a negative. Basic logical fallacy, that. 
But I can point to some past existence proofs. The UK, 1945-50, springs
to mind; seen any mass graves there? Or Sweden, for most of the past
half century. Israel, 1947-1977. France during the 1980's. The list
of socialist regimes that didn't start filling mass graves with their
victims is actually much, much longer than the list of those that did, and
I submit that to explain the mass graves you need to look somewhere 
other than socialism.

Here's a hint: the ones that killed lots of people had big-time issues
with nationalism at the same time. Nationalism is an orthogonal issue to
socialism, and if you assert that it's an unqualified evil I'd be willing
to agree with you.

Well now, that's quite a ringing endorsement isn't it. How's this for a
catchy political slogan "Don't Worry Vote Socialist; We Probably Won't

gts, I think we're talking about survival of identity in the sense of a
living, growing person who carries our identity into the future, exactly as
we do now now while our identity is limited to a single body. As you've
said, this is more correct than saying our "self" carries into the future,
because the "self" is continuously changing.  So we understand that it's our
"self-identity", that set of thoughts, memories, and drives that we
*identify* as ourself, that we have such a strong desire to see carried
forward.

Lee has been saying that in the future we will contnue to have the same
attachment and concern for what we consider to be "our self", but that we
will apply the concept equally to more than one body that carries our basic
identity, even though they've branched.

I'm saying that in this hypothetical future we will fondly appreciate seeing
our "branches" set out on their own, but will think of them as a new kind of
twin sibling, rather than as "our self".

Hey gts, lest my post be too closely associated with your addendum, I would
like to add the following statements:

I certainly do not "object" to Lee's ideas.  On the contrary, I would
encourage them.  However I do disagree with at least one of his current
points, and that's what makes it interesting.  (I realize you probably
didn't mean "object" in quite that same sense, but I want to be clear about
that.)

One of the reasons I continue to subscribe to the Extropy list is that as I
sift through it I continue to find jewels of thought to add to my growing
collection.  Let's encourage differences of opinion, and encourage their
expression in as *rational* and *respectful* a forum as we can manage.

No Charlie,
       That is exactly the point you have been trying to wiggle away from all 
through this discussion and you have no answer for it.
       The whole point about socialists is that they cannot face up to their 
dark side or to their failures.  Instead you just love to discuss socialism 
as a very high abstraction that has lost all touch with the world of reality.
       Still all those countries you love to deny were socialist.  Hitler was 
out to show the other socialist how socialism should really work.  Mussolini 
was a communist that split with his party over a matter of political tactics 
not over theory.  As to the Beautiful Countries go ask a dissident that voted 
with their feet and left one of those countries.  Everyone of them is an 
exercise in human degradation.  Heck, England got so bad they had to go get 
Mrs. Thatcher to pull their parsnips out of the fire.
       Guys, if I have run some of your answers together and employed a you 
plural instead of a singular I apologise -- but as you know we are allowed 
only so much bandwidth per day.
       If you wish to be taken seriously as a respectable political system 
instead of an ancient variation of totalitarianism I suggest you do two 
things.  Embrace your errors, claim them, own up to your having committed 
them and tell us how you intend to guarantee they don't happen again.  I 
don't think you have a clue -- prove me wrong.

The important thing to realize is that you don't get expert advice.
Rather, you pay somebody to do a Google search for you.

>From the FAQ:

"Google Answers is a way to get that help from Researchers with
 expertise in online searching."

"Our Researchers are not necessarily experts in the field related
 to your question, but they are experts in locating hard to find
 information on the web.  If the answer to your question is online,
 chances are pretty good they'll find it."

Net-based technology enabling us to collect, update and share group
knowledge is now becoming much more practical, and I keep thinking that a
group like Extropians would be among the first to take advantage of it.
However, I've been also been thinking for a long time that this would become
indispensible to competitive business survival and have yet to see it
effectively applied.  I see myself consistently underestimating cultural
inertia.

Yes, and when you "widen back" and look at what is carrying out the process,
you see that many of the supposed paradoxes fit neatly in the wider view.

You're pointing to a "dark side" and "failures" that I don't believe 
have anything to do with socialism.

It's a bit like ... (hmm, hunts for a suitable metaphor) ... blaming 
the US government for the failure of economic reforms in Argentina.

I think you're being deliberately obtuse and/or mendacious here; neither
Hitler or Mussolini were remotely interested in socialism. (Industrial 
feudalism would be a closer hit.)

Yeah, right. That explains the way she was kicked out -- in the end --
after three quarters of a million people marched on parliament, and the
way she needs a police bodyguard to this day, and the massive electoral
popularity of the conservatives to this day.

(Or don't you hear about that side of things, in your country?)

"Embrace your errors" is libertarian code for "kindly fall on your sword 
and expire", isn't it?

Speaking as a liberal -- the old-fashioned liberal democrat kind -- I
don't feel any need to satisfy you. In fact, the onus is on libertarians
and objectivists to prove that they can do better. So far, the only
libertarian states I can think of didn't stay that way for long --
the electorate decided that regulated markets were better, and I'm
sure you'd agree that if a country is to be run for its citizens benefit,
then they are the people best suited to decide how it ought to be run,
aren't they? 

I'm fairly sure that doctrinaire enforcement of libertarian policies
would give rise to horrors at least as bad as anything to have come out
of the socialist sphere. *Any* ideology can only be an imperfect reflection
of the complexity of the human condition, and attempts to make human beings
conform to the behaviour required by doctrine are going to end in tears.

Repeat after me: "I must improve my reading comprehension". 

Here's a clue: genocide and war correlates well with nationalism. 
Genocide and war don't seem to correlate with socialism, but follow
those states which go socialist and *also* have a nationalism problem.

Dr. Serafino quoting Orianna Falacci:
<The Islamic world is engaged in a cultural war with the West and the worst
is still to come, Italian author Oriana Fallaci told a receptive Washington
audience last night.>

Yes, Professori Serafino,

That is the path America's enemies have indeed chosen, and the firebrand, O. 
Falacci has illucidated this. "War you wanted, war you want, war you"ll get 
until your last dying breath."  This is not the future I want, but it sure 
seems it is the future we are getting, through forces not influencible by 
American foreign policy. Or what has Bali got to do with anything material?

This war will not end with the Bush Administration. I could see this war 
evolving into something like this where the USA performs state terrorism in 
response to a WMD attack on NYC. The response might be the leveling on Riyahd 
or Mecca by "unclaimed attackers."  Similarly, the Russians could respond in 
kind to the Chechen terror fiasco of last weekend, with an unconventional 
attack on a Chechen city.

On the other hand, I see the impending Bush takeover of Iraq as a 
work-around, from depending on Saudi oil. Iraq  has almost as much oil and 
the world purchasing petroleum from Iraq rather then Saudi would  undercut 
the Wahabbis capacity to financially support Islamic Jihads. It would also 
have a net gain of intimidation of antagonistic Islamic states and the arab 
street, to pull in their horns, perhaps. 

As an American, I see the toppling of Saddam as a win for the USA's 
un-specified war against Islamic Jihadist culture, and the chance to 
distribute oil money to the Iraqi people, instead of "palaces" for Saddam's 
ego.  Now for the downside: there must be a death toll,  and the Iraqi people 
will suffer terribly, and there is nothing logical we can do about it, except 
behave passively. If we behave passively then we will let the Jihadist's 
decide when they will strike next. 

If I were a Jihadist planner I might attempt two large attacks, perhaps 
risking them simmultaneously. One would be a massive attack on electrical 
and/or data infrastructure; being energy and banking. The other attack would 
be on a vulnerable population center, with its concurrent psychological 
shock, and demoralization. The importance of attacking infrastructure was 
high-lighted by Professor Peters of the University of Pennnsylvania. Peters 
successfully predicted the WTC & DC attacks back in 1998 and attempted to 
alert the FAA, in the use of passenger aircraft as guided missles. The FAA 
dismissed Peter's warnings as impossible to predict as "meteorite strikes."

Alternatively, we might encounter a type of sporadic high-intensity warfare, 
is that such attacks would be separated my months or years, between 
successful tries. Consider this a "war of the cities" as happended in the 
Iran/Iraq war.  

Like I indicated, not the world I want, but the world that seems to be.

Hmm. By "object" I think I mean the same thing as you.
I "disagree with" the relevant idea. I find it
implausible and contrary to reason.
 
I'm also astounded that someone as eloquent and as
seemingly intelligent and sincere as Lee would advance
such a preposterous idea. I keep waiting for him to
show me something mind-blowing about the nature or
reality, or else to explain to me that he really meant
something else entirely. I think that is what keeps me
glued to these threads...

In the 20's Lenin forced people to abandon their private farms and go to
huge monumentally inefficient collective farms, the result was millions of
deaths by starvation. In the 30's Stalin tried the same thing again and even
more died. In the 50's Mao did the exact same stupid thing in China and at
least 30 million ended up dead, more than 4 times as many people as in the
Holocaust. This was not genocide although the people were just as dead, they
did not die in war and they did not die because of nationalism, they died
because they were forced to follow an economic system that did not work.

My latest Transitory Human column should interest the subscribers of this 
list. It's a rebuttal to the agenda of the World Congress of Bioethics that 
will be held in Brazil next week, and a subsequent call for the seemingly 
absent Transhumanist feminists:

http://www.betterhumans.com/Features/Columns/Transitory_Human/column.aspx?articleID=2002-10-28-1

Have Feminists Forsaken the Future?
New Conservative bioethicists are using women's rights as a facade for 
removing reproductive freedoms. Few women's advocates seem to notice.

Yes, that is exactly how I see it also, Jef.

However in your following passage to Lee, to which I
was responding, you seem to be giving validity to the
idea that "survival of identity" is something
important and distinct from "survival of self."

Those may be two of Lee's points, but do they really
make any sense upon careful analysis?
 
Because of divergence in experience and personality
after a bifurcation, other versions of what were once
"you" will be going about in life calling themselves
by your name. However they will each have slightly
different personalities, none of them exactly like
yours, and those personalities will continue to
diverge until they lose any resemblance to you. Thus
they will not in actuality be carrying your true
identity. Or to put it another way, they will be
carrying your identity *in name only*. 

If it is proposed by Lee that survival of our
identities "in name only" is something we should seek
and value more in the future, then my comment is that
this is something we already seek and value greatly.
In the simplest example, we ensure the survival of our
identities for posterity each time we contract with an
undertaker for a tombstone bearing our name and
epitaph. 

I for one at least find little satisfaction in knowing
that I might live on in name only, and I hardly need
to embrace extropianism as a means of finding ways to
do so. The desire for the survival of identity in that
sense is trivial and common already in the world
today, as in for example a father who wants sons so
that his surname might survive into future
generations.

The truth is that all we really want is survival of
our *sense of self*. We want to transport this sense
of self into other objects or persons. That is what
this thread is about, or so I thought.

(For Spike)


I hear the violoncello or man's heart's
     complaint,
I hear the keyed cornet, it glides
     quickly in through my ears, it
     shakes mad-sweet pangs through
     my belly and breast.
I hear the chorus....it is a grand-
     opera....this indeed is music!

A tenor large and fresh as the creation
     fills me,
The orbic flex of his mouth is pouring
     and filling me full.

I hear the trained soprano....she
     convulses me like the climax of my
     love-grip;
The orchestra, whirls me wider than
     Uranus flies,

It wrenches such ardors from me, I did
     not know I possessed them,
It throbs me to gulps of the farthest
     down horror,
It sails me....I dab with bare feet
     ....they are licked by the indolent
     waves,
I am exposed....cut by bitter and
     poisoned hail,
Steeped amid honeyed morphine
     ....my windpipe throttled in fakes
     of death,
At length let up again to feel the
     puzzle of puzzles,

And that we call Being.

[excerpt from Walt Whitman: _Song of Myself_, 1867]


Happy Birthday, my dear Evil Twin :-)

Grin noted: but as long as you keep using socialists as a whipping-boy
and synonym for all things evil, and using them as a convenient
target for demonization, I'll keep calling you on it. 

I'd do the same if you were using Moslems, Jews, feminists, conservatives,
or any other designated out-group for the same purpose. It's not your
beliefs that annoy me -- you're perfectly entitled to them --  but the way
you express them.  If you replaced the word "socialists" with "women" or
"blacks" in any one of your postings on the subject they'd be offensive;
I don't see why you should get off the hook just for picking on a group
that isn't flavour of the month among libertarian extropians.

Yes indeed they would be offensive, but "women" refers to half the human
race and "blacks" is an unimportant term about the amount of pigment in the
skin; "socialists" on the other hand is about the way a person acts and I
feel perfectly justified in condemning or praising a person because of that,
indeed I think that is the only criteria it is justified to do so.

From: Lee Corbin [mailto:lcorbin@tsoft.com]

First of all, I must disagree with your chosen title of this thread offshoot
'Does Our Identity depend on atoms' as this was not ever what I argued.
Instead, it should read 'Does the continuation of a particular perceived
consciousness depend upon a 'particular' group of atoms (and not just any
atoms)'  With that in mind, does your answer remain the same?  

Of course our identity does not 'depend on atoms' (by this, I assume you
mean some particular atoms, and not just any atoms) because we can copy our
pattern with any group of items and still have an entity whose identity is
for all intents and purposes identical to the reference group of atoms in
that particular pattern.  I do not dispute this, what I dispute is that the
pattern, which is identical to the reference pattern, and is imprinted upon
a new group of atoms, is not a subjective continuation of the reference
pattern.  That is, it is not you.  The evidence I have for the fact that the
same pattern in a different group of atoms is that if we were to copy the
pattern and imprint it into a new group of atoms the new group/pattern will
be identical to the reference, but would not experience the same subjective
events as the reference, and therefore *would not* be a continuation of the
subjective experiences of the reference (original)

I feel I have had difficult moving this discussion forward, swimming
upstream so to speak, primarily because of misconceptions of my arguments
such as that which made you title this thread as such.  In making a logical
argument it is key to define the terms we are using in discussion, this
argument in particular is based upon some pretty vague notions, so let me
attempt to define them.

identity (you, me, I)- 

definition 1 - a group of thoughts, emotions, experiences that make a person
a particular person.

definition 2 - a pattern which contains thoughts, emotions, and experiences
that experiences subjective continuity from one moment to the next

As you can see, these two definitions have quite different implications, I
think when you say 'identity' you mean something similar to the first, when
I say it, I mean something similar to the second.

To put it another way, when you say 'that copy is you' I translate that
roughly (as you say it) as all the thoughts, emotions, experiences etc. that
make you *you* are present in the copy as well.  If this is the definition
of *you* I do not dispute that 1) a copy is 'you' (for the instant after
copying) and that 2) semantically, there are two 'yous' 

However, when I say that 'copy is not you'  I mean that the copy may have
the same thoughts, memories, emotions that 'you' did, but it does not exist
as a continuation of subjective experience.  

This is proven by imprinting a reference pattern into a new group of atoms,
and retaining the reference pattern.  The new pattern does not experience
the same subjective experience that the reference pattern does, thus it is
not a continuation of the subjective experience of the reference pattern  (a
simple, easy, logical experiment)  This is the argument I have yet to see an
objection to.  Is a copy (the same pattern imprinted on new atoms identical
to a reference pattern) a continuation of the subjective experience of the
reference?  The answer, NO, it is not, because the new pattern and the
reference pattern do not share the same subjective experience.

It seems to me that one of these definitions (yours) can be thought of as
identity as change in time approaches zero, and mine (since it fundamentally
resides on the continuation of subjective experience) requires a time
component.  

These two definitions of identity seem to be intermingled in this
discussion, am I correct in interpreting your definition of 'identity' (I,
me, you)?

I think It is necessary to clarify this definition and probably some others,
to make this discussion more useful.

"That is what *we* are saying, yes."

"Yes."

I should have emphasized 'continuation' of subjective experience, which I
guess I skipped over in typing that particular message.  As I have
emphasized from the get go, a copy will not experience the same subjective
events that a reference or original does, thus it CAN NOT be a continuation
of the consciousness of the original.  

Consider, a reference may be copied *without his knowledge* if a copy was
truly a continuation of a particular identity (by my definition) then he
would experience what the copy does.  If he does not, then they are two,
distinct, separate, isolated entities.

"But it's like moving into another room, or having someone suddenly turn on
a light:  you suddenly do not have the same experience as before, yet your
identity is untouched."

Having 'different' experiences then the ones from the previous instant does
not preclude continuation of consciousness.  You seem to be arguing that an
identity (by your definition?) has a different experience in one moment from
the next and that is no different than a copy having a different experience
in a successive moment from the original before copying.  Moving into
another room is a far different scenario than having a pattern transferred
to another group of atoms while the original group remains intact.  When I
walk into a room, I may have new subjective experiences, by they are
experienced in an entity that experienced them the moment before, with the
same pattern, and the same group of atoms.  

If I were copied, and them my copied entered the room, he may be said to
feel the same, but since I can not sense what he senses, than he can not, by
definition, be a continuation of my consciousness.  Simply removing me (the
reference) from the equation does not change this fact.  A copy is not a
continuation of the subjective experiences of the original.

"And of course as I think John said, your result does not necessarily follow
from the claim and hypothesis."

Since the result says "copy and original, ...do not share same sensory
experience" And you say that does not follow, the converse would be that the
copy and original DO share the SAME sensory experience.  Would you assert
then that both the reference and the copy *share* subjective experiences?
THAT would indicate an immaterial soul that connected patterns.  If they do
not, then they must 1) be separate entities (and identities) and 2) the copy
must not be a continuation of the subjective experience of the reference
(else he would have the same subjective experiences!)

"You might be teleported to a different but identical hotel room and obtain
not the same yet an identical sensory experience."

If that were the case, then there is no way I could know that I was
destroyed and copied, and thus the original died.  But just because I am
ignorant of the occurrence, does not mean it did not occur.  The people who
manned the heisenberg compensators, pattern buffers and refinement beams
would very well know what they had done to me.

"This is where I don't follow, and I think that several other people don't
either."

I really do not know if I can explain it any clearer.  This is either
because I can not convey my ideas clearly enough, or there is a fundamental
misunderstanding of what I am saying.  If I walk into a scanner, and a copy
is made of me, and we both walk out, I can not see what he sees, and he can
not see what I see.  I do not share the same subjective experiences as he
does.  Therefore, he *can not* be a subjective continuation of me, because
he does not share the same subjective experiences.  To claim that he is
means he and I must share the same subjective experiences, ALWAYS, otherwise
we have to be different unique individuals (all beit who both think we are
the same person)  If we do not share the same subjective experiences, than
he can not be a continuation of my subjective consciousness.  Therefore a
copy is NOT me.

" Here you have company.  While as a realist I concede that if an apple is
copied, one is the original and one is only
a copy, they are identical for all practical purposes, and this includes
(for people) survival (and the "personal identity" which tracks survival)."

Good to hear, this clarification of definitions seems very important to
continuing a discussion.

"No, you wouldn't.  Suppose that you were forced (by the way, have you ever
read much SF?) to teleport the first few times---friends grab you and throw
you in to the teleporter terminal just as the Thought Police are about to
capture you all.  And then, to avoid an incredibly taxing mile-high climb
each morning, you just  eventually relent and agree to teleport.  The social
effect on you of seeing your friends and loved ones teleport over and over
again with no bad effects would get to you. "

This seems to be another significant misunderstanding in this discussion, or
rather two different ways of looking at things that are commonly thought of
as the same.  When you speak of my seeing my friends and loved ones
teleported with no ill effects is really a red herring.  I know that when
they are teleported a virtually exact copy of them was made, a copy which
from every external measurement is identical to the original.  It will have
the same thoughts, emotions, and experiences (your definition of identity)
but because it would not experience the same subjective events of the
original if the original had not been destroyed, it does not abide by my
definition of 'identity' in which case I would mourn the death of that loved
one.  Though I am sure it would be easier to get over, I would never lose
the nagging feeling that somewhere, someone with the same hopes, dreams,
fears, loves et all as my copied loved on in front of me now ceases to
exist.  But I digress, where the misunderstanding is, I believe, is that you
perceive 'you' as what people external to you define you as.  If your
contribution to the universe were what made you  valuable, then a copy of
you would perform just as well, sans the original, with no net loss on the
universe.  For everybody other than you, that would be you.  I would be less
upset if someone were to tell me I was to be destroyed and copied, and that
copy allowed to live my life with my loved ones because I know that the joy
I would bring to the world would likely remain, than I would be to simply be
destroyed.  But that is not me, and I would still fear death, that is, the
cessation of my subjective experiences, in such an instance.  

Humans self aware beings are unique in the universe in that they are aware
of their own existence.  In your case of observing no ill effects on ones
friends, this would be fine if my friends were the only ones aware of my
existence.  Unfortunately I am as well, and thus destroying me ends my
existence, while my friends may be fine with the copy, I will not be,
because I am dead.

This is the difference between external and internal existence I suppose.  I
believe it a classic case of scientism to presume that our only existence of
any value is value placed on our external existence.  Do you not have
thoughts that others, externally, are unaware of?  If you do, then you must
have an internal existence, separate from the existence of your friends
perception of you.  This is what would die.

Incidentally, I have not read a lot of sci fi really, I stick mostly to
non-fiction, but if you can suggest a book that will help to clarify the
logical implications of copying / teleporting I would check it out.

Now I agree that this latter argument is not air-tight; sometimes
logic for the sake of consistency must override such social and
psychological inducements.

Michael

The flaw in this argument should be pretty obvious: one does not
/choose/ to be black or female.  One /does/ choose to support
socialism, and to a lesser extent, one's religion (though there's
a lot of parental/cultural influence there).  It is just and right
to hold people accountable for their freely-made choices.  They are,
in fact, the only thing you /can/ rightly judge someone's
character by.

### Just this week probabilistic quantum cloning was demonstrated: Nature
419, 797 - 798 (2002)(news and views), and De Martini, F., Buzek, V.,
Sciarrino, F. & Sias, C. Nature 419, 815-818 (2002) (article).

Isn't this an amazing coincidence?

_________________

Thank you for sending this message and article.  

Considering what a feminist represents, are transhumanists really
feminists? Just as we have outgrown many discriminatory views, have we
outgrown the need to separate the genders? It seems to me that part and
parcel to being transhumanist is being a human and transhumanist rights
advocate, not any one gender. Just as we want to instill a sense of
compassion and opportunity to all who work toward achieving equality by
encouraging merit.

Perhaps we are beyond feminism.  I may still have the temperament of a
feminist, but I don't affiliate with feminists because, like so many
subcultures, the cause served a different time and a different set of
problems. Over the years, our needs have changed. Our problems become
challenges.  The very profile of a feminist has changed.  Instead of using
the word "feminist," I simply use transhumanist.

Many feminist organizations do not support transhumanist science and
technology, culture or socialization.  Camilla Paglia is espouses views on
this quite fluently.  

However, Wendy McElroy is a well-known female and transhumanist.  Her
organization is "ifeminists."  You can find a number of female
transhumanists there.  I'm so sorry that you did not meet with her because
she has a broad perspective on many issues related to technology and
values. http://www.independent.org/tii/news/020924McElroy.html

Further, some questions came to mind after thinking about your concerns:

How many links do you have to female transhumanists that advocate
transhumanist ideas to the public? 

Does TTA have any links, or quotes from transhumanist females in direct
relation to bioethics? 

Have you spoken to any female transhumanists who have been working in the
area of public interests and bioethics?  

Did you see the film "Precipice" directed and produced by two women in
Stanford University's film department?

In order for us to get more women, that is women who work directly in the
field of bioethics, or in related fields such as new technologies, culture,
economics, science, psychology, etc., - we must first recognize them in our
own environment.  While we all want more women involved in all areas of
transhumanity, not just the ones that seemingly affect women.

BTY, I am speaking on bioethics in a panel featuring female transhumanists
at the Alcor Technology Conference in November.  You might enjoy attending.

Well, I say that the USSR was not socialistic, or the PRC, or Cuba, or North 
Korea, or North Vietnam, or any of these places. Why? You say I am trying to 
define away the evils of socialism. But are these countries socialistic? 
What does socialistic mean? Well, I think there is good evidence, a long 
tradition of ideas, that stretch back hundreds of years which will support 
the idea that socialism was, apart from some fringe elements, always about 
workers control. The state entered in, true, in some ideas of socialism, but 
in this case the state was only to be a vessel for workers control. It was, 
supposedly, to have no power for itself. Now, I think that is ridiculous and 
unrealistic to expect-- if you give the state a lot of power, you're going 
to get tyranny. But the state was never fundamental to socialism, as far as 
I can tell--workers control was much more central.

Did the workers control the factories in the USSR? Did workers get to 
formulate uncoerced, democratic-type methods for organizing factories, 
schools, and other organizations? Well, the answer is a total and utter no. 
It was all controlled from above, a complete tyranny. This is why I say that 
socialism and the state are incompatible.

But look at the United States. We are not so much better, in fact. True, we 
have basic rights which prevent massacre by the gun, and, thanks to the 
welfare state, also rights which prevent death by forced starvation, but 
essentially industry remains in the hands of private tyrannies. There is no 
democratic structure to be had in industry. By democratic, by the way, I do 
not mean the tyranny of democracy idea, I mean a loose sort of framework 
which respects individual rights and lends power where it is justifiable, 
not arbitrarily. Even the unions, supposedly the representatives of the 
common worker, have grown bureaucratic and corrupt in many ways, largely 
because people have not fought to keep them focused. The electoral system is 
to a large degree a sham, a mockery of democracy constructed by a system 
which has its roots in the private tyrannies I mentioned earlier. It's a sad 
state of affairs, and the only way it is going to get better is for the 
population to end its passivity and strike back.

SPike,                                                                        
I suggest you contact the risk management office at Suzuki, sending them your 
findings along with suggestions for possible recall repairs.                  

Since there were only 9000 vehicles made, it would be relatively cheap for
Suzuki to announce a repair recall, far less costly than even the legal fees
of a liability lawsuit involving deaths. Furthermore, by notifying them of
this, they would be legally compelled to do something, since they could not
deny that they knew anything was wrong with the design after you sent them
your findings.

I'd cc your communications with them to the NTSB if I were you. It doesn't
sound to me like there is a major problem here, just a small problem with
major possible consequences.

Suppose that we flip a fair coin 20 times, and that a biased sampling 
procedure then randomly selects 5 coinflips from the set of coinflips that 
came up heads and reports on those coinflips; if there aren't 5 coinflips 
that came up heads, the biased sampling procedure reports all available 
heads and enough randomly selected tails to make up the gap.

Suppose the biased sampling procedure reports that the first, sixth, 
eleventh, fifteenth, and eighteenth flips came up heads.  Is there a 
simple general formula for calculating the probability that any given 
other coinflip came up tails?  Clearly the probability is greater than 
50%, but by how much?

(I don't know the answer to this one; it's posed as a genuine math 
question, not a math problem.)

The article Robert quoted is one of the coolest things I have seen in a

       Yes, you are doing exactly that.  Not only does socialism have a long 
tradition of allowing brutal thugs to get in charge but they also have a long 
tradition of initially having a large group "useful fools" (Lenin's phrase) 
providing the theoretical basis to form a state that is easy for a thug to 
take over.  According to von Hayek in the case of Germany there was great 
pressure to find a person like Hitler to become the dictator and make things 
work.
       I have read in Hayek that most of the terms you use are nonsensical 
and incapable of accurate definition -- that is why I refuse to try to define 
socialism.  If you cannot define it after 200 years, and this exchange of 
email, and still are incapable of defining your own system then why expect an 
outsider like me to do so?
       Alexander, you can't even bring your system down to Earth enough to 
accept your past mistakes, which we have enumerated, or to tell us how you 
intend to avoid those same mistakes in the future.
       Friend, IMHO, it is time to put not only this thread to rest but also 
the entire subject of socialism both online and in the real world.  Give it 
up, it is a bad job.  You are wasting the time you spend on socialism just as 
the workers under socialism and those poor souls in the concentration camps 
or the gulags are having their lives wasted.
       Carlyle (spelling?) was reputed to have been asked by a young man how 
he could improve the world.  Carslyle is supposed to have answered, "Become 
an honest man, then there will be one less crook in the world."  Alexander, 
become an honest man, join to a good woman to have a better life, raise some 
decent kids and stay off relief that is as much as any of us can get done.

The probability of what you ask is 50%. The prob that any given flip is one or
the other is 50% in any situation. The odds that every other flip IN SEQUENCE
is tails is dependent upon how long your sequence is. In the case of getting
five tails, the odds are 3.125%.

This is done by the fact that for each additional instance of getting tails,
your odds halve. i.e.

1 flip: h=50% t=50% (cumulative odds given in parentheses below)
2nd flip: h=50% t=50% (2 heads = 25%, two tails = 25%, 1 head & 1 tail = 50%)
3rd flip: h=50% t=50% (3 heads = 12.5%, two tails = 12.5%, 1 head & 2 tails =
37.5%, 2 heads & 1 tail = 37.5%)
etc...

Thanks, Mike, but this answer is incorrect.  See the description of the 
problem.  If a *random* sampler reports five heads, the other coinflips 
have a 50% chance of being heads.  If a *biased* sampler reports five 
heads, that's an entirely different issue.

You don't say how it picks which heads to report.  Randomly?  Does it pick
the first 5 heads?

If it picks the *first* 5 heads, then you can be certain that all of the
un-reported flips below 18 must be tails.  Is that what you want?  (I
presume not, but it's worth clarifying.)

I don't know if this qualifies as an "easy way" to figure it out,
but here's the answer:

Probability 1/2 makes the calculating the binomial distribution a
little simpler, so the number of ways the 20 flips can result in
exactly N heads is 20! / (N! * (20 - N!), so that's 1 way to get
no heads, 20 ways to get 1, 190 ways to get 2, 1140 ways to get 3,
4845 ways to get 4, etc.  Adding those 5 outcomes, which are the
ones where your sample produces at least one tail and the probability
of a remaining coing being a tail is therefore certainty, you get
6196/1048576 (the denominator here is 2^20), or a little less than
0.6 % as the cases that aren't interesting.  That leaves 99.4% of
the cases where your biased selector has chosen 5 heads.

So, for each of these cases (N=5...N=20), calculate the probability
that a single chosen remaining coin is a tail; this will be just
(20 - N) / 15.  For N=5, P=1 (because there were exactly five heads,
so the probability of a reminaining coing being a tail is 1), for
N=6, it's 14/15, etc., to N=20, where P=0 (all heads).

Now write that probability (1, 14/15, 13/15....) next to the previous
numbers you calculated in step 1 (15504, 38760, ...)  Multiply them
across, and divide by (1048576-6196).  Then add the whole column.
The number I get get is 0.66407..., so you should take the "head"
bet if you're offered 2-to-1.

Note: the hardest part of this for me wasn't figuring out how to do
it or calculating the binomials, but having to keep scratching out
"52" all the time...

I just ran a simulation of this; the frequency of tails in the remaining 15
coins over 10,000,000 runs was 66.62 using the biased sampling (50.00 using
unbiased, of course :-) ).

As to the explanation in terms of probabilities, I'm sure there are lots of
factorials and "n choose m" type things and other goodies that my rusty
probability coursework is no longer competent to tackle. :-(

A question for LDC, a probability-competent individual, out of curiosity;

It took me about 20 minutes to code up and trivially test my brute-force
solution, and 40 seconds to do the run which got the final answer. How long
did the calculations below take you to do? I am guessing that this is
everyday stuff for you (remind me never to play cards for money with you),
so I figure it didn't take too long. Our answers came out close enough that
I'd call the two solutions equivalent (although I'd say 2-1 odds on a head
is a little more marginal).

Some thoughts on personal identity

Our identity is not some abstract collage of data and
programs.  It is closely bound up with the notion of
purpose.  What is our purpose?

This discussion has occurred here before, as in the
long discussions over the pseudo-question, "what is
the purpose of life?"  Or worse, "what is the purpose
of the universe."

Consciousness is formed by and consists of feedback
loops.  Those attempted loops that cannot complete
themselves tend to die out due to lack of
reinforcement.  Those loops that contain internal
contradictions disapate energy uselessly, and
identifying them and resolving the contradictions is
an important maintenance task at minimum - independent
of the consequences in terms of useless or
self-destructive actions that may result.  Those
mental processes that divorce themselves from any
possible reaffirmation via some kind of feedback
grounded in the real world eventually get forgotten.

The loops that survive, prosper and come to dominate
the process of consciousness, from the sensory/motor
of touching finger to thumb in the womb, to the
highest level concepts of mathematics, are the ones
that participate in and engender an integrated set of
loop processes, self-sustaining, self-correcting, and
capable of grounding in clear, complex,
life-supporting results in the real world.

Examples of such complex loops: romantic love
entanglements, creative work,
political/religious/philosophical causes.

We do not merely cling to our identities out of habit
or because our consciousness evolved out of combative
selection processes in a battle for the resources of
the mind and body.  There is also an underlying thirst
to see that next phase of uniquely, individually
filtered, styled and integrated of data.  I.e., the
continuation and fulfillment of the loop.  

While there are peak moments in life when some major
underlying loop is reaffirmed, as in the fulfillment
of some great quest or love, there is always the
expectation and feeling that more is coming.  And
those particular events that one has had a determining
or contributing part of are far more fulfilling than
those which are merely pleasing in the abstract,
although our identification with other people -
especially those "close" to us, intelligence in
general, life in general, order, structure, or the
endless possibilities of the universe at large, often
yields far more feedback than our own efforts.

That may be a weakness in the analogy, but I don't see it as a flaw in an 
argument.  No argument was being made.  What was being made was a statement 
of intent.

    This is the 70'th update of my fly longevity experiments. Average
temperature was 24.4 C during this run. Here I test various mineral
supplements at a dosage I had previously found to be relatively nontoxic
for class of supplement.
    Only sodium chloride offered an advantage, and then only late in life.
Possibly aged flies have impaired immunity, and sodium chloride may have
helped to suppress the growth of any microorganisms that could survive the
mold inhibitor & citric acid combination already incorporated into the fly
food.

THE SPACE SHOW

The October 30, 2002 Space Show program will feature Rick Tumlinson, a
leading advocate, champion, and authority for commercial space
development. The Space Show, hosted by Dr. David Livingston, focuses on
timely and important issues influencing the development of outer-space
commerce and space tourism, as well as other issues that are of interest
to us all.The Space Show will air live 8-9 PM Pacific Standard Time,
Wednesday evening Oct. 30, 2002 on KKNW 1150 AM in Seattle and on the
internet per the listening instructions provided below.

Rick Tumlinson, besides being a well-known evangelist for the space
frontier, has had his writings, quotes, and opinions appear in the NY
Times, Wall Street Journal, LA Times, Miami Herald Readers Digest, Space
News and dozens of other publications. He has also appeared on numerous
national TV programs, including ABCs World News Tonight, the CBS Morning
Show, and Politically Incorrect. At one time, Mr. Tumlinson worked for
noted scientist Gerard K. O'Neill at the Space Studies Institute at
Princeton, and he helped pass the Space Settlement Act of 1988. In
addition, he has testified before the National Commission on Space, and
was a lead witness in congressional hearings on NASA in 1996 and 1997.
He is one of the three founders of the Space Frontier Foundation and a
founder of the Foundation for the International Non-Government
Development of Space (FINDS), a multi-million dollar foundation which
funds breakthrough projects and activities. He is also a founder of
LunaCorp, a firm planning commercial missions to the Moon. Mr. Tumlinson
led the effort to save the Mir Space Station and he was instrumental in
making space tourism possible for Dennis Tito and those that follow him.
Mr. Tumlinson will be discussing many of these projects, the barriers he
encountered, and how he worked through the barriers to successful
resolutions. We will also explore in depth with him the need and urgency
to develop a human presence in space. Listeners are encouraged to call
or e-mailquestions or comments to the guest or the host either before or

I agree with the thrust of this.

But I think you were also concerned about "Nader"izing (good word) the bike,
making it uninsurable at any speed. I think you saw that as a secondary but
still valid "good". So do I.

It may not be possible to avoid this now that the investigator (insurance
investigator not civil liabilities law firm employee I presume) knows of you
and your database.

I don't know how quickly insurance company's spread the word amongst
themselves about something like this, but I'd imagine that if only 9000
policies, and only 7000 in the US are being spread amongst multiple insurers
it may be better business for them to simply make the bikes uninsurable
(just refuse to insure them or jack up the price enough to achieve the same
effect) rather than set up a separate actuarial and business process whereby
they take account of whether repairs to the know fault have been effected.

Perhaps, you might get a better chance of getting insurance if one insurance
company thought they could corner a niche market. Known problem, available
solution, 9000 policies or so worldwide, 7000 in the States. That one
company might see it as worth its while if the fix was solid AND they
thought they could get nearly all the policies. I wonder if you could get
you bike buddies to consolidate their buying power and agree to go to one
company. Know any actuaries that work for an insurance company?

Also, I'm not a lawyer nor based in the US so I don't have expertise here,
but I would definitely be inclined to do something, inform someone, (which
you are clearly doing) because it may be that your special knowledge of a
life threatening situation may create a legal duty on you to take
"reasonable" action. In your shoes I'd brief a lawyer at least as well as
you briefed this list as a precaution.

I don't have a spreadsheet on my computer at work, so I had to resort
to the paper-and-calculator method.  Took about 15-20 minutes (it was
a slow day at work :-).  As it turns out, I did make a small mistake--
the subtraction for the final numerator.  Redoing on Gnumeric at home,
I get an exact final answer of 692336/1042380, or 0.66418.  I was a bit
low, but 2-to-1 is still a good bet.

Charlie Stross wrote that cells are replaced and refurbished atomically, and 
therefore bits are the focus of identity. He also noted neurons are replaced 
fully less frequently.

The continuity/section-by-section replacement argument takes this into 
account. Continuity does not imply stasis, it only points out that 
continuity is an essential figure of life, whether in sperm or egg cells or 
neural systems. I guess mutation is also done in small stages.

Personally I am going to adhere to these principles in my augmentation and 
avoid getting into the notion that anything other than a quantum duplicate 
of me could be "me" - it's just a crude (atomic level) copy with my apparent 
memory. It doesn't mean that I can't split my brain (whatever mix of 
nanotech, computronium and organic core that ends up as) but I will be 
keeping continuity of my neural patternings and changing these maps only 
slowly and carefully and in little sections at a time. If I split my network 
I will physically grow extensions and/or split my brain physically and be 
very careful with how I integrate broadcast linkage between my neural 
network and those of others to avoid moral problems and suicide.

Cooooool!  Cool question John!  I get 4*pi cubic

Hmm... how could they have the same sound? Surely the one with a hollow
center would vibrate slightly differently. I reckon if you could suspend
both spheres from wires and dong them with something, and record the sound,
you'd get a significant difference. I don't know how to tell which is which
from that, but I'll bet that someone with good enough knowledge of the
physics of sound could.

To have identical dimensions *and* mass *and* only one with a hollow center,
they must have different densities. Can we assume that they must then be
made of different materials? Surely this is detectable using some kind of
scanning technology?

Actually, scanning might be your best bet in general. Nothing in the
original problem said that the spheres were hard enough to roll - maybe they
are made of wet sponge? Or maybe they are extremely sticky? If so, you could
stick each one to another heavy ball and spin the combination in air; they
should spin differently if the attached balls are identical to each other.

I'm still getting 0.6662, after inverting the random number generation to
make sure that it wasn't affecting the result, after checking the program to
see if it has any obvious faults; nada. Maybe I should post the source, so
someone can figure out why Lee's result differs from mine?

That's what my title meant, and I don't think that you need
worry about people misinterpreting it.  I understand completely
that at the present moment in history, one's identity indeed
*does* depend on atoms;  what was meant, of course, as you
say, is "does it depend on particular atoms".  If I have
understood you correctly, then yes, my answer remains the
same.  Namely:  in no way does one's identity depend on
particular atoms.  (As hinted here, atoms in the long run
may have *nothing* to do with our identities---we might
eventually become plasma entities or patterns of photons.
All that is important is the pattern, and, as Frank points
out the *process*.)

You don't really know this!  How can you be so *sure* that
teleporters really do anything to someone besides change
their location?  Why, atoms were unknown to vastly better
philosophers than you or I for millenia, and you must read
at least enough SF to understand that duplicates would be
accepted as the original people *regardless* of what the
underlying theories are, so long as the theories do not
contain the equivalent of souls.

Have you considered the case that the replacement is
done without altering the location?  In that case, the
experience would be the same.

Most importantly, however, if your location suddenly
changes and so you start having "different experiences"
it does *not* alter your identity.  The key word in
your paragraph is "continuity".  You intuit that 
continuity of experience is lost, while everyone who
argues with you about atoms does not see it that way.

Your posts are very long, and I'm sorry that I don't have
time at present to respond to them in detail.

Yes, right.

No, of course not.  I would simply say that choosing which one
is the *reference* version is an arbitrary choice.

An axiom of your thought---which you seem unable to challenge
---is that you *would* be the original and *would not* be
the duplicate.  Here you should say "neither can see what
the other sees" without presuming to know which is the
*real* you.  

Please remember that if *physics* is all that is really true,
and, as Jef agree with me, it's only our evolutionarily
derived identification with one set of bones that causes
us to think the "other" as *alien*, then there is 
NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM.

Again: suppose that indeed *physics* is all there is,
and that an almost infinitely long description using
only physical terms of one of them is therefore
extremely similar to an analogous description of the other.

Then in this case, we have *no* reason to suppose that
the one who happened physically to be the original 
differs in any important way from the other.  The
key point again (sorry to be repetitive):  the
description from the point of view of physics
may be complete!

I predict that you would quickly get used to it.
We relate to others overwhelmingly powerfully
on non-intellectual levels, and when the same
old foibles, the same old expressions, the same
old everything continued as before, your certainty
that that person was really gone would evaporate.

There have been treatments of this all the way back to
"Rogue Moon", a 1947 book, if I recall correctly.  But
Greg Egan's AXIOMATIC is *the* book with which to jolt
your unconscious assumptions and gain a different and
puzzling (for me too!) take on all this.

Precisely.  Actually, I recommend that we use our newer "human"
nature to analyze the problem, and that a somewhat more
appropriate solution is to accept duplicates as selves.

In some ways, it is not only more *useful* but actually
necessary to continue to adopt the present view.  Suppose
that I and my duplicate are strapped down, and you begin
to torture one of us.  Then soon, just as Julia and Winston
in 1984, each of us says, "Stop! *Please* to it to him!".
In this case the way that we are wired (and we can never
forget that all we are is wiring) dictates that we regard
a duplicate as *other*.  But, Jef, you already appear to
understand this, as you have referred already to our 
primitive, early-evolved instincts or whatever.

But in *other* ways, e.g. the thought experiment where
according to physics a version of Lee Corbin *will*
wake up tomorrow and *will* go to the bank and deposit
ten million dollars---it is better that causally that
version of me descend from my frozen duplicate, and
*this*, over here, commit suicide.  It's better for
*me* this way.

It must help those who aren't following us here to
focus on the *physics* of the situation in my bedroom
tomorrow morning.  A version of me wakes up.  Who is
to say that it's not me?  *Every* morning in my
bedroom a slightly different version of me wakes up.
If souls don't exist, why aren't they all me?

To elaborate, if we have a metric among objects that
yields the "distance" between them and me in terms
of similarity, then objects such as I was, oh, say
about 50 years ago would *not* be me, because I
was a very small child then.  But if tomorrow any
more recent version of me wakes up---say the version
that was writing to this list last year---well, hell,
that's me and I survived *that* replacement.

Yes---it is non-intuitive for many to take this
view from physics seriously, and to realize that
we *only* are patterns, and that we *aren't* 
atoms and aren't locations, and don't have anything
at all like a soul.

It is also scary and paradoxical to realize that
the duplicate sitting across the table from you
is---according again to physics and that similarity
metric---really you too!  And because it is confounded
by *immediate* experience---pinch him and you won't
yell---it's indeed worthy to be called what I have
always called it:  the Identity Paradox.

But, as you have said in so many words, if we can
rise above our animal programming and comprehend
our own advanced nature as *patterns*, then we have
a prescription for action in every situation,
difficult and impossible (in some scenarios) to 
follow as it may be.

I understand that you and I still disagree about
some things, but the above I clearly agree with.

Actually the answer is that the remaining material is always equal to the
volume of a 6 inch sphere [ (4/3)*pi*r^3  where r =3]. You can find the
derivation from first principles at
http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/55631.html but you can also get the
answer easier if you're willing to cheat a little. If you assume the
question has a answer then it must be true regardless of the diameter of the
hole drilled, even if the diameter is zero, hence the remaining volume must
simply be that of a 6 inch sphere.

I also found that some unknown great man has asked the question more
poetically.

Old Boniface he took his cheer,
Then he bored a hole through a solid sphere,
Clear through the center, straight and strong,
And the hole was just six inches long.

Now tell me, when the end was gained,
What volume in the sphere remained?
Sounds like I haven't told enough,
But I have, and the answer isn't tough!

No problem.  Again we take advantage of the hollow
sphere having a larger moment of inertia: suspend
the sticky non-rollable balls with a piece of wire.
Twist the wire some arbitrary angle and release.
The actual angle doesn't matter, so long as it
isnt excessive: the oscillation frequency is not
effected.  The oscillation frequency of the hollow
sphere is lower than that of the solid sphere.  spike

That's right.  The key thing to discuss, in my opinion,
is the kind of personal identity that actually causes
one's own experiences to continue.  Needless to say,
just what that is is very problematical!

You also wrote (earlier, I think---sorry I've lost track)

I see my duplicate as my true self for most purposes
of anticipation and all purposes of survival.

For example, pinch me but not my duplicate, and he
does not cry out.  Yet I believe that just because
I'm not forming memories of something at one location
doesn't mean that it isn't happening to me at another.

Suppose (as is often the case, it seems) both my
duplicate and I are tied down, and the Nazi officer
says, "Okay, ve have decided to kill one of you
[he gestures to me] and zen torture ze other [he
gestures to my duplicate] to death."  

A certain animal part of me says "Do it to him,
please just kill me!", but I firmly believe that
it is only an illusion that this is an escape.
The torture WILL STILL HAPPEN TO ME.  From the
objective, physics oriented account of what
transpires in that room, Lee Corbin gets tortured
to death.

Moreover, I *must* identify with the entity that
gets tortured because we are so alike physically.
In fact, I *will* be him if the three operations

  (a) erase five minutes of my memories
  (b) teleport me to where my poor duplicate
      is tied down
  (c) add five minutes' memories of the 
      appropriate experiences

are carried out.  Note that (a), (b), and (c) do
not affect identity by our normal intuitions.
(Assuming that one is "past", so to speak, the
first few of my "Seven Levels of Identity".)

Yes, but Gordon, the "you" of tomorrow will have
diverged from the you of today, as you know.  And
so this is why you claim not to be the same person
tomorrow that you are today.  Most people here,
including, me simply cannot accept that each micro-
second we become someone else.

"Other version of what were once "you" will be
going about in life calling themselves by your
name"?  Well, according to you, *your* self will
also be going around calling itself by your name
too.  All the duplicates have an equal claim on
"being you", of course.

Well, according to you---unless you've come around
to agreeing that you will be alive tomorrow---
*nobody* will be "carrying your true identity".
That's where I find a flaw in your thinking.

oh, no, absolutely not.

Exactly right.  Non-cryonicists who imagine that they'll
live on because someone will read their books (e.g.,
Heinlein), or because they've had children, are cruelly
mistaken.  Do any of your ancestors live on because you
do?  If the Nazi officer lined up five of your ancestors
and you, and threatened to shoot someone, you would live
only if he happened to shoot your ancestors and not you.

I say that this "sense of self" is completely inadequate.
Many insane people have the sense of being Napoleon, but
in fact they are not Napoleon, and poor Napoleon is as
dead as he can be (no cryonic chance for him to ever 
live again!).

I have little interest in someone of the future becoming
so familiar with my posts, recorded conversations, taped
episodes on TV (if there ever are any), that they can
claim to be me.  Unless they've got my MEMORIES and my
DISPOSITIONS, they're out of luck.  Or rather, of course,
*I'm* out of luck!

Let:

H = event that a coin is heads
S = event that a coin is selected

We have immediately:

p(H) = p(~H) = 1/2
p(S) = 1/4
p(~S) = 3/4

Now what we want is p(~H | ~S), the probability that a coin is not heads
given that it is not selected.  I am going to instead calculate
P(H | ~S), the probability of an unselected coin being heads, and we can
then subtract from 1 to get the desired probability.

Bayes theorem tells us:

p(H & ~S) = p(H | ~S) * p(~S)
          = p(~S | H) * p(H)

I will argue that p(S | H), the problem that a coin is selected given
that it is heads, is very close to 1/2.  That is the main step.  From this
it follows that p(~S | H), the probability that a coin is not selected
given that it is heads is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.  And this will immediately lead
to the desired result using the two Bayes theorem equations.

We know that the most probable outcome is that there will be exactly
10 coins as heads.  When we select 5 of them, the chance that a given
head-side-up coin is selected is 1/2.

With slightly less probability, we might have 9 or 11 coins be heads.
The chances of these two outcomes are equal.  In the 9 coin case, the
chance off a coin being selected is slightly more than 1/2 (specifically
5/9), and in the 11 coin case, it is slightly less than 1/2 (specifically
5/11).  These two cases average to very close to a 1/2 probability.

Likewise we can pair up the case of 8 and 12 coins falling heads.
These too will average out to about a 1/2 probability.  And in this
way we can consider all of the possible cases and average them out
to the same 1/2 probability.  Now, the approximation becomes worse in
the more extreme cases, but these cases are less common and so the bad
approximation won't matter that much.

For more accuracy you can do as Lee did and count each case explicitly.
But it is clear that 1/2 is a good probability for the chance that a
coin that fell heads will be selected.

Therefore we can substitute in the last equation above:

p(H & ~S) = p(~S | H) * p(H) = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4

And then we have, rearranging one of the equations above:

p(H | ~S) = p(H & ~S) / p(~S) = 1/4  /  3/4   = 1/3

And therefore the desired quantity, p(~H | ~S) is one minus this, or
2/3.

This is close to Emlyn's simulations, within about a percent.
The discrepancy is no doubt due to the approximation above that the
chance of a head being selected is 1/2.  Substituting the actual figure
by looking at the 21 possible numbers of heads that could fall (0-20
possible heads) would give a more accurate figure.

You are playing fast and loose with the word "identity," in this thread and
others. You treat the concept of identity superficially, as if one's
identity were little more than a name and social security number.

But your identity extends far beyond your basic stats, Lee. It is far more
than the name on your driver's license.

Your identity is the answer to the question "Who are you?" As I wrote
elsewhere (to Dan F), if pressed to answer this question in detail, people
will respond with much more than name, rank and serial number. They will
give an account of their entire selves. Included in that description will be
a current account of their ever-changing personalities, personalities which
do in fact change with experience.

It appears you have concocted an entire system of thought based on a false
distinction between identity and self, not realizing or not acknowledging
that these two terms do not exist independently.

IDENTITY is a pointer to SELF, as in SELF-IDENTITY.

Your false reasoning has lead you to promulgate the ridiculous conclusion
that in the scenarios you describe, SELF = OTHER. That conclusion is clearly
false by any sane and workable definitions of the words "self" and "other."

As I've stated, your argument fails because the conclusion invalidates the
premise, i.e., reductio ad absurdum.

We're probably just making some different assumption about the question;

You must get paid by the word, I will say the same thing more concisely:
"The evidence the subjective experience is not the same is that the
subjective experience is not the same."
I must say I'm not entirely convinced.

I also think trying to find an exact definition of survival and death is
pointless, like most things we learn the meaning of those words from
example not definition. Whatever I mean when I say "John Clark did 
not die yesterday" I will mean the same thing tomorrow if I'm lucky 
enough to be able to say it tomorrow. If your criteria for survival is so
onerous that you can't even be sure you've survived right now then 
what's the point? As for me, I think I've survived so I have and if my
"copy" thinks I've survived then I have.

No I suppose not, but I haven't assumed the government

Gene I see the direction of your argument and
partially agree, regarding the notion that
power corrupts.  My thought is that the awareness
of the existence of such power would shift the
equilibrium of power out of government.  People
would vote for fewer laws to compensate for
greater government ability to detect infractions.

I grant that there are unintended consequences,
such as a territorial spouse being able to track
his wandering mate.  I've no answer to that one.
Dont get married?  {8^D  Perhaps the human
population would collapse.

I have a vision of a society where everyone
is accountable for everything they do in
public.  I want the home number of every
wretched phone spammer, so that right before
I go to bed at about 2300 Pacific Standard
Time, I can call them (since it is 0200 where
they live) and tell them I have decided
not to buy their product.  I want to see
a society free of the kinds of problems
caused by the anonymity available to the
big city dweller.

With full personal accountability and
accountability by all government officials,
we would be more careful about electing
or allowing the appointment of puritanical
yahoos, such as the US attorney general
Ashcroft.

Libertarians would actually win an occasional
election for a change.  The proletariat would
be alerted to the rise of a dictator, and would
vote to oppose.

Gene, demand freedom, not anonymity.  spike

Hi Doug,

Both on the cryo list and more recently on the extro list I've noticed your
reports for a while now. Whilst its good to know that the spirit of do it
yourself science is alive and well (at least I imagine you doing this stuff
at home in the garage) I wonder if you could either recap or point at an old
post that outlines your experimental rationale.

Are you selecting generations for each test from offspring from previous
runs (sort of classical mendelian selection)? Your currently at run #70.
Have you tested nutrients, temperature, starvation-diet etc on  longevity in
previous iterations? Are you aiming at identifying a hit list of factors
that in combination maximise lifespan (then perhaps gene assaying (at some
time in the future) the best group against the control group)?. Are you
using Drosophila Melanogaster?

Regards,
Brett

IN the context of the discussion, it should have been
apparent to you that I was discussing the notion well-
known to moral philosophers, (e.g. Derek Parfit, "Reasons
and Persons") of *personal identity*.  I could name two
other books that also refer to this concept, and you might
want to check out Max More's Phd. thesis, "The Diachronic
Self".

I am *hardly* referring to nominal identity, as you seem to
be implying.  Indeed, I am interested in the *very* notion
of what one is interested in having *survive*, as several
other posters appear to understand very well.

No kidding.

It appears that you don't know what you are talking about.

I get the feeling that this subject matter is quite new
to you, yet you barge in with the same sense of authority
that (quite rightly) characterized your views on neural
research earlier in the threads on altruism.

Moreover, your overly aggressive dismissals, e.g., "such
rot", "preposterous", serve to convey an unusual-for-you
impatience and jumping to conclusions.  If I didn't think
that people like Mike Perry and Robin Hanson utterly
agreed with me, and several others like Max More and
Derek Parfit probably agree with me, then I'd wonder
indeed if it wasn't going to turn out to be possible
that I was as deluded as you say.

Your own quick-tempered and abrupt reasoning fails to
impress me.  Because the thought-experiments lead to
perplexing results, you immediately take the easy way
out and try to *define* your way clear.  Here you
immediately conclude that one is not the same person
from day to day, or even millisecond to millisecond.
I think that you should admit that if a year ago
someone had attempted to persuade you of that, you
simply would not have listened a minute to "such
rot".

Gordon, we are verging on a new era where things that
have been true for 40,000 years---for example, the
one-to-one relationship between experience and memory
acquisition---are not necessarily true any longer, or
certainly won't.  Please don't paint yourself into
corners with your odd definitions and peculiar axioms.

Well, what is at stake is the evolutionarily new situation
of hypothetical duplicating machinery, applied to soulless
entities made up of atoms, a concept also that we are not
prepared for.  Why it shouldn't be a surprise that your
knee-jerk intuitions aren't adequate.

I avoid simplistic equations like yours above, (or axioms
about humanity that have the words "every" and "all" in
them), and I would advise that you do the same.  I'm merely
claiming that in *some* ways, one's duplicate---were we to
have the machinery to create one---is one's self, while
admitting that in other ways it is not.  (It's just that
the ways in which we *are* our duplicates are more
important, in addition to being novel.)

As is every animal, we are familiar with the ways that our
duplicates are *not* our selves, and I'm drawing attention
to some ways in which they *are* ourselves.  If it turned
out that someone had duplicated the entire city block
where you think you are, and you have been really for the
last few minutes out in the desert (complete with electricity),
then you should rest assured that if your block out there in
the desert is to be annihilated by H-bomb in the next moments,
gts will still live, and *you* will wake up tomorrow morning
in bed regardless.  

Yes---I know that problems remain---I don't call it the
Identity Paradox for nothing.  I merely say that we have
not *yet* become totally comfortable about how to articulate
some of these truths, nor can any of us, despite looking as
hard as possible into the future, state that we know how
all these things will be discussed in the indefinite
years to come.

> As I've stated, your argument fails because the conclusion

Nah.  If all your opponents were always guilty of making
some elementary logical error, or being preposterous, or
of committing the gross errors of which you frequently
accuse them, then you'd have a major mystery on your 
hands as to how gts managed to get so damn much smarter
than all the authors of those books, and all those other
correspondents.

That's exactly right!  Korzybski referred to "intensional" definitions
and "extensional" definitions.  Among the former were Aristotelian
definitions whereby a tree is *defined* as [I forget the twenty word
technical definition] and a human being is *defined* as a featherless
biped.  The latter are "by example" and "by operational definition".

No one learns the meanings of words in the Aristotlean fashion. 
Just as you say, people (especially children) best learn the use
of words by example.  One even learns what "hebetude" means by
learning a number of synonyms that the dictionary refers one to;
and one learned the meanings of *those* words from usage (context)
and example.

("hebetude" was Word of the Day on Nov 8:
http://www.dictionary.com/wordoftheday/archive/2001/11/08.html
Note the utility of the examples.)

Precise definitions and axioms are necessary (SFAIK) only in
mathematics, and it's been noted that a lot of thinkers in
less crystalline (and perhaps more difficult) fields of inquiry
appear to display "math envy".

Yeah, the joke is that *that* is how one is supposed to
solve the problem.

There is a class of problems where you *assume* that
the asker knows what he is talking about.  In this
case, since he didn't provide any other information,
you are supposed to be entitled to assume an infinitesimal
hole in the sphere, of 6 inches!

Then the answer is immediate:  find the volume of a 
6 inch sphere.

An extraordinarily similar one is the following:
A ten unit long line just fits inside an annulus
by being tangent to the inner circle and a chord
of the outer one.  What is the area of the annulus?

I wish I knew more problems like that (hint, hint).
Also, I wonder if there already exists a name for
this class of math problems.  If not, let's invent
one!

Why not simply apply some kind of Church-Turing hypothesis to the matter and 
be done with it?

If I am convinced that I have "survived" uploading or whatever; then I have.

If my family and friends are convinced, then so much the better.

If there are alternate histories, of me in other world-lines, and they are 
convinced that they have uniquely survived; then so be it.

Its not like we have the technology, not even Schwartzeneggers'  Sixth Day 
film (was that based in a Dicke short-no Pun!) is here to trouble our dreams. 
There are other tasks at hand, Kurzweil willing and the creeks don't rise.

It may be better to ask, how might pattern identity theory corelate with what 
we know of physics? Is the "pattern" made of swirling electron-proton pairs 
(cooper pairs), or is there a different mechanism. How does all this stuff 
swirl about our neurology?  Most physicists say that the brain is an 
impossible place for quantum coherence to occur.

Are a copy the same as the original? Well We allready have a precedence 
in nature.

One-egged twins are the same in the beginning of their life. They come 
from the same single cell. At one point that cell divide and becomes two 
featus'

Anybody who argues that two copies of an upload are the same, must also 
agree then that twins are the same person, or that the time passed and 
the different experiences since the division has made them into 
different individuals.

To make it even harder for them to disturb our scholarly discourse with
annoying beginner`s questions we might put up a contest or a written exam,
some kind of a freshman's initiation, elaborated and diabolically conducted
by an ExI celebrity of the candidate's own choice. If she answers 95 % of
the questions correctly she wins a virtual candlelight dinner with her
favourite ExI examiner. I think this might be a happy solution to get rid of
fundamental doubts about personal identity and continuity of consciousness
being preserved in the uploading process. Which after all is one of our
ultimate goals, right? That`s why I can already hear them freshmen singing:

"Nobody ever expects the Uploading Paradox Inquisition!"

> It is my feeling that we should first get rid of the notion of

I guess the term "continuity of consciousness" already implies the notion of
a process, no matter if you choose a destructive or constructive uploading
version. Destroy yourself the Moravec way and keep on living as a solitary,
a unique successor of your former self, or choose to create 2,3,4 duplicates
of you and start a happy (?) family with *all* of you.

There might be another solution of the process that still seems to be a
paradox: keep on being the one and only representative of yourself, put the
copies to sleep immediately, before they can develop a notion of their
identity and get one of them activated when you're in serious trouble or on
the edge of  finally and definitely dying. But this is a tricky issue
because it raises another fundamental topic: Is it ethically justifiable to
put your copies to sleep and have them at your disposal? One would think: as
long as they are still only "cool software" I must  not grant them the right
to develop a warm in vivo existence ... ExI stance...by building up a meat
body around their digital core via nanotech.

But time will probably prove us all wrong. The ultimate way of preserving
your continuity of consciousness might turn out to look completey different
from our speculations today. So let's be generally generous with these ideas
and try to be open for some fresh and more beautiful solutions.

I'd be a keen reader of such a FAQ.

I've been dipping in and out of reading this thread (mostly out actually -so
sorry for the ignorance and non sequitors) because I recognize the
importance for such things to uploading and possibly cryonics. Neither of
these or teleportation being an experience I am keen to undergo anytime
soon.  Indeed with my current scepticism I might be amongst the last to take
a teleporter ride as I can see no way of testing the thing with braver
volunteers that would satisfy me.

Major spilling of ignorance coming.

I actually bought Mike Perry book "Forever for all" from Amazon but couldn't
finish it. I realized I needed to do some catch up reading in quantum
physics to even read it critically. So I picked up copies of "Schrodinger's
cat" and "Schrodingers Kittens" by John Gribbon and a natty litty book
"Introducing Quantum Theory" by J.P McEvoy and Oscar Zarate. At this stage
its probably fair comment to say I've forgotten most of what I read. But it
was reassuring to read that Bohr apparently said "anyone who is not shocked
by quantum theory has not understood it".

The whole idea of many worlds (invoked by Mike Perry in his book above)
seemed to me to be a complete reversal of the Ockams razor approach. It
seemed that every time an new uncertaintuy arouse in the existing model
rather than add an extra dimension or finessing some subtlety at the
boundary or even say damn we just don't know yet, what the many worlders do
is add a whole additional universe every time an uncertainty is encountered.
A little bit like we'd finished "mapping the edges" of the last one.

Practically, it would seem there are few more issues of eventual interest to
extropic types, including myself, but I will take a huge amount of
convincing before abandoning the view, in any non-hypothetical way, that
just because someone else (a copy claims to be me and appears to everyone
else to be me that they are me).

As I said, I'd be a keen reader of such a FAQ, anyone up to writing it?

Brett

Yes. At the quantum level, which has a very measurable impact on the
equilibrium constant. Apart from that we have no precedence in nature.
Nature doesn't do macroscale synchronized deterministic discrete systems
with the same input very well. In fact we don't know a single example.

Two instances of an upload are the same if they evolve along the same
trajectory. Both trajectories are identical at the pattern level down to a
single bit.

Above is a definition.

Two instances of an upload cease being identical at bifurcation. Whether 
differences in external input or system noise or removal of evolution 
constraints caused this is not relevant.

This is also a definition.

Above might come handy, and most of you still in this thread continue 
arguing past each other.

Thanks, Lee.  This is just the procedure I wanted to know if there was a 
simpler version of before I did all that math :) but it counts as an 
answer to my question.  I was hoping someone would say, "Oh, the answer 
must be" followed by a compact factorial expression.

Emlyn, did your procedure eliminate cases where there were four heads or 
fewer in the sample, thus causing the biased sampler to report at least 
one tail?  The original problem specified that the biased sampler reported 
five heads.

### Wow, I learned something today! Now even my mathematically hebetudinous
mind can immediately conclude that the annulus is equal to a circle with ten

### How do you enforce your demand? Against a government which is not
transparent, in a world full of technologies asymmetrically strengthening
large organizations?

You mentioned using democratic means to prohibit government surveillance,
but are you really sure that such means would be sufficient? If you demand
unilateral transparency of the government, you will have a weak government,
poorly able to resist attacks by internal and external forces, soon to be
succeeded by a stronger version, with no intention to listen to your vote.
If you allow government opacity, you will be unable to enforce your demand
to be left anonymous.

How do you solve the conundrum?

Also, I hope your demand for anonymity would not involve the use of
organized violence (state law) to prevent private entities from non-invasive
gathering of information about you. After all, if a neighborhood watch sees
you and recognizes you, your anonymity is breached, yet I am sure you would
not demand that the neighborhood watch volunteers would need to be
blindfolded whenever you pass by their street. Analogously, should the
neighborhood watch, or their hired security firm, or the mutual information
exchange system formed by such firms, use not only eyes but also cameras,
body language analyzers, smell sensors, etc., the resulting personal
information about you would remain their private property, to be used as
they see fit.

So, would you agree that you see transparency as
a patch for the problems caused by unclear title?

For instance, if one paid for using the resources
of others when sending mail, spam wouldn't be
possible on the scale it now exists.  Transparency
seems like a way to avoid fixing the systemic
errors which cause the problems.

What is at stake here is the validity of rational thought as a means of
comprehending reality.

Your argument attempts to equate two mutually exclusive concepts ("self" and
"other"). No rational argument can justify such a contradiction in terms,
which means we need either 1) consider discarding the two terms as having no
meaning in the transhuman future (which leaves us essentially speechless in
matters pertaining to our relationships to people and objects in the world)
or 2) consider the possibility that perhaps your argument is not quite as
rational as you seem to think.

### I was thinking about the meaning of Occam's razor in this context. In
its essence, Occam's razor demands simplicity of thought rather than
simplicity of the world. A simple explanation of a set of measurements is
preferred to a complicated one, as long as the predictions derived from the
explanations are equally corroborated by additional measurements. The number
of entities which are being measured, or could be in principle measured,
need not be minimized, however.

If we accept the idea that the algorithmic complexity of a universe is the
measure of simplicity of its explanation, but the number of all entities in
that universe is not, then Occam's razor would prefer the simplest algorithm
capable of generating all entities, regardless of the number of entities
observed. If you need to invoke a longer algorithm (a longer explanation) to
produce the same set of observed entities, then this is against the razor,
even if you manage to minimize the set of entities derived from your long
algorithm to equal the set of observed entities.

Specifically, in classical QM you introduce a separate explanation of every
quantum event as a collapse of a superposition with a random component
(which has to be added to the algorithm to synchronize it with observation),
so the length of your atomically correct description of the world grows with
each nanosecond. In MWI you could postulate a simple initial state and a set
of rules of deriving subsequent states, containing the full algorithm (=
your simple explanation) sufficient to predict the structure of the whole
multiverse for all time. Since you are using a simpler thought to predict a
larger number of observations, this would be the solution preferred by
Occam, even if the vast majority of the entities would not be observable.

What do you think?

I think Max meant that they are the same when they exist as a single zygote,
before the split and divergence.

It seems to me that development of identical twins is a very handy analogy
for thinking about the development of bifurcated adults. In both cases they
start as one and diverge into two distinct entities at the bifurcation. In
both cases, neither of the bifurcated versions can rightly consider himself
to be the other.

Yes, and people who are not identical certainly cannot have the same
identity. I wonder why some people find this so hard to swallow.

### Yes, but how do you assure that this happens and continues as a social
practice? After all, the combined capitalization of the US publicly
available stock is equal to just a few years' worth of the combined
disposable income of US workers. If workers truly *wanted* to own the means
of production, they would have bought them, just like they buy cars, or
handyman's tools.

You mentioned that UK pension funds own 80% of stock in UK, but does it
solve the problems that socialism was supposed to fix - the conflict of
interests between the owner and the worker? After all, if workers in a
company owned by other workers through a pension fund go on strike to
increase their wages, the conflict is just as real as when the company is
owned by a fund operated by greedy tycoons. Is it right to go on strike
against your fellow workers? Or maybe it's wrong to expect your pension fund
to make money off the worker's hides, by making them work efficiently for a
market price?

Every time you try to use a non-market solution to this kind of problem, it
fails. But if you use the market, you keep having the same problems, no
matter if you call it "soziale Marktwirtschaft", market-oriented socialism,
the third way, or NASDAC.

I agree that you need to use the power of the state to protect the market
from its own success, being overtaken by the biggest players, wealthy enough
to buy the political apparatus. However, the solution I see as correct in
not socialist - it isn't increasing the power (=ability to force others to
do your bidding) of the workers by controlling the means of production and
the state itself. I think we should decrease the *total* available amount of
coercive power, by politically disarming the rich, and the middle class, and
the poor. You only need as much of a state as needed to prevent a bigger one
from happening (+ a few minor functions related to certain uncommon lifeboat
situations and provision of some types of services).

Yes, you are doing exactly that.  Not only does socialism have a long
tradition of allowing brutal thugs to get in charge but they also have a 
long tradition of initially having a large group "useful fools" (Lenin's 
phrase) providing the theoretical basis to form a state that is easy for a 
thug to take over.

Well, if that is socialism, then I'm not a socialist, but I don't see how 
this can have much to do with socialism, at least if you define the word in 
a self consistent way (many didn't). I think socialism should be defined as 
workers' control of the means of production, not brutal tyrants running 
around subjugating. This all depends on definitions ; you say I am trying to 
define away the evils of socialism, but I could say, if there was evidence, 
that you are the one who is trying to define away the benefits of socialism, 
no? And I think there is evidence, I think there is a long line of socialist 
tradition and proto-socialist ideas which demonstrates that socialism, apart 
from a fringe element, was always about workers control, and the state only 
entered in as a means to that end, if at all (remember, anarchists 
considered themselves socialists at Marx's Internationale, before they were 
kicked out). Rather it has been the vested interests of our society, who 
have sought to redefine socialism along their own lines, to pursuade people 
that liberty and happiness are undesirable, that one must submit to the 
state capitalist system (or, as Orwell said, "freedom is slavery"). And it 
has been in other countries that dictators and malevolents would define 
tyranny as socialism for their own propaganda purposes, to entice people who 
favor socialism into supporting them (more Orwell). Thus the word socialism 
was twisted into what may be described as simple doublespeak or 
ill-consistent definitions.

       I have read in Hayek that most of the terms you use are nonsensical 
and incapable of accurate definition -- that is why I refuse to try to 
define socialism.  If you cannot define it after 200 years, and this 
exchange of email, and still are incapable of defining your own system then 
why expect an outsider like me to do so?

Well, he is somewhat right, I think--because the word socialism has been 
twisted by various interests over the years to support power, here and 
abroad. I mean, sure, you can define socialism as "enslaved freedom", but I 
don't think that makes sense, I don't think that "socialism" is the word you 
should choose to describe that. "Tyranny" might be a better choice, in this 
context.

       Alexander, you can't even bring your system down to Earth enough to 
accept your past mistakes, which we have enumerated, or to tell us how you 
intend to avoid those same mistakes in the future.

Again, I don't support these systems, so I'm not sure why I should apologize 
for them. Nazism is totally antithetical to socialism, as was Stalinism. The 
workers didn't control their own conditions at all in such countries ; on 
the contrary, they were monstrous cavities of authoritarianism, with the 
workers completely subjugating to a violent and tyrannical State.

Friend, IMHO, it is time to put not only this thread to rest but also
the entire subject of socialism both online and in the real world.  Give it 
up, it is a bad job.  You are wasting the time you spend on socialism just 
as the workers under socialism and those poor souls in the concentration 
camps or the gulags are having their lives wasted.

Did the workers control their gulags? Did they control their own 
concentration camps? Is it justifiable to label this as socialism?

### Now, let's do some rational analysis here.

If I stay with somebody in a room, we exchange atoms by breathing. If my
atoms are "self", soon there will overlap of "self" and "other".

Or maybe I start talking to somebody and exchange ideas. If "self" is made
of ideas, there soon will be overlap of "self" and "other".

Perhaps I would choose to establish a direct neural link to the person I
talked to. In that case her thoughts would be accessible to me like the
thoughts originating within my own skull. If the feeling of direct access is
what makes "self", then there would be overlap of "self" and "other".

Finally, after extensive mental communion (mediated by advanced hardware)
I/we would decide to rewire our prefrontal cortices (the material substrate
supporting the idea you call "self"), to voluntarily merge our motivational
concepts of self, without losing any of the memories and capabilities each
one of me/her had before we met. In that case again, there would be overlap
of "self" and "other".

"Self" and "other" are not simple mathematical statements that could be
"mutually exclusive". These are complex mental constructs evolved for
specific adaptationist goals, and as such cannot be easily stuffed in a
couple of glib definitions.

Be so kind and refrain from peremptory denouncement of your adversaries as
irrational. What we do, is not to play at sophistry and rejection of
rationality, but to expand the scope of rational thought to encompass and
possibly supplant the simple evolutionary adaptations which won't work well
anymore when uploading becomes available.

Rafel,
       You have just given a great practical demonstration of why it is 
important to keep socialists with their feet drawn up to fire of reality.
       General Semanticists speak of levels of abstraction beginning with 
direct impulses that come to us through our senses.  The direct sensations 
are abstracted into thoughts or impressions all the way to very abstract 
thoughts about thoughts.  Another way of saying this is that the Map is not 
the territory.
       Socialists love to talk about maps and maps of maps but as you have 
just seen over the past few days they resist coming down to earth to deal 
with the territory.  That is why I flat refused to get involved in any 
discussion of maps of maps in that discussion.
       Consider workers.  One of the most difficult things about the reality 
of working is when we have to change.  You can bet that when the automobile 
came along the buggy whip workers would much rather have gone on making buggy 
whips -- it was much more comfortable.
       Right there the socialist is caught in a bind.  How does he get the 
worker to change?  Reeducation doesn't seem to work, the new way really is 
much more difficult that continuing to do things the old way.  Does he give 
up and accept the slow rate of change that he can get through education and 
persuasion or does he turn thug to force change?  As we have seen most if not 
all the socialist states turn thug.
       Of course there are more reasons for turning thug than what I have 
just described but that only speeds the process.
       There is another reason why workers complain.  Please get yourself a 
bridge deck.  We will of course need the 52 card deck with no jokers, etc.
       Now, deal out 4 bridge hands and using a watch with a second hand vary 
your speed until you can do it in 30 seconds.  That is by long standing 
definition a 100% pace.  You will find it requires your attention but not 
excessively difficult.
       Now vary your speed a bit to see how fast you are.  If you deal the 
cards as if you were in a real game you probably can't go faster than 30 
seconds divided by 1.8.  That is 180% of normal pace.
       Finally vary your speed to deal the hand in 43 seconds.  That is 
equivalent to working at 70%.  If you get a friend to watch you at 100% and 
then again at 70%.  Their job is to prevent you from changing the way you do 
things in order to slow down.
       You will find that working at the slower pace is much more difficult 
than working at 100%.
       And, there is where the socialist is really going to have to watch the 
work force.  People intuitively think that working slower is easier but when 
they slow down things get tougher.  Strange but true.  If the boss keeps the 
worker on the job, takes no lip, works hard to support the worker so no 
problems intrude, then the workers output rises to a peak with no further 
ado.  If you try to speed the worker up by yelling, "faster" the gains come 
only with great difficulty.  If the worker is allowed to slow down and loaf 
he becomes extremely tired.
       But may whatever Gods you worship help you if you either coddle the 
worker or try to speed him up by becoming a thug.

### A very good statement.

You can expand it further by appealing to evolutionary analysis.

Our mind is a low-power general reasoning device built atop a huge
conglomerate of highly efficient, specialized modules, or drives. All of
these modules, as well as the general reasoning device (the rational
intellect), evolved during the propagation of a pattern of chemical and
physical processes, that now constitute our bodies and brains. Throughout
evolution, parts of the pattern changed, some elements were eliminated when
they no longer supported the propagation of the whole unit, and branching
occurred trillions of times since the initial replicator arose billions of
years ago.

The most evolutionarily modern tools for survival are analytic concepts.
They allow a contingent analysis of the environment, and the choice of the
optimal, individual solution. One of the most important advances is the
ability to analyze parts of the mind to resolve conflicts and choose the
best solution. Initially, the rational intellect performing these analytic
tasks is merely a tool of the various drives. The drive to survive uses the
intellect to produce a simple notion of self. The drive to proliferate uses
reason to maximize the number of offspring. Etc.

However, if the rational intellect is allowed more in-depth, recursive
analysis, both of the drives I mentioned above can be re-framed, as tools
for pattern propagation. You are able to reach conceptually to the beginning
of evolution and internalize its direction for your own. Since the rational
intellect itself has no motivation, it can only borrow a motivation from the
lower levels, but not necessarily from any single module.

If it happens so that your simple-self module (with built-in notions of
temporal continuity and direct qualia and memory access) is ascendant over
others, you will get gts's attitude. If your altruism module (evolved during
the kin-selected phase of our evolution) wins, you might get a Gandhi-like
persona.

I think that Lee and I allowed our rational faculties to take over
motivation by borrowing liberally form the simple-self module, and the
altruistic module, and the pattern-propagation-through-children module. We
abstracted the most important elements of them - imperative to propagate a
pattern, with maximal similarity to the original, that is compatible with
temporally extended propagation (you can't propagate for long if you don't
change, but if you change too much, it's no longer propagation), and took it
as the prime directive.

If course, it is a value judgment - but a value determined much closer to
first principles than the simple-self value set.

Also, patterns that propagate more efficiently will overtake others. Since I
will support my copying, teleportation, and uploading, while many of the
simple-selfers won't, in the end patterns like me will rule the world. Join
us.

Rafal,

I am amused that Lee (and now you) are accusing me of calling others
irrational. If you read my words you'll see that I am attacking Lee's
argument, not his person. Moreover the basis of my refutation is none other
than that his argument is fallacious by reason of reductio ad absurdum,
which is to say that his conclusion is absurd enough to invalidate his
premises. For that reason I make no apologies for describing his argument
with adjectives synonymous with "absurd", e.g., "preposterous" and
"irrational."

I see no overlap here. You exhale some atoms which are later taken up by
another person. The atoms are first a part of your self and later a part of
another self. At no time are they overlapping.

> Or maybe I start talking to somebody and exchange ideas. If "self" is made

Again I see no overlap between self and other. You can conceive of an idea
similar or identical to an idea that another also conceives. There then
exists two instantiations of that conception, one in your mind and one in
the other's mind.

Again I see no overlap. If you are aware that her thoughts are coming from
her rather than from you, then clearly they are from "other." If you think
they are coming from you, then you are decieved by the illusion created by
the neural link. That deception does not obviate the otherness of her
thoughts.

In that far out case I would consider the merged individuals as a very
complex self, similar to a person with mulitiple personality disorder (but
without the pathology connotation).

The distinction between self and other is the most basic of human
cognitions. It occurs to us in or before early infancy, perhaps even in the
womb. It is the first rational thought we can have, and upon it rests all
subsequent logic.

One might even say we are not persons in the world until we discover this
critical distinction between self and other. Certainly we cannot think "I
exist in the world" until we realize the otherness of the world in which we
exist.

How very 19'th century, and what exactly does it mean anyway? Should a
janitor at INTEL vote on when to switch over to 64 bit processors? Doesn't
sound like a very good idea to me but if you want to start a company along
those lines go right ahead, just don't make me join. I think I'd rather make
my living at a company where the decisions are made by people who know
something about the subject. The real world will soon tell us which approach
works better.

    >not brutal tyrants running around subjugating.

Ah, there is the rub, socialists use force to prevent me from doing things
my way but I have no wish to use force to prevent you from doing things your
way.  That's why I'm a libertarian

    > Friend, IMHO, it is time to put not only this thread to rest

It always amuses me when somebody sends a long post and then at the very end

Yes, I can agree. The key is that no bifurcation had time to occur, so there
is no disparity in self/identity/personality. For the moment I'll take your
word for it that a 10 ms biological chronon is a sufficiently short time
interval (in my own arguments along these lines I used Planck Time, which as
you know is of much shorter duration).

FROM:PRNCSS. L ORGANA

DEAR friend.

I AM PRINCESS LEIA ORGANA ONLY SURVIVOR OF THE ROYAL FAMILY OF ALDERAN
(ALDRN).

I AM MOVED TO WRITE YOU THIS LETTER, THIS WAS IN CONFIDENCE
CONSIDERING MY PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCE AND SITUATION.

I WAS FALSLEY IMPRISONED UPON THE IMPERIAL BATTLESTATION ("DEATH
STAR") WHEN MY PLANET WAS HIDEOUSLY DESTROYED AND ENDED BY THE BVERY
BAD SITH LORD VADER.

I ESCAPED ALONG WITH THE AID OF BRAVE REBELS AND WOOKIES, AND AM NOW I
AM LYING LOW DUE TO THE SITUATION IN THE 4TH MOON OF YAVIN TILL WHEN
THINGS GETS BETTER.

I HAVE CONTROL HERE OF THE SUM OF $25, MILLIONNN IN IMPERIAL CREDITS
DEPOSITED WITH A SECURITY COMAPNY FOR SAFEKEEPING ON TATOOINE.

THE FUNDS WERE SHIPPED BY A COURIER SERVICE AS DIPLOMATIC ITEMS OF
HIGH VALUES TO PREVENT THEM FROM KNOWING THE CONTENT.

WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO friend IS TO INDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU
WILL ASSIST ME BY RECEIVING THE MONEY ON OUR BEHALF ON TATOOINE AND ASSIST
IN INVESTING THIS MONEY IN ANY LUCRATIVE BUSINESS LIKE MOISTURE FARMS AND
STOCK IN MULTI-PLANETARY COMPANIES AND OTHER SAFE LUCRATIVE INVESTMENT
IN YOUR SECTOR.

MAY I AT THIS POINT EMPHASISE THE HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY, WHICH
THIS BUSINESS DEMANDS, AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY THE TRUST AND
CONFIDENCE WHICH I REPOSE IN YOU.

IN CONCLUSION,IN THE EVENT YOU ARE INTRESTED TO ASSIST ME I WILL LIKE
YOU TO CONTACT MY LAWYER WHO I HAVE STATIONED IN MOS EISLEY TO WITHNESS
THE TRANSACTION TO IT'S CONCLUTION.

YOU CAN REACH HIM ON HIS DIRECT LINE VIA MAIL [email removed for
protection],

I apologize Lee, I will attempt to keep my posts more brief, but I fear that
will contribute to misunderstandings of my points.

"Namely:  in no way does one's identity depend on
particular atoms. "

Then if you copied your pattern to a new group of atoms, would that new
entity experience the same subjective events as you?  If it did, then
identity does not depend on particular atoms, but if it did not (the
reasonable outcome) then since the only changed variable is the atoms, then
one must logically conclude that in some manner identity does depend on
atoms.

I contend that it is dependant on using the majority of the same atoms from
one moment to the next.  Copying replaces all atoms simultaneously, growth
and development and simple existence through time only replaces a small
number of atoms at any given moment.

"You don't really know this!  How can you be so *sure* that
teleporters really do anything to someone besides change
their location?"

This is why I suspect you do not understand what I am saying.  I "know" this
through the simple thought experiment.  If my pattern of my atoms is
imprinted on new atoms, creating a new group of atoms in the same pattern,
while I am still standing around, we do not feel / see / hear the same
things.  If he does not sense what I sense, then he must not be a
continuation of me.  There is no appeal to mystical thought, no soul, so
irrationality, it purely the simplest explanation for oberseved phenomena.

observation - a copy of me does not have the same subjective experiences as
me

conclusion - a copy of me is not the continuation of me, since to be the
continuation of me it must share the same subjective experiences as me from
one moment to the next.

"Why, atoms were unknown to vastly better philosophers than you or I for
millenia, and you must read
at least enough SF to understand that duplicates would be accepted as the
original people *regardless* of what the
underlying theories are, so long as the theories do not contain the
equivalent of souls."

So a lot of Sci Fi authors have said this, therefore it must be so?  I do
not dispute that many people (like you) would accept copies as the
originals, instead of another person much like the original, but that does
not mean that a) that are justified in doing so (argumentum ad populum) and
b) that I must.  And it does not necessitate the equivalent of souls, all
one need to is show that a copy does not experience the same subjective
events as the original to show that he is a copy, and not a continuation of
the original subjective consciousness.

"Have you considered the case that the replacement is done without altering
the location?  In that case, the experience would be the same."

Subjectively it would be the same, I do not know if I am continually
destroyed and recreated in the same place from instant to instant.  But is
that reason enough to assume that I am being destroyed from one instant to
the next and to then think it ok to be destroyed and recreated the next
instant somewhere else without worry?  If you first show that I am being
destroyed and recreated from one instant to the next then I will consider
this a valid argument (as I addressed this point in my post to gts) but just
because it is possible does not mean it is occurring and that we should
adjust our lives to something we merely imagine as a possible explanation
for the way the universe works.  

But even if it were subjectively the same, if a copy was placed elsewhere at
the next instant, it is clear that it would not experience the same
subjective events as me.  If the copy was placed where I was, that means I
was destroyed.  That I was destroyed does not invalidate the fact that the
copy was not a continuation of my consciousness.  And the individuals
operating the scanning and reconstruction machine that scanned and recreated
me in an instant would know what happened, and if logical would know that
subjectively the copy they created is not a continuation of my subjective
consciousness, they would know if they had made the copy somewhere else and
not destroyed me, the copy and me would not feel the same events.

"Most importantly, however, if your location suddenly changes and so you
start having "different experiences" it does *not* alter your identity.  

How can my location 'suddenly change' exactly without me either moving from
point a to b (and thus having the same pattern and same atoms) the only way
it can suddenly change is if I were teleported.  If I were teleported
without destroying the original, the teleported entity would clearly have
different subjective experiences then I would, thus it is not a continuation
of me.

"Your posts are very long, and I'm sorry that I don't have time at present
to respond to them in detail."

No problem, I will try to keep them shorter, but it seems necessary to
describe these points in detail to help prevent misunderstanding, as in
cyberspace people continually address either what they think you mean, or
your literal words instead of the ideas you are trying to convey.  The same
points seem repeated, if you think a copy is you, then shouldn't you and the
copy share the same experiences?  If you do not, he is a different person,
regardless of whether or not the copying process destroyed you and/or moved
him.  You said you have seen valid objections to this?  Which one?  

> I should have emphasized 'continuation' of subjective experience, which I
> guess I skipped over in typing that particular message.

"Yes, right."

Yes, right, I see you chose not to respond to the very next sentence "As I
have emphasized from the get go, a copy will not experience the same
subjective events that a reference or original does, thus it CAN NOT be a
continuation of the consciousness of the original. "

> Since the result says "copy and original, ...do not share same sensory
> experience" And you say that does not follow, the converse would be that
the
> copy and original DO share the SAME sensory experience.  Would you assert
> then that both the reference and the copy *share* subjective experiences?

"No, of course not.  I would simply say that choosing which one is the
*reference* version is an arbitrary choice."
AND
""An axiom of your thought---which you seem unable to challenge ---is that
you *would* be the original and *would not* be
the duplicate.  Here you should say "neither can see what the other sees"
without presuming to know which is the *real* "

So you admit that a copy and an original do not share the same experiences?
Then would you agree that a copy is NOT a continuation of the consciousness
of the original?  

I can tell them apart, whichever one walked out of the 'scanner' side of the
'scanner copying machine'.  But it does not matter if you cant tell them
apart, it does not defeat the point that they were separate and that one was
the original and was is the copy.  One of these was clearly the 'reference'
pattern, and one must clearly be the pattern imprinted onto a new grouping
of atoms using the 'original' as a 'reference'.  

"Which one is the original?" is not the same question as "Was there an
original?"
AND
"then there is NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM."

Depends on what you consider significant.  Do you disagree that one of them
was made up of the same atoms that made up his pattern the instant before?
And the other one is made up of atoms that were not arranged into his
pattern the instant before?  There is clearly a difference, rather you
consider it significant is a matter of opinion.

"Then in this case, we have *no* reason to suppose that the one who happened
physically to be the original 
differs in any important way from the other. "

If he and the other do not share the same subjective experiences, then it is
clear that he and the other differ in a pretty significant way, they are
both individual unique entities and do not have some sort of shared
consciousness.

"But Greg Egan's AXIOMATIC is *the* book with which to jolt your unconscious
assumptions and gain a different and puzzling (for me too!) take on all
this."

I will check it out

"You must get paid by the word, I will say the same thing more concisely:
"The evidence the subjective experience is not the same is that the
subjective experience is not the same." I must say I'm not entirely
convinced."

No, unfortunately I do not.  I am trying to understand the positions in this
argument, and trying to convey mine accurately, unfortunately this is a
difficult medium to convey ideas accurately, people argue against what they
think you must mean, or skip through your statements and attack literal
snippets out of context instead of the idea you are trying to convey.  Words
are merely inefficient mechanisms to convey ideas, and filtering thoughts
and ideas into words is not a lossless compression, so some redundancy seems
to be required sometimes.  But I digress...

Do we actually need to perform this experiment to see how it would come out?
As I have said, copy me and my copy and I do not share the same subjective
experiences (ask us what we see) Since my copy can not share the same
subjective experiences as me, then it can not be a continuation of me.  It
is obvious it is a different individual entity with its own experiences.
Thus, the evidence that subjective experience is not the same for a copy and
an original is that if you perform the experiment (currently only a thought
experiment) they are indeed not the same, can you think of better evidence
than that?  If there subjective experiences are not the same, they MUST be
unique, isolated, separate individuals.  Thus a copy is not me.

I will continue to argue this point until A) I argue adequately that this as
the logical position to take or B) someone convinces me of a better more
logical position to take.

The latter would require, as far as I can tell, someone to argue that
logically a copy is indeed a continuation of the subjective consciousness of
the original.  Given the fact that a copy and me will see different things,
and that we both can exist simultaneously, and are spatially separated, it
seems unlikely.  

It seems to me that extropian are much more likely to embrace this
worldview, that a copy and a back up, etc. are indeed you, since it fits
nicely and conveniently into their visions of the future.  I have yet to see
why one should logically believe this to be the case though, and I have
presented reasons to logically think it is not.

I also think trying to find an exact definition of survival and death is
pointless, like most things we learn the meaning of those words from example
not definition."

What about agreeing on a definition for identity?  For 'you, me, I'  For
entities being 'the same' (are they two separate, identical entities but
spatially separated, or are they one entity entirely?) Is it not reasonable
to agree on definitions before we attempt to make arguments that involve
such words?

I never get involved in these silly debates about "identity"
and duplication, because I have yet to see anyone ask a
question that's meaningful and interesting instead of just
prattling on about definitions.  But an almost unnoticed
side comment in this latest one brought to mind an issue I
do think is interesting and worth exploring: the nature of
"obligation" and "communal planning".

I will simply assume--because I think there can be no
reasonable objection--that at some point in our technology
I will be able to duplicate everything I find interesting
about the 110-kg lump of matter I presently occupy in some
other 110-kg lump of matter, or even in some other substrate
(how "exact" is irrelevant, since surely everything that's
interesting and meaningful and unique about me is a tiny
fraction of the total information content of this particular
lump). I will further assume that this second instance of
class Me will behave just as we would expect any other
sentient lump of matter to behave, and that he will be
granted rights and autonomy as any other sentient, and that
I, having created him, will grant him the assets necessary
to start a productive life.

The interesting question, then, is how do we, the other
sentients, handle cases where we have contracted with the
not-yet-duplicated me for some future plans?  The case of
a destructive scan-and-dup should be pretty simple: it's
close enough to existing notions of "transportation" that
we can just treat it that way.  But what about the case
where I deliberately fork, and my dup goes off travelling
while I remain for a while, and then, say, die in an
accident because I knowingly took an excessive risk? Do 
the people to whom I owed obligations have a greater claim
than the ordinary one on my estate, or a claim against my
other fork, because there's another instance out there who
remembers giving the obligation, might be in a position to
fulfill it (for example, because he clearly has the skills
and experience I did), and because my knowledge of that
other instance made me more inclined to take that risk?

How do my obligations, alliances, and contracts with others
affect my ability to fork?  If I am married, do I have the
right to create a fork or give it any of my assets if that
wasn't anticipated in the marriage contract?  Is the fork
bound by any obligations of care I (and therefore he) gave
to my spouse should the original instance die?  Is it
acceptable for me to fulfill a contract for my services
by sub-contracting my twin?  Can I choose to apportion not
only my assets, but my personal obligations between the two
as we see fit (for example, could I let one of me own my
medical insurance and another me own my life insurance,
and a third me keep my marriage?

Can I form contracts between me and my twin before his
creation?  After all, I know everything he will know when
he is created, and have all the same motivations, so
shouldn't I be able to sign on his future behalf?

If I destructively scan and duplicate myself in another
substrate (say an upload, or a bush robot), am I obligated
to choose a form that can physically accomplish whatever
obligations I may have had in my present form?  Can I still
hold others to obligations they may have had to my previous
form, since I remember and still desire them, even though
they did not anticipate my transformation?

"Yes, I can agree. The key is that no bifurcation had time to occur, so
there is no disparity in self/identity/personality. For the moment I'll take
your word for it that a 10 ms biological chronon is a sufficiently short
time interval (in my own arguments along these lines I used Planck Time,
which as you know is of much shorter duration)."

As I have acknowledged as well, since time itself does not exist at any
increment shorter than the Planck Time, then the universe can be thought of
as being destroyed and re-created from every instant to the next.  However,
the question remains important, is the entire universe is destroyed and
recreated simultaneously or is each part of it destroyed and recreated on
its own planck-time schedule.  If the former were the case, I would not
object to a teleporter that scans, destroys, and copies me in the interval
the plank time, as this happens all the time anyway.  If the latter was the
case, I would object, since at any given interval of time the vast majority
of the things that made up my pattern were present at the instant before.
If the scanner copier was not operating at planck time intervals, I would
object.  In Eugen's case mentioned above, even at 10 ms the, the atoms that
make up your pattern were dissassembled and that pattern was imprinted to a
new group of atoms.  This is still not a subjective continuation of you,
since if you were not destroyed, you and the copy would experience different
things, and this if a far greater time scale than the plank length.

"Excellent illustration."

Eugen and GTS, would you not prefer, given the conditions I have outlined,
to instead have your conscioussness distributed in realtime amongst multiple
entities?  Just as I have outlined, if that vast majority of the things that
make up your pattern were part of the same group that made it up the instant
before, I believe it logical to consider it a continuation of you.  Given
that, one may replace ones nuerons one at a time with silicon equivalents,
over a length of time being uploaded AND maintaining subjective continuity.
Once uploaded, one could start spreading his computational parts to other
groups of atoms, one small part at a time.  If my consciousness were
distributed amongst, say, 1 million equally powerfull computers, at any
given time one of them only containing 1 millionth of my concioussness, then
the loss of 1 would not amount to the loss of anymore than 1 millionth of
myself.  

Instead of making continuous backups of yourself, store your concioussness
amongst distributed systems, and then interact with the world as a physical
representation of yourself.  That representation, which is controlled by you
and transits all sensory experience to you, would be the one tortured.  

To clarify, nothing I have outlined is incompatable with the common
extropian themes of 'uploading' 'copying' and 'backups'.  Except what I
outline ensures is that you are indeed present from one moment to the next,
instead of just a copy of you.

Nanotechs called to duty at Picatinny. Several nanotechnology companies will
be aiding in the development of smaller - but just as lethal - weapons at
Picatinny Arsenal, officials said Friday. The military base reached six
partnership agreements - two with businesses, the other four with
universities - to help launch a Manufacturing, Research, Development and
Education Center for Nanotechnologies, said Picatinny officials, who have
dubbed the center "Nano Valley." The center is being funded by $9.5 million
in federal grants received over the past two years. It will be spread out
among several of the 1,000 buildings at the 6,500-acre arsenal. (Daily

The Simplest Pump. Researchers have created a nanoscale ion pump by punching
a tiny hole in a plastic sheet and applying an oscillating electric field.
Their modeling indicates that the single conical pore works like a ratchet,
according to the 4 November print issue of PRL. The group hopes that the
device will eventually help explain ion pumps and channels in biological
cells, the inspirations for their work. Micron-sized beads have already been
pushed "uphill," against electrochemical forces, through specially shaped
small holes. Zuzanna Siwy of the Institute for Heavy Ion Research (GSI) in
Darmstadt, Germany, and Andrzej Fulinski of Jagellonian University in Krakow
wanted to take the next step and pump single ions through nanosized pores.

Computer Simulations Showcase Aluminum's Odd Behavior. Aluminum, a metal
known for its conductivity, could behave like a ceramic or semiconductor in
some situations, according to a new report. The metal may also endure
mechanical stress better than copper, which is typically considered to be a
stiffer metal, in nanotechnology applications. The findings, published today
in the journal Science, could point to improved nanoelectronics. (Scientific

Plans set for Arlington Technology Incubator. Armed with $2.3 million for
nanotechnology tucked into the defense appropriations bill signed by
President George W. Bush on Oct. 23, university and chamber of commerce
officials have cemented plans to break ground for the Arlington Technology
Incubator and hope to launch the unusual facility by next March. The
12,500-square-foot center will house between 30 and 35 technology companies,
which will be startups or young companies doing cutting-edge research in the
fields of biotechnology and nanotechnology - the use of devices or materials
built to operate at a molecular level.  (Dallas Business Journal 10/25/02)

Molecular Shuttlecocks.C60 feathered with aromatic groups forms polar
liquid-crystalline materials. Japanese researchers have unveiled a new
design strategy for polar liquid-crystalline materials that they expect will
be applicable to optoelectronic devices. Other groups have attempted to make
such materials by using conical molecules, which stack to form columns with
a polar orientation. But the flatness of those conical molecules and their
ability to flip "have limited the success of this approach to making polar
liquid-crystalline materials," according to chemistry professors Eiichi
Nakamura, Masaya Sawamura, and Takashi Kato of the University of Tokyo and
their coworkers.-A buckyball feathered with five aromatic groups stacks like

Scientific breakthrough no ordinary yarn. A Chinese research team have found
new approaches to pull carbon nanotubes into continuous yarns up to 30
centimetres long - an achievement that may facilitate mankind's manipulation
of matter atom by atom in the future. The breakthrough was made by Jiang
Kaili and his colleagues at Beijing-based Tsinghua University in May, the
latest issue of science magazine Nature stated. Jiang described the carbon
nanotube yarns as thin ribbons composed of parallel threads that have
diameters in the range of several hundred nanometres, with the width of the
yarn roughly depending on the number of threads in it. (China Daily

Gene Tweaking Safely Doubles Life Span. A US team has doubled the lifespan
of the nematode worm with no apparent physiological side effects. The key to
what appears to be uncompromised longevity is to silence a gene involved in
ageing at just the right point in a worm's life cycle. In previous work
involving interfering with the gene, longer life was only achieved at the
cost of a loss of ability to reproduce in C. elegans. "But knocking down the
gene after the worms reach adulthood increases their life span without
affecting their reproduction," says Cynthia Kenyon at the University of
California, San Francisco, who led the research. (New Scientist 10/24/02)

Neutron Holography. Neutron holography with atomic-scale resolution has been
performed, for the first time, with an "inside-detector" approach.
Holography generally includes a source of illuminating waves, an object to
be imaged, and a detector or film in which waves direct from the source
interfere with waves scattered from parts of the object. The interference
pattern, stored in the detector medium, is later read out (and a 3D image of
the object viewed) by sending waves into the detector. (AIPS 10/15/02)

I thought Emlyn's estimate was rather ingenious, but no, it didn't
take that into account nor were his numbers exact, but it was an
interesting shortcut approach that gets damn close to the right
answer with a lot less work.  I guess those of us who are spoiled

of creative shortcuts like that.

Its hard to swallow because it doesn't happen often in our

the identity here under this cup, now watch closely as I
move the cups around, the hand is faster than the eye
my friend, now can somebody tell me where the identity is?"

Actually what is interesting is that a single individual can have
multiple identities (e.g. multiple personality disorders).
Given the fact that at least some brains seem to be able
to keep one set of memories distinct from another set
it seems that once uploads are feasible, there ought
to become a trade in "memories" and/or "identities".
One might be able to do this even pre-uploads with
high bandwidth memory-to-memory interpersonal links
(ala The Matrix).

So you get up in the morning, make your cup of coffee and
the big decision is "Who do I want to be today?".

The interesting thing is that I'll never have to get a PhD.
If I want one I can just borrow Anders or Eugene's "identity".
(Assuming they get the PhDs before uploading is feasible.)

Can we get someplace by considering the concept of cellular division?
Many bacteria and cells divide.  When that happens each gets half of
original DNA, proteins, lipids, cytoplasm, etc.

So we put Damien under general anesthesia, disassemble him atom by atom,
then reassemble 2 copies, each of which has half of the original Damien's
atoms.  So they are both "copies" but would seem to equally have Damien's
"identity".  When they both come out of it, how could they *not* view
themselves subjectively as the continuation of the original?  (Note
how I've probably doubled the number of good books for us to read
by using this strategy.  ... takes brief bow ... )

I've been thinking about this problem since you first mentioned it to me a
few days ago, Michael. I would have answered except that your message was
downloaded onto another computer of mine (I've been out of town since then,
working on another of my computers). I planned to answer it the next time I
returned to my other computer so that I could quote your original properly
(sorry I've been too lazy to pull it from the web archives :-)

Here for now is my brief and tentative answer:

First of all I think the conundrum you pose is not real in the way you think
it is. We need to remember that the universe is quantized *only in relation
to an observer*. I think then that we must look at things from the
perspective of the subject being teleported. The teleportation subject is
the
observer/experimenter. Given the proper measurement instruments, the
subject's experience of the world would be quantized according to Planck's
constant, including his experience of time.

I do not believe it correct to state that "the entire universe is destroyed
and recreated simultaneously," because this option makes no account of an
observer, but of your two choices above I believe this is the more accurate
description. Due to the central role of the observer, one could say that
*his* entire measured universe is quantized, lock in step.

### The above paragraph is, eh, interesting. In the first sentence you imply
disagreement with my request to avoid "calling others irrational". Then you
present what you see as a reason to call Lee irrational (BTW, this reason is
flimsy - a reductio is valid only if premises are shared, and we and you do
not share premises). Finally you are unapologetic about using the words you
mentioned, directly contradicting the thrust of the first sentence.

As my grandma might exclaim, "Um Gotteswillen!"

### What if the two instantiations of the idea of self, carried by either
person, had the *same* referent?

At some point enough shared ideas translate into a shared mind, continuously
transforming self into other.

### Let's say I construct a visual field out of data from the left striate
cortex in my skull and the right striate cortex in the other skull, and feed
the output to my parietal cortex spatial modeling areas. I will see a world
through a very wide interocular distance, as long as all four of my/her eyes
are pointed in the same direction. This will be an experience not achievable
to my unlinked self, not illusory, and quite useful, for example for
measuring distances, even at interstellar distances.

My vision and her vision will be one, even if our other perceptions remain
separate. This is a clear case of overlap of self and other.

Which brings me to a piece of advice - expand you horizons. You will see
more.

### At exactly how many bits per second exchanged through the link do our
separate selves merge into the complex self? You are surely not implying
that there is a sudden all-or-nothing switch from the self + other to
self(squared). This would be the old Zeno paradox, reincarnated at the
(neo)callosum.

No, no, of course there is a continuous change from two individuals to one,
through increasing overlap of self and other.

### I am afraid your beliefs in this matter are in stark disagreement with
current notions about personality development. The consensus is that the
rudimentary sense of self emerges around 15 - 18 months of age, and
continues developing through childhood, even (to a minor extent) in
adolescence and adulthood. See Erikson, Mahler, Lewis and Brooks-Gunn,
William James.

It is important to get the definitions straight, or there will never be 
an agreement.  Still, given that, perhaps one shouldn't yet expect there 
to be any agreement.  The duplication of identities is not yet possible, 
so we don't really have any idea what the possibilities and constraints 
would be.  At this point, perhaps the important thing is to consider all 
sides of the matter.  (I have my own hopes, but I don't know whether or 
not they will be plausible.)

I find more interesting the case when after diverging you rejoin.  Can 
there be a process merge?  Would you want there to be?  What about just 
exchanging diffs?

Ah, yes.  If I sign a contract, is my duplicate required to fulfill it?

Whee!  Can you make binding contracts with yourself?  That seems to be 
what the question is.  To the extent that the fork is seen as a separate 
individual, you wouldn't be able to obligate him.  (Also:  Which one is 
the fork?)

This depends.  Is he embodied within the same kind of body that you are? 
 Identical?  It hardly seems likely.  Even if it's based around a clone 
of your DNA, it would have been raised in a lab, so, e.g., it's 
experiences with exercises would be different.  And I suspect that the 
first generation of duplicates will live within computers, so they may 
well have quite different motivations.  And even if the basic motives 
are the same, standing in a different position will change everything. 
 If you and he played chess, only one of you would be wanting for white

This is silly. There is no point in oversampling your system as the
you-process won't profit from extra precision. If I don't notice even a
flicker, save having time to think "I've bifurc..." that's most assuredly
a subjective continuation. If an absent tree doesn't fall in a nonexisting
forest, do we really give a damn whether we have a logging permit?

I don't know what this 'consciousness' thing is. I'm a process. A sequence
of pattern frames. Subjectively, it doesn't matter how many instances of
the same process they are. In reality I would prefer to have more
instances of me, because real processes can be terminated, and they have
the potential to bifurcate, thus creating more individuals (which I would
have to split my infrastructure with, though, so one shouldn't overdo it).

Huh?

It's not silicion, but incremental in vivo uploading would give you
subjective identity. (So would discontinuous destructive upload, because
the you-process has been suspended).

If the process is identical, having multiple instances of it has only 
purpose for extra redundancy in case of failures, or potential to create 
raw material for a borganism.

Multiple instances of yourself can't interact with the world unless you

You completely lost me here. You cannot have multiple instances of one

<<
Well, I say that the USSR was not socialistic, or the PRC, or Cuba, or North
Korea, or North Vietnam, or any of these places. Why? You say I am trying to
define away the evils of socialism. But are these countries socialistic?
What does socialistic mean? Well, I think there is good evidence, a long
tradition of ideas, that stretch back hundreds of years which will support
the idea that socialism was, apart from some fringe elements, always about
workers control. The state entered in, true, in some ideas of socialism, but
in this case the state was only to be a vessel for workers control. It was,
supposedly, to have no power for itself. Now, I think that is ridiculous and
unrealistic to expect-- if you give the state a lot of power, you're going
to get tyranny. But the state was never fundamental to socialism, as far as
I can tell--workers control was much more central.>>

  And how does the mob (and I decline to use any other identifier)
"control" a society?  It must do so via the state. If it does NOT
do so via the state, but rather by voluntary methods then I have
no issue with socialism. But frankly the high-g overachievers
simply won't play the game. Ask Rafal about this....


<Did the workers control the factories in the USSR? Did workers get to
formulate uncoerced, democratic-type methods for organizing factories,
schools, and other organizations? Well, the answer is a total and utter no.
It was all controlled from above, a complete tyranny. This is why I say that
socialism and the state are incompatible.>

  If you don't have the state enforcing your society then how will
you control the dissenters?
  How will you cause the last naysayer to join your democracy?
Coercion? Organized coercion? Monopolies on coercion?
Right back to the state.

<But look at the United States. We are not so much better, in fact. True, we
have basic rights which prevent massacre by the gun, and, thanks to the
welfare state, also rights which prevent death by forced starvation, but
essentially industry remains in the hands of private tyrannies. There is no
democratic structure to be had in industry. By democratic, by the way, I do
not mean the tyranny of democracy idea, I mean a loose sort of framework
which respects individual rights and lends power where it is justifiable,
not arbitrarily.>
  If you feel this way why not start a "properly democratic" company?
Such an edifice would doubtless be more efficient.. it would be profitable.

Yeah right....
< Even the unions, supposedly the representatives of the
common worker, have grown bureaucratic and corrupt in many ways, largely
because people have not fought to keep them focused. The electoral system is
to a large degree a sham, a mockery of democracy constructed by a system
which has its roots in the private tyrannies I mentioned earlier. It's a sad
state of affairs, and the only way it is going to get better is for the
population to end its passivity and strike back.>>

Some of the mob can't effectively manage a burger king, to say nothing
of "exercising democratic control of organizations".Keep in mind (and
let's keep this in perspective) you are suggesting that the fellow running
the cashier at the Mickey Ds has an intrinsic right to ameliate my
tyranny over my own firm... or it sure sounds like it!  The *only* workable
way I know of to get democratic control of these institutions is through
the market..which takes into account *self-interest*.
  If you won't coerce us libertarians into obedience to a "stateless
socialism"
then you aren't an opponent, just a trifle mistaken.
  How does the stateless socialism ENFORCE it's mandates and group
decisons? Answer me that Alex....

 What's the enforcement mechanism?
(Not the market I'm assuming!)

Brian

You'll observe that I've used 'upload' as a shorthand for evolution of 
discrete deterministic system. As such it is very possible, and in fact 
rather trivial.

I'd wish people would stop get lost in QM and atomic and neuron debates,
and consider the issue in terms of a machine vision version of SHRDLU
driving robot arm in blocks world in machina, and in reality.

In practice you don't have to do an experiment, because it's trivial to 
realize what will happen in a gedanken. This is the domain to do start 
discussions in. 

Once we agree on definitions, and what would happen in above simple
context, the bridge to atoms and neurons is rather short.

"if there aren't 5 coinflips 
that came up heads, the biased sampling procedure reports all available 
heads and enough randomly selected tails to make up the gap"

I purposely included cases where there were less than 5 heads, based on the
above statement. It actually made things a bit more complex.

When I omit that case, I get 0.6642 .

LOL! I thought that your method was ingenious, and mine was just a dumb
brute force approach. I wouldn't have called it creative; just the most
obvious method to a programmer.

You've got a bit of a motivational headache here; you seem to be 
conflating "socialist" with "dictator in charge of command economy".

Lemme give you a brief picture of a socialist enterprise that's active
just up the road from where I live.

About a hundred people work in this building. It's one branch of a large
concern with several dozen other branches around the UK. It is, in point
of fact, a department store -- one of the largest, most high-valued
chains in the country. The workers there are efficient, courteous, and
helpful, and the goods are competitively priced -- if you can find the
same items on sale anywhere else in the city they'll match on price,
and they provide an extended warranty service on top of whatever the
manufacturer normally offers.

Did I say "socialist"? Yes: this business, the John Lewis Partnership,
is jointly owned. All the permanent staff are shareholders. It's a
worker's co-op. And it's one of the leading retain chains in the UK.

"Worker control of the means of production" means, basically, that when
the enterprise makes a profit, the workers share in it. Nothing more,
nothing less. If you worked for a dot com and had stock options, you
were participating in a socialist scheme.

(With me so far?)

The headache of socialism is that the term has been used to cover a wide
range of sins -- including the communist program, which went far beyond
worker participation in ownership, and including a number of failed,
dictatorial attempts to enforce joint ownership by effectively ensuring
that nobody had a stake in anything.

It's extremely noteworthy that all the failures of socialism have involved
attempts to impose it from the top down, by government fiat. The successes
are all bottom up. 

(Here's a big clue: you seem to have been working on the misguided
assumption that I'm a statist. I'm not ...)

It's also noteworthy that stakeholder participation is mostly opposed
only by people who already have an extremely large stake. A curious fact
of human nature is that people define wealth and status in relative
terms. Because the perception of wealth -- if not its fact -- is relative,
people who already have a pile may in some cases feel threatened by
the prospect of other people acquiring their own pile. There's also the
instinct towards collective self-defense, which crops up quite clearly
in rhetoric about the need to keep the uppity workers under control. It
seems fairly clear to me that a well-motivated work force with a stake
in the profits will out-perform a bunch of serfs: which makes it rather
peculiar that conservative interests seem obsessed with forcing liquidity
in the labour market by applying the stick and not the carrot.

I dunno about you, Ron, but I am both a worker _and_ a boss -- I'm self-
employed. Funnily enough, I find that having a share in the profits of my
enterprise is a rather potent motivating force. How about you?

### I would presume that the law (and feelings of right and wrong that
underpin its application) might develop in the same way as the common law
and contract law did. Results of judicial decisions on the welfare of those
who shape the law will be the input for further judicial decisions, and
statutes.

If we agree that the law should maximize the ability of individuals to
engage in peaceful pursuit of their goals, then the obligations put on you
and the fork will evolve depending on whether the fork's wishes can
influence the law. If yes, then probably the forks would have equal claim to
the estate of the original, and equal share in his obligations. If one fork
is alive but the other dies, the surviving fork might inherit part of the
estate, perhaps depending on the amount of cumulative divergence between the
forks. Immediately after the (voluntary) duplication each fork might be
jointly and serially responsible for all obligations of the original (I
guess my stint as a landlord shows here - remember to always put the joint
and serial responsibility on your tenants). Unless they decide to apportion
such obligations unequally (by a non-coercive process starting from an equal
position), this state of affairs would persist until all obligations of the
original were discharged.

prenuptial agreements to clarify the issue.

There are aspects that are trivial, and others that aren't.  Expect, 
e.g., the first generation of uploads to be a destructive read process. 
 For that reason it will probably only be applied to lab animals.  The 
first human will probably be someone otherwise on death's door (consider 
cyronics, and don't expect this to have any better of an image).

But, will there ever be a non-destructive read process?  Well, probably. 
 But that's much less sure.

Another avenue is a bit different.  Evolve the robot that answers your 
phone forwards for awhile.  Eventually people many not be able to 
distinguish between him and you.  This isn't exactly the same kind of 
identity.  Well, it probably isn't.  But if nobody else can tell the 
difference, how do *you* know.  

A third avenue sort of blends the other two.  I.e., it starts with the 
robot that answers your phone (well, conducts social interfacing) for 
you.  To make it more effective, you use a neural link to transfer some 
of your memories.  Periodically you add a few more, until much of your 
more recent memories (i.e., the things you've pulled out of long term 
storage recently) has been transferred.  And used as a social construct. 
 Who is it?  Who are you?

I don't feel the distance is short.  Merely that the trip is essentially 
inevitable.  I expect personal identities to become more diffuse.  I 
suspect that they already have.  (On the internet, nobody knows if 
you're a dog.)
"To men a man is but a mind. Who cares
 What face he carries or what form he wears?"
The future may take this to extremes that we can't yet imagine.

But this is also clearly individual self defense.  If the workers at one 
organization see that they could do better by moving to another, then 
they may well do so.  No assumption of collective self defense is 
needed.  Merely the assumption that the defender benefits by workers 
being employed more cheaply than they could earn for themselves (or that 
he fears they would believe the same).
Somehow this reminds me of quotes from earlier decades about "the 
servant problem", which basically meant that the servants were finding 
better jobs, and either leaving, or not applying for positions.

Well, I'm a programmer, and I didn't think about breaking up the
distribution into equiprobable pairs and then applying Bayes--I just
did the brute force count 'em all and add 'em up.  But then, I've
been a poker player for as long as I've been a programmer, so I'm
used to just adding up all the possibilities.

An interesting aside from the world of Poker: in the first few
years of the World Series of Poker, high-stakes poker was dominated
by old-school "intuition" gamblers like Johnny Moss, "Texas Dolly"
Brunson, "Amarillo Slim" Preston, "Puggy" Pearson, and a other
"road gamblers" who didn't know a binomial distribution from a
binary star, but could look a man in the eyes and know how he felt
about his hand, and had good enough "card sense" to make seat-of-
the-pants probability estimates that were close enough to make
lots of money (and who were smart enough to hire math nerds to
figure out the exact odds they realized they needed to know).
After the money started growing, the poker scene was invaded by
math nerds.  Folks like Chris Ferguson and Phil Hellmuth who play
over e-mail and will argue on the net for days over whether or not
it's profitable to open with Ace-Jack in eighth position in a
ten-handed game with 5 and 10 blinds, and who will show printouts
from a simulator program to make their case.  This is my crowd.

Last year, a European casino sponsored a world "heads-up" poker
championship.  "Heads up" means one-on-one: at every stage in
the tournament, each player plays against only one other player
in single-elimination.  The two start with an equal stake, and
whichever one winds up with all of it moves on to the next
round, no second chances.  This is a game that doesn't emphasize
knowing complex odds.  Everybody already knows what all the odds
are heads-up, because those have been calculated long ago and are
in every book.  So this game is one of straight one-on-one balls.
It was no surprize to me that the final included Amarillo Slim,
at the age of 73, who hadn't won a regular tournament in nearly
20 years (alas, he didn't win this one either, but second place
was good for a sum that would pay off my house).

Ah, now I see I got the attribution wrong; I was talking about Hal
Finney's nifty shortcut.  Sorry, Hal, for giving Emlyn credit for
your creativity; though I'm sure Emlyn has many talents of his own...

Damn, I think you meant Hal's estimate. I didn't use that method at all. I
just got my robo slave to flipping coins, then counted 'em up.

Yes Charlie,
       I have read explanations so many times that were like yours either in 
the papers or in books and it still comes down to a process that usually 
starts as a con job to gain control and ends with a dictatorship.  Germany, 
Russia, Italy, ad infinitum ad nauseum started with the same announced goals 
and ended with a dictator.  Then they are immediately followed by some one 
saying, "but I am much too nice to act like that. A socialist is blah, blah, 
blah followed by a repeat of the previous regimes."  As the French say the 
more they change, the more they stay the same.  No thank you.  Once in a 
while the citizenry manage to retain enough power to vote the rascals out.
       In the meantime the singularity is approaching and we are wasting our 
time listening to a guy that won't even admit the past of socialism but 
instead says trust me while I redefine everything while changing nothing.  
You ask us to believe that socialism goes back, back, back into antiquity but 
has no history in all the places where we have seen it tried.

That really is amazing. I did not believe it until I tested it by poking
holes in a piece of paper to place over my computer screen. Even then I
suspected I had poked holes in the wrong places.

In that case I would conclude that one or both persons were thinking insane
thoughts, i.e, that they were not thinking rationally. Two distinct persons
cannot logically be one person, regardless of their thinking about the
subject.

That would be interesting, but again I see no overlap of self and other. I
see only an extension of your sensory apparatus, not much different from two
people watching the same widescreen movie. The distinction of self/other
becomes relevant only when those shared perceptions are *cognized* by your
mind and by hers. Each of you will then  find yourselves to be a distinct
self, with distinct thoughts and emotions about your perceptions, even if
your fields of vision share some or all elements in common.

Quite frankly I have too many questions about the multiple-person mind-meld
monstor that you describe for me to reply here. I would need to examine and
interview it (or you) in a lot more detail to understand exactly what you
mean by it. Your argument here reminds me of something I just read from
Robert B in another message: "Its like a con-person's shell game.  'I put
the identity here under this cup, now watch closely as I move the cups
around, the hand is faster than the eye my friend, now can somebody tell me
where the identity is?'"

Have you ever raised children, Rafal? If so then imagine for a moment that
an infant could understand your words as you explained to him that he is too
young to perceive that his mother's breast for which he screams when hungry
is not separate and other than him.

>See Erikson, Mahler, Lewis and Brooks-Gunn,
>William James.

Assuming you read these authors then you are confusing the development of
personality with the much more rudimentary recognition of self/other. It
appears that even our house-pets distinguish between self and other.

Thank you for engaging me in an interesting (and rational) discussion.

Amazing!
       I copied the pic into photoshop and cut out the two squares and put 
them side by side. I did find that if you put you hands, one either side of 
the squares. Shuttering out the cylinder and the left of the pic. The two 
squares do start to look different. this suggests that the illusion is an 
artefact of the entire picture. or maybe i'm just desperate to convince 
myself that the squares are different shades :o)

I did ya one better and used the eye-dropper tool on each square and  
then looked at the color values which are indeed identical.

Info on both squares:

RGB: 107,107,107
CMYK: 58,50,49,16
HEX: 6B6B6B

Squinting is a good way to normalize the input.  I don't know why... it  
just seems to make them look closer to the same shade.

-crw.

If you mean you just looked at the column on the picture containing the
two squares, you'd still have seen the shadow gradient.  That's what
causes the illusion - shadows being so common in nature that our image
processing wetware automatically compensates for them.

Why exactly is Spike your evil twin??  This has got to be an interesting story.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY SPIKE MY FRIEND!!!

I hope to be at the party for your 200th b-day!  Later, everyone can hop into an experimental starship and discover a gigantic artificial construct built around an alien star.  Long before then we can see the James Cameron produced motion picture.

If the fictional Louis Wu can make it to 200 I sure know you can! : )

very best birthday wishes to a truly great guy,

John

I didn't think my first post congratulating Spike on his birthday made it through, so I rewrote it.  I should have known to just wait longer and see what would happen! 

The second post is the "authentic/better" one I would have preferred to have on the list regarding my thoughts and feelings.  I suppose this shows having to rewrite something sometimes actually makes the poster do a better job at expressing themselves.

I wonder if this could be compared to the "xoxing/identity" problem...

Maybe not. lol!

best wishes,

John

Spike, I hope to personally attend your 200th birthday!  Afterward, everyone can board an experimental starship and go explore a gigantic alien construct built around a distant sun.  Long before that day, we can go see the Ringworld film James Cameron will hopefully be producing!    

Sometime in the early twenty-first century I hope Spike's family and extropian friends can throw him a birthday bash at the Creekside Preserve/Ventureville.  He and Shelley would enjoy a nice warm soak in one of our bright-red, heart-shaped, hot tub jacuzzi's!

It has many times occurred to me that if I could
go back to 1966 and start all over thinking about
identity, the simplest and best alternative would
be to convert to some fundamentalist religion
like Christianity.

All the intractable paradoxes of who and what we are
would disappear in a flash.  It would easily be seen
that God dispenses unforgeable serial numbers for each
soul He creates.  All our intuitions would readily
line up behind this fact instead of being constantly
opposed to the facts.

Had I known at age 18 what an obsession this was
to shortly become, I surely would have opted for
this solution, which looks to be so much more in
accordance with Occam's Razor.  Instead of the
virtually insoluble paradoxes and dilemmas, one
would have just *one* peculiar new assumption,
namely that souls (and God) exist.

But there is a strong analogy between that "simpler"
view and the Copenhagen interpretation in physics.
Yes, both make life so much easier:  one saves on
universes, the other saves on dilemmas.  The fatal
flaw in each, however, is that *no* justification
for such an extra and dangerous assumption exists.
Just as the collapse of the wave function is surely
a myth, so is the soul, and we cannot *believe* myths.

So we are simply stuck, in both situations, struggling
to make sense of a universe whose rules this planet
did not evolve us to understand.

I did the same. I clicked the foreground color then the background color in
each square. When I double clicked either one they both came up color
6B6B6B. They are the same color. Indeed the shadow coming from the cylinder
has a darker overlay in the middle squares. (It is the shadow that is
causing the illusion) If you click the square that is just peeking out from
the cylinder (closest to the cylinder) in a triangle shape, it is the
darkest white square, even darker than B.

Not obvious at all IF THE TWO ARE REALLY IDENTICAL, so please don't
come back with stuff about them seeing different things because then they
would no longer be the same. As I've said nineteen dozen times when they
start to see different things they will diverge and that's why I don't want
my
backup older than a second or two.

But you may be the copy and if I were to prove that you are is there any
reason to be the slightest bit upset about it? I can't think of one.

Ahhhhh!

No I don't believe it is , definitions are vastly overrated, examples are
much more important. You've "defined" death in such an odd way that
it's entirely possible that John Clark is already "dead" thus I have little
use for your word and don't care if I'm "alive" or "dead". Do you really
have a problem with the simple idea that if you think you have survived
then you have?

Thank you for addressing the heart of the difficulty with
the right tools!

But observe that you might have traveled for years via the
above mechanism, and persuaded any and all of its superior
accommodations.  Then one day, unbeknownst to you, the
administrators allow a small delay between your remote
duplication and your local disintegration.  But you continue
for years just as before.

(OF COURSE there are also versions of you that persist for
only the time of the delay, but as just said, there *is*
a you which goes on despite all that.)

I hope you do not find more reason to *identify* with the
one about to undergo disintegration than with the successfully
duplicated remote one.  They are *both* equally you.

And thus is "no longer me"?  What gives you such a strange
idea?  Even though the local copy (soon to die) has harrowing
experiences, experiences *DO NOT* immediately make us into
someone else.  (That requires years.)  Remember the quasi-equation

  memory_erasure + teleportation + memory_enhancement = survival_of_duplicate

(which of course PROVES nothing, I submit it ONLY for purposes of
abbreviating a long argument).

Recall that *PHYSICALLY* these are identical in their final
product.  You are the final product.  You survive if your
duplicate does because of the above equality.

None of the three operations above alter one's identity,
and that's why you and your duplicate are, for purposes
of surviving, the same person.

Well, at many points in the *past*, reason promoted the production of
the maximum number of offspring.  Currently, it probably does not.

This is the best paragraph explaining the source of my and
all other's takes on identity that I have ever read.  Kudos.

Indeed, I would say that that is just what I have done:
taken as the prime directive the conflation of the most
important elements of 

   1. the simple-self module
   2. altruistic module
   3. pattern-propagation through children

Thanks again for providing a good explanation.  Some may
worry about number 2 on your list, but here is how it
fits in.  By this item, what is meant is mostly the
manner in which altruism provides an *objective* view
of who should benefit.  It does this by overriding the
incredibly powerful predilection towards self-reward
at the expense of all other organisms.

> If course, it is a value judgment - but a value determined

Yes.  Exactly.  That "simple-self value set" is what IMO
forbids most people from seeing the truth that their
close duplicates are themselves.  "Me, me, me, has to
be over here, not over there!"   It was the first edict
of their early baby selves, and it remains our strongest.
(I am not at all proposing that it is wrong or unimportant;
on the contrary, it merely has to be updated with all the
possibilities now before us.)

Yes, that happens to be true IMO.  Yet even without the semi-biological
or logical reward that you here refer to, it's still true, as you
explained so well above, that our *selves*, when seen in the best
and most advanced light, thrive by "copying, teleportation, and
uploading", regardless of the "reward".

Thanks John.  The evil twin thing was demonstrated

Oh, okay.  I apologize for not being able to respond to it all
(or even to take the time to thoroughly study it all).

Yes, but remember that this would happen if you fell into
a man hole while walking down the street.  More abruptly
still, what if a space warp were transmitted through this
part of space, and you found yourself (same atoms) instantly
on another planet?  It seems to me that your criterion for
"same experience" is too strong.

Moreover, what you are really doing is reasoning from what
is (to me) the conclusion---namely that one's duplicate
cannot be one's self---back to statements about your atoms.
Of course, one man's conclusion may be another man's starting
point (to make non-sexists wordplay on "poison").

At this point I can only appeal to your imagining that
you grew up in a world where people ordinarily teleported.
Say that teleportation had been discovered long before
people knew that there were atoms.  Then it would seem
like any other kind of abrupt movement.  Now, if they
had fully become accustomed to teleportation, can you
really imagine that this would supply ammunition against
the atomic theory?

Yes, you are right.  But our feelings of who we are can be
strongly affected by SF, we are not so all-rational as we
sometimes think, and thoughts are indeed affected by 
feelings.  I urge you to read (if you are not already)
Rafal's posts on the balance and interplay of multiple
agents in our minds.  (Marvin Minsky's book "The Society
of Minds" is very valuable in unhinging our notions that
we have a *truly* integrated self, but so do most books
on neuroscience.  Especially effective (hence disturbing)
is also Ramachandran's Phantoms in the Brain:  Probing
the Mysteries of the Human Mind  -- V. S. Ramachandran
& Blakeslee.) 

As Rafal explains, we believe that our view of identity
correctly encompasses all the relevant thought-experiments
and overrides the "simple-self" directive.

I don't understand.  To me, the mere fact that you *might* be
yet suffer in no untoward way whatsoever powerfully suggests
that it is irrelevant to personal identity (i.e. survival).

I mentioned a space warp;  I'm sure that you would not find it
absolutely impossible if such a device were announced the day
after tomorrow---we (especially on this list) are accustomed 
to believing many impossible things before breakfast each
morning!  ;-)

Well, this of course has to go back to the relevance of atoms.
I found it quite significant that you agreed with the idea that
perhaps you are being replaced every millisecond by a picosecond
replacement of all your atoms.  Perhaps I overreacted to this
concession above.  You do understand that from the point of view
of physics precisely the *same* events unfold; all your neurons
fire just in the same way, all your thoughts develop in exactly
the same way, and so on.

In any discussion with you, absolutely no difference would obtain,
nor would any physical measurement at all be any different (unless
it got down to the picosecond event---but no matter, make it a
10^-100 event).  Now if there is *no difference* from the standpoint
of physics, just what is it that has suddenly gone?

It seems to me that it is a vestige of a soul.  I write about this
at http://www.leecorbin.com/LastRefuge.html

Yes, but (1) if the foregoing arguments dispense with the
relevance of atoms, and (2) you could have radically 
different experiences if the lights suddenly go out
in your house, then it follows that your criterion
here isn't adequate to refute the more general notion
of survival.

I did the old punched holes in paper trick
and was astounded.  Truly this is the best
optical illusion I have ever seen.

Many years ago I had a minor epiphany while
in training for the ministry.  Having discovered
Darwin, it occurred to me that there were
serious anomalies in the theory I had been taught,
some profound logical tension, or cognitive
dissonance, as we liked to call it.

I was pondering these matters one day in
church when the minister called the children
forth for a story.  He gathered them around
an overhead projector and placed upon it a
viewgraph of the common optical illusion with
the two equal length line segments, the upper
one being made to appear longer by inverted
arrow heads.  He asked the children which
line was longer.  They chorused the top one.
He stated that they were mistaken, that in fact
the lines were equal.  They were fooled, he
explained, by an optical illusion.

The kicker is that because of the image
distortion inherent in overhead projectors,
*the top line really was longer*!  The kids
were right.

So then he showed them another similar
optical illusion and asked the same question,
at which time the children chorused in perfect
agreement that the line segments were the
same length.  The pastor congratulated them
on their astute observation, and sent them
back to their pews.  They were wrong the
second time of course, for again the overhead
projector had made lines of unequal length.

That odd little episode led to the epiphany
that I was just like the trusting children.
I was forced to sadly conclude that my entire
religious belief system was an intentionally
distorted image, merely an optical illusion.
With that epiphany, all the pieces fell into
place.  Cognitive dissonance gave way to
cognitive resonance.  I became an engineer
instead.

Thats my story, boys and girls.

I still get 1-2 a day.  Members of the Sask Nutraceutical Network have
been asked if they want their emails removed from the site because of
these scam letters.
However, the moral of this story still is -  if you want 5 million for a
service many lawyers and institutions do for thousands your greed is
indeed going to be your downfall.

I would have said that  the only way to shut these guys down would be to
send them a killer virus in the form of an antivirus trojan horse,
something that would upload the contents of their hard drive  as it
re-formats it.

The site mentioned is a quite effective anti-scam tool as well as a good

Yes. It is the color constancy system that is fooling us. Our
subjective visual model of the world is quite different from
the objective spectral input - our brains are constantly
adjusting color and brightness estimates based on light
conditions, shadows and expectations. A red book still looks
red when it is in shadow or moved around against a colored
background - but that is largely due to us knowing it won't
change color and that it "really" is read; change the
conditions so that our knowledge doesn't apply (like looking
through a small tube so that you don't know what you are
looking at) and the color is changed. A grey sky is acually
almost as white as a sheet of paper, but experienced as dark
due to our knowledge of what a sky should look like.  And a
shadowed checker square looks bright due to the contrast from
surrounding squares and adjusted for the effect of the shadow.

But you don't answer the question. It was something that I didn't thought
of before: does a stock options scheme a la dot com make a business kind
of socialist, or not? If yes, did it evolve in a dictatorship? (obvious
jokes about Bush deleted.. :-))

And, about the constant "Germany, Russia, Italy" that is repeated in every
post, I'm not informed enough for the first two, but Mussolini was soon
expelled from the socialist party because of his pro-war, pro-absolutist
views. He then proceeded to start his own Fascist party, with the results
that we know.

Ciao,

Bzzt. Machine vision SHRDLU driving a robot arm or virtuality version of

After you've figured out identity in SHRDLU world completely, you can 
tackle the issues of how an upload is being created. 

SHRDLUworld is trivial. The whole problem is not, that's why I'm proposing 
starting with a model first.

It's no travel, it's a backup. It only looks like a teleport if the
scenery changes, which typically occurs when I'm looking outside into
physical reality, and the servo gets scragged, or self-terminates due to
connectivity outage. In artifical reality I can resume at the same input
frame, with no subjective discontinuity, not even a flicker.

If there's a gap, even a long one, there is no problem (I would still kick
some admin ass because there was a contract violation, because I'm resumed
in a world which has moved on, which can become a big problem if the
change has been considerable). If I have time to think "SHI.."  then there
is definitely a problem. If you get killed painlessly and instantly, and a
former version of you continues on you still get killed.

A perceivable fork is always bad, and the longer it gets, the worse. Would 
I have forked as a baby, you'd have two people which are not even remotely 
similiar.

No. It's sure easier to die painlessly and instantly than to go screaming 
and cursing a blue streak, but it's still dying.

Let's agree to disagree here. I might grow sufficiently fatalistic some 
day to allow forks and their termination to occur. But not now.

Surviving ends as the fork prong gets terminated. 

This conversation is academic, anyway, because if we make it to the upload 
it will be via a destructive scan postmortem, so there's no fork. Let's 
talk about it again when we meet in the virtualscape.

As the same part of the brain is used for seeing contrast and judging speed 
(cant remember the name of said squishy part, but I know its damn small) It 
makes me wonder whether an optical illusion using this principle can be used 
for slowing down speeding drivers?
       I have seen research that says people speed in bad weather due to a 
distorted sense of speed caused by the lack of contrast created by fog, etc.
I'm thinking along the lines of somehow gradually increasing the contrast of 
road markings, the road surface or something in order to instil a false sense 
of excess speed in a driver in normal conditions. maybe a trick with false 
shadows on the road surface?
       The obvious would be lines across the road that get closer together. 
I'm not sure this would a be great idea though, most drivers would be stopped

There are some 2^20 possible sequences: 1,048,576.  Quite a few of those 
have at least five heads.  There are 2^15 possible sequences without the 
spacings you mentioned already heads.  If you assign the value zero for 
tails and one for heads the average value of the number formed from the 
sequence as a post-radix expansion is one half.  For example, the list 
of the possible sequences has 2^15 permutations, in binary:

.00000000000000000000 = 0
...
.11111111111111111111 = 1- 1/(2^15)

Now, these are among the 2^20 possible sequences, of those, 2^15 have 
those heads in those particular locations in the sequence of twenty, 
there are 2^5-1 other sequences of five coins with those locations each 
with 2^15 other elements of the sequence of 20.

So, a guess at this point, 50% + 1/(2^5), or, 53.125 percent.  That's 
only a guess, though.

Now, this is where you are expecting for twenty coins, on average, ten 
heads and ten tails.  If five are heads then of the other fifteen are 
expected five more heads and ten tails, with there thus being a 
probability of 2/3 or 67%, er, 66.6^_%.  Yet, that is of an unordered 
sequence.

"Is there a simple general formula for calculating the probability that 
any given other coinflip came up tails?"

For any one of the fifteen locations, the probability would be equal, so 
a general formula for determining the first non-sampled coin will 
suffice.  Well, hmm, I wonder here if the biased sampling would 
determine the first non-sampled coin to be more likely to be tails.  
Anyways.

In this case, let's say we want to know the probability of the second 
coin being tails.  Lorrey has a point about it being fifty percent, the 
probability of any fair cointoss being tails.  Out of the twenty coin 
tosses, where when the five known coins are heads then there are 2^15 
permutations for the other fifteen, half begin with a head and the other 
half with a tail.

Another thing to consider is how many of the set permutations of twenty 
have at least five heads.  Most of them do.  I forget the formula, it's 
something with factorial.  I don't recall.  Let's see, with three coins, 
eight set permutations, the number of permutations with all three being 
heads is 1 of 8, let's see, three permutations have two heads and three 
two tails, and one zero heads.  For four coins, having sixteen 
combinations:

4	1
3	4
2	6
1	4
0	1

For five, of thirty-two:

5	1
4	5
3	10
2	10
1	5
0	1

For twenty coins then it looks like:
h	c
20	1
19	20
18	19+18+17+16+15+14+13+12+11+10+9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1= 9*20+10 = 190
17	18+17+... = 8*19 + (17+16+...= 7*18+9 = 135) + (16+15
16
15
14
13
12
11
10
9	=c(11)
8	=c(12)
7	=c(13)
6	=c(14)
5	=c(15)
4	=c(16)
3	=c(17)
2	=c(18)
1	20=c(19)
0	1

I wrote the above and then read Lee Crocker's explanation which seemed 
very good.  I forgot the factorial form, surprisingly I minored in 
statistics.  Now, I have been reading the other replies, and can see why 
it would be 2/3, as noted above.  I could also see why it would be very 
little less than 2/3, there is a probability that five or more coins are 
heads out of twenty that is much greater than not.

What I like to wonder about are infinite sequences of fair cointosses.

I argue that the answer is that we should treat all the
copies/dupes/forks/etc. as if they acted as a single moral entity.  I
don't want to base my argument on the claim that they all *are* a single
entity, actual or otherwise, but rather I just want to show that we should
treat them all like this.

Of course, if you think that all of the entities *are* a single
individual, then you'll have no trouble believing that the individual
should be treated as a single moral entity.  My argument is trivial in
that special case; it's a harder fit if you're in the group that doubts
that multiple copy entities are a single individual.  Thus it will be
towards this latter group that I'll direct my argument.

If, like some here, you think that there's nothing more interesting about
the relationship between you and a copy than there is about the
relationship between you and your identical genetic twin, then you'll see
my argument as something akin to the claim that we should treat these
special "families" of individuals the way many tribes treat other tribes:
the sin of an individual foreign tribe-member is the sin of his entire
tribe, and vice versa.

Now, we don't normally like such arguments in the modern day.  Nowadays we
are mostly opposed to punishing an entire tribe (an entire country?) for
the crimes of one of its members.  So why should we take this argument any
more seriously in the case of copies?

The answer, I think, lies in the fact that people could *choose* to make
copies of themselves.  To the extent that this is possible, we wouldn't
want to let people get away with forking off a copy to do something that
they don't want to be held accountable for, then reaping the benefits of
their forked copy without paying any penalty.  The reason for this has
nothing per se to do with personal accountability, but everything to do
with incentives and consequences: if people knew they could make copies
and use their copies to get away with Bad Things [tm], then we must expect
people to do this more than they might otherwise.

Consider the worst case scenario in a system in which copies are not
responsible for each others' actions: suppose my fork and I walk into a
room with a victim; one of us murders the victim brutally, leaving no
witnesses.  Suppose we're brought to trial, one by one, and our attorney
argues: "Look, you can't punish my client, because in each case there's a
reasonable doubt [50% is plenty reasonable!] that he did not commit the
crime."  In that case, supposing that I were the sort of person who would
kill somebody if I thought I would suffer no consequences, I'd be
incentivized to bring about a situation like this: I'd benefit greatly
from creating copies as plausible alibis, which could thereby prevent
either copy from being punishable under the law.

This is an obvious radical failure of legacy legal guidelines to handle a
case brought about by new technology... maybe it's so obvious that it
doesn't need mentioning.  But the point stands that something similar
*would* happen if we had *any* system in which copies aren't responsible
for each other's behavior, even if people considering whether or not to
fork *knew* that one of their tines would wind up paying the price for his
crimes, rather than my disaster scenario in which neither branch pays the
price.  I say: some people wouldn't care; so long as they kind of get away
with it, they'd do it in a heartbeat.

Now, you may think that it would be a *big mistake* to split, allowing
just one of your splits to suffer the painful consequences of his actions
while the others benefit, but even so, it's a "mistake" that you would
expect a rather large number of people to make.  There's also the
not-to-be-overlooked point that the system would *incentivize* making this
"mistake", so long as copies would not be held accountable for each
other's actions.

So, if by having a moral/legal rule that says that we shouldn't hold
originals/dupes/etc responsible for the actions of their fellows, we
therefore have a system which incentivizes criminal behavior, then we
shouldn't have that moral/legal rule at all.  Instead, we ought to close
off that incentive by making copies responsible for each other's actions,
regardless of their metaphysical/ontological relationship.

That makes no sense to me, unless you are prepared to argue that each of the
forks lacks free-will to choose for themselves the proper and legal course
of action in a given situation.

People can already choose to make children. Those children are responsible
for their own actions after they reach legal age. Similarly, a fork "born"
of legal age would decide for himself whether or not to do your bidding. If
you coerced him to act unlawfully then you would be guilty of extortion or
worse.

Surely each adult person should be considered a free and independent agent,
regardless of origin (fork or womb). Our entire system of justice is based
on this principle.

But that is the best case scenario!

In a free society no person should be punished for another person's crimes!

The administration of justice will be more difficult after the advent of
forking, but both the prosecution *and* the defense will encounter similar
problems. I think these are just some of the many new challenges we'll face
when the time comes.

Hi Extropes,

Not to minimise the differences between what people actually see as
desirable goals, I think the biggest challenge in realizing many peoples
desire to move to better futures, to be part of a better society, to
accelerate the singularity, or whatever you like, is the lack of a practical
plan, let alone an optimal plan, for getting from here to there.

As a group of polymathic types I wonder if you'd be interested in a sort of
though experiment aimed at brainstorming the steps involved in founding a
virtual country.

We live in a world of sovereign countries. UN membership is exclusive to
sovereign countries. Individual persons have no corresponding
meta-organisation they can join, yet a virtual country comprised of
individual citizens who had specifically opted in, could, it seems to me,
become a potent source for good whilst also benefiting it's citizens.

We have a global financial system but we don't have a global society to
underpin it. Which is ironic because capitalism or even the security to
trade and the confidence to invest and build for the long term requires the
sort of security that only a strong democracy can provide. But it seems
national democracies are currently being undermined. When politicians on
electoral cycles of three of four years struggle for votes in a world where
voters are concerned by jobs and innovation is making jobs harder to come
by. Multinational corps (to be successful) need to get into the business of
regime shopping just as politicians to protect the interests of their
constituents need to make deals to create jobs. But national democracies as
currently structured can pose substantive blocks to the emergence of an
international democracy. Its hard to set up Greek city states in 2002,
perhaps a virtual country is the way to make some new creative space.

It is difficult to manage global systems that effect us all such as the
environment, or to give teeth to international human rights, let alone
transhuman ones. The US, imo, for all its flaws is probably the best working
democracy in the world at present - its constitution and bill of rights seem
to set the standard for the protection of the rights of the individual - but
it limits these rights to its own citizens. If you don't happen to be a US
citizen you don't get to vote for Bush or Gore etc, but you do get to wear a
portion of the consequences.

I've heard it argued that democracies are usually pretty good at voting
themselves money, and perhaps this is a key part of what makes them stable,
but if this has been true in the past, it is showing signs of being less
true in the future. Money in modern democracies leaks. People cling to the
right to a job like galley slaves cling to their rights to an oar, when, if
AI come along, or even if it doesn't, it is going to make almost all jobs
redundant (ala Han's Moravec's Robot from memory), so the smart thing to be
defending is not ones job but ones vote.

If you are a wealthy US citizen, and the same applies to other western
countries, you can avoid paying substantial amounts of tax with the
assistance of good tax advice. And this is not necessarily an immoral
action. A person that legally avoid paying say US$1m in taxes may still
choose to redirect that same amount of money to he/she see as truly
benefiting the public good either in or outside their native country.

Within all existing countries there are constitutions, forms of government,
rights and responsibilities accepted by citizens. Its hard to find physical
space to found new countries as the land is already possessed but why should
a country, be bounded by land? At some point with a  land purchase perhaps
the virtual country could become a sovereign country, setting up laws less
paternalistic. Cryonics for instance might be allowed as a matter of
routine. A stream lines version of the FDA could enable individuals to
assume greater share of responsibility for making  informed choices and
trying experimental medicines in the context of absolute rather than
relative medical risk etc. And eventually a virtual  country whose citizens
leveraged the skills and capabilities of each other in preference in their
contracts and trade would become wealthy. If  they paid tax to a virtual
government (duly elected) that government could eventually buy land. Once
the virtual country was seeded and had citizens. Those citizens could also
perhaps set up more traditional political parties in existing countries.

Different existing countries have different feelings about dual citizenship,
I understand the US requires one to revoke other citizenships, however, this
need not be a show stopper, contract law alone may be enough to build a
layer of optional citizenry atop one's national obligations. Extropian or
extropian like lawyers, tax experts, investment advisors, researchers could
probably outcompete most comers on merit in a straight contest. Perhaps they
may not be so good at organisation and implementation - I'm still wondering
about that.

The founding would need to be a bootstrap operation. Countries are not born
instantaneously in their full complexity. Perhaps it might kick off  by
putting together a set of core values or tenets (perhaps like the extropian
prinicples perhaps not), a sort of "declaration of transcendence" might be
structured by contemporary Jefferson's, Adamses and Franklins.

An important basic question to ask and answer would be who would be allowed
to join (those who agree to adhere to the tenets), would there be any poll
tax to do any administrating. And the core question one should ask and have
answered - what's in it for me why should I join?

It would seem that crucial is the recognition that rights and
responsibilities are intimately coupled, the country should not assert
rights for its citizens that it cannot underwrite with commensurate
responsibilities accepted by its citizens. This is a key difference I think
between many existing countries founded on notions that human rights can
exist without human responsibility existing to underwrite them. i.e.. No god
given rights unless god becomes a citizen and as a consequence we can be
sure we have the wherewithal not just the will to underwrite them.

Anyway, that's enough of a gas baggy start, my questions are what would be
the best way, the key engineering principles if you like of founding a
virtual country, what would be the key blocks that people see, does anyone
see merit in the idea of working out in crude blueprint form how to set such
up?

PS: Sorry about the verbosity, I often write long stuff and don't post it,
cause I haven't the time to clean it up, sometimes I think good content
doesn't get sent because I over self censor, maybe my inhibitions are well
founded - I'll accommodate feedback on this point as well.

Regards,

Brett

I found this story about the restructuring of the tree of life
such that hyperthermophiles aren't at the base any more quite
interesting.  It adds some mystery as to where and when life began.

Alfio,
       How long before the founding of the Italian Communist Party were 
Italian communists active in Italy?  Where did they gather -- an outsider 
might assume they got together in the various socialist groups?
       I am told the Libertarian Party in this country was founded in the 
late 60 or early 70s but I can assure you libertarians were getting together 
long before that.
       I am saying there is usually a period of fermentation preceding a 
formal organization.  How long was yours given that socialism goes back a 
good 120 years before 1921 and communism goes back at least 70 years before 
that date.
       Second, I understood you to say the communist kicked Mussolini out.  
Am I wrong?  How did they kick him out before they came into existence?

The Italian communist party was founded only in 1921.

Mussolini was kicked out from the Socialist party in 1914, after a sudden
change from a non-interventist position to a pro-war one. The new
organization set up by him (the Fascist party before, and the dictatorship
after) was, and still is, on the far right of the political spectrum.
(I realize that right and left have different meanings here compared to
the US).

Saying that Mussolini has anything to do with socialism, or leftism in
general, is a big distorsion of the truth. Yes, he milited for a while in
the Socialist (not communist) party. After that, he went on the other side
and never looked back.

Ciao,
Alfio

Great thread!

My first thought regarding your idea is that one function of such a 
country, short of founding traditional politcal parties in existing 
countries, is to function as a lobby in many countries.  A group that 
lobbied for, say, legalized stem cell research in western countries, or 
boosted funding for NASA and such.

My second thought is that virtual nations exist in a manner today.  The 
example that comes to mind is the Scientologists.  They are a group with a 
strong bureacracy, taxation/membership dues, an internal legal system and 
international lobby power.  Another example would be the Roman Catholic 
Church.  In essence, any religion with an organized bureacracy is a 
virtual nation.

I would certainly support an extropian virtual nation, assuming that it 
indeed grows through the bootstrapping you mentioned.  My suggestion for 
an initial step is to create it as a political lobby in an existing nation 
like the US or UK.  This would give a quick return on investment for 
members and would not require the sort of contractual binding that would 
probably turn people off in the beginning.

Is it voting stock?  Then yes.  That's giving the workers some control 
over the means of production.  An interesting question would be what 
percentage of the voting stock was controlled by the workers.  And what 
about retired workers?  I have previously run into people who called 
themselves socialists (I'm still working without a real definition) that 
believed in just this approach.  But they ran into problems when the 
current workers owned a minority of the stock.  They couldn't decide 
whether or not that was legitimately socialist.  My real problem comes 
in when some people control large blocks of stock, but a consumer's coop 
that I saw where everyone got one vote, no matter how many shares of 
stock they bought, ran into trouble when some smooth-talking outsiders 
each bought one share of stock, and then talked most of the members (who 
weren't paying much attention) into some ill-advised business decisions. 
 (Over expansion, etc.  The same things that later got the dot coms in 
trouble.)
Perhaps it would be better to have some more direct relationship between 
the amount of current participation, and the number of votes, but you 
don't want to let any one block become too dominant, either.  My 
favorite variant gives people one vote per share of stock per year of 
holding the stock.  So if you hold your share of stock for two years, it 
gives you two votes, but if you sell it to someone else, it reverts to 
zero votes.  That should keep out the speculators, anyway.  Or at least 
discourage them.  It will mean that the stock it held for 1) long term 
profit and 2) political advantage within the group.  But you would need 
to be dedicated to the group to reap the political advantage.
Another thought is to have the initial round of stock be issued to the 
creators, in proportion to their contribution.  Thereafter have the 
stock be issued at one share per year (but not "or fraction thereof") to 
the workers (including management).  This would tend to make the stock 
decrease in value.  But it could be sold (though not otherwise 
encumbered... got to be careful here.  Can't allow votes to be 
contracted for.)  This idea is still quite half-baked, and probably 
won't get any more well done, as I don't intend to implement it.

Ah... Socialism.  Which, if any, of these schemes is socialist?  I have 
an idea of what fair means.  It means that all parties to an agreement 
believe that they are better off agreeing than not agreeing, and that 
nobody is taking advantage of a dominant position to impose onerous 
constraints on others.  But I still don't know what socialism means... 
Though we seem to be getting a lot closer, once governments were dropped 
from the loop.

I'm not arguing that at all.  (Or, rather, I don't have to argue that.)
Instead, I'm arguing that if we abide by this principle, we should expect
malicious copy-sets to be able to get away with murder and other worse
crimes; the legal/moral rules would become practically unenforcable on
these sets.

Now, with that said, you can still stick to your guns here, and argue that
moral autonomy should imply legal individuality.  But I think it's pretty
obvious that this particular moral law would rapidly lead to chaos in the
streets.  At a minimum, no one could expect their debts to be repaid, as
long as the debtor might do something "crazy" and replace himself with an
unaccountable copy set.  But the greatest threat would come from
suicide-murderers.

Of course, in principle, we live in *some* threat of this happening now:
aren't we always at the trivial risk that debtors might kill themselves,
that every murderer will just commit suicide, etc?  Yes, but what makes
this debt managable is that such actions are rare, and that, after it
happens, there are fewer people in the world who would act this way.  But
there's good reason to think that in a world of copy-sets, such actions
would happen a *lot*, and people who did it would *multiply*.

This is not because you are wrong and copy-sets really *are* all one
person, but because many copy-sets would *act* as if they were.  Just look
around you; a non-trivial fraction of this group seems to think that their
copy-sets would all be one person.  A significant fraction of this group
thinks that their view will become the norm if and when copy-sets become
part of our everyday affairs.  Regardless of whether you agree with their
philosophical viewpoint, I think you must take seriously the fact that
many many people could come to believe it, and that, for such groups, any
one of them would, say, become a suicide bomber without hesitation, if
they didn't have any other independent moral reason not to do this.

So, in order to maintain some semblance of order in a society in which
duplication is easy, you'll *have* to prevent this activity somehow; I
think the answer has to be to enforce crimes on entire copy-sets, rather
than on individual copies.  If we don't do this, we'll soon be swamped by
a majority populace upon whom our system of law is unenforcable.

I realize that this flies in the face of a well-accepted moral rule (if
you take a certain side of an ongoing philosophical debate).  But the
consequences would be too disasterous to ignore in this case.  It'd take
an excessively naive anti-pragmatism to cling to the rule in the face of
consequences of the kind we'd expect if nobody could enforce laws on
copy-sets.

Children take years to develop.  They are also substantially more likely
to diverge from the opinions and behaviors of their parents than copies
are to diverge from each other.  They're also considerably less likely
than copy-sets to commit suicide for their "family" members.

It would be no coercion.  Imagine an insane serial murderer who made a
copy of himself whenever he intended to kill someone; he'd kill his
victim, then kill himself.

I suppose you'd argue that there'd be nothing morally correct to do to
prevent this from happening over and over and over: the killer would have
been automatically brought to justice, you might argue, every time the
crime was committed.  But the fact of the matter is that it would just
keep happening, over and over and over again.  (Imagine if he made himself
a whole army!)  How would you prevent this?  Or would you?

I realize that, but we'd still have to throw it out.

You might think of this like those old philosophical examples in which you
must choose between rejecting a cherished moral rule or else aliens will
blow up the planet or whatever.  Here, I think the choice is just as
stark.

I realize how important this principle is, but we have to throw it away if

Oh?  Can you give an example?  It seems to me that defense will be

Lee Corbin,

I think I understand the reason you cannot seem to see things as I do (and
as others like Eugene do). It seems that I am looking at the forking problem
consistently from a completely objective "bird's eye view," while you are
not.

Allow me to explain with an illustration:

1) You, Lee, are a friend of someone named Bob.

2) Unbeknownst to you, Bob is considering a forking procedure.

3) You have lunch with Bob before he departs on his secret journey to visit
a reputable fork-master in a nearby town.

4) You reason that after Bob's forking there are now two people of relevance
in the nearby town. (Let us call them Bob-A and Bob-B.)

5) You reason [correctly] that if Bob-A returns to your town to visit you,
you will have no way to know anything happened to Bob. Bob-A will appear to
be the same Bob you've always known..

6) Similarly, you reason [correctly] that if Bob-B returns to visit you, you
will have no way to know anything happened to Bob. Bob-B will appear to be
the same Bob you've always known.

7) You reflect upon 5) and 6) and conclude [incorrectly] that Bob-A and
Bob-B must have the same identity.

If you read the above very carefully, you'll see that your perspective on
the problem changes midstream. In 1) through 3) you have no knowledge of
Bob's impending forking procedure. In 4) through 6) you suddenly take the
all-knowing bird's eye view. And here is the real problem: in 5) and 6) you
think of yourself as having the unwitting non-bird's eye view when in fact
you are thinking and reasoning as one with the all-knowing bird's eye view.

Assuming you really believe what you are saying to us, I think your
confusion is due to a shifting of your perspectives similar to that which I
describe above. If you take the bird's eye view throughout the *entire*
problem, (as I and Eugene do); that is if you and your thought-experiment
references to yourself all have knowledge of Bob's forking, then you cannot
fail to realize that Bob-A and Bob-B are similar only in the way that
identical twins are similar. Each of them has his own distinct experience of
life and thus also his own cognitive processes, personality and identity.

It's true that a witness ignorant about the fork would not reach this
conclusion (at least not without meeting both Bob-A and Bob-B at once), but
we here on this discussion list are not ignorant about the fork. We can and
should see the problem from a bird's eye view.

Yes. The communist party was the result of a minority splitting out from
the socialist party, because of their different views.

I said that the Socialist party kicked him out. Seven years later, when

extreme right.

Hmmm.. combining this with the "workers who own the means of production"
socialist view,  it follows that a socialist society is a particular case
of a capitalist society, one where everyone is self-employed (or have at
least a slice of the property) and not just a consumer. Or is it getting
ridiculous? :-) Is this some kind of peace treaty that you and Charlie
can sign? :-)

Now there's an original idea: serial murder-suicide!  That's exactly
the kind of thing that makes the moral issues unclear.  I suppose one
could treat that legally as a murder-for-hire, where the "payment" to
the dup was your act of creating him.

I would analyze this question in two parts, corresponding to our civil
and criminal laws.  The first part asks how our voluntary relationships
are affected by copying, and the second asks about our mandatory ones.

My perspective will be purely pragmatic: what system will be the most
convenient and lead to the greatest quality of life for all concerned.
Philosophical issues of identity will play no consideration whatsoever.
I trust that the recent discussion will have made clear why this approach
is advantageous and in fact mandatory.

In terms of civil laws, if you take on an obligation and make a copy,
is it bound by the obligation?  If not, then you could escape your
obligation by making a copy and then killing yourself.  If so, then
your copy would have its freedom of action circumscribed; it could
not go off to Mars, because the original might at any time suffer a
mishap and then the copy would be obligated to perform in your place.
Neither of these is desirable.

In some cases, a failure to perform can be resolved monetarily.  If the
original dies, his estate doesn't all go to the copy, but it must first
pay a penalty to the person who was owed  performance.  This allows the
copy to have freedom of action, without the original being able to escape
from the obligation.

Given the variety of situations which can occur, ideally the issue can
be resolved on a case by case basis, at the time the contract is made.
The minimum requirement has to be that it is possible for the original
to *voluntarily* create a copy who is bound by some obligation.  Just as
a person can bind himself with a contract, he has to be able to bind his
copy at the instant of its birth.  This allows both solutions above to
be explored and used, as circumstances dictate.

If we don't allow for this kind of copy creation, it will be too easy
for people to escape obligations, and either copy creation will be
illegal, or else no one will be able to bind themselves with contracts.
I think allowing the creation of obligated copies is the lesser of all
these evils.

In the case of criminal justice, some of the same considerations apply.
A person could break the law, create a copy and then kill himself.  If
we don't hold the copy liable, many people will adopt this method to
avoid justice and we will live in a dangerous and lawless society.

And there are new considerations in this case which make it harder.
Suppose the original doesn't kill himself, but ends up going to prison.
If the copy still goes free, then some potential criminals will see this
as lessening the chance of being punished, thereby leading to more crime.

Also, what if the original makes a copy, and then one of them goes on to
commit the crime?  That's not so different from the case where they commit
the crime and then make the copy.  If the intention and plan to commit the
crime was fully developed, then the copy made, then the plan carried out,
the one who did not commit the crime still carries some guilt for the
overall procedure.  If he is not punished then, again, some criminals will
see this as a way of avoiding consequences.

But at the other extreme, if someone makes a copy, then one of them
decides to commit a crime, but the decision was made after the copy,
then it seems wrong to hold the innocent one responsible for the crime.

Given these considerations, here is what I see as the pragmatic and
practical approach.  Let's take the easiest case first: someone commits a
crime; shortly afterwards, they make a copy; and shortly after that they
are caught (both them and the copy, or only the survivor if one of them
is dead).  In that case I think both should be punished.  Each arguably
shares culpability for the crime; each remembers committing it.
And unless we punish both of them, we are going to encourage more
criminal actions.

Now let's take the case where the copy occurs before the crime.
In that case, the issue should be whether the intention to commit the
crime was in place before the copy occured.  This will depend on the
facts of the case.  We already have a distinction between premeditation
and spur of the moment crimes in the case of murder in the first and
second degree.  The legal system is able to grapple with the question
of at what point a person formed the intention to commit the crime.
Where a copy was made, evidence must be gathered to show whether there
was intention before making the copy.  This will determine whether the
copy is held responsible.

Granted, this will not be easy, and in some cases, guilty copies will be
set free because there was no overt evidence that the plan was conceived
before the copy was made.  That's the penalty we pay for a society
where we are innocent until proven guilty.  In practice, if we see a
lot of cases where criminals "just happen" to create copies shortly
before committing their crimes, juries will tend to be more skeptical
of whether the copy was innocent.  There will be a certain amount of
feedback in the system if it starts to be abused.

We might draw an analogy to the crime of conspiracy, where it takes a
plan to commit a crime, plus a single overt act in furtherance of the
plan, to constitute conspiracy.  The copy could be said to be guilty
of conspiracy, if at least a single overt act in furtherance of the
planned crime occured before the copy was made.

In speaking of punishment here, I am talking about physical coercion
like prison terms, probation, even capital punishment.  If the crime is
punished only by a monetary fine, should it be doubled in the case where
a guilty copy exists?  I'd be inclined to leave that up to the judge.
A person's assets are not increased by making a copy, so a single fine
would still be as significant a penalty; but their earning power is
doubled, so over time they could afford a doubled fine.  It might depend
on the timing between when the crime occured, the copy was created,
and the criminal(s) caught.

Summing up, for voluntarily relationships we should encourage voluntary
solutions, where people simply state what they will do in advance, when
the contract is made.  This does require having the option of binding
a copy to follow a contracted agreement as a condition of the copy's
creation.  For criminal actions, we should punish copies if they have
a past history (including the history of the original before the copy
was made) of committing the crime, or of taking some explicity step in
furtherance of a plan to commit the crime.  This is necessary because
otherwise many people will see the creation of copies as a loophole that
allows them to commit crimes without consequences, or with a lessened
chance of being punished.

Interesting question. I really think we should listen to our
lawyers here, since I think there are already useful tools in the
legal toolkit to handle problems like this. But in the meantime,
let's play lawyer:

I think a practical solution is to view copies as belonging to a
new category similar to familyhood, but even closer. Me and my
copy are in many ways more close than me and my brother. Lets
call this relationship a copyhood. Today everybody forms a
copyhood of one - themselves and nobody else. Tomorrow some
people will have a copyhood of several persons. 

Laws and contracts can be adapted by specifying whether they
relate to somebody as an individual person or a copyhood. If we
base our thinking on the traditional humanistic liberal rights
perspective most of the traditional rights will apply to each
member of a copyhood since they are closely tied to the view of
humans as having individual consciousness etc.  The copyhood
would be more like a family or a company. I think especially the
later is an useful legal tool to adjust the system. If copies are
regarded as members of a company jointly owned by the copyhood
(created by the act of making a copy), then a lot of the issues
about obligations can be handled. If copy A dies without paying a
debt, that debt can be transferred to the copyhood. 

It is also possible to leave a copyhood legally. After that point
the individual is to be regarded as an independent person. Debts
and obligations have to be resolved beforehand (or it won't be a
legal divorce), and the relevant part of the copyhood's assets
has to be paid to the leaving member. 

Marriage will likely be an issue for each religion. But legally
we seem to be moving (slowly) towards legislation allowing more
arbitrary partnerships. I guess some countries might say that
marriages automatically exists between copyhoods, and others say
that it is between people - if I copy myself Me1, Me2 and my wife
have to re-register the partnership as having a new structure 
(the first marriage is annulled, and then a new three-person 
partnership is registered). No doubt there is a lot of potential 
here for messy divorces...

If two copies commit a crime together and then blame each other,
there are standard laws to deal with that (depends on which
country you are in), no need to give them special status because
they are copies. A more interesting problem might be if part of a
copyhood commits a crime and another part doesn't know or doesn't
agree; in this case it would be like a company where part of the
company commits a crime and likely the legally logical answer is
to hold the owners (the entire copyhood) responsible, although
again there are legal systems about where the crime stops (if an
employee or owner of company X kills somebody it is not viewed as
a crime by the company). 

It seems like a rich legal field with plenty of material for
interesting posthuman courtroom dramas. 

"Yes, I admit it! I lied to protect 03! 05 and 17 told me that if 
I didn't help them cover up, they would blame me too! But nobody 
of us did it. It was our wife! All of her!"

Why do the socialists do this?  As a capitalist I observe your vicious and 
bloody wars over the minutia of your beliefs and wonder what it is all about. 
 I was totally mystified reading the history of the rivalries within the 
socialist movement.  During your moment in power in National Socialist 
Germany the biggest war seemed to between the National Socialists and the 
other branches of the socialist movement.  The very term Nazis seems to have 
been a deliberate intended insult from other socialists that was never used 
by the National Socialists themselves.
       Take Trotsky, he couldn't even leave Russia and hide out in Russia.  
The socialists killed the man.
       Consider Hitler and Mussolini.  I doubt the war was over before 
socialists were trying to redefine them as "right wing."  Perhaps they were 
right wing within the socialist movement but they certainly were not right 
wing in the general sense of the word.
       Consider the following scenarios.  Did Hitler and Mussolini first make 
billions in the stock market and then enter politics?  Did they first gain 
fame as immensely wealthy and successful industrialists?  Or did they come 
into power as socialist thugs turned rabble rousers?
       I think I will use Occams razor and stick with the first history I 
received on Mussolini.

I don't see how this would result in an increase in the murder rate.
Statistically the situation would be identical to that of catching a serial
murderer who did not suicide after each murder. And it would be easier to
apprehend such an insane murder-suicide killer because we would know exactly
what he looked like.

The only difference might be in how we investigate and prosecute: unless we
caught a copy in the act of murder before he suicided, we would be forced to
gather evidence and charge the apprehended copy with intent to commit murder
(since only his past suicided copies actually commited murders). The laws
would simply need be modified to make the penalty for such a serial murder
scheme as stiff as they are for conventional cases of serial murder. The
last copy would hang.

By the way, Dan, my answer to you below is also an excellent illustration of
my argument that self/personality/identity changes continuously. To my way
of thinking there is no difference, philosophically, between the suicidal
repeat-copy serial murderer you describe and a conventional serial murderer.
A conventional serial murderer's personality "suicides" and is reborn in
slightly different form with each passing moment.

I have 3 Problems with that:

1) Science can no more tell the difference between one hydrogen atom and
another than it can detect a change when a priest claims to have turned it
into the body and blood of Christ, so how can identical things give us
individuality?

2) Individual atoms do not have a unique history so how can they give us a
unique history.

3) You don't tell us how long a "moment" is, all time frames are equally
valid but you're saying some are more equal than others.

I don't get it, you take that as a given and make deductions from there but

True, and that's the point.

No, but it would be reason not to care if you did.

If you've been destroyed and put together a thousand times a second from the
day you were born and you feel fine then why are you going to start worrying
about it now?

Einstein did not really ride on a beam of light either, it's a thought
experiment. I can not prove it did or did not happen because there are no
objective consequences and you can't prove even to yourself that it did or
did not happen because there are no subjective consequences. In other words
it is of no consequence. We've said what we think the subjective effect of
this experiment would be, none, but you have not said what it would be like
to be the copy, all you'll say is it's a different person but tell me what
it would be like to be the copy.

Easy. My eyes ears and hands are on Tokyo connected by a fiber optic line to
my brain in a vat in Wichita Kansas and John Clark is in Tokyo. Somebody
moves a toggle switch and I'm on a different line and zap, I'm in Paris. If
something as abstract as consciousness can even be said to have a position
it's where the senses are not where the brain is.

Spam only works because so few people actually replies to them. If a 
spammer sent out a million mails and got 100.000 replies, and only 2000 
of those where actually real answers, then he needed to shift through 
the remaining 98.000 manually to decide whether they where relevant to 
him or not, I am pretty shure that spamming would soon stop.

All we need is an expert system that can reply for us. Something like an 
advanced Eliza session.

A "Respam" button.

We should be able to just push the "Respam" button on our mail client, 
which would then generate an answer for us.

The answer should seem interrested in the content of the spam, and ask 
for more information. But should never promise anything.

When the scammer then replies to that mail, we hit the "Respam" button 
one more time. And so forth.

I think this would actually work, as most of us have an evil streak that 
would find pleasure in this approach ;-)

Step down. Who are you talking about with "your"? For the record, I don't
consider myself socialist, capitalist or whatever else. I don't seem to
match labels quite well. And in discussions with you, I pointed out some
factual errors that you made and gave some random thoughts about the
discussion. Nothing worthy heating up.

>Why do the socialist do this?

What's "this"? The expulsion of Mussolini? It's like a prominent member of
the Green party started out of the blue advocating dumping used nuclear
fuel on the nearest beach. Would he remain a member of the party for long?
The political blood pressure was also quite higher than now.

More or less correct

He found himself agains Stalin, not the best enemy to have :-) After
having been expelled from Russia in 1929, he went to various European
nations and then to Mexico, where he was killed by a Stalinist agent.

I don't know if the term "right wing" was in use, but since the first
years of fascist power, they and the socialist party were on the opposite
sides of the political spectrum.

The problem is the different meaning of the word "right". Here, Mussolini
and the following Fascist party are more or less the definition of "right
wing". The same can be said for Hitler and Nazism in Germany. Big capital
and industry support may be an aspect of right wing-ness, but it's not
required in Europe. And the extreme right wing is more the territory of
street bullies and football fans.

Sorry, I'm just trying to give some informations. I'm a lot nearer, you
know :-) The previous discussion about "right wing" is an example of the
distorsions that can be introduced looking at Europe history with an US
background, and of course the contrary.

"I've been thinking about this problem since you first mentioned it to me a
few days ago, Michael. I would have answered except that your message was
downloaded onto another computer of mine (I've been out of town since then,
working on another of my computers). I planned to answer it the next time I
returned to my other computer so that I could quote your original properly 
(sorry I've been too lazy to pull it from the web archives :-)"

No Problem GTS, I admit I was curious to know what you thought of it.

"Here for now is my brief and tentative answer: First of all I think the
conundrum you pose is not real in the way you think it is. We need to
remember that the universe is quantized *only in relation to an observer*."

Is that true?  Isnt this a fundamental issue of knowing how the universe
actually exists without guesses about it?  Most practicing scientists feel
that there is an objective truth out there somewhere, and we are continually
getting closer and closer at describing it.  If time exists at no smaller
interval than the Planck time, then are you saying it only exists at no
smaller interval because observers can see no smaller interval?  Or does
there truly exist no smaller interval?  

Is this the same as the quantized nature of space at the Planck length?  As
a particle moves through space, if space is quantized, then it can not be a
smooth continuous flow, and that particle must jump from one spot to the
next in minute quantum tunneling events.  One could envision the
quantization of space as a giant grid where a particle can only exist in one
grid square at a time, and not part in one and part in the other.  If it is
moving, to move it must disappear from one square and re-appear in the next.
Is this grid the same for all particles?  Similarly, as a particle moves
through time, it can only exist at time intervals that are even multiples of
the Planck length of time.  Is this 'time grid' the same for all particles?
If that is the case, then all particles, as they move through time, must
disappear from one time grid square to appear in the next.  If all particles
are synchronized, then all of them must disappear simultaneously.  If they
are not, then some would disappear while others would not.  It seems that if
the latter where the case, we should be able to observe the quantization of
time (in theory at least) if the former were the case, we could not since
all of our instruments would disappear at the same time.  If quantum theory
predicts that time is quantized, and we can observe that quantization, then
each particle must not be in the same grid, correct?  Or I could just be
rambling incoherently.

You say that the universe is quantized only in relation to an observer, does
that mean in an absolute sense, it is not quantized?  I was under the
impression that observed or not, space and time are quantized, their
dimensions being the Planck length and Planck time, respectively.  

If it is not quantized in an absolute sense, then it must be smooth and
continuous, and our observations must be quantized.  If that were the case,
I certainly *would not* teleport anywhere in any short amount of time.

"I think then that we must look at things from the perspective of the
subject being teleported. The teleportation subject is the
observer/experimenter. Given the proper measurement instruments, the
subject's experience of the world would be quantized according to Planck's
constant, including his experience of time."
AND
"I do not believe it correct to state that "the entire universe is destroyed
and recreated simultaneously," because this option makes no account of an
observer, but of your two choices above I believe this is the more accurate
description. Due to the central role of the observer, one could say that
*his* entire measured universe is quantized, lock in step."

How can he observe the quantization of time, if his observation instruments
are also undergoing the same quantization?  I would think that if one could
observe it, then all particles must not be in sync, but I must admit my
knowledge is hugely limited in this subject.  Any related sites or
experiments anyone know to shed light on this?

Again, if that is the case, if all matter is in sync as it progresses
through time, I would not object to a spatial teleportation that took place
at a time interval of the Planck length of time.

"So we put Damien under general anesthesia, disassemble him atom by atom,
then reassemble 2 copies, each of which has half of the original Damien's
atoms.  So they are both "copies" but would seem to equally have Damien's
"identity".  When they both come out of it, how could they *not* view
themselves subjectively as the continuation of the original?"

I am not disputing that both would view themselves as subjective
continuations of Damien's Identity, I am saying that even though they
believe they are, they are not.  In your example, half of damiens original
atoms were used for one copy and half for the other copy, what was the
intermediary state of these atoms?  If they were removed from the original
reference damien, they were in one instant part of the pattern that made up
the one damien and in the next not part of that pattern.  Were they
collected into a pile of atoms, and then used as raw materials to construct
the two copies?  If that is the case, the original pattern made up of the
original group of atoms was at some point completely destroyed, thus there
would be no continuation of the subjective experience of the original
reference Damien.  Or so my argument goes...

Your question confuses what I have been trying to argue, I have not argued
that the atoms themselves hold some mysterious 'piece' of damiens
conscioussness and that is why a copy is not him, I only worked backward
from the result of my oft quoted thought experiment.  If we copied damien,
he and his copy would not experience the same subjective events, thus the
copy of him is not a subjective continuation of him.  If that were the
result of this experiment (which I believe it reasonable to assume it would
be, because if it were not *that* would imply a mysterious magical
connection) Then I ask, why is that the case?  I say it is because the
original Damien was comprised of both a pattern and a group of atoms that
made up that pattern, and the vast majority of that group of atoms was
present in the same pattern that made up damien the instant before, thus he
was a continuation of the previous one.

"This is silly. There is no point in oversampling your system as the

Your copy may assert up and down that he is a subjective continuation of the
reference original, but unless your copy and you experience the same thing,
he can not by definition be a subjective continuation. Do you contend that
because we believe something to be true that it must be true? He is a
different, distinct individual.  You walked into a passive atomic level
scanner, he walked out of an atomic assembly chamber.  You are looking
north, he is looking south, you see clouds, he sees a clear blue sky.  You
are different people, if he can not see what you see, then he can not be a
continuation of your subjective consciousness, he must be a copy of it that
is now moving along his own time space line.

"I don't know what this 'consciousness' thing is."

You do not have to know what it is to realize that a copy and you do not
share the same subjective experience, and thus he can not be a continuation
of your subjective consciousness.  

 I'm a process. A sequence of pattern frames. Subjectively, it doesn't
matter how many instances of the same process they are. In reality I would
prefer to have more instances of me, because real processes can be
terminated, and they have the potential to bifurcate, thus creating more
individuals (which I would have to split my infrastructure with, though, so
one shouldn't overdo it)."

Nothing I have said precludes copying, it just suggest that logically, that
copy is not you, but is a copy of you.  This makes him no less valuable as
an individual, and no less a person.  

> majority of the things that make up your pattern were part of the same

"Huh?"

This would be why I keep having to say the same things over and over again,
most people do not apparently read my arguments.  

Briefly, Consider this thought experiment.  I walk into a scanner, I am
copied, me and my copy walk out.  My copy can not see what I see, and I can
not see what he sees.  If he can not see what I see, he can not be a
continuation of my subjective experiences.  If this is the result of the
experiment, that he can not see what I see, then I ask 'why' is that the
case.  He has the same pattern as me.  The only difference I see is that he
has different atoms.  But we know that any individual atom has no unique
property over another atom, *except* its location.  The atoms he is made up
of are part of his pattern, the atoms I am made up of are part of my
pattern.  So far so good.  But why is he not a subjective continuation of
me?  His pattern is made of atoms, and so is mine?  Well my pattern was made
of the same atoms at the previous instant that they are made of this
instant.  His atoms, in the previous instant, were a homogenous pile of
CHNOPS and a few minerals.  If the result is that he does not see what I see
and thus is not a subjective continuation, then given the factors I just
mentioned, the *only* explanation present for this is to maintain subjective
continuity one requires the same pattern and the same atoms.  (that is, the
vast majority of the pattern remains from one instant to the next, and the
vast majority of atoms remains from one instant to the next)  Given that,
please point out what you consider to be logically invalid in this argument.
This is, of course, on the condition that said experiment turns out the way
I guess it would, I have no reason to suspect logically otherwise.

"I wonder why I've broken my resolve to not participate in such threads. "

Of course it is because you find my arguments so compelling (joke)

"OK I will ask. If the you two are really identical you will answer my
question in synchronization if you are not then you will not."

So to be identical you must mean we have to be experiencing the same
subjective events, for that to be the case we would have to take up the same
space at the same time, which is impossible.  If we are in separate places,
we must be different entities.  If we do not experience what the other
experiences, then one can not be a subjective continuation of the other,
thus he is not the other.

 >Since my copy can not share the same  subjective experiences as me [...]

"I thought that's what you were trying to prove."

I don't know what to suggest here except to read what I am actually saying
instead of, perhaps, what you think I am saying.  Everything I am arguing is
based on the outcome of this thought experiment.  If you copy me and my copy
and I do not experience the same thing, he *can not* be a continuation of
me.  As I have said, I do not know this is how this experiment would turn
out, but if it turned out any other way, *that* would suggest the existence
of a magical entity that connected us.  If you think the copy and the
reference would experience the same thing, that of course would contradict
my arguments.  Please see my post to Eugen just before this one for my
explanation of why I draw the conclusions I do from this thought experiment.

 > is obvious it is a different individual entity with its own experiences.

"Not obvious at all IF THE TWO ARE REALLY IDENTICAL, so please don't come
back with stuff about them seeing different things because then they would
no longer be the same." 

Honestly I have never cared if semantically they were 'the same' (see my
previous discussion on what we mean by 'the same') I care if one of them is
a continuation of me.  It is reasonable to conclude that the copy is not a
subjective continuation of me (if the thought experiment turns out the way I
predict) because he and I do not share the same subjective experiences.

"As I've said nineteen dozen times when they start to see different things
they will diverge and that's why I don't want my
backup older than a second or two."

I do not doubt they see different things, the fact that they do *proves* my
point, that they MUST be different entities, and that a copy *can not* be a
continuation of me.  How can you assert that he sees different things AND is
a continuation of you if you were not destroyed?

    >Thus a copy is not me.

"But you may be the copy and if I were to prove that you are is there any
reason to be the slightest bit upset about it? I can't think of one."

No, unless I found that the original was destroyed in the process.  I know
that I dread destruction, so I would be reasonably sure that the reference
that I am a copy of from a few moments before also dreaded destruction, thus
I would mourn his loss.

Tell me, if you were in a room full of copies made very recently (a few
seconds) and you killed 10 of them, would you feel like you killed 10
people?  Or 1 person?  What if they were a week old?  A year?

>Is it not reasonable to agree on definitions before we attempt to make

"No I don't believe it is , definitions are vastly overrated, examples are
much more important. You've "defined" death in such an odd way that it's
entirely possible that John Clark is already "dead" thus I have little use
for your word and don't care if I'm "alive" or "dead". Do you really have a
problem with the simple idea that if you think you have survived then you
have?"

You do not believe that definitions are important when arguing?  What if we
were arguing if farmouzabala was vitchilimi?  Would you not want a
definition of both farmouzagbala and vitchilimi?  Well we are arguing if a
copy is you, shouldn't we also define 'copy' and 'you' to come to a
meaningfull resolution?

Yes it's true according to the standard interpretation of QM.

A photon for example is a single quanta of light. We can infer from
certain experiments that light behaves in a continuous non-quantized
manner until it is observed/measured, at which time it appears to our
instruments as quantized particles. The energy of a photon is a function
of Planck's constant. 

This is true not only for light but also for all other forms of
electromagnetic radiation, and indeed for all forms of matter including
massive particles like protons and neutrons.

Like light, time is continuous when we are not measuring it. It is
however meaningless to speak of units of time smaller than the planck
time, which is the time needed for a photon to travel one planck length.
It is meaningless to speak of shorter durations of time because the
quantum states of measured objects in the universe cannot change in less
than a unit of planck time. 

For example, if it were possible to take two consecutive measurements of
the position of a single particle in less than a unit of planck time,
the particle would appear in the same position in both measurements. It
would be as though the clock stopped during the interval between your
two measurements.

Right.

Why not? 

Your experience of life is what counts, and upon close inspection your
experience of life is quantized. Your eyes, for example, are designed by
nature to detect photons and signal their presence to your brain. Under
the right conditions even a single photon can be detected by the naked
eye.

As I wrote above, it is though the clock stops for intervals shorter
than one planck time. I think that interval would be the perfect
opportunity to teleport. The teleported version of you would be
identical to the original version of you with respect to every quantum
state. You could be assured then that your experience would continue
seamlessly.

The xoxes believe they are Damien, to me (and presumably you) they both
look and behave as Damien looks and behaves.  Who is "truthteller" that
says "these xoxen are not Damien".

yes (at least when I was making up the example, that was what I was thinking).

There is no continuation of the "subjective experience" because we knocked
Damien out with halothane before we disassembled him.  Its little different
from going to sleep one night and waking up the next morning having had
your bed relocated by a bunch of pranksters while you were catching your Z's.

That's good because if you were making that claim you would be off in the
Penrose camp and we generally slowly roast such individuals here...

It sounds like you are saying everyone that has an operation involving
general anesthesia wakes up with a different identity.  (I.e. you are
put to sleep in one place and you wake up someplace else with a "gap"
in your subjective experience.)

Now, what is the difference between that situation (in which I assume
you are going to "claim" identity is maintained) and a situation in
which (a) while you are lying alone, post-surgery, sedated, in your
private room, the blue people enter your room, disassemble all of your
atoms (carefully keeping track of each atom), then reassemble you with
all of your atoms in a different location (i.e. you get all the C's back
where the C's belong but it is a different C from the original C that was
in that location); and (b) while you are lying alone, post-surgery, sedated,
in your private room, the blue people enter your room, disassemble all of your
atoms (carefully keeping track of each atom), then reassemble you with
all of your atoms back in its *original* location.  (The blue people were
having a slow day, so they can afford to waste some time playing with your
"subjective experience" this way. [1])

This term "continuation" isn't clear to me.  I would argue that if you capture
the "pattern" and provide a "reasonable" shift between frames of reference
(environments) that "Damien" is still "Damien" even if we have two "Damiens".
If the atoms are important, then uploading will certainly involve a change
in "identity" since the same atoms are unlikely to be involved in the
different substrates.  Obviously people can handle the "shift" from 10:00 PM
one evening to 7:00 AM the next morning.  They also seem to be able to handle
the shift from being put under general anesthesia until they wake up
and even being in a coma for a number of years (though this is rare).
It raises some interesting issues regarding cryonic suspension as to
whether a person can retain an identity when the down time in their
subjective experience may be 30-100 years or more, particularly in light
of the accelerating changes one might expect from the singularity.

But you seem to be precluding "reintegration".  If you have a married
couple and view them as an "integrated" unit, then they may often
have separate experiences, which they relate in stories to each other.
A very closely coupled couple with good communication skills may be
able to effectively "recreate" the experiences of their partner within
their own "identity".

With memory sharing technologies (which I expect to be available long
before uploading) then it is perfectly reasonable to allow for a
"reintegration" of separate experiences.  So while copies may diverge,
they can easily remerge.  Can you claim then that they have separate
identities?

Don't you think the ExI list would be so much more interesting if there
were two or three xoxes of me monitoring it, taking arbitrary positions
on various topics and interjecting repartee from time to time?  Every
Sunday we could reintegrate and become "one" again.

Robert

I've been lobbying for legalised stem cell research in Oz. GMO and gene
therapies are other hot issues. There are many issues that a group of
educated and motivated individuals with a common set of values could
accelerate by being organised without opposing in any harmful way existing
western democracies. But this is a long way down the track. The hard part is
getting started I think. Intelligent individuals are frequently not joiners
or if they do join they join very focussed causes. They are usually capable
of functioning well even within the limits of the existing systems. And they
are, I think reticent, to buy into the baggage that comes with being part of
a group, where fellow group members say and do things that do not want to be

I am reminded of Mike Moore's April fools day joke about an extropian
church. Whilst I can see where you are coming from, neither the
scientiologists nor the catholic church have two of the principal components
I'd see as crucial. Something like a democratic structure or an intention to
move to a democratic structure at some time once the basics have been worked
out would differentiate this virtual country/democracy from the above
institutions. The other component I'd see as important is a commitment to
pan-critical rationalism. Faith and religion would be tolerated but as faith
and religion proceed from the basis of assumptions that cannot be shared or
explored universally they ultimately turn out to be anti-social and I'd
expect people would eventually grow out of them.

Unless rights and responsibilities whether these additional ones turned out
to be were placed in some form of contract/formal agreement I think they'd
be meaningless. Contracts do require a home juristiction (say the state of
california or something) and thereby become part of  an existing countries
legal framework, however, contracts can also build in a requirement for
pre-judicial mitigation, which courts will usually honor. I expect the
sanctions for failing to honor ones contractul obligation to ones fellow
citizens might simply be expulsion from the virtual country or suspension.

But way before any of this can take place common values need to be
articulated along with a vision to draw people together. I think a first
point is a something like a declaration of transcendence - wrong name but
the drift is there.  When the "founding fathers" got together to draft the
declaration and the constitution they were already delegates of extablished
states. Perhaps "founding fathers" need to be sourced from the extropian
movement, maybe from civil libertarians movements and a bunch of others that
can agree on similar values.

What kindred movements might currently exist that have like constituencies
already?

I am treating this just as an intellectual exercise but one that might be of
use at some point.

If we adopt this view, then we're still on the road to ruin.  Again,
consider the serial suicide-murderer.  Suppose the murderer (with the
intent to kill) spawns a copy, who then legally leaves the copyhood,
[perhaps he'd have to file a statement or something,] commits a
murder, and kills himself.

If we took the copy's "leaving the copyhood" seriously in a court of law,
then I don't see how we could hold the copyhood responsible for the copy's
actions.

I therefore conclude that we ought *not* to permit leaving the copyhood;
that we ought to treat the entire copyhood as a single moral entity.

The spammers have already thought of this.  Most of
the ads require the customer to call a phone number

Not if you are an adjective and not a noun, not if you are the way
matter reacts when it is organized in certain complex ways,
then there is no reason you would even have a unique position.

 Of course you do, you already said that you don't know if you were taken
apart and copied last night so the subjective outcome must be zero otherwise
you could tell.

As I said before in most cases they would see different things but it
certainly wouldn't violate the laws of physics for it to happen, just place
them an equal distance from the center of a symmetrical room or place them
in the same virtual environment.

   >It is reasonable to conclude that the copy is not a subjective

That's what I'm trying to get out of you, exactly what do you predict? Just
saying they are "different" is not good enough, what is the difference, get
into the mind of the copy and tell me about his memories and what it's like
to be him. Does the copy's opinion of his own survival mean nothing to you?

  > I do not doubt they see different things,

You should doubt it, especially  if the copy is only a millisecond old.

If there were at least 11 in the room and I destroyed 10 bodies then I

I'd much rather have you point to a farmouzagbala, after all in the real

Yes, that's quite clear.  As you suggest, it's merely a question
of extending the range of contracts.  There are a few harder things
about contracts covering duplicates, but I don't think that they're
insurmountable.

Of course.  It also has a great deal to do with the memories
of entities at various moments, and even more to do with 
intentions.  But what puzzles me is that the clearest and
best laws always steer clear of intentions.

That does seem correct, but determining the exact instant in which
such a decision is made is probably at least NP-complete  ;-)
Suppose I've been carrying a grudge against Mr. X, and I know
that if I go into a certain bar, then perhaps I'll lose my
temper, get into a fight with X, and kill him.  Knowing that
this might occur, I might make a copy for a number of reasons,
(this being one I'm only partly conscious of).  Sure enough,
some one of me wanders into that bar sooner or later and kills
X.  But that's not so bad; I live on in my duplicates.

Worse, I don't even know X, but just happen to have made a large
number of duplicates for a big programming project.  Any one of
them may realize that forfeiting his life isn't such a big deal,
and that the project will continue (perhaps new duplicates will
be made) anyway.  It may develop that all close duplicates must
pay for a crime, otherwise, a quick suicide of the guilty xox
is too easy an out.

Whether they remember it or not doesn't necessarily matter.  In
the future one may have enough control over one's memories that
one can be restored to prior state, and it will turn out (I have
predicted) that to punish someone in this state is exactly 
physically identical to punishing a duplicate that was in
no way involved.

We therefore have yet another reason to hold accountable all
close duplicates.

Yes.  This is a corrective to some other posters who wondered
what would happen if two duplicates were in the same room when
a crime was committed.  We already have this case:  when two
ordinary people, usually friends, are together when a crime is
committed, then it doesn't work for each to plead that he cannot
personally be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  If it

Yes.  But I predict that it will come to be necessary to deter
all close duplicates (like a single person is deterred) because
intent and motivation are too hard to determine.  Yes, this is
a little like punishing a whole village for the misdeeds of
single partisans, but I doubt that anything else will work.

Amazing.  I think that it is *you* who don't take the God's eye
point of view, i.e., consider an objective view from on-high;
a "bird's eye view", if you will.

Okay, so I have no idea that Bob is off getting duplicated.

Yes, I won't be aware of the A-B situation.

Well, isn't that a tautology?  Remember, I don't know that any
forking has occurred.

Huh?  I didn't know!  (Pre-reading didn't help!  That was still a jolt.)

Oh, yes, yes.  That's elementary.  No, that's not the "mistake"
I'm making.  The issue is infinitely more difficult than this!

In the first place, you and Eugen are at entirely different
levels in my hierarchy.  There are two or three operations
to which Eugen accedes that you do not.  He will teleport,
and finds backups entirely suitable.  In other words, if
*you* walk into a backup facility and stare at your
(metaphorically) frozen backup, you'll say "That's not me!".
But Eugen has stated that backups are fine, provided that they
get no run time *prior* to the deanimation of his primary.
(Just why it matters so much when they get run time is
of course the whole problem with *time* that causes many of
us to disagree.  Eugen is now saying that the idea only makes
him uncomfortable now, but he may get used to it later.)

So which level of my hierarchy are you on?  Do you agree to
teleport where information is sent and different atoms used?

> We can and should see the problem from a bird's eye view.

Oh, absolutely.  A bird's eye view comes closest to an
objective physical description.  You see, from an objective
physics description, your duplicate is just as much you as
you are.  It's when you allow this truth into your heart
(i.e. your intuition) then you can shake off the non-objective
view looking out of your own skull towards your duplicate,
saying "he's not me!", and rise to the bird's eye view.

Now just from physics, at the instant of duplication, there
are no important differences between the two of you.  Neither
has something that the other is missing.  In addition to it
being totally dark inside the chamber the original may also
have been moved a few feet by space-warp so that neither
has the slightest bit of different information.  Anywhere.

Why do you suppose that your subjective experience only occurs
in one particular one of them?  Is our physics incomplete in
some way?  Or do you have an unconscious belief in soul that
you haven't yet fully expurgated?

Why exactly does the history of an atom matter?  You have agreed that
if just one of your atoms was instantly replaced by reservoir atom,
that would be okay with you.  How do you think that you would feel 
if 10^15 of them were exchanged?   What about 10^24?  (That's supposed
to be about 1cc's worth.)  And I'm still amazed that you would feel
sorry for the rest of us if you found out that we were being replaced
every millisecond in a picosecond long operation which swapped out
all our atoms!

Okay, see above.

For the more difficult case, you should adopt my alterations to your
experiment in which the original is shifted a few feet, the room is
blacked out, and both the original and the copy find themselves
symmetrically facing the door.

This is a difficult question.  I have found few definite guides
as to when definitions are important.  One is when the number of
semantic links is large and they relate on a more emotional level.
The classic example is "abortion is murder".  One has to argue
over what is meant by "murder" or allow the anti-abortionists
to score a winning touchdown.

Now I say that you can't just go define words like 'copy' and
'you' and it is preposterous to even try.  Suppose that you
succeeded.  What would then arise is that both parties would
go right on using the words the way that they'd always used
them.  We aren't logic machines, you know.

Ya hafta use a whole lot of common words to get your meaning
across.  Words are like ball-bearings on a skating rink:
to get anywhere to you have to tread carefully and be
especially wary of putting too much weight on any one
of them.

Attempting a rigid, totally logic-driven analysis is a complete
exercise in futility.  You and John, for example, both know 
quite well the kinds of scenarios "copies" occur in.  I suggest
you refer to those scenarios.  Although you know what "you" means
in some contexts, e.g., this sentence, that term can be ambiguous;
that's why the terms "original" and "duplicate" are used---it
refers to mechanical processes well understood in terms of 
effect.

Forget subjective assertion and see this in form of SHRDLUworld discrete
system trajectory (state frames continuously dumped to storage).

Your observer stuff makes you all confused. Dump the observer use a 
measurement. Dump QM, dump atoms. Look at synchronized discrete system 
state evolution. Frame your experiment in terms of that system.

The tires are smoking, yet the car goes nowhere. Get rid of mysticism, 
address the issue in SHRDLUworld. See you there.

Most new nation schemes are just idle pipedreams or somewhat
suspect economic ventures. The virtual nation idea mentioned
earlier in this thread is far more realistic. Not that virtual
nations have any pull per se, but witness the growth of prestige
and power of NGOs the last decade. Probably the smart thing to do
is to work to create an international NGO with our values, plenty
of credibility and money. 

Something like the WTA on par with Amnesty or Greenpeace would be
far more efficient at enabling and promoting what we strive for
than any number of freedomships and oceanias. It would also require
far less initial capital and uncertain political/legal issues. But
it would require a very dedicated core of ambitious people willing
to give all to bring about a great organisation. The organisation
would be their careers (and that may be the greatest problem with
organisations - preventing them from becoming vehicles of
propagating themselves rather than their or their leaders' goals).
Building and maintaining something like this is not trivial. But it
is good training if you want to try to build a real nation.

No. Space is unlabeled. If you have no system noise and are fully 
deterministic it's sufficient to provide the same input. If you have 
system noise and are nondeterministic you can still be forced by 
subjecting you evolution constraints (trajectory forcing). Effects of 
trajectory forcing result in both systems evolving along the same lines 
regardless of input, which for spatially distinct systems is equivalent to 
shared hallucination, or selective agnosia.

You're wrong. Go look up my synchronized deterministic system evolution 
post (which no one commented on, so I've failed to make a point).

I think anything larger would necessarily start with an NGO,
internationally, or even nationally. I imagine most western countries would
have similar legal structures for non-profit NGOs as we have in Australia
for incorporated societies and associations and that therefore the NGO
structures would be grounded in a legislative framework and a particular
jurisdiction.

Agreed. But how do the numbers of extropians and transhumanists compare with
the numbers of members in Amnesty and Greenpeace I wonder and if the former
are far fewer why is that? Is it that the objectives of amnesty (freeing
political prisoners and speaking out against torture) and Greenpeace
(championing "the environment") simpler and easier to grasp than the
objectives of extropians and transhumanists which include but are not
limited to improved quality of life and longevity? Is it that these
organisation have been running longer?

I guess my thought is that brainstorming "engineering principles" takes
little capital and is a necessary precursor to building a construct
efficiently and effectively. Would you think that a great organisation is
more likely to emerge organically without being designed and that attempts
to distill optimal design principles to save time and effort are futile?

Yes. This does seem to be a substantial problem. Nixon would seem to be one
example of at first a modern failure but latter perhaps of the checks and
balances build into the US structure proving their worth. Free press.
Separate legislature. Adversarial political parties.

How could you know that? How can we rule out a top down approach where
perhaps a number of existing successful NGO's are brought together to bud
off something close to a real nation in one complicated but orchestrated
move?

When before, in the history of the world, has it been possible to say
without chicanery to rich and poor alike that a better standard of living is
possible for all. Technologically the imminent wherewithal to radically
extend life, creates an opportunity to offer something to the rich that they
do not have, provided we can get the societal mechanisms commensurate with
existant and emergent technological ones. The incentive to cooperation seems
to have never been greater. Whether we are the "last mortal generation" or
"first immortal" depends on our organisational capabilities IMO.

If you look through the list archives you will see it is a recurring
theme on this list. Targets include building artificial islands on
international water, buying islands or regions in third world nations,
setting up space colonies and similar projects. Usually followed by my 
response "get real" :-)

It might be, or it might exist in other forms (like a formally informal 
network of local organisations and chapters). Your mention of the CoS is 
a good example of a international organisation where much effort seems 
to have gone into making its internal money- and power-flows insulated 
from outside legal interests. Many of the most successful NGOs seem to 
be more for-profit than non-profit, which is worth thinking about.

Yes and yes. There is also a feedback effect: Amnesty and Greenpeace
promote certain ideas about open societies and the environment, which
makes society more willing to both implement them and to support the
organisation. So far we have not bootstrapped transhumanism to the same
extent. To get to the state where we could even start something like
this we will need more people participating in the mainstream debate,
seeding transhumanist ideas and discourses among the intellectual 
networks. It is probably less efficient to first start an organisation 
and try to affect things than to first affect things so that there is 
ample members, interest and money for the organisation.

I am a firm believer in spontaneous order, but usually the spontaneous 
order has to be created by someone :-) What I mean is that organic 
emergence of organisations is an enormously powerful process where 
different approaches can compete and interact, allowing the best to grow 
and learn from the failures of the others. But each organisation in this 
soup of hopeful institutionlets is the creation of somebody. I don't 
know if there are optimal design principles that work for organisations 
(my hunch is that they only work if you have clear and simple goals), 
but it might be worth a try.

The problem exists in other organisations too - cliques of researchers
or executives promoting each other, environmentalist groups becoming 
more interested in media stunts than the environment, aid organisations 
growing into bureaucratic amoebas and so on. We can learn a lot from 
political theory here. I think the open society is a good ideal for an 
organisation: internal transparency, freedom to criticise, 
accountability and so on.

I distrust top down approaches for ill-defined problems. If it was a
project to engineer a space station with a self-contained ecosystem for
Mars travel I would trust this kind of orchestration - there is a single
goal (maybe different views on why to achieve it), there are clear ways
of figuring out who to do what and so on. But societies aren't machines 
and they are not solutions to any particular problem. They are the 
result of what humans think and do. 

Just getting a lot of people who roughly agree together is hard enough,
and experience from all those utopian commune experiments in the US and
elsewhere shows that once the initial ideological fervor and enthusiasm 
wear off the society tends to crumble - it has no reason to exist beyond 
the ideological goal. A far more likely situation would be for a number 
of NGOs to step in to help run a region with pre-existing inhabitants 
with their own views. Here the issue instead would be to convince 
everybody to work together and get along despite very different views 
and interests. Lots of data in studies of aid organisations successes 
and failures here.

Hmm, while I like the tone of this pep-talk, I think the problem is that 
you assume the rich are the most important factor. Sure, they have money 
and usually influence, but without the support of entire societies you 
will not get enough funding and markets to support any move towards 
transhumanity. In order to demonstrate our doubtless limitless 
organisational capabilities :-) we need to demonstrate our cultural 
capabilities. If we can show people that we are approaching a 
cooperation revolution where a great deal of desirable, practical and 
moral achievements are possible, then we are going to get the social 
mechanisms we need to support this.

The problem with your assumption is that you consider the law as 
something unchanging that will not adapt to new situations. If the above 
situation becomes a problem, laws will adapt. It might even be that the 
first case gets away with it, but hardly the second. Legal systems tend 
to patch themselves without throwing away basic principles. 

[ At least here in Sweden the above situation might be resolved
medically rather than legally. Since the copy behaved in a suicidal
manner, there is more than enough reason to deduce that the other copy
might suffer from the same condition, and that is enough to have him
committed for evaluation. The current rules on taking people into
custody to prevent them from possibly harming themselves are rather
frightening... ]

Another aspect worth thinking of: the technology necessary to produce
copies implies very complete brain scanning. It is likely that this
would enable truth machines or memory audits. While such technology
might or might not be allowed in everyday interaction, it seems likely
it would be regarded as admissible evidence in such a future court. 
Hence the issue of whether the leaving-murder-suicide was premeditated
or not could be resolved.

Even after a million years? Even after my copy underwent a religious 
conversion? Even after my other copy got orbitofrontal brain damage and 
couldn't control his impulses?

Alertness pill seeks wider uses
http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99992981

A drug designed to help people with a particular sleep disorder to stay 
awake could soon be licensed to perk up sleepy shift workers and others 
affected by drowsiness. The prospect is stirring up a debate about the 
dangers of popping a pill to counter a sleep-deprived lifestyle.

If the unwitting witness met with both forks at once and surveyed their

by the differences in personality between them (differences which could
be very subtle or very apparent depending on the passage of time and
events). How would he account for the differences in personality, Lee,
except by acknowledging that the two are in reality different people
with different non-nominal identities?

The idea behind the Planck length is that as the wavelength of light gets
smaller its energy gets larger but according to Einstein energy is just
another form of mass ( E = MC^2) so at some point it is so small and so
energetic it becomes a black hole. The Planck time is the time it takes
light to travel the Planck time, and it doesn't make sense to talk about
smaller things, that might or might not change when somebody finds 
a quantum theory of gravity.

Lee,

1) Bob gets forked into Bob1 and Bob2.
2) Jack, a friend of Bob's, has no knowledge that his old friend Bob has
forked into Bob1 and Bob2.
3) Bob1 visits Jack on the day after the forking. Jack cannot, by any
means possible, determine that his old friend Bob has forked.
4) Then along comes Bob2, who joins Jack and Bob1 at lunch.
5)"Strange," says Jack, "I thought there was only one Bob!"
6) Bob1 and Bob2 both say they think they are the same Bob Jack has
always known.
7) "Maybe so," says Jack, "But I suspect you two are nevertheless
different people. Allow me to conduct a thorough survey of your
personalities."
8) Jack then tests both versions of Bob with an exhaustive set of
personality tests. Among them is a simple test of food preferences. All
tests show Bob1 and Bob2 to be identical, except for the food preference
test. For some reason Bob1 rates pizza significantly higher than Bob2.
Bob1 rates pizza 7 on a scale of 1 to 10, while Bob2 rates it only 4 on
a scale of 1 to 10.
9) "Strange," says Jack, "you two appear to be exactly the same person,
except that Bob1 likes pizza a lot better than Bob2. I wonder how that
can be!"
10) "Oh!" exclaims Bob1, "I guess I should mention here that I stopped
for pizza on the way home from the fork-master clinic. It was the best
darned pizza I ever had! I'm definitely going back for more next time I
get a chance."
11) Jack then concludes rightly that Bob1 and Bob2 are not the same
identity after all, even if they are very similar. He realizes it would
be absurd to consider them to have the same non-nominal identity,
because when Bob1 refers to himself as "I" or "me" he is referring to
someone who rates pizza as a 7, and when Bob2 refers to himself as "I"
or "me" he is referring to someone who rates pizza as a 4. Small those
this difference may be, it is nevertheless true that Bob1's and Bob2's
ideas of self have different referents.
12) Jack then wonders why it is so hard to explain this to his friend
Lee Corbin.

### Actually, I intend quite seriously to buy a private island. If you go to
http://www.privateislandsonline.com/islandsforsale.htm, or
http://www.vladi-private-islands.de/home_e.html, you will find a large
number of very interesting pieces of real estate. My dream is a 30 to
100-acre island the Northeastern US (unfortunately, the lovely islands in
British Columbia are off limits to me as a cryonicist), which should not
cost more than 200k.

If you know about any nice and cheap islands for sale, let me know. I'll
give you honorary citizenship :-)

GTS, I don't see why, even if bob1 and bob2 both rated pizza as seven, that
is still wouldn't be reasonable to consider them separate.  There are *two*
of them after all.  Even if two sub atomic particles are identical, there is
still two of them.  One on my right, and one on my left.  Even if Bob1 and
Bob2 were perfectly identical in every test of personality and makeup, there
are still *two* of them.  Simple as that.  Even if one were to imagine that
their individual personalities remainined in stasis since forking, thus not
creating more differentiating personalities with time, there is still no
good reason NOT to consider them two seperate people.

### Yes, of course! Workers' cooperatives where a stake has to be bought are
the perfect example of a functional socialist idea. Interestingly enough,
they are also an example of a viable capitalist entity, since the means of
production are controlled by a free market mechanism, the very essence of
capitalism.

Which brings me to a couple of glib characterizations: Socialism works only
insofar as it overlaps with capitalism. Capitalism is honest mainly where it
intersects with socialism.

Libertarianism is the multidimensional manifold formed by the intersection
of socialism and capitalism. It works, and it is good.

### Sounds like the description of the ideal free market (before the
emergence of monopolies). Isn't socialism just a slightly misguided type of
libertarianism?

### You seem to be unwilling to change your frame of reference. Anything
that doesn't fit in must be insane. Just like a 1980's word processor you
cannot analyze data in a graphical format. You say: "Fatal exception at
034A3". Yet, graphical data does exist. Change your frame of reference.

Remember, I am not saying that there is an objective way of identifying
identity. My participation in this whole thread is about convincing you that
identity is subjective, and is a matter of personal choice, along with the
highly complex perceptions of "self" vs. "other". I don't want you to
blindly accept my frame of reference, merely to accept that not everything
outside your frame must be "irrational", or "insane".

### I am glad you make this distinction. You are on the way to joining me
and Lee here.

Let's continue the experiment. I/we synchronize the functioning of the
parietal cortex observer-centered maps in both skulls, using the composite
visual input from both sets of eyes. Both of us start perceiving ourselves
as situated in the same place (so much for those who say "Two persons can't
occupy the same space at the same time"). In fact, looking in a mirror, each
one would see our two bodies, located *away* from the subjective location
encoded in our parietal cortices. At the same time either one of us would
still be able to objectively describe the physical aspects of this
situation, that is, the location of the bodies, but our point of reference
for our "selves" would be located elsewhere - at the overlap of "self" and
"other".

The closer you get to the prefrontal cortex, the closer you are to the
meaning of "self".

### We established a long time ago that alligators and humans have most
likely quite different mental lives, didn't we? My dog's sense of self is so
far removed from the complex mental constructs you and I are using in our
discussion, that bringing it in might only breed confusion. The sense of
self and the understanding of "other" are inextricably bound to, and develop
with our personality.

### Both of you are touching on a very important element - in the rational
application of punishment we want to prevent future crime (not merely avenge
past wrongs) by targeting the mental state of the prospective criminal (be
it the guilty party or others considering the same deed). In the absence of
Truth Machine technology we have to rely on past behavior, and any law that
deals with intentions, like Lee said, will not work well.

With a copyhood, the behavior of one copy offers a very good insight into
the intentions and probable behavior of all others, just like a truth
machine will tell everything about the individual. A murderer's copy would
murder, too, under the same or similar circumstances.

Since to prevent future crime you need to target the malicious will, the
readiness to commit crime, and the behavior of one copy is sufficient proof
of such will in the others, it is reasonable to extend punishment to all the
copyhood. Even the erasure of memories of a crime, or not being directly
involved in the planning of the crime is not a sufficient excuse - we *know*
Mr. Dahmer#2 is bad to the bone, after Mr.Dahmer is found gnawing on one.

In the copy-enabled, truth-machine wielding society we will no longer punish
the deed but we will deal with the malicious intent.

This Saturday at the Getty Salon - 4:00 PM (or earlier), we will be
discussing the art of negotiation.  We'll take a look at the strategy 
designed by The Warschaw Group (whose principle recently spoke at the Women
in Technology meeting here in LA) and other means of dealing with
businesses and people to get what we want and close the deal.  The caveat
here being that getting what we want is often based on a win-win scenario,
but learning the "Art of War" (Sun Tzu) is a pretty good idea as well.

Your suggestions is timely for the negotiations topic.  In order to deal

Does anyone know what happened to George Dvorsky?  Some women are in
disarray about his interpretation of transhumanist women and biotechnology.
It would be good to discuss this since folks like Sabine Atkins and Gina
Miller would like to voice an opinion.

_________________

Thank you for sending this message and article.  

Considering what a feminist represents, are transhumanists really
feminists? Just as we have outgrown many discriminatory views, have we
outgrown the need to separate the genders? It seems to me that part and
parcel to being transhumanist is being a human and transhumanist rights
advocate, not any one gender. Just as we want to instill a sense of
compassion and opportunity to all who work toward achieving equality by
encouraging merit.

Perhaps we are beyond feminism.  I may still have the temperament of a
feminist, but I don't affiliate with feminists because, like so many
subcultures, the cause served a different time and a different set of
problems. Over the years, our needs have changed. Our problems become
challenges.  The very profile of a feminist has changed.  Instead of using
the word "feminist," I simply use transhumanist.

Many feminist organizations do not support transhumanist science and
technology, culture or socialization.  Camilla Paglia is espouses views on
this quite fluently.  

However, Wendy McElroy is a well-known female and transhumanist.  Her
organization is "ifeminists."  You can find a number of female
transhumanists there.  I'm so sorry that you did not meet with her because
she has a broad perspective on many issues related to technology and
values. http://www.independent.org/tii/news/020924McElroy.html

Further, some questions came to mind after thinking about your concerns:

How many links do you have to female transhumanists that advocate
transhumanist ideas to the public? 

Does TTA have any links, or quotes from transhumanist females in direct
relation to bioethics? 

Have you spoken to any female transhumanists who have been working in the
area of public interests and bioethics?  

Did you see the film "Precipice" directed and produced by two women in
Stanford University's film department?

In order for us to get more women, that is women who work directly in the
field of bioethics, or in related fields such as new technologies, culture,
economics, science, psychology, etc., - we must first recognize them in our
own environment.  While we all want more women involved in all areas of
transhumanity, not just the ones that seemingly affect women.

BTY, I am speaking on bioethics in a panel featuring female transhumanists
at the Alcor Technology Conference in November.  You might enjoy attending.

That *is* what I mean by an objective view, or bird's eye view,
or God's eye view, whatever.   Do I need to take a lie detector
test before you will believe that I believe that the *objective*
view is absolutely necessary, and that the basic problem IMO
is *subjective* evaluation?

> Your arguments rely heavily on the perceptions of people who

I don't think that my arguments hinge on that at all.  Suppose
that indeed I am presented with my true love, or an old friend.
Do you think that my attitude towards him or her would or should
be any different if I know that he or she is a duplicate?  It
would not.  But since what I think at that time is ipso facto
subjective, that's not what the crucial point is.

The crucial point is that physically the same events are taking
place locally whether or not remote copies exist.  If someone
teleports into my immediate surroundings, what is physically
true about them, or about our relationship doesn't depend on
whether there is a remote copy also produced.  I affirm that
not only would my behavior be the same, but that anyone's
behavior would be the same.  The only coda to this is that
so far as whether person A *survives*, that is a global not
a local condition.  But I feel that I may be missing your
point.  Am I?  Your single sentence above doesn't say much
except to tell me how I am thinking.

Sorry, if I read carefully, then I must have reactions.  I
wrote my reactions as I read (following an initial skim that
wasn't clear).  What was its face value?

> Eugene and I agree on the relevant point that divides us: that

Okay, but do answer this:  Would you agree to teleport where
information is sent and different atoms used?  Do you think
that you would survive such an operation?

> How can non-identical people have the same identity?

Because pattern-identity is not an all or nothing phenomenon.
How many stones must be removed from a heap before it's not
a heap any more?  How many atoms does one have to remove from
the sun before it's not a sun any more?  How many annoying
telephone solicitations does gts need before he's not gts
any more?

If you say "one" to any of those questions, I think that
you're simply wrong---the relation in your skull between
words and things is too brittle.

You ask "How can they have the same identity?".  Exactly
the same way that I will be the same person tomorrow that
I am today, or was last year.  For most people, Gordon,
identity does not change every instant.  For most of us,
it's something that we feel to be the same about us year
after year, although if we are realistic, we realize that
after enough years, one isn't the same person anymore.

> Your answer seems to rely heavily on the fact that *unwitting*
> witnesses will have no reason to be believe anything unusual occurred.

You seem very stuck on this.  I am saying that at the present
time, witnesses are the best *instruments* we have for determining
whether someone's identity has altered.  If we had the entire set
of all paragraphs correctly describing the person, then we'd have
much sharper instruments.  Just as a river changes from day to day,
we regard it, rightly, as the same river.  The wisdom in "you can't
step into the same river twice" ignores more truth than it provides
(even though it does provide some).

As I say, suppose they were.  Suppose they knew that there was
an identical copy in Andromeda.  So what?

Yes.  But if someone talks to me tomorrow in the same excruciating
detail that you are proposing, he'll find differences between Lee
tomorrow and Lee today.  The central point is, there won't be enough
differences to matter.  You yourself appear to vaguely understand
that you are dealing with the same person that you wrestled with
months ago in a different thread.

Exactly the same way that the sheriff does when he arrests
a perpetrator.  Yes, the perpetrator is not *identically*
the same as the organism that committed the crime.  What
is so hard to understand about this?  What are you straining
at?

Lee

Hi gts,

I see another delightful thought experiment here.  I hope
you will forgive me for reading it carefully line by line
and replying.  Normally I like to quickly scan an entire
post first, but in this case, you are entitled to my
reactions as I have them.  Thanks.

Okay, that's fair.  Jack does not have any outside information.

Even with the case of identical twins, who have been separated
from birth, this is no small task.  If the duplicates are only
a few minutes old, Jack is going to have one hell of a time!

Duh!  Sometimes **I** like pizza better than at other times.
There's nothing new in that!  My mood and eating preferences
clearly change during a single meal.  If you think that that's
what makes up a person, [deleted].  My food preferences have
extremely little to do with who I am as it is.  But under the
usual conditions, Gordon, what we mean by "food preferences"
doesn't even change for people, except over months.  That's
because everyone knows that after a meal you'll like some
foods better or worse than before (for a short time), or,
guess what, you might not even feel like eating!  That hardly
makes you a different person!

What makes up a person, gts, is his or her memories, personality
dispositions, beliefs, and so on.  That's why I am the same
person you keeps writing to you in this manner in this thread.

Wrong.  Your concept of "identity" is so rigid that it is 
completely useless.  By your lights, no two articles above
the molecular level have ever been identical in the history
of the universe.

Despite their similarity, the terms "personal identity" and
"identity" as used in physics are not the same thing.  A person's
identity is what distinguishes him from other people of his
tribe or nation.  We also say that one's identity doesn't
change from day to day, but we clearly mean *personal identity*
here.  Likewise we consider that the Mississippi River remains
the same river from day to day.

Or does the word "same" in the preceding paragraph annoy you.
Do you think it best for us to stop speaking of the Mississippi
river as an entity?

Why even concoct such an involved example?  As soon as a fork
occurs, one duplicate will be sitting in a room "over there"
and another "over here".  One will admit "I am here near the
door, not over there", and the other will say "I am here, not
over there near the door".  What we are debating is (1) whether
"Bob" survives if only one duplicate does  (2) whether one
of the Bobs should look forward to waking up the next day
even if "he" is the one that's going to be killed.

(I admit that the latter is much more difficult that the
former, but, so it happens, equally true.)

Depends on what the bias is. You originally said the bias was in
selecting every other flip. This is not a bias, because the odds for
any given flip is 50%. You are selecting which flips to use before you
know any history, and you are selecting flips in an arbitrary manner.

You might disagree with me. I suggest you run a real experiment before
rejecting it.

And a bogus statement it was. If you are not so objective that you
aren't willing to freely and objectively examine issues of race,
gender, as well as tendencies of some individuals to believe in stupid
and obsolete political ideologies, you really don't belong on this list.

Mike,
       I don't think they have a failing of intelligence or objectivity 
necessarily.  Look back at the history of socialism as soon as one group of 
them has a failure the others start relabeling themselves to escape any well 
deserved negative reputation.  Way back in the 19th century the word 
socialism came into poor repute so they relabeled themselves Liberals and 
Progressives.  They call themselves communists, socialist, Trotskyites, 
Maoist and just the past few days on this list we saw them relabeling 
themselves as practically being capitalists.
       As my friend says they take the same old smelly bleep, repackage it in 
sweeter smelling paper and put it right back on the market.
       But if you wish to argue that they are in fact non-objective and not 
too smart I won't argue the point -- I am only commenting on motive.  <G>  
They want to hide who they are and what they are attempting to accomplish.  
IMHO that is why they like to talk in such abstract terms -- if they come 
down to earth we will discover who they are.

Lee Corbin,

The difficulty of determining differences in personality is not at issue. If
necessary Jack could have spent six months or six years on the project.

> Duh!  Sometimes **I** like pizza better than at other times.
> There's nothing new in that!

Absolutely! As I've argued, your personality changes slightly from moment to
moment. Thanks for the example. :)

In this case however we are not considering the changing personality of a
single person through time. We are considering the disparity in
the personalities of two people in the present moment.

I picked the pizza example precisely illustrate the fact that subtle changes
occur constantly. Bob1 himself would probably not be very aware of his
changed attitude about pizza had he not been asked to rate his food
preferences on a sliding scale of 1 to 10. In the same way, all of our
opinions, beliefs and attitudes are in a constant state of flux in response
to our ever-changing experiences, though we are often only barely aware of
these changes until we are asked about them. Small changes accrue and
become large changes, but the distinction between large and small
is completely arbitrary.

The forks in my example -- Bob1 and Bob2 -- are not the same people, Lee. It
matters not iota whether their differences of opinion are trivial or
profound. The same principle holds whether they differ about pizza or about
politics.

> Wrong.  Your concept of "identity" is so rigid that it is
> completely useless.

My concept of identity is useless to you, perhaps, because to accept it
would be to acknowledge the logical flaw in your argument.

Two people who think differently about the same subject at the same time
must be two different people. Why is that so hard to accept?

You can put in your name and it will use Google to find sayings about
